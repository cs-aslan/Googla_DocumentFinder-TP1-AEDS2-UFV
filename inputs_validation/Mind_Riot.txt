I was slipping through the cracks  
Of a stolen jewel  
I was tightrope walking in two ton shoes  
Now somebody is talking about a  
Third world war Ive been caught in a mind riot  
And the police said this is normal control Ive been caught in a mind riot  
  
The candle was burning yesterday  
Like somebodys best friend died  
Ive been caught in a mind riot mind riot  
  
I was crying from my eye teeth and  
Bleeding from my soul  
And I sharpened my wits on a dead mans skull  
I built an elevator from his bones Ive been caught in a mind riot  
Had climb to the top floor to  
To stamp out the coals Ive been caught in a mind riot  
  
The candle was burning yesterday  
Like somebodys best friend died  
Ive been caught in a mind riot  
  
Im tied within  
The candle was burning yesterday  
Like somebodys best friend died  
Ive been caught in a mind riot  
Im tied within  
Im lucks last match struck  
In the pouring down wind  
Pouring down wind  
  
Mind riot mind riot mind riot mind riot
