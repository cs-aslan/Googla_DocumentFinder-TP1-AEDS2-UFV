Show them only  
Flesh you needed  
You want it for you too  
stares stares that follow  
stares stares that follow  
  
They want it for you  
Are you all that  
Youre cracked up to be  
We all want it for you  
Sacrificial  
Made for TV  
laughters coming  
  
And goodbye kisses  
Gave him family  
Pray your dream  
Pray youre dreaming  
  
Are you all that  
Youre cracked up to be  
We all want it for you  
Stares that follow  
Friends to call on  
Dont be desperate  
show them once  
  
Sacrificial  
Made for TV  
Laughters coming  
Goodbye kisses  
pray you stutter  
pray its not old  
Goodbye
