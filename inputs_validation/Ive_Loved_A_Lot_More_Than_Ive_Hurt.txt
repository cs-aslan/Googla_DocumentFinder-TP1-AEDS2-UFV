Well Ive spent more money than Ive made  
And Ive grown more whiskers than Ive shaved  
Ive worked harder getting out of work  
But Ive loved a lot more than Ive hurt  
  
Ive spilled more whiskey than Ive drank  
I drove up more gas than was in my tank  
Ive lost a lot more than my shirt  
But Ive loved a lot more than Ive hurt  
  
Oh I hurt a little now and then  
But when youre broke you learn to bend  
The bottom line for what its worth  
Ive loved a lot more than Ive hurt  
  
Well I walk a lot more than I ride  
And I show a lot more than I hide  
Im sometimes more trouble than Im worth  
But Ive loved a lot more than Ive hurt  
  
Oh I hurt a little now and then  
But when youre broke you learn to bend  
The bottom line for what its worth  
Ive loved a lot more than Ive hurt  
  
Yea the bottom line for what its worth  
Ive loved a lot more than Ive hurt
