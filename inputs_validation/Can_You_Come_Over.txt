Darlin can you come over  
Can you come over  
Meet me tonight  
  
Ive been sitting here alone  
Looking down this telephone  
Thinking things Id really love to say to you  
Oh its true  
I cant get enough of how you love  
Thats the truth I swear to you  
  
Can you come over  
Can you come over  think of what we could do  
If you decide to if youre alive to  
What I want from a guy like you  
  
Darlin can you come over  
Can you come over  meet me tonight  
  
Watching movies on TV  
Never does a thing for me  
I get bored just living here and hanging round  
Toss a coin its heads or tails  
If I run a bath or do my nails  
Whats it really matter when Im far away from you  
  
If you come over  
If you come over  I could be good for you  
Wouldnt you please me  
It could be easy  
Just stay here for a night or two  
  
Darlin can you come over  
Can you come over  meet me tonight  
  
Im the girl who waits for you  
Im the girl who needs you too  
Im the girl who wants you tonight  
  
Darlin can you come over  
Can you come over  
Meet me tonight
