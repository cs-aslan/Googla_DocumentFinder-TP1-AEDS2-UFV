I was just now thinking about  
The jaws of life they chew you up  
Spit you right back into the frying pan  
  
And how life unwinds  
Around and around and up and down  
You think youre fine but then  
Youre back in the frying pan  
Into the frying pan  
  
And how life unwinds  
Around and around and up and down  
You think youre fine but then  
Youre back in the frying pan  
Into the frying pan  
  
And how life unwinds  
You think youre fine but then  
I was just now thinking about  
The jaws of life they chew you up  
Spit you right back into the frying pan  
Frying pan  
The frying pan  
Frying pan  
Frying pan  
Frying pan  
Frying pan
