They call him Lukas  
Climbing the stairs to talk to you  
Comin to tell his story  
Every single one of which is true  
Hello Lukas  
Im please to meet you now how do you do  
  
So they go driving  
Out to the river like lovers do  
You smell out the summer  
Baby the summer just smells of you  
One day Im gonna be a famous writer  
Some book like love in the afternoon  
It was all Lukas could say  
Maybe one day we could run away run away  
  
I thought we never last  
I thought we never last  
  
Now here comes Lukas  
He done everything he wanna do  
It was twenty years later  
Come back to do what he promised to  
He come back to make her happy  
But these things dont always wait for you  
And poor Lukas was late  
Thats when he got back shell be married today  
Gone away  
  
I thought we never last  
I thought we never last  
  
And Lukas would say  
For a million lonely people  
Another long gone  
For a million hearts that opened  
A million break  
And the worlds just a fallen angel in my way  
Im up in heaven you can hear them say  
Lookin for Lukas but Lukas was always runnin away
