My heart had been broken and I couldnt take no more  
I shuttered up my windows and I bolted tight my door  
Then I took one look at you and I nearly lost my mind  
  
Now Im going round going round going round going around one more time  
Yes Im going round going round going round going around one more time  
  
Betty was a little heartbreaker it didnt quite work out  
She did a number on my confidence I was riddled with self doubt  
I said thats it Im through I quit then Juanita she looked so fine  
  
Now Im going round going round going round going around one more time  
Yes Im going round going round going round going around one more time  
  
Round and round in a circle its always the same  
One moment you swear youve had enough the next youve got to know her name  
All on my own it wasnt that bad I was getting by as I could get  
I stopped into a drug store for one pack of cigarettes  
She didnt have a quarter had to call her cousin Kate  
and could I lend her maybe one thin dime  
  
Now Im going round going round going round going around one more time  
Yes Im going round going round going round going around one more time
