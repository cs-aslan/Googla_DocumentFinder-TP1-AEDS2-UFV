If you were mine  
Id never let you leave me  
If you were mine  
Id never let you go  
  
Because you are  
Just what Ive always wanted  
And I think that you oughta know  
  
From the moment I first saw you  
Girl you went straight to my brain  
In my heart Ive got a feeling  
That I could never explain  
  
If you were mine  
Youd never know no sorrow  
If you were mine  
Id marry you tomorrow  
Yes I would  
  
Believe me girl  
What the occasion  
If you call me  
Ill come with no persuasion  
  
You just call  
And Ill come running  
Oh yes I will baby  
Come rain or storm  
Hail or snow  
  
Cause the way I feel about you  
No place is too remote to go  
  
Oh well baby oh well  
Now now now now now  
Oh baby oh well
