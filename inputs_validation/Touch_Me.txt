Yeah  
Come on come on come on come on  
Now touch me baby  
Cant you see that I am not afraid  
What was that promise that you made  
Why wont you tell me what she said  
What was that promise that you made  
  
Now Im gonna love you  
Till the heavens stop the rain  
Im gonna love you  
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I  
Come on come on come on come on  
Now touch me baby  
  
Cant you see that I am not afraid  
What was that promise that you made  
Why wont you tell me what she said  
What was that promise that you made  
  
Im gonna love you  
Till the heavens stop the rain  
Im gonna love you  
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I  
Im gonna love you  
Till the heavens stop the rain  
Im gonna love you  
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I
