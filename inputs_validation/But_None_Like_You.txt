The world is full of people but none like you  
Theyre ordinary people but none like you  
How far away is yesterday before you came along  
It seemed to be just a dream to me until you proved here on  
The lanes are full of lovers but none like you  
  
Just ordinary lovers not dreams like you  
I shut my eyes to realize this grand surprise is true  
That Im the lucky one who found you  
I shut my eyes to realize this grand surprise is true  
That Im the lucky one who found you
