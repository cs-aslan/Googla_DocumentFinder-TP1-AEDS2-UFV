The lonely sea  
The lonely sea  
It never stops  
For you or me  
It moves along  
From day to day  
  
Thats why my love  
Thats why my love  
Youll never stay  
Youll never stay  
  
This pain in my heart  
These tears in my eyes  
Please tell the truth  
Youre like the lonely sea sea  
Sea sea  
The lonely sea sea  
  
Repeat x3  
Lonely sea lonely sea  
Lonely sea lonely sea  
Lonely sea
