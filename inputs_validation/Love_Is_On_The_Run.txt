Just because its raining here  
It doesnt mean the sun isnt shining  
Somewhere else for someone  
You have loved  
But whos not near you anymore  
When your love is on the run  
Dont fall apart at whats begun  
Its just the healing process  
Of your heart  
  
When your dream has lost its cause  
Dont waste your time in closing doors  
Youll be the last to know  
When love has gone  
  
Love is on the run  
Love is on the run  
Love is on the run from me  
  
Love is on the run  
Love is on the run  
Love is on the run from me  
  
Couldnt find the words to say I love you  
Couldnt fight the hurt of holding on  
Couldnt hope  
Couldnt dream  
Couldnt see tomorrow  
Without your love  
I cant go on  
  
Love is on the run  
Love is on the run  
Love is on the run from me  
  
When your love is on the run  
Dont fall apart at whats begun  
Its just the healing process  
Of your heart  
  
When your dream has lost its cause  
Dont waste your time in closing doors  
Youll be the last to know  
When love has gone  
  
Love is on the run  
Love is on the run  
Love is on the run from me
