Verse  
Hey beating yourself up  
Tryna figure up how you wound up out in the cold  
Not only did you lose me but the one that you was  
Cheatin on me also left ya alone no I cant speak for her  
But that be mean you had my mind and was clockin my soul  
But it fell apart cuz you couldnt recall first lie that you told  
  
Chorus  
Listen baby if youre gonna be a liar  
At least try to be good at it  
If youre gonna be a cheater  
Our deal is not to be caught  
Got her on the roots  
Or dont even play the game  
Cuz you got me so high  
Dont know what you doin  
Such an ameture  
  
Verse 2  
Beating myself up  
Tryna figure out how you fooled me as long as you did  
Mad at myself so anxious for love that I wasnt payin attention  
But you got the best of me gave you the best best believe  
Never again said Im way to smart so believe me baby never again  
  
Chorus  
Listen baby if youre gonna be a liar  
At least try to be good at it  
If youre gonna be a cheater  
Our deal is not to be caught  
Got her on the roots  
Or dont even play the game  
Cuz you got me so high  
Dont know what you doin  
Such an ameture  
  
Bridge  
Smokin mills deception  
Pillow saltin tears rejection  
Your hopes and tears connect  
When our heart is treated with no care or discretion  
Ladies what you fear is protection  
From fellas that dont know about affection  
But Id try some love and affection  
Only Mr Smith and Weston  
  
Chorus  
Baby if youre gonna be a liar  
At least try to be good at it  
If youre gonna be a cheater  
Our deal is not to be caught  
Got her on the roots  
Or dont even play the game  
Cuz you got me so high  
Dont know what you doin  
Such an ameture
