Being the first in the Irish Sea  
I got a message I cant read  
Another message I cant read  
  
Im on your side  
Nowhere to hide  
Trapdoors that open  
I spiral down  
  
Youre living in a fantasy  
Youre living in a fantasy  
  
Im lost at sea  
Dont bother me  
Ive lost my way  
Ive lost my way  
  
Youre living in a fantasy  
Youre living in a fantasy  
Youre living in a fantasy  
This beautiful world  
  
Being the first in the Irish Sea  
I got a message I cant read  
Another message I cant read
