She said shed come she didnt  
Im the one in love she isnt  
Theres no girl standing there  
And theres no one who cares  
And the trees are so bare  
On the Boulevard de la Madeleine  
Its a sad day in Paris  
With no girl by my side  
Got to feeling so badly  
Like a part of me died  
It would have been  
So good to see her  
I never thought  
She wouldnt be there  
Theres no girl standing there  
And theres no one who cares  
And the trees are so bare  
On the Boulevard de la Madeleine  
Oh I wish I knew her better  
Its not easy to forget her  
Theres no girl standing there  
And theres no one who cares  
And the trees are so bare  
On the Boulevard de la Madeleine  
Its a sad day in Paris  
With no girl by my side  
Got to feeling so badly  
Like a part of me died  
It would have been  
So good to see her  
I never thought  
She wouldnt be there  
Theres no girl standing there  
And theres no one who cares  
And the trees are so bare  
On the Boulevard de la Madeleine
