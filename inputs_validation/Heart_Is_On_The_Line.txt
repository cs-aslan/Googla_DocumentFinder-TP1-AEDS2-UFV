What do you want from me  
When will you ever see  
I gave it all nothing less  
The feeling aint mutual I guess  
Why am I so confused  
Why do I feel so used  
This game at hand was made for two  
But somehow I played without you  
  
No Im not sad  
Nothin lasts forever  
Head over heels  
Better late than never  
  
Chorus  
My heart is on the line  
Running out of time  
Love stop making a fool out of me  
My heart is on the line  
Running out of time  
Love stop making a fool out of me  
  
Telling my friends youre fine  
Even our favorite wine  
But youre not there and it hurts  
Nobody knows how it hurts  
Maybe I thought I knew  
That I belonged to you  
I dreamed a dream I couldnt have  
I foolishly let myself dance  
Inside your eyes  
Oh dont be sad  
I shouldve known better  
Why didnt I realize  
  
Chorus  
  
Love stop making a fool out of me  
Love stop making a fool out of me  
  
Whenever you call me up  
Everything else must stop  
My heart says stay but I go  
Cause I need you and you know  
Youre inside of me  
I want you now and forever  
Come on back to me  
  
Chorus  
  
My heart is on the line  
Running out of time  
Love stop making a clown out of me  
Love stop making a fool out of me  
Love stop making a clown out of me  
Love stop making a fool out of me
