Baby I never seen nobody like you  
Youre a good friend you know youve been there for me  
From the beginning thats why I love you  
I mean I place no one above you no what Im sayin  
Anything you want you just come to Daddy  
Listen  
  
When I discovered you I discovered a piece within  
A joy like no other you are my closest friend  
Girl if you were a number youd be a perfect 10  
Right out of the blue sky you were heaven sent  
The way we make love over and over again  
If I had to describe it thered be nowhere to begin  
And Im so proud to be your next of kin  
Bring a train over me when I had no reason  
  
Chorus  
Oh plenty caramel coated taffies  
Chocolate covered strawberries  
Love so sweet  
Youre my chocolate factory  
Gumdrops mixed with chocolate milk bars  
Theres so much variety love so sweet  
Youre my chocolate factory  
  
Now if I could write a book on how you made me feel  
The title would read a strong black man and thats for real  
I been going round and round just like a Ferris wheel  
And in and out of relationships with out appeal  
Aint nobody else on Gods green earth for me  
If we turn ourselves together well make the perfect team of dreams  
Change me for the world as long as I exist  
Always in the kitchen cookin up my favorite meal  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre that puzzle piece that completes me girl something so sweet  
Girl youre everything girl youre everything that I need  
Youre my escape when I want to be free when I want to be free  
You full of plenty treats like peppers and sweet tarts big blue red hot  
Baby you are  
  
Chorus x3
