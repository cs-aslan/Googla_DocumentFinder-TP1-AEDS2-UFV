Heard he grew up in Queens  
Got a bullet to the brain  
Dug a step into fame  
But that dont mean a thing  
  
Said hed rather be king  
With an absolute reign  
Till he finds himself a victim of the game  
He was stabbing her back as a matter of fact  
Then his life became serious  
  
Marchin like the soldier  
Marchin like a soldier boy  
Show you the things that make a man a king  
  
Marchin like the soldier  
Marchin like a soldier boy  
Why dont you shine like youre the man again  
  
People say that youre blind  
Then they say that youre fine  
But they wont help you find  
Find the road again  
  
If they wont help you fight  
So they torture your mind  
Then leave you delirious hee hee hee Oh my
