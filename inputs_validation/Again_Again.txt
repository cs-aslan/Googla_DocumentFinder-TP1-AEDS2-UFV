Youve gotta a lotta lotta nerve  
Coming here when Im still with him  
And I cant have you it isnt fair  
Born March of 86 my birthdays coming  
And if I had one wish  
Yeah youd be it  
  
When youre round  
I lose myself inside your mouth  
Youve got brown eyes  
Like no one else  
Baby make it to me  
  
Chorus  
Again and again  
Again again again again  
Never stop again and again  
Again again a a again again  
Never stop oh  
  
He never really saw me  
Or waited when we were hooking up  
Yeah hed a never last  
Last week when I was sad  
You said that you knew  
My eyes change from kinda green  
To kind blue hey yea  
  
When youre round  
I lose myself inside your mouth  
Youve got brown eyes  
Like no one else  
Baby make it to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey tell me if I leave him  
Baby would you be there  
Cause maybe you could  
Be more than that all the time  
Im sad chillin
