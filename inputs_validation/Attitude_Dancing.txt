Theres a new kind of dancing  
Thats going to be the rage  
You just leave yourself behind  
Like an actor on a stage  
Cop a different pose  
From the pose youre in  
Shine a different attitude  
From underneath your skin  
  
Attitude dancing  
Strut around the floor in a new attitude  
Attitude dancing  
Any attitude is the proper attitude  
Attitude dancing  
Dont be afraid to change your attitude  
Attitude dancing  
Free up your spirit with a new attitude  
  
It dont even matter  
If you stretch or shake  
And it dont really matter  
What moves your body makes  
  
And it dont really matter  
What steps you choose to do  
Only one thing matters  
Thats your attitude  
Your attitude attitude dancing  
  
Attitude dancing  
Strut around the floor in a new attitude  
Attitude dancing  
Learn to move in another attitude  
Attitude dancing  
Find the groove in a new attitude  
Attitude dancing  
Dont be afraid of a new attitude  
  
It dont really matter  
What steps you choose to do  
The only thing that matters  
Is your attitude  
  
Your attitude attitude dancing  
Strut around the floor in a new attitude  
Do the locomotion in a new attitude  
Do the mashed potato in a new attitude  
Do the hully gully in a new attitude  
  
Find a role you like  
Capture it and freeze  
Then turn it around  
A hundred and eighty degrees  
Or if youre at a loss  
Observe some natural dude  
And turn into a mirror of his attitude  
  
Attitude attitude attitude  
Dancing
