Chorus  
Every road that Ive been down  
The only truth that I have found  
Theres only one thing I cant live without  
You  
  
I was searching for something I thought I would never find  
Losing my mind  
In and out of bad love I though I was born to lose  
Then came you  
I thought I knew what the real thing was  
But nothing shakes me like your love does  
Ive been hypnotized  
Now I realize  
  
Chorus  
  
Every time I get lost in a temperamental mood  
You still stay cool  
Just when I think this lifes about to drive me insane  
You take the reins  
  
Every time I feel Im drifting off course  
Youre my compass youre my one true north  
In a mixed up world  
You make sense to me world  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah every road baby  
Leads me to you  
And baby thats all I need to know  
  
Chorus  
  
Every road that Ive been down  
The only truth that I have found  
Theres only one thing I cant live without  
You  
  
Every road that Ive been down in my life  
Every time I feel Im taking off  
Every road that Ive been down in my life  
Every road girl leads me to you  
Yes it did yes it did  
Every road girl  
Every road leads me to you
