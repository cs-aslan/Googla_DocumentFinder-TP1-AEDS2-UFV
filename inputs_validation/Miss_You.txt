Lost inside a room  
The priest at the door with news  
Said you were gone now I knew  
Oooh my world was broken in two  
I prayed that you were here  
To hold my heart  
Id hide myself in your bed  
And cry myself numb  
  
Oh god I miss you  
Tell me can you hear me  
Oh god I miss you  
I cant scream and I cant speak  
Show me now  
Will I ever be free from you  
  
Lost inside my head  
I close my eyes and fled  
No pain no gain  
No death no more  
I drown myself in flesh  
Theres no way out  
No way how  
Do you even know me now  
I finally see how amazing  
Can you hear me now  
  
Oh god I miss you  
Tell me can you hear me  
Oh god I miss you  
I cant scream and I cant speak  
Show me how  
Will I ever be free from you  
  
Oh god I miss you  
Tell me can you hear me  
Oh god I miss you  
I cant scream and I cant speak  
Show me now  
Will I ever be free from you  
Oh god I miss you  
  
Why did you go and leave me alone  
And now Im running away from my home  
No theyll never know Im gone  
They dont know how  
Know how  
Can you hear me now  
Oooh can you see somehow  
Oooh heres to new love  
From your great beyond  
Can you hear me now  
  
Oh god I miss you  
Tell me can you hear me  
Oh god I miss you  
I cant scream and I cant speak  
Show me now  
Will I ever be free from you  
  
Oh god I miss you  
Tell me can you hear me  
Oh god I miss you  
I cant scream and I cant speak  
Tell me how  
Will I ever be free from you
