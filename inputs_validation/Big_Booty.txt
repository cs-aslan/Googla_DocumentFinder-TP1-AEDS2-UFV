Big Booty  
  
She said I aint gonna fix you no more sausage  
Biscuits and gravy on the side  
You done said the wrong thing to me baby  
And you can kiss big booty goodbye  
She said I aint gonna fix you no more cases  
Or fix you nothing else thats chicken fried  
Go on and find yourself another woman  
And you can kiss big booty goodbye  
Go on and find yourself a skinny woman  
Something a little more your size  
And dont come back to me a moaning  
When she cuts you off of burgers and fries  
She said I aint gonna fix you no more chicken  
And no more Mommas chocolate pies  
And heres something heave for you baby  
You can kiss big booty goodbye  
play  
Go on and find yourself a skinny woman  
Something a little more your size  
And dont come back to me a moaning  
When she cuts you off of burgers and fries  
She said I aint gonna fix you no more sausage  
Biscuits and gravy on the side  
You done said the wrong thing to me baby  
And you can kiss big booty goodbye  
And you can kiss big booty goodbye  
And you can kiss big booty goodbye
