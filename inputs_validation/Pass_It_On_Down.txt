We live in the land of plenty  
But many things arent plenty anymore  
Like the water from our sink  
They says not safe to drink  
  
You gotta go and buy it at the store  
Now were told theres a hole in the ozone  
Look whats washing on the beach  
And Lord I believe from the heavens to the seas  
Were bringing Mother Nature to her knees  
  
Chorus  
So lets leave some blue up above us  
Lets leave some green on the ground  
Its only ours to borrow lets save some for tomorrow  
Leave it and pass it on down  
  
Well theres a change taking place way on the mountains  
Acid rain is falling on the leaves  
And down in Brazil the fires are burning still  
How we gonna breathe without them trees  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a place where I live called the Canyon  
Where Daddy taught me to swim  
And that water its so pure  
And Im gonna make sure  
Daddys grandkids can swim there like him  
  
Now we all oughta feel just a little bit guilty  
When we look into the eyes of our kids  
Cause brothers its a fact if we take and dont put back  
Theyll have to pay for all we did  
  
Chorus x 4
