There were no angry words at all  
As we carried boxes down the hall  
One by one we put them in your car  
Nothing much for us to say  
One last goodbye and you drove away  
I watched your taillights  
As they faded in the dark  
I couldnt face the night in that lonely bed  
So I laid down on the couch instead  
  
Chorus  
Last night I prayed the Lord my soul to keep  
Then I cried myself to sleep  
So sure life wouldnt go on without you  
But oh this sun is blinding me  
As it wakes me from the dark  
I guess the world didnt stop  
For my broken heart  
  
Clocks still tickin life goes on  
Radio still plays a song  
As I try to put my scattered thoughts in place  
And it takes all the strength Ive got  
To stumble to the coffee pot  
The first of many lonely mornings Ive got to face  
You call to see if Im ok  
Look out the window and I just say  
  
Chorus  
  
I guess the world aint gonna stop  
For my broken heart
