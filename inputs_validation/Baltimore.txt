Beatup little seagull  
On a marble stair  
Tryin to find the ocean  
Lookin everywhere  
  
Hard times in the city  
In a hard town by the sea  
Aint nowhere to run to  
There aint nothin here for free  
  
Hooker on the corner  
Waitin for a train  
Drunk lyin on the sidewalk  
Sleepin in the rain  
  
And they hide their faces  
And they hide their eyes  
Cause the citys dyin  
And they dont know why  
  
Oh Baltimore  
Man its hard just to live  
Oh Baltimore  
Man its hard just to live just to live  
  
Get my sister Sandy  
And my little brother Ray  
Buy a big old wagon  
Gonna haul us all away  
  
Livin in the country  
Where the mountains high  
Never comin back here  
Til the day I die  
  
Oh Baltimore  
Man its hard just to live  
Oh Baltimore  
Man its hard just to live just to live
