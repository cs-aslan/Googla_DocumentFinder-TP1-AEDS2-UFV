Michael mcdonald  
  
Sure as that old whistles blowin  
Theres a tug upon my heart  
Somewhere in that misty mornin light  
Theres another brand new start  
Sometimes Id love to see this end  
And watch it fall apart  
cause its still such a long road  
And were a long way from the start  
You know anyone can say whats wrong  
That dont make it right to me  
We werent born into this life  
To walk away from everything  
Once you get the blues in your stride  
All you needs a song to survive  
You think by now we would know that  
Were gonna keep this train arollin  
We aint gonna break down on this highway  
We could sit here waitin worried wonderin  
Wishin we were somewhere other than right her  
But were right here
