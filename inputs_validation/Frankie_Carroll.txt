Frankie Carroll  
He got drunk last night  
I tried my best to help him  
But he wound up in a fight  
  
And his Missy got him  
She said  
Frankie its alright  
Frankie wont do you wrong  
  
Frankie Carroll  
He beat his kids last night  
I dont like you kids shouting  
Shut up now dont care whos wrong or right  
  
And his Missy got him  
She said  
Frankie Ill keep the kids quiet  
Frankie Frankie whats wrong  
  
Frankie Carroll  
He fell to bed last night  
And his head hung off the pillow  
And his eyes were closed shut tight  
  
And his Missy  
She got up and turned out the light  
Frankie Frankie whats wrong  
Frankie Carroll was with a woman last night
