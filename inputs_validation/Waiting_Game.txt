You and me  
A little different  
Though we tried to stay the same  
It never leaves  
And when it changes it is still a waiting game  
  
I wait for a lonely breath  
I wait to surface from this death  
Wait for the light to come  
And take away these images I get  
In my head  
  
Chorus  
More than ever  
I need to feel you  
More than ever  
I see the real you  
  
You are me  
A worst disaster would be waking up alone  
Now were free  
Were drifting out  
Like all the ones we didnt know  
I wait for a silent tear  
I wait for things to disappear  
Wait for the ground to stop moving underneath my only fear  
If I lose you I dont know  
  
More than ever  
I need to feel you  
Its all around  
More than ever  
I see the real you  
And its around  
  
Everything everything  
Weve had  
Out of sight out of mind  
Given that  
What I see when I dream  
Hurts like hell and back  
  
Everything everything  
Weve had  
Out of sight out of mind  
Given that  
What I see when I dream  
Hurts like hell and back  
  
Chorus
