Little catholic girl is fallin in love  
A face on a page a gift from above  
She shouldve known better than to give her heart  
She shouldve known better than to ever part without me without me  
I gave her everything that I ever owned  
I think she understood it but she never spoke  
She shouldnt oughta try to be that way  
She shouldnt have to go there every day without me without me  
  
Now listen to us good and listen well  
Listen to us all and everything we tell  
We shouldve known better than to give her away  
We shouldve known better to this very day without me without me  
Listen Joan of Arc all you gotta do  
Say the right words and Ill be coming through  
Hold you in my arms and take you right away  
Now shes turned away to another land  
We never understood it why she gave her hand  
She shouldnt oughta promise cause its just pretend  
I know she doesnt mean it and shell leave again without me without me  
Without me without me
