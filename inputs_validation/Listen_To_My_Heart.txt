Next time Ill listen to my heart  
Next time well Ill be smart  
Next time Ill listen to my heart  
Next time well Ill be smart  
Next time Ill listen to my heart  
Next time well Ill be smart  
Next time Ill listen to my heart  
Next time well Ill be smart  
That girl could still be mine  
But Im tired of the hurt  
Tired of tryin  
Im tired of the pain  
Tired of tryin  
Im tired of cryin
