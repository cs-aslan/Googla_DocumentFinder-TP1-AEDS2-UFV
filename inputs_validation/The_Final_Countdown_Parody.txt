Were sleeping together  
But still its not enough  
And maybe youll come on my back  
To fuck who can tell  
I guess there is no one to blame  
We have only one left only one left  
Will things ever be the same again  
  
Hook  
Its the final condom  
The final condom  
Ohh  
  
Verse 2  
Were heading for Uranus Uranus  
And still we stand tall  
Cause maybe theyve seen us  
And welcome us all yeah  
With so many strokes to go  
And blowjobs to be done to be done  
Im sure that well all miss it so  
  
Hook  
Its the final condom  
The final condom  
The final condom  
Final condom Ohhh oh oh ohhh  
The final condom  
Ohhh  
Its the final condom  
The final condom  
  
The final condom  
Final condom  
Ohhh Its the final condom  
We enjoy it togetherrr  
The final condom  
Well all miss it so  
Its the final condom Final condom  
Ohhh Its the final condom
