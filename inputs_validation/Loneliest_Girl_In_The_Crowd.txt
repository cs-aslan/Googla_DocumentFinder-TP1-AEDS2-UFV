Shes got to be the loneliest girl in the crowd  
How can she look so sad when the music is playing so loud  
Maybe shes waitin on someone wholl make her feel proud  
Shes got to be the loneliest girl in the crowd  
I took a chance and I asked her to dance but she put me down  
While I was a lookin for a big ole smile I found a big ole frown  
So loving looking so calm and shes so well endowed  
Shes got to be the loneliest girl in the crowd  
Somebody hurt her I dont understand its so wrong  
Why is she here shes mixing her tears with my happy song  
She looks like an angel who just came down out of the clouds  
But shes got to be the loneliest girl in the crowd  
I took a chance and I asked her to dance but she put me down  
While I was a lookin for a big ole smile I found a big ole frown  
So loving looking so calm and shes so well endowed  
Shes got to be the loneliest girl in the crowd  
Shes got to be the loneliest girl in the crowd
