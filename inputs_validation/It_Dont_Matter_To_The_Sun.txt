It dont matter to the sun  
If you go or if you stay  
I know the sun is gonna rise  
Shine down on another day  
There will still be a tomorrow  
Even if you choose to leave  
Cause it dont matter to the sun oh baby  
It matters to me  
  
It aint gonna stop the world  
If you walk out that door  
This old world will just keep on turning round Turning round  
Like it did the day before  
Cause see to them it makes no difference ohh  
It just keeps on keepin time  
Cause it aint gonna stop the world Oh baby  
But itll be the end of mine  
  
What can I say  
What can I do  
Im still in love  
So without you  
  
GuitarPiano solo  
Mmm mmm mmm oh yeah oh yeah  
What can I say  
What can I do  
Im still in love  
So without you  
  
It dont matter the moon  
If your not in my life  
No the moon will just keep hangin round hangin round  
Like its just another night  
Find another place to shine on down  
On some other lovers dreams  
Cause it dont matter the moon oh baby  
But is sure do matter to me  
No it dont matter to the moon oh baby  
But it matters to me
