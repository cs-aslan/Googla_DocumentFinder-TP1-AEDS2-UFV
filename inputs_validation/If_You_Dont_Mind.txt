Wheres the light  
Killed my day  
Lost in the dark of your ways  
Wasting my energy endlessly  
On your sweet lie  
  
And if you dont mind  
I would like to live the lie that I will survive  
And if you dont mind  
I would love to slip away and leave your world behind  
  
Feel secure Im not so sure  
Youre not just faking something  
Wasting our last day  
I cant take the pain  
  
And if you dont mind  
I would like to live the lie that I will survive  
And if you dont mind  
I would love to slip away and leave it all behind  
  
And if you dont mind  
I would like to live the lie that I will survive  
And if you dont mind  
If you dont mind
