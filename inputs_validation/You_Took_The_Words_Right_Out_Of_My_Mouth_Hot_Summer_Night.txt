On a hot summer night  
Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses  
Will he offer me his mouth  
  
Yes  
  
Will he offer me his teeth  
  
Yes  
  
Will he offer me his jaws  
  
Yes  
  
Will he offer me his hunger  
  
Yes  
  
Again will he offer me his hunger  
  
Yes  
  
And will he starve without me  
  
Yes  
  
And does he love me  
  
Yes  
  
Yes  
  
On a hot summer night  
Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses  
  
Yes  
  
I bet you to say that to all the boys  
  
It was a hot summer night and the beach was burning  
There was fog crawling over the sand  
And when I listened to your heart I hear the whole world turning  
I see the shooting stars falling through your trembling hands  
  
While you were licking your lips and your lipstick shining  
And I was dying just to ask for a taste  
Oh we were lying together in a silver lining  
By the light of the moon you know theres not another moment  
Not another moment  
Not another moment to waste  
  
Oh will you hold me so close that my knees grow weak  
But my soul is flying high above the ground  
Im trying to speak but no matter what I do  
I just cant seem to make any sound  
  
And then you took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh and I swear its true I was just about to say I love you  
  
Love you  
  
And then you took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh and I swear its true I was just about to say I love you  
  
Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water  
And I guess that Im beginning to grin  
Oh were finally alone and we can do what we want  
Oh the night is young and aint noone gonna know where you  
Noone gonna know where you  
Noones gonna know where youve been  
You were licking your lips and your lipstick shining  
I was dying just to ask for a taste  
We were lying together in a silver lining  
By the the light of the moon  
You know theres not another moment to waste  
  
And then you took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh and I swear its true I was just about to say I love you  
  
Love you  
  
And then you took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh and I swear its true I was just about to say I love you  
  
Love you  
  
And then you took the words right out of my mouth oh  
It must have been while you were kissing  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth oh  
It must have been while you were kissing  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth oh  
It must have been while you were kissing  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth oh  
It must have been while you were kissing  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth oh  
It must have been while you were kissing  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth oh  
You took the words right out of my mouth oh  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Whoa it must have been while you were kissing me  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me  
  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me
