He said get out of here nobody wants you here  
You smashed his head and the man died  
And theres a murmur loud  
From the appearing crowd  
Searching for motives and reasons why  
  
Now take a look at yourself and youll see  
What you are in the eyes of the world  
You didnt want it but now hes dead  
And youre on the run from the law  
  
Youre a murderer in every town  
Murderer to the whole world  
Murderer youre on the run  
Murderer youll have to kill again  
  
And like an animal which escaped from the cage  
Theyre hunting you over their holy land  
Traps waiting everywhere you fall in deep despair  
Darkness and night your only friends  
  
One day the chase will be over for you  
And youll find your own peace in the end  
Some day you will find sanctuary  
DeathBut so long my friend  
  
Youre a murderer in every town  
Murderer to the whole world  
Murderer youre on the run  
Murderer youll have to kill again  
  
Youre a murderer in every town  
Murderer to the whole world  
Murderer youre on the run  
Murderer youll have to kill again  
  
Look for a safe place where no one will find you  
And try to escape from the law  
Wherever you are theres a killer behind you  
Wanting to get you for sure  
To lose the fear that one day he will get you  
Be faster and kill him and run  
Now you dont have to fear him no more  
But in his place another headhunter will come  
Run away
