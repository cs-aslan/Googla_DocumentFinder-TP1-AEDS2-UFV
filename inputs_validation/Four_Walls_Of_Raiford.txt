Well them four walls of Raiford closing in on me  
Doin three to five hard labor for armed robbery  
I had two years behind me but I could not wait the time  
Everytime I thought about it well I died some more inside  
  
And I had stripes on my back memories that hurt  
For the only time I seen sunshine is when I hit the dirt  
Diggin ditches for the chain gang sleepin in the cold  
Oh Lord please forgive me for I could not wait no more  
  
Chorus  
And Im comin home to see you Jesus  
Well it feels so close this time  
Please take mercy on this soldier  
From the FloridaGeorgia line  
  
When they find me they must kill me  
Oh Jesus save my soul  
I cant go back down to Raiford  
I cant take that anymore  
  
Well these last few years behind me  
Oh Lord have been so sad  
I fought proudly for my country when the times were bad  
Now they say Im guilty when they find me I must die  
Only me and Jesus know that I never stole a dime  
  
Chorus  
  
Well when Vietnam was over there was no work here for me  
I had a pretty wife awaitin and two kids I had to feed  
Well Im one of Americas heroes and when they shoot me down  
Wont you fly old Glory proudly put my medals in the ground  
  
And Im comin home to see you Jesus  
Well it feels so close this time  
Please take mercy on this soldier  
From the FloridaGeorgia line  
  
When they find me they must kill me  
Oh Jesus save my soul  
I cant go back down to Raiford  
I cant take that anymore
