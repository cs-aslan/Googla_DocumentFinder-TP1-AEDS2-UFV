I want to tell bout my lover  
And I want to tell you bout my best friend  
Compared to all the others  
Hes a little bit different  
A friend saw him on the town  
Said he was turnin all the pretty girls down  
She said You really should be proud of him  
  
Chorus  
Isnt he a strange one  
He thinks comin on to me is a whole lot of fun  
He doesnt want anybody else but me  
Isnt he a strange one  
He thinks I hung the moon  
Hes pretty sure I was the one  
And Im glad hell never be  
  
A stranger to me  
I know hes one in a million  
When he says Im the one that hes dreamin of  
I hope he doesnt wake up anytime soon  
From this honeymoon  
My girlfriends are turnin green with envy  
They want to know are there anymore at home like him  
Cupid must be really watchin over me  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah I m glad hell never be  
A stranger to me  
Isnt he a strange one  
Isnt he a strange one
