When I was a little baby boy  
Just to sit and play would be my joy  
Now Im oh so big and Im oh so strong  
How I wish to be where I once belonged  
  
When I was an older baby boy  
All the girls I wanted were my joy  
I would drink my wine wouldnt miss a night  
How I wish that someone had put me right  
When I was an older boy  
When I was an older boy  
When I was an older boy  
  
When I was an older ladys toy  
Thoughts of lust and wealth were now my joy  
And the years gone by are so far behind  
But the memories are still in my mind  
When I was a ladys boy  
When I was a ladys boy  
When I was a ladys boy  
  
When I was a little baby boy  
Just to sit and play would be my joy  
Now Im oh so big and Im oh so strong  
How I wish to be where I once belonged  
When I was a baby boy  
When I was a baby boy  
When I was a baby boy
