Dont live a lie  
This is your one life  
Dont live a lie  
You wont get lost  
Just walk just walk  
  
Heres for the ones tryna hold you back  
Tryna make you feel like your less than that  
Give you nothin more better than to make you crack  
But really tryna put your dreams off track  
And youll know in the end itll be okay  
Cause all that really matters are the steps you take  
And everything else falls into place  
Theres no price to pay I say  
  
Were alright alright yea yea  
Were gonna get it when we live it live it  
Were alright alright yea yea  
Were gonna get it when we live it

Dont be afraid to make a move

Just do what you were born to do  
And everything works that way
