Way back in the mountains  
Way back in the hills  
There used to live a mountaineer  
They called him Fiddlin Will  
He could play most anything  
And some say he could sing  
But the one thing that he liked to do best  
Was sawing on the strings  
  
So get out the fiddle  
And rosin up the bow  
Look at ol Will apattin his toe  
Well make music till the rafters ring  
All that pickin and a sawin on the string  
  
When the neighbors had a shindig  
And they all had vittles to eat  
Wed always have to wait on Will  
To make the frolic complete  
When he comes down from the mountain  
All the gals began to sway  
Sometimes hed pick that ol fivestring  
Until the break of day  
  
So tune up the fivestring  
Tighten up the hide  
Tell all the hill folks to get inside  
All them pickin and asawing on the string  
  
So tune up the fivestring  
Tighten up the hide  
Tell all the hill folks to get inside  
All them pickin and asawing on the string
