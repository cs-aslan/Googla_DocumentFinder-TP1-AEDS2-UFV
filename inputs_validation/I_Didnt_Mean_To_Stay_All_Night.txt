My love is drifting in a sweet dream  
And my heart is beatin like a drum  
And my words dont make a sound  
And Im dancin but my feet aint on the ground  
  
I am flyin forever within your arms  
Im flyin forever within your heart  
I am flyin  
I didnt mean to stay all night oh no  
But baby you hold so tight  
I didnt mean to turn you loose oh no  
But baby you wont refuse  
I didnt mean to turn you on oh no  
Its heaven it cant be wrong  
I didnt mean to stay all night  
  
My thoughts are runnin in a race  
And my mind is slippin into space  
Cause your world is all around  
So Im dancing but my feet aint on the ground  
  
I am flyin forever within your arms  
Im flyin forever within your heart  
I am flyin  
I didnt mean to stay all night oh no  
But baby you hold so tight  
I didnt mean to turn you loose oh no  
But baby you wont refuse  
I didnt mean to turn you on oh no  
Its heaven it cant be wrong  
  
I am flyin forever within your arms  
Im flyin forever within your heart  
  
I didnt mean  
I didnt mean to make you stay  
But baby you got your way  
I didnt mean  
I didnt mean to fool around  
But baby you held me down  
  
I didnt mean to stay all night  
I didnt mean  
I didnt mean to make you stay oh no  
I didnt mean to let you get your way  
I didnt mean  
I didnt mean to fool around oh no  
I didnt mean to let you hold me down  
I didnt mean to turn you on baby oh no  
To make you fall in love  
I didnt mean  
I didnt mean to turn you loose honey oh no  
But you just cant refuse  
And I didnt mean  
I didnt mean to stay all night oh no  
But you wont let go  
I didnt mean  
I didnt mean to make you stay oh no  
I didnt mean to let you get your way  
I didnt mean  
I didnt mean to fool around oh no
