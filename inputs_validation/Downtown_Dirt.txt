Down at the arcade the defender is there  
Down off of Broadway hes there playing his games  
Its very dangerous putting money down on Robotron  
Oh Im the Great Defender  
And I really know just how to get along  
Down at the arcade  
Oh Im the Great Defender  
And I really think Ive got it made  
A fistful of quarters a fifty dollar stake  
Life is a gamble on Videotape  
I called a disc jockey to dedicate a song to Blair  
Its the Four Tops singing ill be there  
Down at the arcade  
The president called to give me the news  
Ive been awarded the Nobel Price in rhythm and blues  
And Stevie Wonder wants to record one of my songs  
Oh Im the Great Defender  
And I really know just how to get along  
Oh Im the Great Defender listen to my song  
I really hope you like it it isnt very long  
Its rooted in the fifties but its hearts in 1984  
And if you really like it  
Then I sing it for you once more  
Down at the arcade
