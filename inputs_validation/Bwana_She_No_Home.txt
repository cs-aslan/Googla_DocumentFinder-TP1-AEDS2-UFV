Dont you ever invite your boyfriend here  
  
I like to be here alone  
  
You just answer the door and feed the deer  
  
And fight the telephone  
  
Got to learn these words and I know you will  
  
Or Ill send you right back to Guayaquil  
  
Say bwana she no home say bwana she no home  
  
Say bwana she no home say bwana she no home  
  
  
  
Got to peel your eyes for the heat my dear  
  
You got to froth and foam  
  
Got to send away the mad puppeteer  
  
Who seems to think this is home  
  
I want you to speak the English right  
  
I want you to smile and be polite  
  
Say bwana she no home say bwana she no home  
  
Say bwana she no home say bwana she no home  
  
  
  
I dont care if you drive my 350 honey  
  
Dont letem steal my chrome  
  
I dont care if you spend all my money honey  
  
Long as you leave me alone  
  
I just want you to try and remember one thing  
  
If somebody knocks or the telephone rings  
  
Say bwana she no home say bwana she no home  
  
Say bwana she no home say bwana she no home
