Look a little on the sunny side  
Even when they say youre on the slide  
And for a while theyll say your records never make it  
But in a while theyre gonna be showering you with praises  
Theyll give you mediocre reviews  
And put you in the underground for a while  
But look a little on the funny sunny side of life  
Look a little on the sunny side  
You sing em the blues  
And then they ask for a happy tune  
And when you start to smile theyll say gimme dat rhythm and blues  
And when you give em dat rhythm and blues theyll simply smile and say  
We didnt want to hear you play  
We didnt like you any way  
Its very hard to please the people every single time  
But look a little on the sunny side  
Look a little on the sunny side  
Even when you feel you want to hide  
You gotta laugh dont let your critics ever upset you  
Cause for a while the cynics will all be out to get you  
You gotta be shrewd you gotta be strong  
Youve gotta convince yourself that you are not wrong  
Whistle a tune and think of a catchy happy little song  
And look a little on the sunny side  
Its very hard to please the people every single time  
But look a little on the sunny side  
Theyre gonna put you down for a while  
Youve got to learn to grit your teeth and smile  
And look a little on the funny sunny side of life  
Look a little on the sunny side
