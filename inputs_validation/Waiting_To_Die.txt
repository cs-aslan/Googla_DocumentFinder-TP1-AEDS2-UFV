Its just a day like any other day  
A beautiful day for an accident lets say  
Yes its just a day like any other day  
Just one step closer to the end of the buffet  
La la la la la la  
La la la la cause were waiting to die  
  
Now its a good time for a tasty glass of wine  
Lets not burden our minds with carbon dioxide  
And everyone hurry dont sit and abide  
Yes everyone stand up were running out of time  
La la la la la la  
La la la la cause were waiting here to die  
  
Look what a terrible mess that weve made  
The sun beats us down as we search for the shade  
And yes it is true death is everyones fate  
But weve made it this far its time to celebrate  
La la la la la  
La la la la cause were waiting here to die  
La la la la la  
La la la la cause were waiting here to die
