Here he comes lookin for his baby  
Its for sure sure and not for maybe  
Dont ask when will the lucky day be  
Here he comes and let him tell you himself  
  
If I seem to scintillate  
Its because Ive got a date  
A date with a package of  
The good things that come with love  
You dont have to ask me  
I wont waste your time  
But if you should ask me  
Why I feel sublime  
Im  
  
Steppin out with my baby  
Cant go wrong cause Im in right  
Its for sure not for maybe  
That Im all dressed up tonight  
  
Steppin out with my honey  
Cant be bad to feel so good  
Never felt quite so sunny  
And I keep on knockin wood  
  
Therell be smooth sailin cause Im trimmin my sails  
With a bright shine on my shoes and on my nails  
alternate line In my top hat and my white tie and my tails  
  
Steppin out with my baby  
Cant go wrong cause Im in right  
Ask me when will the day be  
The big day may be tonight
