Youve been taking your time  
And youve been living on solid air  
Youve been walking the line  
And youve been living on solid air  
Dont know whats going round inside  
And I can tell you that its hard to hide  
When youre living on solid air  
And youve been painting the blues  
And youve been looking through solid air  
Youve been seeing it through  
And youve been looking through solid air  
Dont know whats going round in your mind  
And I can tell you dont like what you find  
When youre moving through solid air solid air  
I know you I love you  
And I can be your friend  
I can follow you anywhere  
Even through solid air  
Youve been stoning it cold  
Youve been living on solid air  
Youve been finding it cold  
Youve been living on solid air  
I dont know whats going on inside  
I can tell you that its hard to hide  
When youre living on solid air solid air  
Youve been getting too deep  
Youve been living on solid air  
Youve been missing your sleep  
And youve been moving through solid air  
I dont know whats going on in your mind  
But I know you dont like what you find  
When youre moving through solid air solid air  
I know you I love you

Dont know whats going on inside  
But I can tell you that its hard to hide  
When youre living on solid air solid air  
Youve been painting the blues
