I hope you notice how I feel  
Girl I aint running gain  
But theres a couple things I like I try to explain  
You say you wanna wait a while  
  
Girl I aint mad at you In fact I like your style  
Cause its more than just a physical attraction that Im feeling  
Its real ooooh and maybe heres the deal  
Ill be right here  
  
And the sun and the moon and the stars  
They all refuse to shine  
Ill be right here  
I wanna be the thought that you think whatever is on your mind  
Ill be right here  
Girl I wanna be a part of you just like the air you breathe  
And you can count on me  
  
You dont have to be afraid to say whats on your mind  
Your body language tellin me lets take our time  
You say you wanna play the wild
