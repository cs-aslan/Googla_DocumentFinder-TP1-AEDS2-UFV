Well Ive been waiting waiting here so long  
But thinking nothing nothing could go wrong but now I know  
She has a built in ability  
To take everything she sees  
And now it seems Im falling falling for her  
  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
She reaches in grabs right hold of your heart  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
It takes control and slowly tears you apart  
  
I dont really know her I only know her name  
But she crawls under your skin youre never quite the same and now I know  
Shes got something you just cant trust  
Its something mysterious  
And now it seems Im falling falling for her  
  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
She reaches in grabs right hold of your heart  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
It takes control and slowly tears you apart  
  
She dont like losing to her its still a game  
Though shell mess up your life youll want her just the same now I know  
She has a built in ability  
To take everything she sees  
And now it seems Ive fallen fallen for her  
  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
She reaches in grabs right hold of your heart  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
It takes control and slowly tears you apart
