Yes I do I love you  
I swear on the stars above I do  
I swear on the streetlight on the corner  
Shoving back the shadows  
One shadow cursing  
Another shadow laughing  
Underneath the streetlight  
I dont know where theyre coming from  
I just see em passing  
Underneath the streetlight  
  
Yes I do I love you  
I swear on the buildings above I do  
I swear on a billion yellow and TV blue windows  
Gayboys with their pants so tight  
Out in the neon light  
Underneath the street light  
A m m madmanmadman  
Kicking over garbage cans  
Underneath the streetlight  
  
Yes I do I love you  
I swear on the blinkin planes above I do  
I swear on the truck at the stoplight  
With his airbrakes moaning  
All night the trucks roll  
Up to the tunneltoll  
Underneath the streetlight  
They come rollin rollin  
Rollin for a living  
Underneath the streetlight  
  
Yes I do I love you  
I swear on the disco sparkle dark I do  
I swear on the bebop boys  
Chasing the black bird  
Rock n roll broadcast  
Movin up now full blast  
Underneath the streetlight  
They come dancin dancin  
Really rock n rollin  
Underneath the streetlight  
Yes I do I love you  
I really love you  
Yes I do yes I do  
I love you
