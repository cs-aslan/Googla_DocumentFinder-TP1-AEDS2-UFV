For awhile I can sing  
All the world and everything  
Is touching you  
Knowing you are real  
A miracle beside me  
For awhile I can breathe  
Life is you and I can  
Cling to fantasies  
Seeing me with you  
Keeps my soul alive now  
Tomorrow if I die  
At least Ill know why I live  
Youre mine  
If only for awhile  
For awhile for awhile  
You hold my world and you can spin it  
For awhile for awhile  
Life is good because youre in it  
Tomorrow if I die  
At least Ill know why I live  
Youre mine you are mine  
If only for awhile
