This time hes gonna wear an iron suit  
This time shes gonna fix her heart and make it bullet proof  
He says hes gonna take a bite from the forbidden fruit  
She says never never bite more than you can chew  
But this time hes not gonna be another couldve been  
This time shes gonna get real love the skin shes in  
She says a winner never quits quitters never win  
She said this time that she is built to face anything  
This time hes gonna step for who he is  
This time shes gonna live to work shes not working to live  
He says just because you say its true it dont mean it is  
She says it seems too good to be true well then it probably is  
This time hes hell bent yeah hes heaven bound  
This time shes gonna pick herself up no more breaking down  
He says hes gonna turn the wheel turn this shit around  
She says if hes looking for love then she dont want to be found  
  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
Its so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
Its all Ive got  
Yeah when you hit the ground  
Its hard to get to heaven when your falling hell bound  
  
This time hes gonna make it to the aftermath  
This time shes gonna raise her head choose the righteous path  
He said one day we will look back and it will make us laugh  
She said better to have and not need than to need and not have  
No matter what the cause its better to have loved and lost  
Have you ever met a man who never loved at all  
Yeah the higher they are the bigger they fall  
You have to choose something cuz you cant have it all  
No hes not gonna be the last to the finish line  
She said even losers get lucky sometimes  
He says its gonna get better like a fine wine  
She says its harder to smell the roses when the sun dont shine  
This time hes gonna find another way  
This time shes gonna take you to the good oldays with no gracing  
Only warm embraces with the two little sweet angels with dirty faces  
  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
Its so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
Its all Ive got  
Yeah when you hit the ground  
Its hard to get to heaven when your falling hell bound  
  
Every break every burn every toss every turn every sin  
Anything youve learned its all programmed all programmed  
Every break every burn every toss every turn every sin  
Everything weve learned its all programmed all programmed  
  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
Its so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
Its all Ive got  
Yeah when you hit the ground
