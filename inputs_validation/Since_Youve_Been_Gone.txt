Since youve been gone  
Well I feel like Ive been chewing on tinfoil  
Since youve been gone  
Its like I got a great big mouthful of cod liver oil  
Oh well Im feelin like I stuck my hand  
Inside a blender and turned it on  
You know Ive been in a butt load of pain  
Since youve been gone  
Since youve been gone  
I couldnt feel any worse if you dropped  
A twoton bowling ball on my toes  
Since youve been gone  
It couldnt hurt anymore if you shoved  
A redhot cactus up my nose  
  
Since youve been gone  
Well it feels like Im getting tetanus shots every day  
Since youve been gone  
Its like Ive got an ice cream headache that wont go away  
Ever since the day you left me  
Ive been so miserable my dear  
I feel almost as bad as I did  
When you were still here
