chorus  
Oh damn  
The club bout to close in a minute  
Can I get your number baby  
So you and I can go get in it  
Let me come and pick you up oh  
And go take you out oh  
Can I get your number baby  
So I can show you what Im all about  
What Im all about damn  
  
Ive been checkin you out  
And I noticed that you aint just one of the crowd  
So tell me wont you  
Come on and see about me baby  
Ive got the Cris on ice and Im bout to get nice  
Up in VIP with all my ladies  
Tell me how many times in your life  
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight  
Tell me a little somethin about you  
Heres a little somethin about me  
I got a house in Capri and my own G4  
And that Benz with the doors that lift up from the floor  
  
Chorus  
  
Now that youre sitting next to me  
I bet youre wondering  
What my intentions are for you  
And I to get into  
Baby I just want to  
Hug and kiss and love ya  
Look into my eyes baby dont be shy  
Is it yes or no  
We aint got all night  
Tell me how many times in your life  
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight  
Tell me a little somethin bout you  
Heres a little somethin bout me  
I got a pimp penthouse with a sick hot tub  
We can watch the flat screen  
While the bubbles fill it up  
  
Chorus  
  
La la la la la la
