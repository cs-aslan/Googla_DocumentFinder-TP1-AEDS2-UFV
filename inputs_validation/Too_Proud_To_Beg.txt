Love came to me that day  
Stayed longer than I planned  
But change is good they say  
So I rearranged my world for them  
For her and love and here I go again  
I spoke to my heart  
Said Open up wide  
Then got the message you had changed your mind  
And now here I am and I just dont understand  
Baby if you talk to me then I will listen  
There cant be no us honey if you are missin  
Yes I love you yes I need you  
aint no world for me without you  
I want you Im just too proud to beg  
So sad the journey made  
So high the price we have to pay  
All for love  
And it hurts you anyway  
I cant lose my soul to hope and wishing  
You dont understand me I know that you think  
I dont love you I dont need you  
But my intentions are to love you  
See I want you Im just too proud  
To beg for your love  
So dont put me through it  
Take a little time to think about what youre doing  
And try to understand why  
Yes I love you yes I need you  
aint no world for me without you  
I want you Im just too proud to beg  
So sad the journey made  
So high the price we have to pay  
All for love  
And it hurts you anyway
