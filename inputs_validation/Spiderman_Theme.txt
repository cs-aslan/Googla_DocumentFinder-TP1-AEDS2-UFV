Spiderman spiderman  
Does whatever a spider can  
Spins a web any size  
Catches thieves just like flies  
  
Look out here comes the spiderman  
  
Is he strong listen bud  
Hes got radioactive blood  
Can he swing from a thread  
No escape from his spiderweb  
  
Look out there goes the spiderman  
  
When chill meets the night  
at the scream of a crime  
Like a stream of light  
He arrives just in time  
Look out life is a great big bangup  
Wherever there is a hangup  
Youll find the spiderman
