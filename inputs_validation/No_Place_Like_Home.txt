Im faced with the facts  
And a fist full of threats  
I stand quite amused  
At the end of the bed  
I have no defense  
For what I have said  
As a handful of love  
Whacks me right round the head  
Shes growling and stalking  
And grabs from a pile  
A book that she throws  
And it missed by a mile  
Im holding a pillow  
And as naked as sin  
Im backed to a corner  
With a wastepaper bin  
Then up on the mattress  
Theres no place to go  
Im guilty yes guilty  
But theres no place like home  
  
I rewind the hours  
To see what went wrong  
I plead for forgiveness  
And Im hit like a gong  
It seems that Im guilty  
Of smiling too long  
When recalling lovers  
That now are long gone  
Im guilty youre guilty  
So let me be stoned  
The past is the present  
When theres no place like home  
  
Off with the shoes  
And a whack round the head  
Your ear rings like a phone  
Some explanation  
Might patch and mend  
A love thats lost control  
Now theres no place like home
