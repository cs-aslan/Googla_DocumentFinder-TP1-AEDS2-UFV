Damien save me  
And be my guide  
Sooner or later  
Were all gonna die  
When we were walking  
Through the streets  
Everything you said was bittersweet  
And I wish that we could be in a  
Bottle of time just you and me  
Lets talk about the ways and means  
The body shape  
The love supreme  
And drink drink until we disappear  
Damien save me  
And be my god  
Sooner or later  
Im gonna die like a dog  
Cut me in half  
And Ill let you see  
What this whole wide world  
Has done to me  
Ill be you sacrificial cow  
Just tell me when and Ill  
Show you how  
Lets talk about  
The sacrifice  
The body limbs  
That rest on ice and drink drink until  
We disappear  
I know youll never let me down  
Down down down  
So lets take it and push it  
And kick it and break it  
And turn it all around  
Damien save me  
And be my guy  
Sooner or later  
Were all gonna die  
When we were walking  
Through the streets  
Everything you said was bittersweet  
And I wish that we could be  
In a bottle of time  
Just you and me  
When we were walking through the streets  
walking through the streets  
walking through the streets
