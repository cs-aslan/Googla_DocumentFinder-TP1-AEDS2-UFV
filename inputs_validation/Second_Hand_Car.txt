In a second hand car you ran away with him  
You didnt get too far before he made you cry  
And he beat on you oh he never treated you  
More something on his shoe walk on by on by  
Its time time to run away from him  
A man dont act that way and you know hell never change  
Its a way to love knocked down and bruises too  
And its a way for him to knock down and use you  
Ill send a ticket to you Ill send the fare to you  
Ill say a prayer for you and it makes me cry me cry  
Its time time to run away from him  
A man dont act that way and you know hell never change  
Its time time for you to come on home  
But the world dont seem that way and you know itll never change  
Never change never change  
Its such a rare report ah she got lost on him  
I get lost in thought hope she walks on by  
Ill make the time to give if you dont give a damn  
Well make a home and live without you and we can  
Its time time to run away from him  
A man dont act that way and you know hell never change  
Its time time for you to come on home  
But the world dont seem that way and you know itll never change  
Never change never never never never change  
On and on and on and on and on  
On and on and on and on and on  
On and on and on and on and on  
On and on and on and on and on
