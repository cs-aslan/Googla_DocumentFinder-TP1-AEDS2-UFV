I kiss you once Ill kiss you twice  
I kiss you once Ill kiss you twice  
I kiss you once Ill kiss you twice  
And I get the shivers cause youre cold as ice  
  
Ill dig you up and Ill get me some  
Ill be the one tickling right in your ear  
Ill dig your belly skin on tight  
Ill dig you youre coming home with me  
Ill dig you up Ill dig you up  
  
You take me home gonna rocking zombie  
I got an appetite for your loving  
I bring you flowers every night and tenevery night and ten  
Well well well well  
I got showsbabe you got bone  
Ow come on  
  
Ill dig you up and Ill get me some  
Ill be the tickling one in your ear  
Ill dig your belly skin on tight  
Ill dig you youre staying over here  
Ill dig you up oh overnight  
Ill dig you up Ill dig you up  
  
I got a heart at the cemetery  
No cheers theyre really scary  
Rip rip yeah rip man right by me  
Second verse sounds good to me
