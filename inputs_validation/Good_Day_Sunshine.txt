Good day sunshine  
Good day sunshine  
Good day sunshine  
  
I need to laugh and when the sun is out  
Ive got something I an laugh about  
I feel good in a special way  
Im in love and its a sunny day  
  
Good day sunshine  
Good day sunshine  
Good day sunshine  
  
We take a walk the sun is shining down  
Burns my feet as they touch the ground  
  
Good day sunshine  
Good day sunshine  
Good day sunshine  
  
Then we lie beneath a shady tree  
I love her and shes loving me  
She feels good she know shes looking fine  
Im so proud to know that she is mine  
  
Good day sunshine  
Good day sunshine  
Good day sunshine  
Good day sunshine  
Good day sunshine  
Good day sunshine  
Good day sunshine  
Good day sunshine
