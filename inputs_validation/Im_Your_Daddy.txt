I thought tonight would suck like every other night  
Id party with my friends  
But when I saw you grooving on the dance floor  
Normal came to an end  
  
We started talking and man it was so clear to me  
Theres no one else like you  
You got the brains the body and the beauty  
To top it off youre cool  
  
Chorus  
This aint impossible  
This aint improbable  
You are my baby tonight  
And Im your daddy  
This aint believable  
This aint predictable  
You are my baby tonight  
And Im your daddy  
  
I hope that I aint freaking you out  
You probably hear it all the time  
I swear I aint like those other boys  
Im a special kind  
  
I would like to give a demonstration  
Of what it is I do  
Ill take you out to dinner at Palermos  
Well split a cheese fondue  
  
Chorus  
  
I will egg the goomba  
If you tire  
Try my best to moonwalk  
On the wire  
  
I just want to oh ah  
Feel your fire  
Feel your fire  
Feel your fire  
  
Chorus
