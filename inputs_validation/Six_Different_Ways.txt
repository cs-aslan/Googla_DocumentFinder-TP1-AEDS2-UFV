This is stranger than I thought  
Six different ways inside my heart  
And every one Ill keep tonight  
Six different ways go deep inside  
  
Ill tell them anything at all  
I know Ill give them more and more  
  
Ill tell them anything at all  
I know Ill give the world and more  
They think Im on my hands and head  
This time theyre much too slow  
  
Six sides to every lie I say  
Its that American voice again  
It was never quite like this before  
Not one of you is the same   
This is stranger than I thought  
Six different ways inside my heart  
And everyone Ill keep tonight  
Six different ways go deep inside
