Sweet words  
That you once whispered into my ear  
Promised youll always be by my side  
Now you say that were thru  
Cause you found someone new  
And to me it dont seem right  
  
And when I ask if there is a chance that we  
Somehow could love again like before  
You just say Its the end  
You just want to be friends  
And to me it dont seem right  
  
Well Im beggin you say its not the end  
I dont know what Ive done  
But I wont do it again  
I still remember all the good times we had  
Good time that went to make a romance  
So it hurts to be told  
Im out in the cold  
And to me it dont seem right
