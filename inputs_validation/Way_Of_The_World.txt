If you take the tears from crying eyes  
Will the hurt just disappear  
Put a weapon in the hand of a frightened man  
Will he show no fear  
So we stand and we watch while the city lights go out one by one  
Mother Nature sits on the other side with a loaded gun  
  
Why is there blue sky  
Why is there red sky  
Nows the time to ask the reason  
Should the blue sky  
Meet the red sky  
Should the rules have to change at all  
We all know whatever they say  
Time is on our side  
This world has been here before just going round and round and round  
  
We all agree as far as we can see  
Its just the way of the world  
Thats how its meant to be  
Theres right and theres wrong  
Theres weak and theres strong  
Its just the way of the world  
And thats how its meant to be  
  
Take the motion from a spinning wheel and watch it stop  
Take the danger out of a naked flame and what have you got  
If you take the anger out of a broken heart you feel no pain  
Could you swear if you had that second chance you wouldnt do it again  
  
Why is there blue sky  
Why is there red sky  
Nows the time to ask the reason  
Should the blue sky  
Meet the red sky  
Should the rules have to change at all  
We all know whatever they say  
Time is on our side  
This world has been here before just going round and round and round  
  
We all agree as far as we can see  
Its just the way of the world  
Thats how its meant to be  
Theres right and theres wrong  
Theres weak and theres strong  
Its just the way of the world  
And thats how its meant to be
