Every things gonna be alright boys help is on the way  
Hold your head up high now theres no need to cry now  
Were not running anymore  
  
Leave the politics behind boys theyre not working anymore  
Theres so much more at stake here its make or break here  
Havent we been here before  tell me what were waiting for  
  
Chorus  
  
You gotta remember you dont have to be afraid  
You still have the freedom to learn and say what you want to say  
You gotta remember dont let em take away  
The land we call the home of the brave  
  
Who sings the song of the people you dont hear it anymore  
I heard it late last summer to the beat of a different drummer  
It never sounded quite like that before  
  
So youre trying to shake this feeling that troubles right outside the door  
You lie awake each dark night like a time bomb wound up too tight  
A storm in waiting just offshore  tell me what were waiting for
