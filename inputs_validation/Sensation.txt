Tommy  
  
I overwhelm as I approach you  
Make your lungs hold breath inside  
Lovers break caresses for me  
Love enhanced when Ive gone by  
  
Youll feel me coming  
A new vibration  
From afar youll see me  
Im a sensation  
  
They worship me and all I touch  
Hazy eyed they catch my glance  
Pleasant shudders shake their senses  
My warm momentum throws their stance  
  
Youll feel me coming  
A new vibration  
From afar youll see me  
Im a sensation  
  
I leave a trail of rooted people  
Mesmerized by just the sight  
The few I touch are now disciples  
Love as one I am the light  
  
Soon youll see me cant you feel me  
Im coming  
Send your troubles dancing he knows the answer  
Im coming  
Im a sensation
