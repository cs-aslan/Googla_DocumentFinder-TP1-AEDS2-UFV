I forget what to ask for  
There isnt anything  
I havent been given  
How could I wish for  
Anything more as I  
Am here living in heaven  
This moment in the sun  
To feel the wheel turning on  
  
Carry me on my way carry me on my way  
Carry me on my way carry me on my way  
  
I worry about my actions  
I think about the damage I do  
Ive seen the coming attractions  
Armageddon and Waterloo  
I tried to change my mind  
I wasted precious time  
  
Carry me on my way carry me on my way  
Carry me on my way carry me on my way  
  
Who knows where the time goes  
Only everything is everything  
Feels like Im wearing my fathers clothes Singing a song my brother would
sing  
I turned to hide my face  
Theyre gone without a trace  
  
Carry me on my way carry me on my way  
Carry me on my way carry me on my way
