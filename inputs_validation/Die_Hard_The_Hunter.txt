Lets welcome home the soldier boy from far away far away  
No angel of mercy just a need to destroy fire away fire away  
Lets toast the hero with blood in his eyes  
The scars on his mind took so many lives  
Die hard the hunter  
  
Welcome home soldier boy  
Put down your pistol yeah put down your toy  
Yeah they can take a gun away from you  
But never take away your attitude  
They cant do that no they cant do that  
  
You got no enemy no front line  
The only battles in the back of your mind  
You dont know how to change from bad to good  
You brought the war to your neighborhood  
You cant do that no you cant do that  
  
Back in the city hes a man on the loose  
He is the shadow thats following you  
He takes no prisoners when hes hunting for game  
Hes got a bullet and it carries your name  
  
Die Hard Caught in a trap  
Hunter Theres no lookin back  
Die Hard Hes hides in the crowd  
Hunter Die Hard and proud
