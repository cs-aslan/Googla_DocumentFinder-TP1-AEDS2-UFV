I do it for your love  
Im not sentimental no one calls me tender  
I keep my emotions safe inside  
But Ive never felt these feelings  
And time just keeps revealing  
A part of me I can no longer hide  
The moment that I kissed your lips  
I found a whole new world exists  
Look what youve done with my life  
If I write your name a thousand times  
Inside a heart next to mine  
Act like a fool whose faith is blind  
Whatever I do I do it for your love  
Im not one for flowers  
Or talking on the phone for hours  
Fancy words have never been my game  
An answered prayer I never prayed  
That came true anyway  
Now I know Ill never be the same  
If I light a candle in the night  
To see the reflection in your eyes  
You dont even need to ask me why  
Whatever I do I do it for your love  
I write your name
