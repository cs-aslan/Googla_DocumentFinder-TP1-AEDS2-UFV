Oh you shouldnt have kissed me and got me so excited  
And when you asked me out I really was delighted  
So we went to a pub in belsize park  
And we cheered on england as the sky grew dark  
Oh you shouldnt have kissed me cause you started a fire  
But then I found out that youre a serial liar  
  
You lied about your status  
You lied about your life  
You never mentioned your three children  
And the fact you have a wife  
Now its england 2 colombia 0  
And I know just how those colombians feel  
  
If you hadnt passed out while I was talking to your friend  
It could have really ended badly cause you very nearly had me  
If he hadnt taken pity on my heart full of desire  
I might never have found out youre a serial liar  
  
You lied about your status  
You lied about your life  
You forgot you have three children  
You forgot you have a wife  
Now its england 2 colombia 0  
And I know just how those colombians feel  
  
It is not in my nature to ever pick the winning team  
Sometimes I think Im happy then I remember its a dream  
Now it isnt in my nature to ever pick a winner  
I always pick a bastard who would have me for his dinner  
  
I can never possess the object of my desire  
Cause hes bound to turn out to be a serial liar  
Ok I didnt mention my kids I thought Id wait a bit  
But I am free and single and hes a lying git  
  
Cause he lied about his status  
He lied about his life  
He forgot he had three children  
He forgot he had a wife  
And its england 2 colombia 0  
I know just how those colombians feel  
  
So I got into a taxi and sobbed all the way home  
Called my friend up in sao paulo and cried down the phone  
I played some tragic music and I lay down to die  
But later I woke and I hadnt stopped crying  
  
You should never have kissed me you tasted of deceit  
Your perfume was adultery but Im not a piece of meat  
So Ill be the one that you couldnt acquire  
I found out in time youre a serial liar  
  
You lied about your status  
You lied about your life  
And I pity your three children  
And I pity your poor wife  
Now you can go to hell  
Im going to brazil  
Still its england 2 colombia 0
