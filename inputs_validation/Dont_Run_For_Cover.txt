You hide wont fight  
Avoid the daylight  
Give in wont win  
No try to make it right  
  
Why dont you stop crying  
Stop your painful dying  
Why dont you give your life a sense  
  
One game one aim  
But youre always sleeping  
One light so bright  
In darkness youre creeping  
  
Why dont you use your head  
Step out of your warm bed  
And stop being on anxious rat  
  
Run for your destination  
Fly to the sun  
Dont give a damn what the people may say  
Its like a chain on your leg  
When you always look back  
If you dont risk anything one day youll pay  
  
Chorus  
Dont run for cover  
Dont cry alone  
Make a step on your stairway  
One step closer to what you live for  
Dont run for cover  
Dont throw away  
The only chance that you got  
To be the fire in a hot life you choose  
  
No pride no right  
In your heart is more strength  
You know I know  
Your destinys in your hand  
  
Now you have this time  
To survive dont be blind  
In this world where so many cant see  
  
Bridge  
Try to catch the key  
Make that you can see  
The light of your life your way to go  
  
Chorus  
  
Run for your destination  
Fly to the sun  
Dont give a damn what the people may say  
Its like a chain on your leg  
When you always look back  
If you dont risk anything one day youll pay  
  
Chorus
