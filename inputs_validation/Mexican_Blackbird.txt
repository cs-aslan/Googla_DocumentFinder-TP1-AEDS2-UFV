If youre down in Acuna and you aint up to being alone  
dont spend all your money on just any honey thats grown  
Go find the Mexican blackbird and send all your troubles back home  
  
They all call her her puta cause no one really knows her name  
She works the cantina dancin and alovins her trade  
Her mama was Mezcan and her daddy was the ace of spades  
  
Oh lets drive that old Chrysler down to Mexico boy  
Said keep your hands on the wheel there  
Oh it sure is fine aint it  
Now ya got it Hand me another one of them brews from back there  
Oh this is gonna be so good  
  
Mm shes hot as a pepper but smooth as a Mexican brew  
So head for the border and put in an order or two  
The wings of the blackbird will spread like an eagle for you  
  
Oh one more time  
can you roll me another Bull Durham please  
Cant you do it with one hand boy
