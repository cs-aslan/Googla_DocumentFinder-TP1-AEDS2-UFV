Repeat x2  
All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce yall  
  
Its structures to this game its instinct mixed with knowledge  
Im a player in the game and I know not from college  
Eyes open focus scopin out the scene  
Watch the gangsta haters close cause they worse than dope fiends  
I hope things get better for you  
Cause Ima make things get better for me  
And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB  
The LLG wit DPG by the sea  
We ride at high tide the East is my side  
Ima tell you long as my voice is recordable  
That plan you got aint gonna work you better audible  
Oh yes Im fresh and like spy from existence  
Wit persistence I perceive  
To supply you wit what you need no room for greed  
Better go around and when it come to you  
Dont bite off more than you can chew  
Respect the game and the game will respect you back  
Game is life life is struggle  
Without the coastal juggle  
So if you drop I test that fragile as a crsytal  
Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol  
Or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces  
And put it back together and remain tougher than leather  
As for me Im trying to keep it real Dogg  
All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce yall  
  
Chorus x2  
Just keep it real Dogg  
All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce yall  
  
Teatlet hold em shake em roll  
Fly G boys and all you hoodrat girls  
Pound puts it down all around the world  
But lets pick up the litter LB young nigga  
I need solar on my Dogg nall I bark when it get dark  
Bitches in heat we tear the beat up what  
On the microphone I bury the bone  
Always strays try to follow me home  
To get the pooper scooper why They dropping doodoo  
Im stepping on shit lift up the bottom of my shoe  
See Im smashing fullbreaded wit no leash  
When I mob make marks across the street  
See Im vicious like hell got em waggin they tail  
For the bowwow LBC style  
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever I fetch paper  
On the receiver go get it like a retriever  
I want em close enough so I can lock on em  
With the mizzic see I let the Doggz loose on em  
Check this out here man I lick em sick em  
Mans bestfriend I hit you for ten  
Fleas cant seize my pack what whats my name  
Major trick were hitting licks like a doberman gang  
Whydone trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy  
Run a cat up a tree nigga its DPG  
  
Chorus x2  
  
They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs  
Where its all about dope and pistol smoke  
I packs me a heavy calibre 38 revolver  
Wed out Dpd out GCd out  
Oh did you not know  
Snoop wit the 44 knocking atcha door  
We the passion for smashing and mashing the masses  
Knocking niggas like cash is Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin  
Its like in a action  
Cause for the cash in my own zone we known for blasting  
Busting no need for discussion  
We dont discuss we stay close as 10 inches then bust  
Close enough to touch then rush  
Clean and radical and get clutch  
The Dogg is the Don like killer Corleone  
For the DOdouble G with the solid gold rhyme  
  
Chorus x3
