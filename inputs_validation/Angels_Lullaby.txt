I was never alive  
Til the day I was blessed with you  
When I hold you late at night  
I know what I was put here to do  
I turn off the world and listen to you sigh  
And I will sing my Angels Lullaby  
  
Know Im forever near  
The one you can always call  
Right all you know to fear  
Are the shadows on your wall  
Im here close enough  
To kiss the tears you cry  
And I will sing my Angels Lullaby  
  
So tell me how to stop the years from racing  
Is there a secret someone knows  
Ill never catch all the memories Im chasing  
Ill never be ready to let go  
  
And when the world seems cold  
And you feel that all of your strength is gone  
There may be one tiny voice  
Your reason to carry on  
And when Im not close enough  
To kiss the tears you cry  
You will sing your Angels Lullaby  
Let this be our Angels Lullaby
