Had to phone ya  
Had to phone ya just to talk to you  
Had to phone ya just to tell ya I was missing you  
It lifts my spirits every single time  
Sometimes youre busy for awhile  
But when you get through  
It makes me smile  
Awhen I phone ya  
Californias not so far away  
Youre not alone ya know Im only just a dial away  
I visualize that youre looking fine  
Feels so good when you come on the line  
You you you you you you you you  
You you you you you you you you  
You you you you you you you you  
You you you you you you  
Come on  
Come on and answer the phone  
Come on come on  
I hope your home  
Come on and answer the phone  
Come on come on  
I hope your home  
Come on and answer the phone  
Come on come on  
I hope your home  
Come on and answer the phone  
Come on come on  
I hope your home  
Come on and answer the phone  
Come on come on  
I hope your home  
Come on and answer the phone  
Come on come on  
Hello hey Brian  
I hope your home
