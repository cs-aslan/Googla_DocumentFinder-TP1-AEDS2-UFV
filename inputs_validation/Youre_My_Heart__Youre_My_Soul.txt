Deep in my heart theres a fire  
Thats a burning heart  
Deep in my heart theres desire for a start  
Im dying in emotion  
Its my world in fantasy  
Im living in my living in my dreams  
  
Youre my heart youre my soul  
I keep it shining everywhere I go  
Youre my heart youre my soul  
Ill be holding you forever stay with you together  
  
Youre my heart youre my soul  
Yeah a feeling that our love will grow  
Youre my heart youre my soul  
Thats the only thing I really know  
  
Lets close the door and believe my burning heart  
Feeling alright come on open up your heart  
Ill keep the candles burning  
Let your body melt in mine  
Im living in my living in my dreams
