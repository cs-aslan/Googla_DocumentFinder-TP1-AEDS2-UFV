All my friends tell me I should move on  
Im lying in the ocean singing your song  
Ah thats how you sing it  
Loving you forever cant be wrong  
Even though youre not here wont move on  
Ah thats how we play it  
  
And theres no remedy for memory your face  
Like a melody it wont leave my head  
Your soul is haunting me and telling me  
That everything is fine  
But I wish I was dead  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
Its like a dark paradise  
No one compares to you  
Im scared that you wont be waiting on the other side  
Every time I close my eyes  
Its like a dark paradise  
No one compares to you  
Im scared that you wont be waiting on the other side  
  
All my friends ask me why I stay strong  
Tell em when you find true love it lives on  
Ah thats why I stay here  
  
And theres no remedy for memory your face  
Like a melody it wont leave my head  
Your soul is haunting me and telling me  
That everything is fine  
But I wish I was dead  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
Its like a dark paradise  
No one compares to you  
Im scared that you wont be waiting on the other side  
Every time I close my eyes  
Its like a dark paradise  
No one compares to you  
But theres no you except in my dreams tonight  
  
Oh oh oh ha ha ha  
I dont wanna wake up from this tonight  
Oh oh oh ha ha ha  
I dont wanna wake up from this tonight  
  
Theres no relief I see you in my sleep  
And everybodys rushing me but I can feel you touching me  
Theres no release I feel you in my dreams  
Telling me Im fine  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
Its like a dark paradise  
No one compares to you  
Im scared that you wont be waiting on the other side  
Every time I close my eyes  
Its like a dark paradise  
No one compares to you  
  
But that theres no you except in my dreams tonight  
Oh oh oh ha ha ha  
I dont wanna wake up from this tonight  
Oh oh oh ha ha ha  
I dont wanna wake up from this tonight
