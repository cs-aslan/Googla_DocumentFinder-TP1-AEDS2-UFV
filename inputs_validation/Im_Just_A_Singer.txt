Im just a wandering on the face of this earth  
Meeting so many people  
Who are trying to be free  
And while Im traveling I hear so many words  
  
Language barriers broken  
Now weve found the key  
And if you want the wind of change  
To blow about you  
And youre the only other person to know dont tell me  
Im just a singer in a rock and roll band  
  
A thousand pictures can be drawn from one word  
Only who is the artist  
We got to agree  
A thousand miles can lead so many ways  
  
Just to know who is driving  
What a help it would be  
So if you want this world of yours  
To turn about you  
And you can see exactly what to do  
Please tell me  
Im just a singer in a rock and roll band  
  
How can we understand  
Riots by the people for the people  
Who are only destroying themselves  
And when you see a frightened  
Person who is frightened by the  
People who are scorching this earth  
  
Im just a wandering on the face of this earth  
Meeting so many people  
Who are trying to be free  
And while Im traveling I hear so many words  
  
Language barriers broken  
Now weve found the key  
And if you want the wind of change  
To blow about you  
And youre the only other person to know dont tell me  
Im just a singer in a rock and roll band  
  
How can we understand  
Riots by the people for the people  
Who are only destroying themselves  
And when you see a frightened  
Person who is frightened by the  
People who are scorching this earth  
  
Music is the traveller crossing our world  
Meeting so many people bridging the seas  
Im just a singer in a rock and roll band  
Were just the singers in a rock and roll band  
Im just a singer in a rock and roll band
