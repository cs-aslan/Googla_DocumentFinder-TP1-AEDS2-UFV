Ive played the song  
Now it drives me crazy  
Ive run the race  
Now Im too damn lazy  
This love of ours  
Is a fading photograph yeah yeah  
Now I must approach to life today  
Seems a little different  
Hard to say  
But it looks like the end  
  
Times up  
Promise this time Ill get it off  
Better we slam the door shut  
Didnt you know if nothing  
Changes nothing changes  
Times up  
Promise this time Ill get it off  
Better we turn the lights off  
Love is a train we wait for it  
Even when its gone  
  
Weve surfed the wave  
Now weve hit the short end  
Weve squeezed the fruit  
Till theres no more juice left  
Were both so good  
Good at keeping up the lie yeah yeah  
Hey but no ones got to die  
We can get it in prospective  
Kiss my lips  
Life is what we make it  
  
Times up  
Promise this time Ill get it off  
Better we slam the door shut  
Didnt you know if nothing  
Changes nothing changes  
Times up  
Promise this time Ill get it off  
Better we turn the lights off  
Love is a train we wait for it  
Even when its gone  
  
As Im waving you goodbye  
I want you to smile  
Save a picture in your frame  
File it right next to my name  
Im willing to die  
For love willing to try  
But not willing to lie for love  
I know that this cakes already baked  
Now its burning burning  
  
We can get it in prospective  
Kiss my lips  
Life is what we make it  
  
Times up  
Promise this time Ill get it off  
Better we slam the door shut  
Didnt you know if nothing  
Changes nothing changes  
Times up  
Promise this time Ill get it off  
Better we turn the lights off  
Love is a train we wait for it yeah yeah  
Even when its gone  
Times up  
Promise this time I get enough  
Promise this time Ill get it off  
Love is a train we wait for it  
Even when its gone
