Hello Mr Krinkle  
How are you today  
Seems the rumors are about your team might move away  
Now me Im sentimental  
But Im not one to cry  
  
Say there Mr Krinkle lets cruise the Bastard boat  
Damn then sonsabitches with their gillnets set afloat  
I flip on my tele and I watch the waters die  
Cmon Mr Krinkle tell me why  
  
Hey ho Mr Krinkle have you heard the brand new sound  
Its a cross between Jimi Hendrix  
Bocephus Cher and James Brown

New Wave coldfiltered lowcalorie dry  
Cmon Mr Krinkle tell me why
