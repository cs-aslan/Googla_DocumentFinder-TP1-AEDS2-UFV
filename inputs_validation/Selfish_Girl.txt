Baby boy what you done to me  
I saw you smiling suddenly  
I cant get you out my mind  
I got it bad boy I cant lie  
I want your time and your full attention  
I wanna to talk to you  
And not to mention good love that you give to me  
I think about it constantly  
No I wont apologize for feeling like I do  
Its just the simple facts of life  
Im crazy over you  
  
Chorus  
Im a selfish girl when it comes to you  
Every minute of the day Im addicted to what your giving me boy  
Its killing me when it comes to love  
Im not trying share you  
Might think Im greedy but I just dont care  
I need you in my world cause Im a selfish girl  
  
I understand that you got your crew  
But Ive got something in mind for you  
Make you lose all track of time  
Guaranteed to blow your mind  
I dont care what anybody got to say  
Maybe they never had it quite this way  
Let them talk and criticize  
They all need to recognize  
They might see Im a bit extreme  
To need you night and day  
But what I feel cant be concealed  
There aint no other way  
  
Chorus  
  
Boy you got me tripping  
I didnt know what I was missing  
This is crazy crazy  
So amazing so amazing  
I didnt mean to be demanding but I hope your understanding  
Im not playing boy Im not playing boy  
Im just saying boy  
They might see Im a bit extreme  
To need you night and day  
But what I feel cant be concealed  
There aint no other way  
  
Boy you got me tripping  
I didnt know what I was missing  
This is crazy crazy  
So amazing so amazing  
I didnt mean to be demanding but I hope your understanding  
Im not playing boy Im not playing boy  
Im just saying boy  
They might see Im a bit extreme  
To need you night and day  
But what I feel cant be concealed  
There aint no other way
