You may have left your mistake with breakfast  
Watching the sun go down  
Ive been lying awake till dawn now  
Im not ready to face that  
Im not ready to face that thing today  
  
I wish I was high  
Brighter than nothing  
Smarter than nobody  
Ive wasted away  
  
I think of the things that matter  
And I think of the things that dont  
Whatever it is no matter  
I hate feeling the way I feel  
I hate feeling the way I eel today  
  
I wish I was high  
Brighter than nothing  
Smarter than nobody  
Ive wasted away  
  
I see myself with headphones on  
Im listening to Wake of the Flood  
Im listening to Wake of the Flood  
Now Im high  
  
I wish I was high  
Brighter than nothing  
Smarter than nobody  
Ive wasted away  
I wish I was high  
Brighter than nothing  
Smarter than nobody  
Ive wasted away
