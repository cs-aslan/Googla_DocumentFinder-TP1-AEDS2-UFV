Its four o clock in the mornin  
And the daylights creepin in  
And Im lyin awake in bed  
And outside my window  
The rains just pourin down  
And theres a pain inside my head oh yeah  
I looked hard into the mirror  
Took some water in my hands  
And threw it on my face  
But your memory wont fade away  
I see you everywhere  
Around this empty space  
This nights too long fadin fast  
I tell myself this pain wont last  
Its just a flesh wound  
Missin my heart but it still cuts deep  
Nothin but a flesh wound yeah  
It tore me apart and I still cant sleep  
You know you really did it well  
Now Im lyin on a bed of nails  
But its nothin but a flesh wound  
Better pull myself together  
Gotta hold my head up high  
Thats what Ive got to do  
No damage done  
But deep inside my heart  
Who am I tryin to fool  
Its over now its all in the past  
I tell myself this pain wont last  
Its just a flesh wound  
Missin my heart but it still cuts deep  
Nothin but a flesh wound oh  
It tore me apart and I still cant sleep no no  
Ive got no choice I must be strong  
Cant lie here thinkin about it all night long  
Its nothin but a flesh wound  
Its just a flesh wound  
Missin my heart but it still cuts deep  
Nothin but a flesh wound oh  
And it tore me apart but I still cant sleep  
You know you really did it well  
Now Im lyin on a bed of nails  
Its just a flesh wound oh  
I got to be strong  
Its just a flesh wound babe  
It tore me apart oh at last  
Its a flesh wound  
Nothing but a flesh wound oh  
It cuts me deep yeah
