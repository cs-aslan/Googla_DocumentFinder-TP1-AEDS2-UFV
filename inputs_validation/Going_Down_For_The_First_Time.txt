I wake up every morning and thats my first mistake  
From thereon in its downhill all the way  
I used to have a problem but now you want to leave  
My new problems getting through the day  
  
Going down for the first time  
Guess Ive yet to learn loves aint blind  
I could use a little help I cant stay here by myself  
And I cant work you out of my mind  
  
Now I dont mind admitting that maybe you were right  
The more we try the less it seems to work  
We get so used to banging our heads against the wall  
Its only when we stop it starts to hurt  
  
Going down for the first time  
Guess Ive yet to learn loves aint blind  
I could use a little help I cant stay here by myself  
Ill step right out of line Ill go clean out of time  
Yes I could use a little help know Id lose it by myself  
If you fall out of sight you know youll turn out the light  
  
Going down for the first time  
Guess Ive yet to learn loves aint blind  
I could use a little help I cant stay here by myself  
Ill step right out of line Ill go clean out of time  
Yes I could use a little help know Id lose it by myself  
If you fall out of sight you know youll turn out the light  
And Ill quietly go out of my mind
