Just another guy that you see around  
No more than a face  
Somewhere in the crowd  
Then when you pass  
I m feeling sorrow  
Cause youre so near  
Yet youre so far away  
  
I know that Im a fool for wanting  
What I cant have  
If I say I loved you youd only laugh  
So each night Id dream that youre mine  
And wake each morning only to find  
That Im just another guy  
  
I know in my heart that  
I dont stand a chance  
But I just cant end this one way romance  
  
Maybe someday  
Ill be there by your side  
But if I remain just another guy  
Youll be here in my heart forever  
And I know that darlin youll never be  
Just another girl to me
