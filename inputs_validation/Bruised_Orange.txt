My hearts in the ice house come hill or come valley  
Like a long ago sunday when I walked through the alley  
On a cold winters morning to a church house  
Just to shovel some snow  
  
I heard sirens on the train track howl naked gettin nuder  
An altar boys been hit by a local commuter  
Just from walking with his back turned  
To the train that was coming so slow  
  
You can gaze out the window get mad and get madder  
Throw your hands in the air say what does it matter   
But it dont do no good to get angry  
So help me I know  
  
For a heart stained in anger grows weak and grows bitter  
You become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there  
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own  
Chain of sorrow  
  
I been brought down to zero pulled out and put back there  
I sat on a park bench kissed the girl with the black hair  
And my head shouted down to my heart  
you better look out below  
Hey it aint such a long drop dont stammer dont stutter  
From the diamonds in the sidewalk to the dirt in the gutter  
And you carry those bruises to remind you wherever you go
