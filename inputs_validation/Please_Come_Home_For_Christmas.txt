Bells will be ringing the sad sad news  
Oh what a Christmas to end the blues  
My babys gone and I have no friends  
To wish me greetings once again  
  
Choirs will be singing Silent Night  
Christmas carols by candlelight  
Please come home for Christmas  
Please come home for Christmas  
If not for Christmas by New Years night  
  
Friends and relations send salutations  
Sure as the stars shine above  
For this is Christmas yeah its Christmas my dear  
Its the time of year to be with the one you love  
  
So wont you tell me youll never more roam  
Christmas and New Years will find you home  
Therell be no more sorrow no grief or pain  
And Ill be happy happy once again  
  
instrumental interlude  
  
Therell be no more sorrow no grief or pain  
And Ill be happy happy Christmas once again
