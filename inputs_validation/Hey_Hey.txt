Well Ive seen some women  
They put your soul on ice  
They want a piece of the action  
But they never let you roll the dice  
  
Thats the kind of woman  
Bring a good man down  
Thats the kind of woman  
I dont want around  
Hey hey  
  
I got a woman that dances  
She knows how to jump and shout  
Now she dont want to use me  
Cause she knows how it wears me out  
  
Yeah shes the woman  
With the magic touch  
She dont want to lose me  
Cause she loves me too much  
Hey hey  
  
Hey hey my woman looks good to me  
Hey hey my woman looks good to me  
Yeah she knows how to please me  
She knows how to set me free  
  
Get off of that couch  
Turn off that MTV  
Get off of that couch  
Turn off your MTV  
Hey hey my woman looks good to me
