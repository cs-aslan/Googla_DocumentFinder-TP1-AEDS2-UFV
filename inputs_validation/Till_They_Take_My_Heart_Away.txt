I look into your eyes so far away  
Theres trouble in your mind  
Youre losing faith  
Hey now let me hold you  
Itll be okay  
Coz I will love you  
Till they take my heart away  
Remember when you called  
And said goodbye  
We thought wed lost it all  
And so did I  
Even if I lost you  
I would feel the same  
Coz I will love you  
Till they take my heart away  
Believe in me  
Im here to stay  
I will love you  
Till they take my heart away  
Now were stronger than before  
Weve made it throught  
I never felt more sure  
Because of you  
Hey now are you listening  
Do you hear me say  
I will love you  
Till they take my heart away
