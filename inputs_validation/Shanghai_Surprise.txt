I cant understand how Ive gone astray  
I should be sailing away on a liner  
I was knocked on my back on a dock at Yangtse  
Its a hell of a way to see China but Im ready  
You must be crazy  
And you got no money  
And youre a liar  
My straits are dire from the the wok into the fire  
Id like to trust you but Ive broken my rickshaw  
Sometimes theres no hope in in chasing opium  
Id like to love you but Im not sure whats in your eyes  
Mm Shanghai surprise  
Whatever youre saying I want it anyway in  
Been hanging round like a kid at your back door  
Ooh babe  
You could be kinder and show me Asia minor  
Ill let you love me let you see whats here in my eyes  
Shanghai surprise  
You must be crazy  
Crazy  
And you got no money  
Money  
And it seems like madness  
Back streets so crowded that no room to swing a cat  
Id like to know you but youre acting so coolie  
Im finding out pursued by evil looking dudes its  
Getting hot for me like tofu when it deep fries  
Oh Shanghai surprise  
But baby you look like any common crook  
Thats hanging round in those real shady places  
Ooh babe  
While you assess me why not try to impress me  
Step over here let me see whats there in your eyes  
Oh Shanghai surprise  
I dont understand how I got delayed  
I should be sailing today on a liner  
Was kicked in the ass on a dock at Yangtse  
Its no way for a man to see China but Im ready  
You must be crazy  
Crazy  
And you got no money  
Money  
But youre a trier  
My straits are dire from the the wok into the fire  
Id like to meet you but Ive broken my chopstick  
Sometimes theres no hope in in chasing promises  
I wanna love you though it could prove to be unwise  
Shanghai surprise  
Whatever youre saying I want it anyway in  
Been hanging round for a ride on your rickshaw  
Ooh babe  
You may correct me now that youve inspected me  
Come over here let me feel you cut down to size  
Oh Shanghai surprise  
My straits are dire from the the wok into the fire  
Id like to know you but Im not really social  
Sometimes its no joke cant cope with opium  
Id like to love you but Im not sure whats in your eyes  
Shanghai surprise  
Shanghai surprise Shanghai surprise  
And you got no money  
But youre a trier
