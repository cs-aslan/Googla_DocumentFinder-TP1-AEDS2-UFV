I guess it all started when I woke up  
This morning everything seemed okay  
Till I let my pet snake get loose in the kitchen  
Now Ive been in trouble all day  
  
I got some paint on the wall a pretty orange color  
And a little on the carpet and floor  
I covered it up with moms coat from the closet  
That she says she cant wear anymore  
  
Ive had a bad bad day  
Not like I thought it would be  
Ive had a bad bad day  
It seems like everyones picking on me  
  
I put some sand in my grandpas tobacco  
And he frowned at me all day  
Then I hid his pipe cause it smells when he smokes it  
He shouldnt smoke anyway  
  
So between moms coat and my grandpas tobacco  
Life can be rough on a kid  
Theyve almost worn out the seat of my britches  
It dont hurt much now but it did  
  
Ive had a bad bad day  
Not like I thought it would be  
Ive had a bad bad day  
It seems like everyones picking on me  
  
Ive had a bad bad day  
Not like I thought it would be  
Ive had a bad bad day  
It seems like everyones picking on me
