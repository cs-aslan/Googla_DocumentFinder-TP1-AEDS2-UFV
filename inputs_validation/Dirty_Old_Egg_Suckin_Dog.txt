Well hes not very handsome to look at  
Oh hes shaggy and he eats like a hog  
And hes always killin my chickens  
That dirty old eggsuckin dog  
  
Eggsuckin dog  
Im gonna stomp your head in the ground  
If you dont stay out of my hen house  
You dirty old eggsuckin hound  
  
Now if he dont stop eatin my eggs up  
Though Im not a real bad guy  
Im gonna get my riffle and send him  
To that great chicken house in the sky  
  
Eggsuckin dog  
Your always hangin around  
But youd better stay out of my hen house  
You dirty old eggsuckin hound
