When I look round I only see outta one eye  
As the smoke surrounds my head the sauna  
I hear the voices but I cant make out their words  
Saying things saying things that  
  
I got something sticking in my eye  
Got something sticking in my eye  
Got something sticking in my eye  
I feel unusual from thinking  
About the underground decay God help me  
  
Kill beneath the camera watch the world begin to cry  
Its not from pity it comes from  
Whats been sticking in my eye  
Got something sticking in my eye
