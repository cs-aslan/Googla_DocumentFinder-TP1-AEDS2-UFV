The glamours gone  
The shades are down  
And Paris is only a lonely town  
Lonely  
  
When loves a laugh  
And youre the clown  
Then paris is only another town  
Dreary  
  
For the lovers clown  
This towns a weary merry go round  
And round and round  
The chestnut the willow the colors of Utrillo  
  
Turn to grey grey hues  
The band playing vyse  
Along the Champs Elysees  
Sounds like wake up blues  
  
Paris is a lonely dreary oh so lonely town  
Wheres that shining flower  
Neath the Eiffel tower  
Wheres that fairy land of gold  
  
Isnt it a pity that this magic city  
Turned suddenly cold  
The chimneys moan  
The river cries  
  
Each glamorous bridge is a bridge of sighs  
River river wont you be my lover  
Dont turn me down  
For Paris is such a lonely lonely town
