Ten Thousand princes  
Ive seen them all  
Ive seen them come  
And I see them fall  
Ive watched them win  
Ive watched them loose  
Since youve been around  
Noone gets to choose  
Because when the game begins  
And the time is now  
When there is no more talking  
Only here and now  
There is only here and now  
I aint seen anything quite like you  
Aint been anyone quite like you  
  
Ten thousand princes  
All backs against the wall  
Then Thousand losers  
When the winner comes to call  
How they scream in frustration  
Then thousand reasons why  
The rhetoric is endless  
I see the laughter in your eyes  
Because when the game begins  
And the time is now  
When there is no more talking  
Only here and now  
Only here and now  
I aint seen anything quite like you  
Aint been anyone quite like you
