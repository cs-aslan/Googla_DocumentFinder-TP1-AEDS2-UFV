Baby tell me what youre trying to prove  
Playing games with my heart  
Hey now listen I aint gonna take one more night  
Youre the one who broke the rules  
And Im the one who played the fool  
Now youre trying to tell me its alright  
You should know better than to hurt a friend  
Youll never get another chance again  
  
Youll be back where you started  
I know you wont admit it but youre brokenhearted  
Back where you started  
You think its gonna be easy but it just gets harder harder  
  
You had a way with words  
One look and I was under your spell  
I didnt know should I stay or should I run  
You cant deny you told me lies  
Love em and leave em baby thats your style  
Im not afraid to take life as it comes  
You play with fire I guess youll never learn  
You mess with me babe you re gonna get burned  
  
Youll be back where you started  
I know how it feels when youve been discarded  
Back where you started  
You think you got it made but it wont get you far no it wont get you far  
  
Whos gonna help ya throw you a lifetime  
Ill tell you one thing youve really done it this time  
You took your one chance and let it slip away
