II am just a number  
Ihang on to what I got  
Yousay what you want to  
IIII just try to stay alive  
Iput myself together  
People say get away somebody will turn you in  
Life life without surrender  
Togethernessecstasy is what I need  
I can laugh but I should cry  
When love and understanding are the ultimate crimes  
  
Chorus  
And I said Walk it down Talk it down  
oh oh oh Sympathy Luxury  
Somebody will take you there  
Walk it down Talk it down  
oh oh oh Sympathy Luxury  
Somebody will take you there  
  
Shesays she remembers  
Timelong time ago  
Webelong together  
IIII turn up the radio  
Lies lies and propaganda  
Igonna tell you what I need  
Life life without surrender  
Togethernessecstasy is what I need  
I got yours and you got mine  
And I can swim but I should fly  
  
Chorus  
  
Aint no crime to believe  
I took my money I bet my life  
What you see is what you get  
But it sure aint what we need  
  
Chorus
