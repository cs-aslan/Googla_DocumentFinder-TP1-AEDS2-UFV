Well I realizes Ive been hypnotized  
I love you gypsy eyes  
I love you gypsy eyes  
  
All right  
Gypsy  
  
Way up in my tree Im sitting by my fire  
Wonderin where in this world might you be  
And known all the time  
Your still rollin along the country side  
Do you still think about me  
  
Oh my  
Gypsy  
  
Well I walked right on up to your rubble road side  
The one that rambles on for a million miles  
Yes I walked down this road searching for your love  
And I found some too  
But I found her I aint gonna let go  
  
I remember the first time I saw you  
The tears in your eyes oh that girls tryin to say  
Oh little girl you know I could love you  
But first I must make my getaway  
Two strange men fightin to the death over me today  
Ill try and meet you by the old highway  
Hey  
  
Well I realize that Ive been hypnotized  
I love you gypsy eyes  
I love you gypsy eyes  
I love you gypsy eyes  
I love you gypsy eyes  
  
Ive been searching so long  
I think they made me lose the battle  
Down against the road my worry knees  
Off to the side I fall but I hear her sweet call  
My gypsy eyes fine and Ive been saved  
Oh Ive been saved  
Thats why I love you  
I said I love you  
Lord I love you
