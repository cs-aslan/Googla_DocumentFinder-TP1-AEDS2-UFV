Its like the middle of a age  
I feel the space between us all  
A forced expense  
But the big divide  
Between the devil and the deep blue sea  
Lets take a chance with beginners luck  
We have nothing so theres nothing to lose  
I cant believe the only reasons were here  
Are the reasons in the Bank of England  
  
Hear me now  
Weve only started  
Theyll just exploit us but its only day one  
We havent got that far  
Not far at all
