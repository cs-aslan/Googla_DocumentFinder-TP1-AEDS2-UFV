Lazarus  
A passenger traveling quietly conceals  
Himself  
With a magazine and a sleepless pillow  
Over the crest of the mountain the moon  
Begins its climb  
And he wakes to find hes in rolling  
Farmland  
  
The farmer sleeps against his wife  
He wonders what their life must be  
A Trailways bus is heading south  
Into Washington D C  
  
A mother and child the baby maybe two months old  
Prepare themselves for sleep and feeding  
The shadow of the Capitol dome slides across his face  
And his heart is racing with the urge to freedom  
  
The father motionless as stone  
A shepherd resting with his flock  
The Trailways bus is turning west  
Dallas via Little Rock  
  
Wahzinak  
O my darling darling Sal  
The desert moon is my witness  
Ive no money to come East  
But I know youll soon be here  
  
Lazarus  
We pull into downtown Dallas by the side of  
The Grassy Knoll  
Where the leader fell and a town was broken  
Away from the feel and flow of life for so many years  
He hears music playing and Spanish spoken  
  
The border patrol outside of Tucson boarded the bus  
  
Border patrolman  
Any aliens here You better check with us  
How about you son  
You look like you got Spanish blood  
Do you Habla Ingles  am I understood  
  
Sal  
Yes I am an alien from Mars  
I come to earth from outer space  
And if I traveled my whole life  
You guys would still be on my case  
You guys would still be on my case  
  
Lazarus  
But he cant leave his fears behind  
He recalls each fatal thrust  
The screams carried by the wind  
Phantom figures in the dust  
Phantom figures in the dust  
Phantom figures in the dust
