You say that its over baby Lord  
You say that its over now  
But still you hang around me come on  
Wont you move over  
You know that I need a man honey Lord  
You know that I need a man  
But when I ask you to you just tell me  
That maybe you can  
Please dontcha do it to me babe no

Or honey let me be

And whatcha gonna do with your life  
Life all just dangling
