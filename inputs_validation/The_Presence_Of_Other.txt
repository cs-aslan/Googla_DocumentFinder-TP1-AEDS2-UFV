This time its different  
Be sure I mean it  
Cant go on trading on ideas that I just dont own  
A life with some meaning a life with some sense  
I want to blame you  
Give you my power  
I keep it all on the inside keep it locked in the dark  
I keep it all on the inside keep it locked in the dark  
People telling me its not my responsibility  
But it is my problem and its my life my life  
I must believe the solutions to the problems are in my hands  
  
Feel the presence of other  
Love the resistance it presents  
Different from and outside of me  
Pushing me to find what is self  
  
Slow down just talk  
Sit down right here  
Must be an answer to the question of birth and death  
A world with some meaning  
A world with some peace  
Inside its turbulent outside reflects it  
Hear you knockin on the inside  
Hear me breathe answer please  
Hear you knockin on the inside  
Hear you breathe answer me  
People telling me what they think that I should be  
Only thing that I can be is myself myself  
I must believe in my choices to create value out of everything  
  
Feel the presence of other  
Love the resistance it presents  
Different from and outside of me  
Pushing me to find what is self  
Feel the presence of other  
Love the resistance it offers  
Different from and outside of me  
Pushing me to find what is self  
  
This time its different  
Im sure I mean it  
Slow down just listen  
Its my life its my life
