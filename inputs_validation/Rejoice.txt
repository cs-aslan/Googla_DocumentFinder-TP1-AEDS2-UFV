Its falling its falling  
And outside the buildings  
Are tumbling down  
And inside a child on the ground  
Says hed do it again  
  
And what am I to do  
What in the world am I to say  
Theres nothing else to do  
He says hell change the world someday  
I rejoice  
  
This morning I fell out of bed  
When I woke up to what he has said  
Everythings crazy  
But Im too lazy to lie  
  
And what am I to do  
Just tell me what am I supposed to say  
I cant change the world  
But I can change the world in me  
If I rejoice  
Rejoice  
  
And what am I to do  
Just tell me what am I supposed to say  
I cant change the world  
But I can change the world in me  
If I rejoice  
  
I dont know what to change  
Rejoice
