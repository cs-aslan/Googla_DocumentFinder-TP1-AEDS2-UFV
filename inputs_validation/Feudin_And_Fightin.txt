Feuding and fussing and afighting  
Sometimes it gets to be exciting  
Dont like them ornery neighbors down by the creek  
Well be plumb out of neighbors next week  
  
Grandma poor old grandma  
Whyd they have to shoot poor grandma  
She lies neath the clover  
Someone caught her bending over  
  
Picking up a daisy  
Feuding and fussing and afighting  
This is a wrong that needs a righting  
Lets get that funeral service over  
So then we can start in afeuding again  
  
Feuding and fighting and afussing  
Thats all thats going on with using  
We are such neighborly people peaceful and sweet  
All except when we happen to meet  
Daughter baby daughter  
  
Poisoned all the neighbors chickens  
Daughter hadnt oughter  
Least until she could run like the dickens  
They hit her with a shovel  
  
Feuding and fighting and afussing  
No use astanding here acussing  
Lets give our daughter a pistol now that shes four  
And go feuding and fighting some more
