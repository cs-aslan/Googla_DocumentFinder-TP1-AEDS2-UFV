Our frank and open  
Deep conversations  
They get me nowhere  
They bring me down so  
Give it a rest wont you  
Give me a cigarette  
God give me patience  
Just no more conversation  
Oh give us a drink  
And make it quick  
Or else Im gonna be sick  
Sick all over  
Your frankly vulgar  
Red pullover  
Now see how the colors blend  
  
Our frank and open  
Deep conversations  
They get me nowhere  
They just bring me down so  
Give it a rest wont you  
Now will you just give over  
The world may be ending  
But look Im only human  
  
So give us a drink  
And make it quick  
Or else Im gonna be sick  
All over  
Your frankly vulgar  
Red pullover  
Now see how the two colors blend my friend  
Wont somebody help  
  
Wont somebody stop me  
From thinking  
From thinking all the time  
About everything  
Oh somebody  
From thinking all the time  
So deeply so bleakly  
So bleakly all the time  
About everything Who I am how I ever got here  
Somebody stop me  
From thinking  
From thinking all the time  
So bleakly so bleakly  
So bleakly all the time
