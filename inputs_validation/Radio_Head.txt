Baby your mind is a radio  
Got a receiver inside my head  
Baby Im tuned to your wavelength  
Lemme tell you what it says  
  
Transmitter  
Oh Picking up something good  
Hey radio head  
The soundof a brandnew world  
  
So look at my fingers vibrate  
From their tip down down to my toes  
Now Im receiving your signal  
Were gonna leave the land of noise  
  
Transmitter  
Oh Picking up something good  
Hey radio head  
The soundof a brandnew world  
  
Transmitter  
Oh Picking up something good  
Hey radio head  
The soundOf a brandnew world  
  
Now you and I have no secrets  
Now baby lemme read your mind  
I hear evrything youre thinking  
You cant help the way you sound  
  
Transmitter  
Picking up something good  
Hey Radio head  
The soundOf a brandnew world  
Oh Radio Head  
Radio Head  
Radio Head  
Radio Head
