Look out of any window  
Any morning any evening any day  
Maybe the sun is shining  
Birds are winging no  
Rain is falling from a heavy sky  
What do you want me to do  
To do for you to see you through  
For this is all a dream we dreamed  
One afternoon long ago  
Walk out of any doorway  
Feel your way feel your way  
Like the day before  
Maybe youll find direction  
Around some corner  
Where its been waiting to meet you  
What do you want me to do  
To watch for you while youre sleeping  
Well please dont be surprised  
When you find me dreaming too  
  
Look into any eyes  
You find by you you can see  
Clear through to another day  
Maybe been seen before  
Through other eyes on other days  
While going home  
What do you want me to do  
To do for you to see you through  
Its all a dream we dreamed  
One afternoon long ago  
  
Walk into splintered sunlight  
Inch your way through dead dreams  
To another land  
Maybe youre tired and broken  
Your tongue is twisted  
With words half spoken  
And thoughts unclear  
What do you want me to do  
To do for you to see you through  
A box of rain will ease the pain  
And love will see you through  
  
Just a box of rain  
Wind and water  
Believe it if you need it  
If you dont just pass it on  
Sun and shower  
Wind and rain  
In and out the window  
Like a moth before a flame  
  
Its just a box of rain  
I dont know who put it there  
Believe it if you need it  
Or leave it if you dare  
But its just a box of rain  
Or a ribbon for your hair  
Such a long long time to be gone  
And a short time to be there
