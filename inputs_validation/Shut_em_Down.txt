I can shut a nigga down so quick my sounds so sick  
My talents spread around while Im holdin my dick  
My dingling shit flip emaculate  
Evolutionary flows yall want more dough  
Make wit the best get the best all the rest hit em less  
Rip a nigga from the East to the West  
Just a lyrical maze lyrical days  
God works in mysterious ways  
Im the warlord of war relieve the raw dog  
Niggas aint even comin close to my low score  
Niggas fleein when Im rippin on the hard core beat  
Thats slammin through your jeep like a 44 Mack to your back  
Nigga L never got rip by a track  
I dont fuck around always come back  
For the lyrical miracle day one platinum plaque right off the back  
Looked at every nigga wit the mic on my arm  
A timebomb blowin up ring the alarm  
Cool double O flow well to the LL  
Im leave the world looking hard as hell  
  
I shut em down  
Get off me You cant hold me  
I shut em down  
Get off me You cant hold me  
I shut em down  
Get off me You cant hold me  
I shut em down  
Get off me You cant hold me  
I shut em down  
Get off me You cant hold me  
I shut em down  
Get off me You cant hold me  
I shut em down  
Get off me You cant hold me  
I shut em down  
Get off me You cant hold me  
  
To the next plateau niggas bet my flow  
Betta bet I role wit more control  
Gotta bring the heat that eliminate who cant compete  
Spit razors to rip the beat  
Relentless endless friendless when it comes to the lyrical mack  
Now off my back stack em drag em now feds waggin  
Hear you fassen place on the blood of my veins without passion  
Mashin take a little time to think the rhyme out  
How to find out  
Bump and grind out  
Pump the lines out  
Ima show what the microphone is all about without doubt  
See to the double O bounce in the bubble eye limo  
No I aint checkin for you bull shit demo  
Every time you hear me in a battle Im lethal  
Nigga too sweet n low you aint equal  
  
I shut em down  
I shut em down  
I shut em down  
I shut em down  
I shut em down  
I shut em down  
I shut em down  
I shut em down Get off me You cant hold me  
  
I can take you to the level if I let my phantom  
Nigga bout to rule the world wit one anthem  
Kidnapped rap for a handsome ransom  
Smoke a little Branson on the side of the mansion  
Keep it thugged out even when a nigga dancing  
Branson make that trans and keep it dancing  
Ima murder every nigga in the game  
Cant stand the rain  
Fuck a maintain  
Gotta leave the world in flames  
Nigga want to live life stay out of my lanes  
Tryin to read my name  
Heres a murderous combo wit you on your pain  
Sideways stimulator bringin the flames  
Niggas want to feel me spit the whole clips  
Sing along it will split your lip  
45 wit an name on the grip  
Niggas said you want to battle  
Nigga now talk shit  
  
I shut em down  
Get off me You cant hold me
