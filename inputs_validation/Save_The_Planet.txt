The man cross the street he dont move a muscle  
Though hes all covered in dust  
When constitutions of granite cant save the planet  
Whats to become of us  
With a painted restraint I dont move a muscle  
Though a turbine roars  
If the bathwaters clear and my ears underwater  
Its a tolerant hum from the core  
  
Sleeps beckoning from the depths  
From the cracks and from the crevices  
Join the army of ghosts  
The murmurs in the mist  
  
Thats when the powers of observation  
Come to the periphery town  
And we carry their water  
We dont make a sound  
And after gaining our resignation  
They come through the chainlink fence  
Your only enemys panic  
Your only chance is to start making sense  
  
Sleep plunging into deeper debt  
Into bunkers and black minarets  
On a geyser of ink  
A morning voice faint and yet  
  
And it sounds heroincredible  
Sound that makes the headphones edible  
Awake affiliated and indelible  
  
The man cross the street dont move a muscle  
Though hes all covered in dust  
Says constitutions of granite cant save the planet  
Whats left to captivate us  
Whats left to captivate us  
Whats left to captivate us  
Whats to become of us
