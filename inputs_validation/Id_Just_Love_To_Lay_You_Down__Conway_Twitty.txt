Theres a lot of ways of saying what I want to say to you  
Theres songs and poems and promises and dreams that might come true  
But I wont talk of starry skies or moonlight on the ground  
Ill come right out and tell you Id just love to lay you down  
  
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear  
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear  
Ill let you know how much it means just having you around  
Oh darlin how Id love to lay you down  
  
Theres so many ways your sweet love made this house into a home  
Youve got a way of doing little things that turn me on  
Like standing in the kitchen in your faded cotton gown  
With your hair up in curlers Id still love to lay you down  
  
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear  
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear  
Ill let you know how much it means just having you around  
Oh darlin how Id love to lay you down  
  
When a whole lot of Decembers are showin in your face  
Your auburn hair has faded and silver takes its place  
Youll be just as lovely and Ill still be around  
And if I can I know that Id still love to lay you down  
  
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear  
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear  
Ill let you know how much it means just having you around  
Oh darlin how Id love to lay you down  
  
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear  
Lay you down and tell you all the things my woman loves to hear  
Ill let you know how much it means just having you around  
Oh darlin how Id love to lay you down  
  
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear  
Lay you down and tell you all the things my woman loves to hear  
Ill let you know how much it means just having you around
