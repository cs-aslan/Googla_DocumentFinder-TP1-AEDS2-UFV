In eighteen hundred and fortyone  
The corduroy breeches I put on  
Me corduroy breeches I put on  
To work upon the railway the railway  
Im weary of the railway  
Poor Paddy works on the railway  
  
In eighteen hundred and fortytwo  
From Hartlepool I moved to Crewe  
Found myself a job to do  
A working on the railway  
  
I was wearing corduroy breeches  
Digging ditches pulling switches  
Dodging pitches as I was  
Working on the railway  
  
In eighteen hundred and fortythree  
I broke the shovel across me knee  
I went to work for the company  
On the Leeds to Selby railway  
I was wearing corduroy breeches  
Digging ditches pulling switches  
Dodging pitches as I was  
Working on the railway  
  
In eighteen hundred and fortyfour  
I landed on the Liverpool shore  
My belly was empty me hands were raw  
With working on the railway the railway  
Im sick to my guts of the railway  
Poor Paddy works on the railway  
  
In eighteen hundred and fortyfive  
When Daniel OConnell he was alive  
When Daniel OConnell he was alive  
And working on the railway  
  
I was wearing corduroy breeches  
Digging ditches pulling switches  
Dodging pitches as I was  
Working on the railway  
  
In eighteen hundred and fortysix  
I changed my trade to carrying bricks  
I changed my trade to carrying bricks  
To work upon the railway  
  
I was wearing corduroy breeches  
Digging ditches pulling switches  
Dodging pitches as I was  
Working on the railway  
  
In eighteen hundred and fortyseven  
Poor Paddy was thinking of going to heaven  
The old bugger was thinking of going to heaven  
To work upon the railway the railway  
Im sick to my death of the railway  
Poor paddy works on the railway  
  
I was wearing corduroy breeches  
Digging ditches pulling switches  
Dodging pitches as I was  
Working on the railway
