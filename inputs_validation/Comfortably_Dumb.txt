Im paralyzed  
Process information  
At the speed of light  
Im frozen  
In motion  
Desensitized  
Over stimulated matter  
Over mind  
Knowing I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
I must confess  
Highly educated  
In my ignorance  
Not stupid  
Still lucid  
Indifferent  
Watching a world  
Amuse itself to death  
Im muted  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
What When  
Why Where  
How come  
Who cares  
Knock knock  
Whos there  
No one  
How come  
Who cares  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
Take me away  
So far away  
So far away  
Wont somebody  
Take me away  
Take  
Take it all away
