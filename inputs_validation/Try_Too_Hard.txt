You follow every line you wear your perfect patch and style  
But youre like a satellite and youre driftin through the sky  
You cant make up your mind about this or that or anything at all  
So you go with the flow and hope to God that no one knows it  
  
PreChorus  
Everything you are everything you say  
Everything you do is not for you  
Everything you feel everything you know  
You found it on your favorite tv show  
  
Chorus  
And its people like you that make me sick  
Im surrounded by you everywhere I look  
  
Verse 2  
Youre telling everyone how different that you really are  
But its been said before so maybe youre not special after all  
If you put the same amount of effort into letting go  
Just act yourself and you might like it you never know  
  
PreChorus  
Cause everything you want everything you do  
You try so hard to be everyone but you  
Everywhere you turn you just gotta learn  
Its easier if you dont try so hard  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
And its people like you that me me sick  
Im surrounded by you everywhere I look  
Is there somewhere I can go to get away  
Where theres truth and people mean just what they say  
  
Bridge  
You try too hard  
You just try too hard  
You try too hard  
  
Chorus  
And its people like us that make me sick  
Im surrounded by it everywhere I look  
Is there somewhere we can go to get away  
Where theres truth and people mean just what they say  
  
Bridge  
You try too hard  
You just try too hard
