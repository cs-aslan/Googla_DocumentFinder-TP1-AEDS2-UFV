I was counting on you  
To stand by me  
To see me through  
I was counting on you  
  
They moved the moon  
While I looked down  
When I looked away  
They changed the stars around  
  
Im so confused  
Dont know what to do  
Dont know which way to turn  
I was counting on you  
  
They moved the moon  
While I looked down  
When I looked away  
They changed the stars around  
  
Cant you see me  
Cant you hear me now  
Dont you want a love thats true  
Dont you know my heart belongs to you  
  
I was counting on you  
To stand by me  
To see me through  
I was counting on you  
  
They moved the moon  
While I looked down  
When I looked away  
They changed the stars around  
  
They moved the moon  
I feel so strange  
While I looked down  
Everything I depended on  
When I looked away  
Has been rearranged  
They changed the stars around
