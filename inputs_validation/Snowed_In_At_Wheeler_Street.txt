Excuse me Im sorry to bother you but dont I know you  
Theres just something about you Havent we met before  
Weve been in love forever  
When we got to the top of the hill we saw Rome burning  
  
I just let you walk away Ive never forgiven myself  
I saw you on the steps in Paris you were with someone else  
Couldnt you see that shouldve been me I just walked on by  
Then we met in 42 but we were on different sides  
  
I hid you under my bed but they took you away  
I lost you in a London smog as you crossed the lane  
I never know where youre gonna be next but I know that youll surprise me  
Come with me Ill find some rope and Ill tie us together  
  
Ive been waiting for you so long I dont want to lose you again  
Dont walk into the crowd again Dont walk away again  
I dont want to lose you  
I dont want to lose you  
  
I dont want to lose you again  
Theres just something about you  
Have we been in love forever  
911 in New York I took your photograph  
  
I still have your smiling face  
In a heartshaped frame  
Snowed in at Wheeler street just two old flames keeping the fire going  
We look so good together  
  
Cant we just stay there forever We were so happy  
Id live that day over and over but the world wont stop turning  
When we got to the top of the hill we saw Rome burning  
I dont want to lose you I dont want to lose you again  
  
Dont walk away again Dont leave me lost again  
I dont want to lose you  
I dont want to lose you  
I dont want to lose you again  
  
I dont want to lose you  
I dont want to lose you  
I dont want to lose you again  
Oh no not again  
  
Not again
