Excuse me sir do I have your attention  
Theres something if you dont mind Id like to mention  
So open those ears sit your butt down and shut your mouth up  
Im aware that its hard for you to do that  
All I ask is lay down put your feet up  
Now soak in pay attention learn a lesson loud and clear  
  
Chorus  
Hey youre a dirty liar  
You wronged me out for something I thought was right  
I wanted to be left alone  
Not shown around like your golden prize  
Oh I looked around  
Look what happened you found out  
You never satisfy me  
  
Never trusted anyone in the first place  
You turned me up your disgusting anyway  
Hear that music crank it up  
Is there something familiar in the singers voice  
Turn it down now listen to me  
What made you think you were my authority  
Im awake finally now Im able to move on just gotta tell the truth  
  
Chorus  
  
Now do these words stick to you hope they do  
Think about it think about it  
Stick to you like superglue keep you from the things you do  
  
Guitar solo  
  
Chorus 2x
