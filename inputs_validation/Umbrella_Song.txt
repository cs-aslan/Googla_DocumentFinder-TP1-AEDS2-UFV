On the poor side of town lives a girl no one knows  
With her worn out shoes and her ragged clothes  
Her mother tries to provide since her father has died  
But no one even cares if shes alive  
  
And when the rain comes down  
Shes never getting wet  
And though the skies are gray  
Shell still be smiling yet  
  
Cause in her eyes theres no teardrops  
In her heart theres no pain  
Shes got her love as an umbrella from the rain  
Oh what love is an umbrella from the rain  
  
On the rich side of town lives a boy no one knows  
With his shiny shoes and his fancy clothes  
Hes got everything he needs if he wants to succeed  
But no one even cares if hes alive  
  
And when the rain comes down  
Hes never getting wet  
And though the skies are gray  
Hell still be smiling yet  
  
Cause in his eyes theres no teardrops  
In his heart theres no pain  
Hes got his love as an umbrella from the rain  
Oh his love is an umbrella from the rain  
  
Isnt life feeling strange and money cant buy  
All you need to get by  
All around the world there are folks no one knows  
If theyre worn out shoes their fancy clothes  
Will they find more there to give for and open the door  
To know that someone cares if theyre alive  
  
And when the rain comes down  
Were never getting wet  
And though the skies are gray  
Well still be smiling yet  
  
Cause in our eyes theres no teardrops  
In our hearts theres no pain  
Weve got a love as an umbrella from the rain  
Oh our love is an umbrella from the rain  
  
And when the rain comes down  
Were never getting wet  
And though the skies are gray  
Well still be smiling yet
