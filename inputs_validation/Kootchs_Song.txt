She is frenzied to the point of pain  
She is counting up her list again  
She wont satisfy another man  
You understand  
You cant cross the boundary beyond  
Which she stands  
  
Hes disposed of all his inner mind  
Donned his mask and left the world behind  
He has cancelled all the checks he signed  
So why be kind this time  
You cant see the picture of you in his hand  
  
Now theyve thrown out all the undesired  
Morbid dreams behind a gay attire  
They wont talk about the morning fire  
So why aspire  
You dont want to be what they think is a man
