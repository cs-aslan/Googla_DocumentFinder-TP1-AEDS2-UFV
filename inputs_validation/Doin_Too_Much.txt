I gave my kinfolk the keys to my Suburb  
I told em Hit the side and slide and get the herb  
But guess whos calling Pipedream Patty  
Made that nigga park my who ride beside the alley  
Forget about that nigga though fuck that nigga  
Fuck that nigga yo  
But I cant forget about him cause he taught me everything I know  
Oh no Joe walking down the wrong lane  
Tooting on that cocaine fucking wit that wrong thing  
Niggas like that what get things like they want it damn  
Then fake the funk doggonnit  
Now loc look at this predicament  
You smoked out and cant be trusted I cant kick it wit  
Niggas like you used to be in my crew  
Goddamn they dont make niggas like they used to  
I remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew  
Thats probably why I keep a tight grip on my deucedeuce  
  
Now if youre doing for your family and you cant stand it  
Cause you know these motherfuckers trying take advantage  
Say they doing too much yeah nigga you doing too much  
And if your kinfolk broke and he smoke dope  
And he need to catch a motherfucking different stroke  
Say he doing too much yeah Joey you doing too much  
  
We parlay parlay everyday DPG style  
We might throw a pool party every once in a while  
Now in fact we gon do one this weekend  
Lets see how many hoes me and my nigga Rose can weed in  
I believe in sharing the cock  
Also I believe in comparing the cock  
Look dont knock a nigga like me why  
Cause she love the way I just beat up the pussy  
Not just knee deep she was totally deep  
When she went down on me  
She blew a nigga socks off got a nigga rocks off  
Oh wee baby yous a freak  
Put my homey up on game like a gangsta  
But my homey fell in love and he banked her  
Aint that a trip Now we in a twist  
Back in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist  
  
Now when a nigga hit his girl and she dont hit back  
And he get his third strike wit no get back  
Say he doing too much yeah homey you doing too much  
And when the homey in the pen doing a sin  
And his girlfriend fucking wit his best friend  
Say she doing too much hell yeah she doing too much  
  
Im living up in the hills wine sipping wit mills  
Im having major type of paper I aint tripping off bills still  
Show me some respect and accept my coolness  
And dont mistake my kindness to mean Im foolish  
Use this as a warning cause Im starting  
To figure its some niggas think Im soft as Charmin  
Pardon me cause I aint mad when you get bent  
But I hate when fools mistake me for US spray  
Friends and family getting after me like repo  
Eat smoke choke then want me to throw em a cnote  
You doing too much when you clutching on my touchtone  
Calling strays over nigga leading months gone  
Conversate for fo hours wasting mo power  
And only get to hit a cold shower  
You faking like youre making more moves than Simpson  
But fronting pushing buttons doing nothing but sin  
  
And when a nigga on yo phone running up yo bill  
Trying to tell some hoodrat bitch how he feel  
You know he doing too much yeah nigga you doing too much  
And when your baby momma crying bout she need some milk  
And you heard some other nigga did been at her tilt  
You know she doing too much yeah baby you doing too much  
Thats real
