So there you are youre sittin there just kinda chillin  
A richie boy you look a little bit like Dylan  
The 90210 bitch with the funny hair  
So Im gonna change a few things around here and there  
Start with your eyes I pluck em both out your head  
And pull your balls out your sack and stick em there instead  
Then I snap off your toes and stick em in your nose  
And pull the hair out your head until your skull shows  
Youre almost ready gotta fix you for the show tonight  
But your lips man to me they just dont look right  
They could be a little fatter even more  
So fuckin fat that your lip is draggin on the floor  
Tie your tongue into a knot and stretch it out  
And tack a sign on it tellin what youre all about  
Set you up cause now youre ready so open up the door  
cause at the House of Wonders youre the freak show  
  
Chorus x2  
Carnival thrills  
Carnival shows  
Carnival excites you  
Carnival kills  
Ah oh ah oh  
Another freak show for the juggaluggalo  
  
So there you are come on in chickie wow Aint you a pretty  
I think Ill start with the silicone thats in your titty  
Ill pull it out and put it in your forehead and cheek  
So now you look like the elephant bitch freak  
Dont try to run chickiepoo Im just gettin started  
Ill beat your head in with a brick until youre halfretarded  
Remember that ugly girl you laughed at at the prom  
Dont try to laugh now bitch you look like her mom  
You came to do the starin but its you theyre starin at  
Ill stuff you full of chilicheese dogs to make you fat  
Then Ill stretch your fuckin lips and stick em in your ear  
So all that evil shit you talk only you can hear  
I shave you bald and glue your titty on the top  
And then I spit on your nipple until you drop  
Hey Almost ready Jump steady open the door  
Cause at the House of Wonders youre the freak show  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Oh oh oh my God Repeat x2
