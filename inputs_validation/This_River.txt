Oh this river oh this river runs  
Cant take my heart away from you  
You are in my soul  
Cant tame this love I feel for you  
Cant escape what is meant to be  
Its endless as the heavens  
Its timeless and its strong  
Its faithful as an angel  
Its right there right or wrong  
Theres no end to this emotion  
It goes on and on  
  
Chorus  
This river runs this river runs so true  
This river runs this river runs to you  
This rivers deep as the ocean  
Runs on blind emotion  
This river runs oh yeah  
  
Youre every beat within my heart  
You are in my blood  
Nothing could keep me from your arms  
Where you are is where Ill always be  
As long as there are mountains  
And stars still fill the sky  
As long as theres forever  
Im right here by your side  
Theres no end to this emotion  
Till the end of time  
  
Chorus  
  
This river runs oh so deep within my soul  
And it flows forever  
And for the rest of all time  
Always be there  
  
Chorus
