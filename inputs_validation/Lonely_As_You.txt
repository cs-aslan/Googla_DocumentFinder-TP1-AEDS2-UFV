What would I do  
Lonely as you  
Pleasure or pain I can choose  
What would I do  
Lonely as you  
  
Pleasure or pain I can choose  
  
Wake up your dream and I cant stand your screamin  
Drowning out these prayers just some words without meanin  
Spare all the preachin my secrets worth keepin  
No one understands like I do  
  
Keep out of reach Im your leadin deletion  
Hide behind these masks  
Though they still see right through them  
Every now and then  
Youre down and out my friend  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
  
Blame it on you thought these years Ive been losin  
Blame it on the past its the last place I knew you  
Blame all the children their rage and their ruin  
Blame it on the black and the blue  
Every now and then  
Youre down and out my friend  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
Im down with you  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
  
Every now and then  
Youre down and out my friend  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
But Im done with you  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the very last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
All Right
