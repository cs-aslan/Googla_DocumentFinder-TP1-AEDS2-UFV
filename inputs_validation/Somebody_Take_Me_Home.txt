Same ol bedroom floor  
Same ol empty sheets  
I hate this haunted bed  
So down heres where I sleep  
  
Tryin to find a place  
To hide what you have left  
Some things never change  
My heart hasnt yet  
  
Well I dont wanna go out tonight  
Yeah but I cant be alone  
Standing underneath this broke streetlight  
Cant somebody take me home  
Cant somebody take me home  
  
The hope that we had left  
Wrapped around your ring  
That river just rolled on by  
When I watched it sink  
  
Well I dont wanna go out tonight  
Yeah but I cant be alone  
Standing underneath this broke streetlight  
Cant somebody take me home  
Cant somebody take me  
  
Out of this bar  
Out of this heartache  
Out of this town  
That just keeps breakin down  
Keeps breakin down  
  
Well I dont wanna go out tonight  
Yeah but I cant be alone  
Standing underneath this broke streetlight  
Cant somebody take me home  
  
I dont wanna go out tonight  
Yeah but I cant be alone  
Standing underneath this broke streetlight  
Cant somebody take me home  
Cant somebody take me home  
Wont you take me home
