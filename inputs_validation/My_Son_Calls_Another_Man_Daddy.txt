Tonight my head is bowed in sorrow  
I cant keep the tears from my eyes  
My son calls another man daddy  
The right to his love Ive been denied  
  
My son calls another man daddy  
Hell neer know my name nor my face  
God only knows how it hurts me  
For another to be in my place  
  
Each night I laid there in prison  
I pictured a future so bright  
For he was the one ray of sunshine  
That shone through the darkest of nights  
  
My son calls another man daddy  
Hell neer know my name nor my face  
God only knows how it hurts me  
For another to be in my place  
  
Today his mother shares a new love  
She just couldnt stand my disgrace  
My son calls another man daddy  
And longs for the love he cant replace  
  
My son calls another man daddy  
Hell neer know my name nor my face  
God only knows how it hurts me  
For another to be in my place  
  
My son calls another man daddy  
Hell neer know my name nor my face  
God only knows how it hurts me  
For another to be in my place
