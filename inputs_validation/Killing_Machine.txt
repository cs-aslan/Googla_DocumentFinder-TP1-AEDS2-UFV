I never give no answers I never tell no lies  
I never walk a straight line so I never get surprised  
I dont ask no favors so I wont get abused  
I learned to win when I was young  
So Im never ever gonna lose  
  
They pay me the money and Ill do the job  
I got a contract on you  
I got a contract on you  
  
I never ask no questions I never speak my mind  
I always found that silence helps to keep me and my kind alive  
I take care of business It takes care of me  
I look after myself and do it well  
cause somebodys always looking for me  
  
They pay me the money and Ill do the job  
I got a contract on you  
I got a contract on you  
  
What manner of man am I  
A gun lump sum and then I move on  
What manner of man are you  
Stab a friends back to jump a queue  
  
I do what I do cause I cant do nothing better  
You do what you do just defendin yourself  
  
cause you aint got nothin better to do  
  
I got no place no name Im just a killing machine  
I kept the population down if you know what I mean  
I never stop in one place I move about the cities  
Got expensive tastes but I hasten to add that  
Im the best that there is  
  
They pay me the money and Ill do the job  
I got a contract on you  
I got a contract on you  
  
I got a contract on you  
I got a contract on you
