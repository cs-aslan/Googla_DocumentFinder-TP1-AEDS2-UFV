Some folks say theres a price on love  
Watch your freedom go watch your freedom go  
Just cant breathe with your head in the glove  
Watch your freedom go baby I dont know  
But how can they mean it  
How come they give it up  
How long until they see  
The modern laws of lovin dont apply to me  
  
Twenty Four Seven stay here with me  
Twenty Four Seven throw away the key  
Twenty Four Seven I dont want to be free  
  
You get by if you kiss and tell  
Hear the people say hear the people say  
Two strong hearts gotta share one cell  
Hear the people say but it aint my way  
How can they mean it  
How come they add it up  
Ill give my heart and my soul  
If loving you is prison I dont need parol  
  
Twenty four seven stay here with me  
Twenty four seven throw away the key  
Twenty four seven I dont want to be free free free  
Twenty four seven around the clock  
Twenty four seven I never want it to stop  
Twenty four seven mm here with me  
  
Im gonna count the time  
That youre gonna be mine  
Seven days a week  
Twenty four hours aint enough for me  
  
How can they mean it  
How come they add it up  
Im gonna give my heart and my soul  
If loving you is prison I dont need parol  
  
Twenty four seven stay here with me  
Twenty four seven throw away the key  
Twenty four seven I dont want to be free free free  
Twenty four seven stay here with me with me  
Twenty four seven throw away the key the key  
Twenty four seven I want to twenty four seven with you you you you you  
Twenty four seven nonstop love  
Twenty four seven  
Twenty four seven  
I want you twenty four seven
