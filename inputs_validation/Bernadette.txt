I dont want to leave Bernadette  
But I dont want to live with the jet set  
I dont want to leave with you payin all my debts  
With that alimony palimony whatever it is you get  
  
Ooh Bernadette you are so expensive  
Youve never done a days work in your life  
Youve got no incentive  
Youve made a career out of punting off all of the men youve slept with  
Ooh Bernadette you are so expensive  
  
I cant get a job Bernadette  
So all that I can offer are a lot of bad debts  
If you marry me Bernadette  
Youll lose the alimony palimony whatever it is you get  
  
Ooh Bernadette you are so expensive  
Youve never done a days work in your life  
Youve got no incentive  
Youve made a career out of punting off all of the men youve slept with  
Ooh Bernadette you are so expensive  
Ooh Bernadette Bernadette  
Ooh Bernadette Bernadette  
  
Bernadettes got a house in the country  
Shes really got it made  
Her lawyers made her filthy rich  
Shes got all expenses paid  
  
Maybe a famous rock star will fly you away  
Then youll eat him all up  
And spit him out  
With a dash of Perrier  
  
And when youve had enough  
Youll throw him away  
And take him for all you can get  
Yeah you like it dont you Bernadette  
  
I dont want to leave Bernadette  
But I want to keep a little bit of self respect  
I dont want to leave with you paying all my debts  
With that alimony palimony whatever it is you get  
Ooh Bernadette you are so expensive  
Youve never done a days work in your life  
Youve got no incentive  
Women like you oughta be locked up
