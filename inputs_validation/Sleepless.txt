In the dream I fall into the sleepless sea  
With a swell of panic and pain  
My veins are aching for the distant reef  
In the crush of emotional waves  
  
Alright get a hold of yourself  
An dont fight it its over your head  
Its alright the rumble in your ears  
Its alright to feel a little fear  
An dont fight it its over your head  
Its alright you wake up in your bed  
  
Silhouettes like shivering ancient feelings  
They cover my foreign floors and walls  
Submarines are lurking in my foggy ceiling  
They keep me sleepless at night  
  
Hey can you picture the sight  
The figures on the beach in the searing night  
And the roaring hurt of my silent fight  
Can you pull me out  
Of this sleepless night  
Can you pull me out
