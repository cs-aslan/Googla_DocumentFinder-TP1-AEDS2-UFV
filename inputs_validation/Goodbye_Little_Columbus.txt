The plane is waiting you must to go  
Goodbye Im gonna miss you  
And all the things you say at a leaving  
Ah just turn your head and walk away  
  
Goodbye little Columbus  
Goodbye Ill see you one day  
Goodbye little Columbus  
Travelling just travelling  
  
That certain moment the final call  
And that desperate search for Cest la vie  
Oh what youd give to hear of a slight delay  
Ah just turn your head and walk away  
Walk away just walk away  
  
Goodbye little Columbus  
Goodbye Ill see you one day  
Goodbye little Columbus  
Travelling just travelling  
Youve made up your mind  
And youve got to go
