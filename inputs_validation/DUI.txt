Lets get drunk and go out driving  
Lets see just how quickly we can go  
Lets plowed and plow down some old lady  
Lets go drink off the stereo  
Lets go down and vomit out the window  
Lets keep score of how many weve killed  
Two tequila slammers off the dashboard  
Theres an alcoholic at the wheel  
Careful when Im taking this next corner  
Dont want anybody wasting beer  
Pass another lime and Corona  
Too drunk to use my butt for shifting gears  
Lets get drunk and go out driving  
Lets do donuts in the culdesac  
Lets get drunk and go out driving  
Whirling and were never coming back  
Whirling and were never coming back  
Whirling and were never coming back
