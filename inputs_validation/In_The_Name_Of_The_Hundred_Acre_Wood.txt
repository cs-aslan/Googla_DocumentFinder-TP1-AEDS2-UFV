In the name of the hundred acre wood  
We claim thee  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
We claim thee  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
  
Whatll do  
When something new crosses your path  
Out of the blue  
Whatll ya do  
What do you do  
  
I think once upon a time  
Heffalumps ruled the forest  
They rocked and stomped and blew their horns  
To their new and dearest  
They scared all the rest of us  
The Heffalump is as a Heffalump does  
As a heffalump now is a heffalump was  
  
Whatll do  
When something new crosses your path  
Out of the blue  
Whatll do whatll do whatll do  
What do you do  
  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
We claim thee  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
We claim thee  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
  
Whatll do whatll do whatll do
