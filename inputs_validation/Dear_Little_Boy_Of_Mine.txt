Boy of mine boy of mine dear little boy of mine  
Boy of mine boy of mine although my heart was aching  
I seem to know that youd want to go  
Pride in your manhood waking  
  
Ill be here waiting dear  
Till at the glad dawn breaking  
Ill hear you say youre home to stay  
Dear little boy of mine mine dear little boy of mine boy of mine  
  
Boy of mine boy of mine although my heart was breaking  
Ill hear you say youre home to stay  
Dear little boy of minemine dear little boy of mine  
dear little boy of mine
