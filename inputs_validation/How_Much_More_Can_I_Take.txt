Youre breakin my heart  
Stealing my thunder  
How much more can i take  
Youre draggin me down  
Holding me under  
How much more can i take  
  
How much more can i take  
Wont somebody break  
The news to you gently  
You fill my eyes  
But you dont fill the hunger  
How much more can i take  
  
I see your face  
Everywhere everyplace  
How much more can i take  
Youre here in the night  
Youre here in the morning sunlight  
How much more can i take  
  
How much more can i take  
I wish that i could make your mind up for you  
You fill my eyes  
But you dont fill the hunger  
How much more can i take  
  
How much more can i take  
Wont somebody help me  
Im naked as the day i was born  
These clothes have a way  
Of changin what im feelin  
I try and i try but i cant put em on  
  
I sit here alone  
Wait by the telephone line  
How much more can i take  
Im jealous as hell  
Mixed up n mean as well  
How much more can i take  
  
How much more can i take  
I know shed like to break  
Those stones over my body  
You fill my eyes  
But you dont fill the hunger  
How much more can i take
