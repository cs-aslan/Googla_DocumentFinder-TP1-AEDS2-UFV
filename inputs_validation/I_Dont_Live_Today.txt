Will I live tomorrow  
Well I just cant say  
Will I live tomorrow  
Well I just cant say  
But I know for sure  
I dont live today  
  
No sun comin through my windows  
Feel like Im livin at the bottom of a grave  
No sun comin through my windows  
Feel like Im livin at the bottom of a grave  
  
I wish youd hurry up and execute me  
So I can be on my miserable way  
  
I dont live today  
Maybe tomorrow I just can say  
But a I dont live today  
Its such a shame to waste your time away like this  
  
Well  
I dont live today  
Maybe tomorrow I just cant tell you baby  
But a I dont live today  
Its such a shame spending the time away like this  
  
Yeah  
  
There aint no life no where
