I cant stop you  
So go your way  
If that makes you happy  
Ive nothing to say  
  
But nothing goes up  
No nothing goes up  
Without coming down  
  
Im hurting now  
Cause youre leaving  
But I know that someday  
I wont be grieving  
  
Cause nothing goes up  
No nothing goes up  
Without coming down  
  
So darling please think  
Before you leap  
Remember what you sow  
So shall you reap  
  
Please be careful  
In all you do  
Whats happening to me  
Could happen to you  
  
Cause nothing goes up  
No nothing goes up  
Without coming right on down
