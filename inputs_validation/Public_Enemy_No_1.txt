Public enemy number one  
Jail break and a smoking gun  
You wont believe the things Ive done  
And the killing was just for fun  
  
Public enemy number one  
A stolen car and Im on the run  
Through the night through the rising sun  
And the trouble has just begun  
  
Roses on your grave  
Ill be on my way  
Theres no time to stay  
With the enemies Ive made  
  
Im invincible  
You might say despicable  
Punishments reciprocal  
Public enemy number one  
  
Im unbeatable  
My mind is untreatable  
Crimes unrepeatable  
Public enemy number one  
  
Public enemy number one  
Watch the authorities come undone  
With every standoff that Ive won  
Flirting death just for fun  
  
Public enemy number one  
Born a fugitives fathers son  
Another heist of a bank is done  
And the trouble has just begun  
  
Roses on your grave  
Ill be on my way  
Theres no time to stay  
With the enemies Ive made  
  
Im invincible  
You might say despicable  
Punishments reciprocal  
Public enemy number one  
  
Im unbeatable  
My minds untreatable  
Crimes unrepeatable  
Public enemy number one  
  
They say that Im wanted  
For all those dead  
But everyone whos tried  
Got a bullet to their head  
  
Im invincible  
You might say despicable  
Punishments reciprocal  
Public enemy number one  
  
Im unbeatable  
My minds untreatable  
Crimes unrepeatable  
Public enemy number one  
  
Public enemy  
Public enemy  
Public enemy
