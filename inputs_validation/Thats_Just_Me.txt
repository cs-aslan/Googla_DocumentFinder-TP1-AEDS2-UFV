Well I was southern born and raised on the Good Book  
My old boots are worn from the hard roads I took  
And Im proud to be my daddys son  
And momma taught me how to work and not to quit  
Until the jobs done  
Well I may not be high society but I got all I need  
And thats just me  
The only way I know to be  
Thats just me  
What you get is what you see  
  
Well they tell me Im old fashioned  
And that Im part of a dying breed  
Id say Im living in real good company  
But thats just me  
  
Well I got me a wife and were bringing up a young one  
Well shes a backwoods woman and my boy hes a top gun  
We live out in the country where were free to roam  
And when a hard day is over how I love just going home  
Well its the life I live and the air I breathe  
  
The way I believe  
  
And thats just me  
The only way I know to be  
Thats just me  
What you get is what you see  
  
Well they tell me Im old fashioned  
And that Im part of a dying breed  
Id say Im living in real good company  
But thats just me  
  
Yeah they tell me Im old fashioned  
And that Im part of a dying breed  
Id say Im living in real good company  
But thats just me
