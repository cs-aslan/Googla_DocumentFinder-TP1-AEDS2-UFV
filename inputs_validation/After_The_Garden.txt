Wont need no shadow man  
Runnin the government  
Wont need no stinkin WAR  
Wont need no haircut  
Wont need no shoe shine  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone  
  
What will people do  
After the garden is gone  
What will people say  
After the garden  
  
Wont need no strong man  
Walkin through the night  
To live a weak mans day  
Wont need no purple haze  
Wont need no sunshine  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone  
  
Where will the people go  
After the garden is gone  
What will people know  
After the garden  
  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone
