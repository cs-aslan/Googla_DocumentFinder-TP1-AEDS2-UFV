Give me all your tears  
Let me turn them into pearls  
Let me turn all the tears  
That youve cried into pearls  
Hand them to me Im gonna keep  
  
Keep them for you  
I want to hold you  
I want to kiss you  
I want to mend what is broken  
  
Love me the way that you loved her please  
Cause now Im giving it all  
And so Ive made up my mind Im gonna be  
Yours this time Im gonna give what Ive got  
And get your love in return  
And so Ive made up my mind Im gonna be  
Yours this time Im gonna teach you to trust  
And learn how to burn  
Experience pearls  
Pearls of experience  
When sand strikes up in your eyes  
I will cover your face  
  
Ill plant your desert with roses  
And Im gonna keep keep them for you  
And so Ive made up my mind  
  
Ill wear your pearls more precious than silver  
Ill wear your pearls so close to my skin  
Id tear myself apart just to get you  
And so Ive made up my mind  
  
And so Ive made up my mind
