Verse 1  
Oh no you broke a heart again  
Now I cant help but feel foolish and ashamed  
I am a broken record a glitch in your iPod  
But could it be an empty track a lost melody  
  
PreChorus  
Baby just burn well see  
I dont need you to believe in  
Ive got a new faith in me youll see  
  
Chorus  
You broke my heart and now this is my arena and Im sold out  
You tried to kick me down but youre hearing this now when your heart is
beating  
See Im doing fine better than fine  
And now I see that your melody was lost on me  
  
Verse 2  
Oh no I let you fool me once  
Shame on you fool me twice shame on me  
Am I a scratched CD A glitch in your download  
But could it be an empty track a lost melody  
  
PreChorus  
Baby just burn well see  
I dont need you to believe in  
Ive got a new faith in me youll see  
  
Chorus  
You broke my heart and now this is my arena and Im sold out  
You tried to kick me down but youre hearing this now when your heart is
beating  
See Im doing fine better than fine  
And now I see that your melody was lost on me  
  
Bridge  
Oh baby just burn well see  
I dont need you to believe in  
Ive got a new faith in me youll see yeah  
  
Chorus  
You broke my heart and now this is my arena and Im sold out Im doing fine
without you  
You tried to kick me down but youre hearing this now when your heart is
beating Im doing fine without you  
See Im doing fine better than fine  
And now I see that your melody was lost on me
