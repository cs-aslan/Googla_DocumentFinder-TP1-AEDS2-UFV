Well I have walked loves winding pathway  
Seeking to find loves treasures untold  
And just when I reached the end of my journey  
Id find that I have three last steps to go  
  
The first step was heartache I took when you cheated  
The next step was heartbreak he held you so near  
The last step Im taking now that you love another  
Because you lie I cry these eternal tears  
  
My fortune to love like rain from above  
I never know eternaly I love you so  
  
My journey is over now and I realized  
These eternal tears forever Ill cry  
  
My fortune to love like rain from above  
I never know eternaly I love you so  
  
My journey is over now and I realized  
These eternal tears forever Ill cry  
  
My journey is over now and I realized  
These eternal tears forever Ill cry
