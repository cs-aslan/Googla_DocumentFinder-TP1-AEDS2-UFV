Stop right there  
Let me picture you in my mind for the last time  
Soon youll be walking out of my life  
Let me gaze upon you for the last time  
  
I need something to hold on to  
Something to carry me through  
All I need is one last look before you go  
So Ill have memories where ever I go  
One last look before youre gone  
So in my heart youll live on and on  
  
Just one last look before we part  
So memories of you will fill my heart  
Let me remember my whole life through  
Cause my happiest days Ive spent with you  
  
I remember your eyes that was my treasure  
Your tender lips that brought me pleasure  
Oh loving you I dont regret  
And all these things I dont want to forget  
  
How being without you will be hard to do  
But I want I want whats best for you  
I rather see you happy with someone new baby  
Than to bring bring sorrow to you  
  
As you leave  
If you see tears in my eyes just keep on walking  
Dont you worry  
  
All these tears you see are tears of joy  
The joy of loving you and knowing youd loved me  
Its given me enough happiness so true  
To last my whole life through  
  
Just one last look before you go  
Let sweet memories overflow  
So the thought of you will live on and on  
Long after after youre gone  
  
If I never see your face again  
Never feel your your embrace again  
The happiness Ive known with you  
Will stay with me baby  
My whole through  
  
Just just one last look before we part  
Just one last look to fill my heart  
Just one last look
