Never thought Id fall but now I hear love call  
Im getting sentimental over you  
Things you say and do just thrill me through and through  
Im getting sentimental over you  
  
I thought I was happy I could live without love  
Now I must admit love is all Im thinking of  
Wont you please be kind and just make up your mind  
That youll be sweet and gentle be gentle with me  
Beause Im sentimental over you
