Rodney Crowell  
When you look at me  
Like you dont know me  
And you talk to me  
Like youve never met me  
I can leave you alone if I try  
If I tried I could tell you goodbye  
If I wanted to  
I could be long gone  
And I dont have to crawl  
Then you call on me  
As if I should run to you  
You make your move  
As if I should follow you  
Well I dont have to be nobodys fool  
I wont make no exception of you  
I dont have to be nobodys fool  
I dont make no exception of you  
I dont have to crawl  
I can just walk away  
No I dont have to crawl  
I dont have to get down on my knees  
I dont have to crawl  
I can just walk away  
No I dont have to crawl
