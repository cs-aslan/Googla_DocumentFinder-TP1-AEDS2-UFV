Took a little time before were done to love me  
Took a little more than I ever did before  
Took your bad intentions  
Took all your excite  
And if I didnt mention  
Took my inhuman rights  
Its a heavyweight title bout  
The more I live the more I find out  
  
Chorus  
Damned for if I love me  
Damned for if I care  
Damned for all the make you feel betters  
As the damned scream this aint fair  
Damned for if I love me  
Damned for if I care  
Damned for all the make you feel betters  
As the damned scream this aint fair  
  
Had a little time before I went and fucked me  
Had a little trouble getting up off the floor  
Had youre Im not like that  
Had a hand up in my face  
Head bobbing like a wet rat  
No love for the human race  
The more fuel the farther I go  
The more I live the more I  
Nonono  
  
Chorus  
  
Damned if I do and damned if I dont  
Damned if I will and damned if I wont  
Damned for your screamin that this aint fair  
God damn your screamin I dont care  
  
Took a little time before you tried to fuck me  
Made a little spot for you right there on the floor  
So fuck your good intentions  
Fuck your human rights  
Fuck your finger in my face  
This time Im gonna bite  
  
Chorus
