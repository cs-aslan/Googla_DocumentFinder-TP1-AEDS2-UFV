Rising with the sun the work has been done  
But the people are starting to stare  
Called from the afar to court of the Czar  
Could it be something is wrong  
  
You stand face to face and your heart gathers place  
For the answer to a question a prize  
If only you had known to be honest was wrong  
For the work that youve done you will pay with your eyes  
  
Chorus  
Into the black where the night  
Never ends and the light  
Leaves a scar on your soul  
Where your heart used to hold  
Your love here  
Heaven in Black  
  
Inside theres a voice saying was there a choice  
Youd still be entombed in the night  
Lucifers to blame the reason for the flame  
Theyve taken your sight but theyll not take your God  
  
Chorus
