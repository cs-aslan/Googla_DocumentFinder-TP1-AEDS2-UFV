Shes like a frostfern in my head  
The lamplight burns my eyes and then she fades away  
My pencils frozen in my hand  
And the letter I cant write it seems to be a desert without end  
  
I woke up late at night  
She called me up then disappeared  
And the echo of her voice filled the empty places in my dreams  
With the silent tide  
  
She fades away  
Again  
She fades away  
She fades away again  
  
Dont go now please stay  
My senses are cruising through a void  
As pale reflections play on the deserted road  
I hear a humming of machines  
  
A distant sound like thunder  
Crawling through the cold  
Theres no escape I know  
I run around in circles without end  
  
And the more the memory grows  
Dissolving from reality  
With the silent tide  
She fades away  
  
 dont make me cry  
This time Ive got to learn  
I know she wont return
