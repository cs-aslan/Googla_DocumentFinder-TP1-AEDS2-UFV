The super fly guy that youre courtin now  
Used to be a superswot  
And the clothes he thinks look retro  
Are more Land That Time Forgot  
  
And if he knows where he was standin  
When JFK was shot  
Chances are though times passed him by  
Hes still standing within yards of that spot  
  
So if your hangover feels like the dart board  
Whilst the Christians hit bullseye  
And paranoia that selfemployer  
Is following in heavy disguise  
  
Off goes intelligence to join high tide  
To drift with all the things we let go  
Only tidal wave could possibly save  
All we let go with the flow  
  
Let go with the flow  
Books we may have written we dont know  
Let go with the flow  
Some enchanted city we wont go  
  
He who used to float like a butterfly once  
Is floatin like a glorious moth  
And the fly girls you hung around with then  
Are lucky if they even take off  
  
Dresses and skirts you thought were in  
Everyone a dustrag or dishcloth  
Like every flat beer that they serve around here  
We all start life as fabulous froth  
  
So why do you work yourself that hard  
When you dont even like the job  
Why do you hate the smalltime thief  
When its your own time youll always rob  
  
Off goes intelligence to join high tide  
To drift with all the things we let go  
Only tidal wave could possibly save  
All we let go with the flow  
  
Let go with the flow  
Books we may have written we dont know  
Let go with the flow  
Some enchanted city we wont go  
  
Let go with the flow  
Books we may have written we dont know  
Let go with the flow  
Some enchanted city we wont go
