Well the birds were talking all at once  
And the old man mowing down his lawn  
He didnt look like much too bad a guy  
And I was thinkin Hang on man somethings wrong  
Your blues seems to be gone  
Heaven aint bad but you dont get nothing done  
  
Lay down your head a while  
You are not needed now  
You are not needed now  
  
Well Allison laid a hex on me  
And every time I turn around  
Its swimming through the air above my bed  
I told Miss Higgs and she said fine  
As long as youre back in your room on time  
I keep you clean and the girls will keep you fed  
  
Lay down your head with mine  
You are not needed now  
And we got things to do  
  
Between the blankets made of wool  
The trains roll by every half an hour  
And the body can get no restin done thats true  
So I do my best as best I can  
Thinkin big and making plans  
And wondering where them trains are rolling to  
  
Lay down your head poor boy  
And feel how the ground does move  
And hear how them drivers sing  
  
Well goodbye friends its time to close  
Everybody knows thats the way it goes  
Where was it you lived in case Im ever there  
Well three doors down and two behind  
And it gets a little bit out of hand sometimes  
Dont let it fool you into thinkin you down care  
  
Lay down your head and fly  
Ill quietly pass you by  
You wont even see me go  
  
If I thought about it long enough  
I just might make some kind of move  
Watchful lies are too hard on the soul  
With the smoke house just across the way  
And its fog upon the light of day  
That would be hard comin up with where to go  
  
Lay down your head poor boy  
Feel how the ground does move  
Hear how them drivers sing  
What now my darling one  
Go find a little fun  
You are not needed now
