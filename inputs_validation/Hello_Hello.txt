Feet are feeling light  
Head on up to see the sights  
Aint life a many splendor thing  
  
Ducking up and down  
All those crazy sights and sounds  
Bounce around like puppets on a string  
  
Never gonna find anything to change my mind  
Famous last lines of a fool  
  
Just when you think  
Youre a chain with just one link  
Something comes to tip you off your stool  
  
Hello hello  
Hello hello  
My my my what have we here  
What a surprise  
What a surprise  
  
Hello Hello  
Hello Hello  
Im not alone its good to know  
Someones out there to say hello  
Hello  
  
Do a dizzy dance  
Twirl around and take a chance  
Nothings easy  
Nothing comes for free  
  
Sniffing on a flower  
Running through an autumn shower  
Bumping in to someone else like me  
  
Hello hello  
Hello hello  
My my my what have we here  
What a surprise  
What a surprise  
  
Hello Hello  
Hello Hello  
Im not alone its good to know  
Someones out there to say hello  
Hello  
  
And I could fly on the back of a bird  
I could shake all the leaves from a tree  
If theres a quest Im a knight  
Where theres wrong Ill do right  
Two is better then the one I used to be  
  
Hello hello  
Hello hello  
My my my what have we here  
What a surprise  
What a surprise  
  
Hello Hello  
Hello Hello  
Im not alone its good to know  
Someones out there to say hello  
  
Hello hello  
Hello hello  
My my my what have we here  
What a surprise  
What a surprise  
  
Hello Hello  
Hello Hello  
Im not alone its good to know  
Someones out there to say hello
