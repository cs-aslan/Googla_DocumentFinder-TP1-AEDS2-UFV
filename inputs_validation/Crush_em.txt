Enter the arena and hit the lights  
Step up now youre in for a ride  
this is war aint no fun and games  
we get it up you go down in flames  
Party time going down  
you better not mess us around  
the stakes are rich take a hit or stay  
the price is high someones gonna pay  
Heads I win tails you lose  
out of my way Im coming through  
roll the dice dont think twice  
and we crush Crushem  
Looking for trouble now youve found it  
youre a drum and were gonna pound it  
Last one standing wins the fight  
hear us scream and shout all night  
down on the floor and eat the grit  
this is gonna hurt a little bit  
Heads I win tails you lose  
out of my way Im coming through  
roll the dice dont think twice  
and we crush Crushem  
Now we lay you down to rest  
youll never be more than second best  
step inside youre in for a ride  
and we crush Crushem  
Dont need reason dont want names  
just a John Doe to put to shame  
step aside let me explain  
the name of the game is pain  
Now weve found you  
Were gonna pound you  
Were gonna beat you  
Gonna defeat you  
Were gonna bust you  
Were gonna crush you  
Were gonna Crushem
