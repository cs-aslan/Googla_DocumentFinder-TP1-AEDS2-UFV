Chorus  
Oh Im bein followed by a moonshadow moon shadow moonshadow  
Leapin and hoppin on a moonshadow moonshadow moonshadow  
  
And if I ever lose my hands lose my plough lose my land  
Oh if I ever lose my hands Oh if I wont have to work no more  
  
And if I ever lose my eyes if my colours all run dry  
Yes if I ever lose my eyes Oh if I wont have to cry no more  
  
Chorus  
  
And if I ever lose my legs I wont moan and I wont beg  
Yes if I ever lose my legs Oh if I wont have to walk no more  
  
And if I ever lose my mouth all my teeth north and south  
Yes if I ever lose my mouth Oh if I wont have to talk  
  
Did it take long to find me I asked the faithful light  
Did it take long to find me And are you gonna stay the night  
  
Chorus  
Moonshadow moonshadow moonshadow moonshadow
