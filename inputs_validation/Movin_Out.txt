Anthony works in the grocery store  
Savin his pennies for some day  
Mama Leone left a note on the door  
She said Sonny move out to the country  
Ah but working too hard can give you  
A heart attack ack ack ack ack ack  
You oughta know by now  
Who needs a house out in Hackensack  
Is that all you get for your money  
  
And it seems such a waste of time  
If thats what its all about  
Mama if thats movin up then Im movin out  
Mm I movin out mm oo oo uh huh mm hm  
  
Sergeant OLeary is walkin the beat  
At night he becomes a bartender  
He works at Mister Cacciatores  
Down on Sullivan Street  
Across from the medical center  
And hes tradin in his Chevy for  
A Cadillac ack ack ack ack ack  
You oughta know by now  
If he cant drive with a broken back  
At least he can polish the fenders  
Repeat chorus  
  
You should never argue with a crazy mi mi mi mi mi mind  
You oughta know by now  
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime  
Is that all you get for your money  
And if thats what you have in mind  
Then thats what youre all about  
Good luck movin up cause Im movin out  
Mm Im movin out Mm oo oo uh huh mm hm
