Ill tell you about the driver who lives inside my head  
Starts me up and stops me and puts me into bed  
He opens up my mouth when its time for me to talk  
Fires up my legs when he wants me to walk  
Keeps my eyes open most of the day  
Adds to my memory the things that people say  
When he makes decisions I dont have to wait  
But sometimes it seems hes got to much on his plate  
Like this morning when I woke up and he dressed me in this shirt  
That looks a little ragged where he drug me through the dirt  
Im moving through this life and Im thinking about the next  
And hoping when I get there Ill be better dressed  
Keeps my eyes open for most of the day  
Adds to my memory the things that people say  
When he makes decisions I dont have to wait  
Ill tell you about the driver who lives inside my head
