You know the reasons I cant conceal you kow Im leaving you  
Obviously you know how I feel you know Im tired of crawling  
hind my name among the crowd  
  
Its not a matter for wrong or right  
It aint much better than drinking  
And looking to fight its not as easy as calling out your  
Name when ism down  
  
Chorus  
Im on the last american exit to the north land  
Im on the last american exit to my homeland  
Im on the last american exit to my  
Last chance the keep calling out my name I shout it down  
  
Youve made them wonder and know for sure  
Youve made them hunger at night and then run for the door you know youll  
Probably cry like Caesars son when youre found  
  
Its not your face its another town lets face it baby  
Im up and then baby Im down youll watch the border offer you fame and  
Watch you drown  
  
Chorus  
  
Know your neighbors and know theyll take us  
Know my city its just like theirs are hope I make it I know Im gonna make it  
Somehow know my savior he knows you shakers  
Know my pity Ill see you later Id like to stay but I know it doesnt matter  
Somehow  
  
Chorus  
  
They keep callin out my name they keep callin out my name  
They keep callin out my name I shout it down
