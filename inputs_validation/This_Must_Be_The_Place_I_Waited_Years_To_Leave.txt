Everybody EEEverybody  
Everybody EEEverybody  
Everybody EEEverybody  
Everybody jump to attention  
  
Each morning after Sunblest  
Feel the benefit mental arithmetic  
I waited by the staffroom  
In time for benediction  
Living a law just short of delusion  
When we fall in love theres confusion  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
  
To our voices nobodys listening  
We shiver in the rain by the touchline  
Then a coach ride to the station  
My lord the carriage awaiteth  
Living a law just short of delusion  
When we fall in love theres confusion  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
And how  
How long  
  
Im listening to the words I thought Id never hear again  
A litany of saints and other ordinary men  
Kneeling on the parquet  
Whatever has gone wrong  
The fear and feeling hopelessness  
I dont want to belong  
  
I dreamt I was back in uniform  
And a candidate for examination  
History someone had blundered  
And a voice rapped knuckle under  
Living a law just short of delusion  
When we fall in love theres confusion  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
And how  
And how  
How long  
  
Trebuet nash narod odnogo  
Our people demand only
