Every breath you take and every move you make  
Every bond you break every step you take Ill be watching you  
Every single day and every word you say  
Every game you play every night you stay Ill be watching you  
  
Oh cant you see you belong to me  
How my poor heart aches with every step you take  
  
Every move you make every vow you break  
Every smile you fake every claim you stake Ill be watching you  
  
Since youve gone Ive been lost without a trace  
I dream at night I can only see your face  
I look around but its you I cant replace  
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace  
I keep crying Baby baby please  
  
Oh cant you see you belong to me  
How my poor heart aches with every step you take  
  
Every move you make and every vow you break  
Every smile you fake every claim you stake Ill be watching you  
Every move you make every step you take Ill be watching you  
  
Ill be watching you  
Every breath you take and every move you make  
Every bond you break every step you take Ill be watching you  
Every single day and every word you say  
Every game you play every night you stay Ill be watching you  
Every move you make every vow you break  
Every smile you fake every claim you stake Ill be watching you  
Every single day and every word you say  
Every game you play every night you stay Ill be watching you  
  
Every breath you take and every move you make  
Every bond you break every step you take Ill be watching you  
Every single day and every word you say  
Every game you play every night you stay Ill be watching you  
Every move you make every vow you break  
Every smile you fake every claim you stake Ill be watching you  
Every single day and every word you say  
Every game you play every night you stay Ill be watching you
