Intro  
  
Verse 1  
Take me on a whim  
Its not the sun that provides us  
Its not the moon that divides us  
  
Verse 2  
I can barely swim  
And the currents coming in  
And the currents coming in again  
  
PreChorus  
Stand up when you hear your name  
Cus I think that were the same  
Weve got the same old hands  
Weve made the same old plans  
  
Bail out to the yellow raft  
Its got a hole but we can last  
Well watch until it fades away  
  
Chorus  
Time is taking over  
Look how far weve come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far weve come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Verse 3  
Ive been painted gin  
Its not the colour I came in  
Its not the shirt that I stayin in  
  
Verse 4  
Hang me on a limb  
And the currents coming in  
And the currents coming in again  
  
PreChorus  
Stand up when you hear your name  
Cus I think that were the same  
Weve got the same old hands  
Weve made the same old plans  
  
Bail out to the yellow raft  
Its got a hole but we can last  
Well watch until it fades away  
  
Chorus  
Time is taking over  
Look how far weve come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far weve come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far weve come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far weve come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Bridge  
Stop right there  
Ive got a hole inside my chest  
And til it fills up  
I wont be satisfied  
  
Stop right there  
Ive got a hole inside my chest  
And til it fills up  
I wont be satisfied  
  
Stop right there  
Ive got a hole inside my chest  
And til it fills up  
  
Chorus  
Time is taking over  
Look how far weve come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far weve come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Its time to take it over  
Step out into the sun  
  
Its time to take it over  
And look how far weve come  
  
Weve come
