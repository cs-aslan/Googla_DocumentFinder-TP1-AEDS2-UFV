I was gonna cancel then I looked into the sky  
Knew the badness wont prevent the sun to shine  
I was gonna cancel then took a sec to realize  
All the disappointment that would trail behind  
I was gonna cancel then you reminded me of who I am  
Everything is clearer than a mirror is to woman  
Just the same as a dog is to man  
  
Oh Just hop out of the bed hey  
Go ahead face the day  
Who cares what you know  
Dont let that in the way no way  
Shut out all the doubt hey  
Just get up and go  
Whats on the other side Yeah  
You will never know unless you  
Go go go giiirl  
Go go go giiirl  
Go go go giiirl  
Go go go go girl  
  
I was gonna cancel then I thought about the strength  
That I got from all of the prayers and what it meant  
I was gonna cancel then I realized  
That time is just that money and the love watch how you spend  
I was gonna cancel until you reminded me of what I do  
Now I see it clearer my best friend is a mirror look behind me  
And I see all the things Ive been through  
  
Just hop out of the bed hey  
Go ahead face the day  
Who cares what you know  
Dont let that in the way no way  
Shut out all the doubt  
Just get up and go  
Whats on the other side  
You will never know unless you  
Go go go giiirl  
Go go go giiirl  
Go go go giiirl  
Go go go go girl  
  
Whats wrong with saying I love you  
Its nothing to kid about  
Some people going through a struggle  
Trying to scribble it out  
They say attention is a shovel  
Its time to dig em out  
You cant just let em stay in a bubble  
Theyll pop to get it out  
  
Whats wrong with love love  
Whats wrong with love love  
  
Just hop out of the bed hey  
Go ahead face the day  
Who cares what you know  
Dont let that in the way no way  
Shut out all the doubt yeah  
Just get up and go hey  
Whats on the other side  
You will never know unless you  
Go go go giiirl  
Go go go giiirl  
Go go go giiirl  
Go go go go girl
