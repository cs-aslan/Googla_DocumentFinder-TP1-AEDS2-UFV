I cried all night for Sonny  
Til my eyes were dry  
Til the oceans overflowed  
And the Red Sea turned blue  
I cried all night for Sonny  
I heard he was crying too  
  
I cried all night for Sonny  
We shook hands and said goodbye  
His face was etched with sorrow  
His heart without a hue  
I cried all night for Sonny  
I heard he was crying too  
  
When you try and love two people  
You cant love either one  
Cause after a while youll have to choose  
Or else love self denial  
  
I stayed all night with Sonny  
Like thered never be another day  
Go on and sleep til sunset  
And Ill watch over you  
I cried all night for Sonny  
I know he was crying too
