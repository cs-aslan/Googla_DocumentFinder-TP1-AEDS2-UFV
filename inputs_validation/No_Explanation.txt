You really took me by surprise  
Youre someone Ive needed for a lifetime  
Your heart was cleverly disguised  
But it didnt look that way in my mind  
  
Tell me how can it be I was the last to know  
Darling I couldnt read what was in your mind  
To turn around and to love me  
  
Chorus  
With no explanation  
I gave you everything I had  
I didnt know that you would take it  
With sweet consideration  
And after all that weve been through  
I cant believe its true  
Until I hear you say  
  
My mouth is still wet from our last kiss  
Was loving me your one intention  
What were the signs and the times that I missed  
Oh I need you more than I could mention  
  
I wont ever accept you leaving for someone else  
Baby and when something is wrong  
Darling I need to know  
Dont ever leave me  
  
Repeat chorus
