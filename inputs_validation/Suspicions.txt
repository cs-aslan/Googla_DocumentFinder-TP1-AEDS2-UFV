Im so glad that I met you baby  
Im so proud when we walk in the room  
I know its crazy to worry like I do  
I get this feelin that Im losing you  
  
Chorus  
I get these suspicions  
Even though I know that you love me baby  
And I really shouldnt feel this way  
Ooo suspicions  
I cant help it youre just so good lookin  
Im afraid somebodys gonna steal you away from me  
  
When I go out to a party with you  
You always turn every head in the room  
And I just know whats on every mans mind  
I try to fight it but it gets me sometimes  
  
I get these suspicions  
Even though I know that you love me baby  
And I really shouldnt feel this way  
Ooo suspicions  
I cant help it youre just so good lookin  
Im afraid somebodys gonna steal you away from me  
  
Oh baby oh darlin  
  
When Im with you I feel so satisfied  
The way you touch me when you lay by my side  
That look in your eyes when we make love  
Makes me hate myself for what Im thinkin of  
  
I get these suspicions  
Even though I know that you love me baby  
And I really shouldnt feel this way  
Ooo suspicions  
I cant help it youre just so good lookin  
Im afraid somebodys gonna steal you away from me  
  
Suspicions  
Even though I know that you love me baby  
And I really shouldnt feel this way  
Ooo suspicions  
I cant help it youre just so good lookin  
Im afraid somebodys gonna steal you away from me  
Suspicions Oh baby oh darlin  
Suspicions Cause I love her cause I love her  
I love her and she loves me  
Suspicions Aint nobody gonna take my girl from me  
Suspicions  
Ooo suspicions  
Ooo suspicions
