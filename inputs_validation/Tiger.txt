The city is a jungle you better take care  
Never walk alone after midnight  
If you dont believe it you better beware  
Of me  
  
I am behind you Ill always find you I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me I am the tiger  
  
The city is a nightmare a horrible dream  
Some of us will dream it forever  
Look around the corner and try not to scream  
Its me  
  
I am behind you Ill always find you I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me I am the tiger  
  
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights  
Yellow eyes the spotlight of the city nights  
  
I am behind you Ill always find you I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me I am the tiger  
  
The city is a prison you never escape  
Youre forever trapped in the alleys  
Look into the shadows and youll see the shape  
Of me  
  
I am behind you Ill always find you I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me I am the tiger  
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights  
Yellow eyes the spotlight of the city nights  
I am behind you Ill always find you I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me I am the tiger  
And if I meet you what if I eat you I am the tiger  
I am behind you Ill always find you I am the tiger  
Tiger  
Tiger  
Tiger
