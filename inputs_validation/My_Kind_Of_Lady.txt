Let me tell you what I want to say  
Youre the only one who can make me feel this way  
My kind of lady  
No better love could I embrace  
  
No better heart no other face  
Can quite compare with you  
You came along and then you mend my broken dreams  
I was so down and then as foolish as it seems  
  
You gave me your affection  
Yeah baby you came through  
Well make it youll see  
In spite of those who say its wrong  
  
This time we feel that we belong  
Now we can truly say  
Well be together and thats all well ever need  
Well love each other thats the way its gonna be  
  
And nothin under the sun of moon  
Can make us be apart  
Oh my honey  
You know Ill love you every day  
  
When things go wrong well find a way  
Im so glad I met you  
Much more than I can ever say  
Were making plans and holding hands just like before  
  
Well try again well make amends along the road  
Its fellin good just like it should this time we know  
Well share each others happiness for now and evermore  
Ive been wastin my life away  
  
Ive got a message for you today  
To tell you that you are  
My kind of lady  
Im not the same since I met you  
  
All of my dreams had fallen through  
And then you came along  
One magic night when things went right it was so fine  
Looked in your eyes and realized that you were mine  
  
And nothin under the sun of moon  
Can make us be apart  
Oh my baby  
You know Ill love you all the way  
  
When times get hard well smile and say  
Im so glad I met youIll love you more and more each day  
Were making plans and holding hands just like before  
Well try again well make amends along the road  
  
Its fellin good just like it should this time we know  
Well share each others happiness for now and evermore
