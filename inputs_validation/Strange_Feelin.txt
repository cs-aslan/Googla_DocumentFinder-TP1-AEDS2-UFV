I got this strange strange feelin  
Deep down in my heart  
I cant tell what it is  
But it wont let go  
It happens every time  
I give you more than what I have  
But now all I need is a little time to sing this song  
And I think were gonna find a way to lose this strange feelin  
  
All around I feel ya darlin feel ya darlin  
When youre home all alone  
Oh dont you need somebody to talk your troubles to  
Ah lord I know I want to catch the morning train lord the first thing  
Oh I want to hear you say were gonna take that strange feelin  
Oh take it all away  
  
Well its just like a mockingbird asinging on a hillside  
Churping at his morning song  
But dont you weep dont you fret dont you wail dont you moan  
Cant you hear that whiporwill acallin  
Now dont you worry  
Your daddys comin home  
Hes gonna chase those blues away  
And believe me when I say  
Were gonna lose that strange feelin all around all around
