You know hes moving fast  
Be hes still going slow  
Hes ahead in the race  
And there is not far to go  
And your load is so heavy  
And your legs want to rest  
Its all right its all right its all right  
  
You think hes way up in front  
But hes so far behind  
Hes asleep in the grass  
And hes run out of time  
While your load was so heavy  
You never wanted to stop  
Its all right its all right its all right  
  
Your friend is heavy  
But he was ready  
And never stopped for a while  
And while you were sleeping  
He went on keeping the final line in his mind  
Its all right its all right its all right  
  
Its all right its all right its all right  
Your friend is heavy  
But he was ready  
And never stopped for a while  
And while you were sleeping  
He went on keeping the final line in his mind  
  
Its all right its all right its all right  
Its all right its all right its all right  
Its all right its all right its all right  
Its all right its all right its all right  
Its all right its all right its all right
