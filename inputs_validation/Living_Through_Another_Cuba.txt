Living through another Cuba  
Its 1961 again and we are piggy in the middle  
While war is polishing his drum and peace plays second fiddle  
  
Russia and America are at each others throats  
But dont you cry  
Just on your knees and pray and while youre  
Down there kiss your arse goodbye  
  
Were the bulldog on the fence  
While others play their tennis overhead  
Its hardly love all and somebody might  
Wind up red or dead  
Pour some oil on the water quick  
It doesnt really matter where from  
He love me he loves me not  
Hes pulling fins from an atom bomb  
  
This phenomenon happens every twenty years or so  
If theyre not careful your watch wont be the  
Only thing with a radioactive glow  
Ill stick my fingers in my ears  
And hope they make it up before too late  
If we get through this lot alright  
Theyre due for replay 1998
