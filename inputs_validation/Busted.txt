My bills are all due and the baby needs shoes but Im busted  
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound and Im busted  
I got a cow thats gone dry and a hen that wont lay  
A big stack of bills gettin bigger each day  
The county will haul my belongings away cause Im busted  
  
I went to see my brother gonna ask him for a loan I was busted  
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone but Im busted  
My brother said there aint one thing I can do  
Wife and the kids theyre all down with the flu  
I was just thinking about calling on you cause Im busted  
  
I aint no thief but a man can go wrong when hes busted  
The food that we canned last summer is gone and Im busted  
Well the fields are all bare and the cotton wont grow  
Me and my family gotta pack up and go  
Ill make a living but where I dont know Im just busted
