Chorus  
The sea is foamin like a bottle of beer  
The wave is comin but I aint gonna fear  
Im waxin down so that Ill go real fast  
Im waxin down because its really a blast  
Im goin surfin cause I dont like your face  
Im bailin out because I hate the race  
Of rats that run round and round in the maze  
Im goin surfin Im goin surfin  
  
You take your car to work  
Ill take my board  
And when you run out of fuel  
Im still afloat  
  
My buddies and their honeys all come along  
They seem invincible as they surf along  
The sea is rollin like a thousand pound keg  
Were goin surfin were goin surfin  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X  
  
All along the undertow is strengthening its hold  
I never thought itd come to this  
Now I can never go home  
All along the undertow is strengthening its hold  
I never thought itd come to this  
Now I can never go home  
  
Chorus
