Chosen for this brutality  
You see no sign youre unaware  
This is the start of the atrocity  
That will send you far beyond repair  
Trapped inside yourself  
A dark lonely place  
Because of what you are  
Eternal black embrace  
Youre void of all selfrespect  
Your dignity has gone  
Dont know what you expect  
You feel like youre the only one  
Trapped inside yourself  
A dark lonely place  
Because of what you are  
Eternal black embrace  
This black cloud hangs over you  
Plague you right until your dying day  
Always something that you can do  
Speak out dont fade away  
Trapped inside yourself  
A dark lonely place  
Because of what you are  
Eternal black embrace
