I saw a ghost on the stairs  
And sheets on the tables and chairs  
The silverware swam with the sharks in the sink  
Even so I dont know what to think  
Ive been longing for  
Daisies to push through the floor  
And I wish that plant life would grow all around me  
So I wont feel dead anymore  
So I wont feel dead anymore  
  
I saw a bear in the den  
Reading my textbooks again  
That bats flowed like traffic as they poured from the attic  
Heaven knows I could really use a friend  
  
Id rather waltz than just walk through the forest  
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time  
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus  
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine  
Ive been longing for  
Daisies to push through the floor  
And I wish plant life would grow all around me  
So I wont feel dead anymore  
So I wont feel dead anymore  
  
Your spirit is sweet so pull off your sheet  
And give me a ghost of a smile  
Show me your teeth cause youre teddy beneath  
So just grin and bear it a while  
Just grin and bear it a while  
  
Id rather waltz than just walk through the forest  
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time  
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus  
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine  
  
Today Im busting out  
Of this old haunted house  
Cause Im sick of waiting for  
All the spider webs to grow all around me  
Cause I dont feel dead anymore  
And Im not afraid anymore  
  
Id rather waltz than just walk through the forest  
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time  
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus  
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine  
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine
