Dont you ever doubt my love cause you fit me like a glove  
And I could never give you up for someone else  
Honey I wont do you wrong and Ive been loving you too long  
And I could never give you up for someone else  
When it comes to lovin honey you can sure put out the flame  
No other woman ever could now aint that a shame  
You lay heavy on my mind youre the best love I could find  
And I could never give you up for someone else  
  
If you ever have to go honey please dont let me go  
Cause I could never give you up for someone else  
When it comes to lovin honey  
  
If you ever have to go
