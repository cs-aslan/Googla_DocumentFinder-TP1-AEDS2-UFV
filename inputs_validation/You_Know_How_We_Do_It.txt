Yeah yeah  
Fool you know how we do it  
  
West Side  
Comin from the West Side  
Nothin but the West Side  
  
Aint nothin goin on but the bomb ass rap song  
Hittin all night long  
Just like me on the black and white ivory  
Gettin six on artillery you dont want to see a G  
Break yo ass like dishes  
Buster ass tricks sleep with the fishes  
Runnin from Lennox up at Venice  
They want to have me in stripes like Dennis the Menace  
But that aint poppin aint no stoppin  
Fo hoppin ass droppin Coupe DeVille  
My truth can ill fool I got skills  
So back on up fore I check that chin  
Down as fuck and Im full off Henn  
You gets no love and I thought you knew it  
Fool you know how we do it  
  
Comin from the West Side  
West Side comin from the West Side  
  
Chillin with the homies smellin the bud  
Double parked and Im talkin to Dub  
about who got a plan who got a plot  
whom got got and who got shot  
Cause everybody knows that he got the info  
Crazy Toones hangin out the window  
Fool I got them bombass tapes  
Da Lench Mob Planet of the Apes  
Im down with Eiht and Watts Up  
Kam is solo they got nuts  
When Ice Cube write a sentence  
I want The Bomb just like George Clinton  
SKD is down to catch a body  
Put on Knee Deep well turn out your party  
You gets no love and I thought you knew it  
Fool you know how we do it  
  
You know how we do it  
  
Jack B Nimble and Jack B Quick  
if you want to jack me on a lick cause  
Im that fool from South Central  
You think you stuck yourself with a number 2 pencil  
Thats how I poke hot lead in yo ass  
With Mo Bounce to the Ounce in the dash  
Mash up Venice headed for the West  
Everything is great slow down for the dip  
On a 100 and 8th and keep mashin  
Dont drink and drive to keep the fo from crashin  
Stashin a glock and I thought you knew it  
You know how we do it  
  
Comin from the West Side West Side  
Nothin but a West Side  
Its hittin on the West Side  
Fool you know how we do it
