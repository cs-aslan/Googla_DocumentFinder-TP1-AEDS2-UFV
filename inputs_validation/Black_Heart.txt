Black hearts comin hes a cold machine  
Cuts like a knife gentle and clean  
Face like an angel mind of a killer  
Nobody else gonna love her better  
  
Lay down now stay down  
Took her life with a quick pull trigger  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Well I dont mind I dont mind  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Said I dont mind if you dont mind  
  
The color is all but faded  
Out of a dead mans eyes  
Down to his blackened heart  
  
Black hearts kickin like a beating drum  
Shooting her down the sound of his gun  
No compassion hard as an assassin  
Falling deeper still in that reckless fashion  
  
Lay down now stay down  
Deeper and deeper with a blind mans passion  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Well I dont mind I dont mind  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Said I dont mind if you dont mind  
  
The color is all but faded  
Out of a dead mans eyes  
Down to his blackened heart  
  
Rescue me  
If you dont mind  
x3  
  
If you dont mind  
The color is all but faded  
Out of a dead mans eyes  
Down to his blackened heart  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Yeah yeah yeah
