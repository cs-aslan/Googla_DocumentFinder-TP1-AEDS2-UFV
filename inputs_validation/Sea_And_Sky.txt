The sea goes on forever  
The sky goes on forever  
Its all a vast unmeasured shore  
  
If you just think about it  
The waves are always sighin  
The sea birds always cryin  
Where time means nothing anymore  
  
If I could I would take up the sea  
Join hands with the sky  
Id melt with the shore  
Theyre part of all I adore  
And all the love we will share  
One moment more ooh yeah yeah yeah  
  
Ahh the sea goes on forever  
The sky goes on forever  
Its something noone can deny  
If they go on forever  
And they go on forever  
  
Then why not you and I  
Like sea and sky  
Sea and sky  
Sea and sky
