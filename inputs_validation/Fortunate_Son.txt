Some folks are born made to wave the flag  
Yeah the red white and blue  
When the band plays Hail To The Chief  
Yeah theyll point the cannon at you  
  
It aint me it aint me  
Im no millionaires son  
It aint me it aint me  
I aint no fortunate one  
  
Some folks are born silver spoon in hand  
Well they help themselves yeah  
When the tax man comes to the door  
House looks a like a rummage sale  
  
It aint me it aint me  
I aint no millionaires son  
It aint me it aint me  
I aint no fortunate one no  
  
Some folks inherit star spangled eyes  
Yeah when they send you down to war  
Well when you ask them how much you should give  
Yeah its always more more more  
  
It aint me it aint me  
I aint no senators son  
It aint me it aint me  
Im no fortunate one  
  
It aint me it aint me  
I aint no military son  
It aint me it aint me  
I aint no fortunate son  
Take it away
