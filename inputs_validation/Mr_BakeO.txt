  
  
  
Im sitting in my chair watching the TV  
Its not even on but theres plenty for me to see  
I just lit some crazy ass shit  
that my friend overnight mailed to me  
  
Im fucking wasted  
Its the best shit I ever tasted  
I think they fucking laced it  
Cause Im so damn lambasted  
  
Oh my friend came over so I packed him a pipe  
I told him he better go easy with this shit but he didnt believe the hype  
He sparked three bows just to show he could take it  
Two minutes later he was playing backgammon naked  
  
Hes fucking wasted  
Its the best shit he ever tasted  
Hes lost in fucking spaceded  
Cause hes so wicked wicked wasted  
  
Oh I spent the last two hours  
hiding under my bed  
Cause I looked in the garbage can  
and I think I saw my Uncle Louies head  
  
Im fucking wasted  
  
Well my friend blew a hit into my pet birds face  
The bird laughed hysterically and started to moonwalk all over the place  
He tripped over the toaster wire and fell on his beak  
He looked at the two of us and he started to speak  
  
Im fucking wasted  
Its the best shit Ive ever tasted  
My brains been eraseded  
Well fucking fried  
  
Im sitting in the bathtub wanting something to eat  
I wanted a pizza the bird said Pepperoni would be sweet  
Delivery guy showed up four hours later handed me his shoe  
I said we ordered pizza buddy what the hells up with you  
  
Im fucking wasted  
Its the best shit I ever fucking tasted  
Oh fucking shit  
  
Im way too baked
