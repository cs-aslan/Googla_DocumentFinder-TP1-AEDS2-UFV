So youve heard Ive been flyin  
And tryin to get into  
Somebody new  
And Im off on a new love  
And dont hardly ever  
Think about you  
  
Hes gotten so cold  
He aint the same old  
Lover you used to know  
Hes in a nose dive  
Barely half alive  
And just about to let go  
  
Someones been telling you stories  
Someones been telling you stories  
Someones been telling you stories  
And they just aint true  
No they just aint true  
  
So you heard I got laid  
And betrayed by a maid in a one night stand  
And Im caught in the middle of something I dont really understand  
Hes gotten so lost  
Hes been doublecrossed  
By a change in the wind  
  
Hes gone solo again  
And he cant slow down now  
To pick up a friend  
Someones been telling you stories  
Someones been telling you stories  
Someones been telling you stories  
And they just aint true  
No they just aint true  
They just aint true  
  
So youve heard Ive been flyin  
And tryin to get into  
Somebody new  
And Im off on a new love  
And dont hardly ever  
Think about you  
Hes gotten so cold  
He aint the same old  
Lover you used to know  
  
Hes in a nose dive  
Barely half alive  
And just about to let go  
  
Someones been telling you stories  
Someones been telling you stories  
Someones been telling you stories  
And they just aint true  
Oh no they just aint true  
They just aint true
