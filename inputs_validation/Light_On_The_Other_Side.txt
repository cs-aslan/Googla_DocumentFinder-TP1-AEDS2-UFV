When I come to the dock and sit very still  
I wonder why on earth we fight and kill  
I see a light on the other side flickering to me  
As if to say youre alright youll find your way  
  
The world is so beautiful when Im out here  
Why cant it be the same when were back there  
  
Above my head straight ahead  
I see a bird gliding  
As if to say Im alright Ill find my way  
  
Windows are shattered  
Streets are battered  
Kids are frightened  
Men are still at war  
  
Moms are feeling sad  
Dads are feeling bad  
I wanna know I wanna know  
If the worlds gone mad  
  
Above my head straight ahead  
I see a bird gliding  
As if to say Im alright Ill find my way
