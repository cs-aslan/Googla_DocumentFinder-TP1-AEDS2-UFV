Its a wonder at all that Im alive  
Its a wonder at all that Im still standing  
Its a wonder at all that I survived the war  
  
Between your between your heart and mine  
Between your between your heart and mine  
  
I wont surrender  
I will fight better  
You lock me out you knock me down  
But I will find my way around  
I wont surrender  
This is war  
  
Its a wonder at all that I can see  
Its a wonder at all that the sky is not falling down  
Its a wonder at all that I decide to breathe  
Anymore anymore anymore  
  
I wont surrender  
I will fight better  
You lock me out you knock me down  
But I will find my way around  
I wont surrender  
This is war  
This is war  
  
This is war this is war  
I will run until I cant run anymore  
Someones got to lose  
Its not gonna be this girl this time  
  
I wont surrender  
I will fight better  
You lock me out you knock me down  
But I will find my way around  
I wont surrender  
I will fight better  
And this is war  
This is war
