Went out drinking late last night  
I had a blast  
But now the morning light has come  
And kicked my ass  
  
Ive got the worst hangover ever  
Im crawling to the bathroom again  
It hurts so bad that Im never gonna drink again  
  
And by my seventh shot  
I was invincible  
I would have never thought  
Id be this miserable  
  
Ive got the worst hangover ever  
Im rolling back and forth on the bed  
Im worked so bad that Im never gonna drink again  
  
Wont someone just kill me  
And put me out of my misery  
Im making deals with God Ill do anything  
Make it stop please  
Make it stop please  
  
Ive got the worst hangover ever  
Im crawling to the bathroom again  
It hurts so bad that Im never gonna drink again  
Ill probably never drink again  
I may not ever drink again  
At least not til next weekend  
Im never gonna drink again
