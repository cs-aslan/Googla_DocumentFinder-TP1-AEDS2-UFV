You say you want to seek the truth but its hard to find  
No one to help you your friends dont have the time  
So you ride around in your car switch on the radio  
You want to relate to something you once read in a book  
What kind of a way to try to take a look  
  
Until I got hurt I was looking I was on my way  
Until I got hurt until I got hurt darling I painted my face grey  
Until I got hurt til I got hurt why didnt I  
I didnt think of this until I got hurt  
Till I got hurt baby I didnt know what love is  
  
You say you want to learn to laugh cause music makes you cry  
But the tears you shed are only in your eye  
So you turn to any phony mouth with a tale to tell  
But hes just a hoaxer dont you know selling peace and religion  
Between his jokes and his karma chewing gum  
  
Until I got hurt I was looking I was the same as you  
Until I got hurt until I got hurt I did not know what to do  
Until I got hurt till I got hurt why didnt   
I didnt think of this until I got hurt  
Till I got hurt baby I didnt know what love is  
  
Young son dont let me down young son  
Im trusting you to keep on never turn away now  
Hold on never let go now hold on  
Turn your heart to the bright sun  
Love will come your way  
Cause till you make that final show  
Youll never know what love youve been missing  
Missing  
  
You say you want to seek the truth but you work alone  
No one to help you and nobody to push you on  
So you sit at home drinking your wine television on  
You wait for a miracle cause you say one day onell come along  
 But wishful thinking boy any minute now  You might be gone  
Id like to help you brother but that would be wrong  
  
Until I got hurt I was looking I was on my way  
Until I got hurt until I got hurt darling I didnt know which way  
Until I got hurt till I got hurt why didnt I  
I didnt think of this until I got hurt  
Till I got hurt baby I didnt know what love is  
  
Until I got hurt oh I didnt know what love is
