Cut the devil down lord cut the devil down  
Drive him out of town lord cut the devil down  
The devil hates your blood lord you know he hates your blood  
So drown him in a flood lord the devil hates your blood  
  
Well I thought that hed be bound to leave  
Without our praise and love

When Im seeking the power from above lord  
  
Cut the devil down lord cut the devil down  
Swing your sword around lord and cut the devil down  
The devil knows whos boss he surely knows whos boss  
Cause you beat him at the cross lord the devil knows whos boss  
  
Well the saints are crying to you lord  
And they just cant be denied  
Cause their clothes are washed in righteousness  
And their sins are all crucified

Throw your weight around lord and cut the devil down  
The liars got to leave lord the liars got to leave  
Because he saw you bleed lord the liars got to leave

And your peace is all I need  
And I must repent before your throne  
So Im here on my knees and I plead

Blind him with your crown lord yeah cut the devil down
