If you wanna make me happy  
Heres all you gotta do  
Just take me where youre going  
And Ill take care of you  
Cause Ive got this need thats growin  
To keep you satisfied  
And if you keep your green light showin  
Then you can take me for a ride  
  
Cause I la la la la la la love you  
And I la la la la la la care  
And I really want you with me baby everywhere  
  
Well I like the way youre movin  
And I like the way you go  
Well I like the way you let your  
Locomotion show  
Cause my drivin wheel is drivin  
And my pistons are workin good  
And if your motor gives you some trouble baby  
Ill take a look underneath your hood  
  
Cause I la la la la la la love you  
And I la la la la la la care  
And I really want you with me baby everywhere  
  
Well I know you like your transportation  
With a motor and a rubber wheel  
But when you move you cause a transformation  
In this lover and the way I feel  
  
So if you wanna make me happy  
Heres all you gotta do  
Just let me ride your box car  
And Ill hobo with you  
Cause all I got is on my shoulders  
Im walkin on my travellin shoes  
And before I get much older  
Im gonna kick these lovesick blues  
  
And I la la la la la la love you  
And I la la la la la la care  
And I really want you with me baby everywhere
