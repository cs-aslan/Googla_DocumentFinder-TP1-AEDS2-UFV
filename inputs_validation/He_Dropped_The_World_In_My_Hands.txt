I loved you before you met him and I loved even after you were wed  
I told you Id never forget you that Id be here when his love was dead  
Now youre back in my arms and Im happy  
And I guess he knows just where he stands  
Cause when he lied and cheated on you thats when he dropped the world in my
hands  
  
Didnt he realize what he was losing to give you up he must happened insane  
And to him it just didnt seem to matter that his love was another mans game  
Its his right if he wants to be a fool but I wonder if he really understands  
That when he gave your love back to me thats when he dropped the world in my
hands
