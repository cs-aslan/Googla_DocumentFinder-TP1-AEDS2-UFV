I dunno wot she got  
I dunno wot she got  
I dunno what she got but it seems to have a grip upon me  
No telling where she learn the things she do to me  
And I dont know what she done wrong but I want to hurt her  
  
wanna take it out on her  
Take it out on her  
Take it out on her  
With my weapon  
  
Shes so exacting that she tells me when I go wrong  
She doesnt value the attention she receives  
She says Im taking all the time but Im not returning  
thats right  
  
Do this but she wont do that  
Lying beside me like a parcel of fat  
Hot love  cold sweat  feel her beneath me want to crush her to death  
She tries to justify the people who despise me  
She puts her finger on things she knows will hurt  
And I cant defend myself till we turn the lights off then  
  
I dunno wot she got  my weapon  
My stinking weapon
