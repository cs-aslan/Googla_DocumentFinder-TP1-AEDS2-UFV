Darling lets turn back my years  
And go back to yesterday  
Lets pretend that time has stopped  
And I didnt go away  
  
We had our love to make us happy  
It wasnt meant to bring us tears  
Love like ours should never die  
So darling lets turn back the years  
  
We had our love to make us happy  
It wasnt meant to bring us tears  
Love like ours should never die  
So darling lets turn back the years  
  
Darling lets turn back my years  
And go back to yesterday  
Lets pretend that time has stopped  
And I didnt go away  
  
Darling lets turn back my years  
And go back to yesterday  
Lets pretend that time has stopped  
And I didnt go away
