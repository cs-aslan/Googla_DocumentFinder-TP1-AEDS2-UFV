No one on earth means more to me Your painted pictures are the way that the
world should be Dont ever change it I dont wanna live in this world without
you Oh no I cant explain I cant define What you do to me but my senses are
so alive You tell your story and its all that I ever believe Portraits and
poetry are frozen forms of perfection But they dont live and breathe When my
hearts in need they dont answer me You  ooo oooh you are youre a human
work of art Walking talking inspiration You  ooo oooh you are youre a
human work of art You make me love you make me care You give me freedom I
dont need when I know youre there My search is over Ive got all of the
riches that money dont buy Oh no Your words are poetry and your face is more
than perfection The way I watch you move it only goes to prove In everything
to do You  oooh oooh you are youre a human work of art Walking talking
inspiration You  ooooh ooh you are youre a human work of art Youre my
mission Youre my goal Oooh you liberate my soul Theres no illusion that
your touch is gold Portraits and poetry are frozen forms of perfection The way
I watch you move it only goes to prove In everything you do You  oooh oooh
you are youre a human work of art Walking talking new sensation You  ooooh
oooh you are youre a human work of art Walking talking inspiration
