Take me to heart  
And Ill always love you  
And nobody can make me do wrong  
Take me for granted  
Leaving love unshown  
Makes will power weak  
And temptation strong  
  
Chorus  
A womans only human  
You should understand  
Shes not just a plaything  
Shes flesh and blood  
Just like her man  
If you want a do right alls day woman  
You gotta be a do right alls night man  
  
They say its a mans world  
But you cant prove that by me  
And as long as were together  
Show some respect for me  
If you want a do right alls day woman  
You gotta be a do right alls night man  
  
Chorus  
  
If you want a do right alls day woman  
You gotta be a do right alls night man  
If you want a do right alls day woman  
You gotta be a do right alls night man
