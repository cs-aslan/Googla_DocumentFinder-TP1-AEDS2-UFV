Im flyin flyin  
In a frame of my mind that time cannot erase  
Im seein seein  
The future the past as I lay the present to waste  
Im scopin scopin  
All these feelings I have and hopin for them to come true  
And Im holdin something more precious than fine ore baby  
Im holdin you  
  
Im breathin breathin  
The fumes of the grid that rid my lobe of oxygen  
Im climbin climbin  
The walls to where good and evil make amends  
Im trippin writhin and squealin pukin  
Looking for someone like you  
And Im holdin something more precious than fine ore baby  
Im holdin you  
  
Im flyin flyin  
In a frame of my mind that time cannot erase  
Im seein seein  
The future the past as I lay the present to waste  
Im scopin scopin  
All these feelings I have and hopin for them to come true  
And Im holdin something more precious than fine ore baby  
Im holdin you  
And Im holdin something more precious than fine ore baby  
Im holdin you
