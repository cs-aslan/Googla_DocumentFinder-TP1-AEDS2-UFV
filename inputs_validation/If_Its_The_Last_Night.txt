I dont know if youll understand  
But Im hoping that youll follow me down to the waterway  
Ill be there if you change your mind  
Listening to the ticking of the hands on a clock working overtime  
  
Chorus  
If its the last night it oughta be left for lovin girl  
If its the last night it oughta be left for lovin girl  
If its the last night it oughta be left for lovin girl Ive seen your face
on every girl that Ive held since you went away  
Its getting late and I have to know  
Im mending the wings of a heart that was broken not so long ago  
  
Chorus  
  
If its the last night it oughta be left for lovin girl
