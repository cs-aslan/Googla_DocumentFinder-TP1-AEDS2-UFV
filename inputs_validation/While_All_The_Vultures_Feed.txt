The future is on fire  
Of a dying breed  
Dont understate our relevance  
Were the eyes and the walls  
And we witness the vultures feed  
  
Yeah  
  
Chorus  
Oh  
Stay wide awake  
Stay wide awakeYeah  
Oh  
Make haste cause predators precede  
Oh  
Stay wide awake  
Stay wide awakeYeah  
Oh  
While all the vultures feed  
  
Like angles in a sphere  
Of our own design  
No more perpetual innocence  
With words we make shapes  
And our angles can align  
  
Yeah  
  
And our appetites careless and menacing  
It humbles me  
We breathe softly out with the predator  
Such is a sight to see  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Stay wide awake  
  
Repeat x4  
While all the vultures feed
