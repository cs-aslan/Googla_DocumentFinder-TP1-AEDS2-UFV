If you always do what youve always done youll always get the same old stuff  
Life can treat you good then turn as cold as ice  
And believe me when I tell you  
  
This thing called love for sure is like most things in life  
Not all bad not all good its just something that I believe  
Not all cold not all hot yeah I like that  
Not all bitter not all sweet sounds all right to me  
  
So dont miss all the good waiting for the best theres still happiness  
Right in the middle  
Perfect love sounds real nice  
But that never seemed to happen with any relationship of mine  
It was always up and down in then out  
And after the last goodbye I still didnt know what it was all about  
You get disappointed if it aint bliss all the time  
  
And you get so annoyed if you cant feel the same every night  
Not all bad not all good Im tryin to tell you that its  
Not all high not all low not all high and not all low  
Not all heaven not all hell as far as I can tell  
  
Its not some prize you win you dont have a thing to prove just enjoy the
groove  
Right in the middle  
Cause Ive learned when it comes to love its the exact same reality  
Thats why they say Que sera sera  
Which means whatevers gonna be is gonna be  
  
Whatevers gonna be is gonna be  
Not all bad not all good I need somebody to understand  
Not all sunshine not all rain  
You know that too much of a good thing is really no good  
Not all laughter not all tears Im only trying to tell you  
  
To let your good times roll keep your selfcontrol theres a lot of soul  
Right in the middle
