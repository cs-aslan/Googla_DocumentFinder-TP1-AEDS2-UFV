I can see it in your eyes youre angry  
Regret got shit on what youre feeling now  
Mad cause he aint like me  
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me  
All the care I would take all the love that we made  
Now youre trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you  
Its a shame you didnt keep it Alicia Katia  
I know that you gon hear this Im the man  
Yeah I said it bitch Im the man  
Dont you forget it  
The way you walk thats me  
The way you talk thats me  
The way youve got your hair up did you forget thats me  
And the voice in your speaker right now thats me  
And the voice in your ear thats me  
Cant you see that I made it Yeah I made it  
First I made you who you are then I made it  
And youre wasted with your ladies  
Yeah Im the reason why you always getting faded  
  
Chorus  
Take a shot for me ooh  
Take a shot for me ooh  
Take a shot for me  
A shot for me  
A shot for me  
  
Okay look Im honest  
Girl I cant lie I miss you  
You and the music were the only things that I commit to  
I never cheated for the record back when I was with you  
But you believe in everything but me girl I dont get you  
She says I know you changed I never see you  
Cause youre always busy doing things  
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things  
I think the city that were from just kinda ruined things  
Its such a small place not much to do but talk and listen  
The men are jealous and the women all in competition  
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret  
And taint all the images of your Mr Perfect  
I could tell that you been crying all night drinking all summer  
Praying for your happiness hope that you recover  
This is one I know you hated when you heard it  
And its worse because you know that I deserve it  
  
Chorus  
  
May your neighbors respect you  
Trouble neglect you angels protect you  
And heaven accept you
