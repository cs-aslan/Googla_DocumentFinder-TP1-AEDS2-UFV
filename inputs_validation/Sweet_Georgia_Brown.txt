He just got here yesterday  
Things are hot here now they say  
Theres a new gal in town  
Gals are jealous theres no doubt  
All the guys just rave about  
Sweet Sweet Georgia Brown  
And ever since she came the common folks all claim say  
  
No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown  
Two left feet but oh so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown  
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown  
Ill tell you just why you know I dont lie not much  
Its been said she knocks em dead when she lands in town  
Since she came why its a shame how shes cooled em down  
Fellas that she cant get must be fellas that she aint met  
Georgia claimed her Georgia named her Sweet Georgia Brown  
  
All you gals will get the blues  
All you pals will surely lose  
And theres but one excuse  
Now Ive told you who she was  
And Ive told you what she does  
Still give this gal her dues  
This pretty maidens prayer is answered anywhere  
  
No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown  
Two left feet but oh so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown  
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown  
Ill tell you just why you know I dont lie not much  
All those tips the porter slips to Sweet Georgia Brown  
They buy clothes at fashion shows for one dollar down  
Fellas wontcha tip your hats oh boy aint she the cats  
Whos that mister aint her sister its Sweet Georgia Brown
