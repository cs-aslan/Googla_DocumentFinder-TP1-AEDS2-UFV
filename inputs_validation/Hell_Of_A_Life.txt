I think I just fell in love with a porn star  
Turn the camera on she a born star  
Turn the corners in a foreign car  
Call the coroners do the CPR  
She gave that old nigger an ulcer  
Bitter sweet taste made his gold tooth ache uh  
Make a knee shake make a priest faint uh  
Make a nun cum make her cremate uh  
Move down town cop a sweet space uh  
Livin life like we on a sweep stakes what  
We headed to hell for heavens sakes huh  
Well Ima levitate make the devil wait yeah  
  
Chorus  
Have you lost your mind  
Tell me when you think weve crossed the line  
No more drugs for me  
Pussy and religion is all I need  
Grab my hand and  
Baby well live a hell of a life  
  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Never in your wildest dreams  
In your wildest  
You can hear the loudest screams  
Comin from inside the screen  
You a wild bitch  
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy  
Said her price go down she ever fuck a black guy  
Or do anal or do a gang bang  
Its kinda crazy its opposite the same thing  
Well I guess a lot of niggers do gang bang  
And if you run trains we all in the same game  
Run away slaves all on a chain gang  
Bang bang bang bang bang  
  
Chorus  
  
One day Im gon marry a porn star  
Well have a big ass crib and a long yard  
Well have a mansion and some fly maids  
Nothin to hide we both screwed the brides maid s  
She wanna roll play till I roll over  
Ima need a whole day at least roll doja  
What party is we goin to on Oscar day  
Especially if she cant get that dress form Oscar Day  
Laurenta they wouldnt rent her they couldnt take the change  
Thats a dress of her back and told her get away  
How can they say they live they life wrong  
When you never fuck wit the lights on  
fuck wit the lights fuck wit the wit the lights on

Have you lost your mind  
Tell me what you think weve crossed the line  
No more drugs for me  
Pussy and religion is all I need  
Grand my hand  
Baby well live a hell of a life  
  
I think I fell in love with a porn star  
And got married in the bathroom  
Honeymoon on the dance floor  
And got divorced by the end of the night  
Thats one hell of a life
