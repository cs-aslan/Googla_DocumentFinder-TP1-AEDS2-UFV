Youre my worldyoure every breath I take  
Youre my worldyoure every move I make  
Other eyes see the stars up in the sky  
But for me they shine within your eyes  
  
As the trees reach for the sun above  
So my arms reach out to you for love  
With your hand resting in mine  
I feel a power so divine  
  
Youre my worldyou are my night and day  
Youre my worldyoure every prayer I pray  
If our love ceases to be  
That is the end of my world for me  
  
With your hand resting in mine  
I feel a power so divine  
  
Youre my worldyou are my night and day  
Youre my worldyoure every prayer I pray  
If our love ceases to be  
That is the end of my world for me  
End of my world  
End of my world  
End of my world for me
