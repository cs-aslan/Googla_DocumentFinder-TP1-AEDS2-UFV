Ah nothing on earth could be so fine  
I think I might have found something  
And I think it might be my love  
  
Yes I think I came across something  
And I think she might be my love  
  
Ohohoh  
Yes it must be love  
Ive found out its worth it must be love  
Cause nothing on earth could be so fine  
Im making you mine
