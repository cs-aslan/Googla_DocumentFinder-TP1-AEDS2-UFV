My father knew it  
And his before him  
And it goes way back down the line  
They had a vision  
A prayer for the future  
For what I would believe in time  
Now Im not perfect  
Lifes not easy  
But I wouldnt take the world for what they gave to me  
  
Chorus  
Im living the legacy  
Walking the path that the faithful have laid down  
Im living the legacy  
Finding the hope that my fathers found  
I am standing tall when Im on my knees  
Im living the legacy  
  
Something in common  
Deep inside me  
With those before me who are gone  
Gives me the vision  
Fills me with a passion  
To make the message carry on  
Now Im not perfect  
Lifes not easy  
But for the futures sake Im gonna do the best I can  
  
Chorus 3X
