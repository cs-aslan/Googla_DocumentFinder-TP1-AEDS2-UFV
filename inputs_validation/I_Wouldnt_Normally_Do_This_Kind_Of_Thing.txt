Ask me why  
I say its most unusual  
How can I even try to explain  
Why today I feel like dancing  
Singing like lovers sing  
When I wouldnt normally do this kind of thing  
I wouldnt normally do this kind of thing  
  
Ask me when ta ra ra ra  
I say it started when I met you ta ra ra ra ra ra  
And ever since then I knew that the past couldnt last  
For right now I think Im running  
A race that I know Im gonna win  
And I wouldnt normally do this kind of thing  
I wouldnt normally do this kind of thing  
  
If people say Im crazy I tell em that its true  
Let them watch with amazement  
Say it wont last beyond breakfast  
Its a phase hes going through  
Denigrate or speculate on what Im going through  
Because it isnt the sort of thing I would normally do  
  
Ask me what ta ra ra ra  
I say I think its good for you ta ra ra ra ra  
Believe it or not I know where its all leading to  
I feel like taking all my clothes off  
Dancing to the right of Spring  
And I wouldnt normally do this kind of thing  
I wouldnt normally do this kind of thing  
I wouldnt normally do this kind of   
This kind of thing
