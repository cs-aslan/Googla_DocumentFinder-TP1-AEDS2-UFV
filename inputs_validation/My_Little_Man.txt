Dont you know I love you more than life itself  
Dont you know that youre my pride  
And I would not have you walking through this world  
Without me by your side  
  
Go to sleep my little man  
Dont you weep my little man  
  
Id like to keep you with me all your life  
But I know I cant do that  
So I must try to teach you wrong from right  
To keep the vulture from your back  
  
Go to sleep my little man  
Dont you weep my little man  
  
And when youre dreaming you can talk to angels  
So wipe the tears from your eyes  
And if theres demons that try to steal you breath away  
You cant believe that know my spirit will be standing by your side  
  
You saved me you gave me the greatest gift of all  
Believe me believe there aint no mountain thats too tall  
  
I will gladly carry your cross for you  
To take your pain away  
But what I cant carry is my love for you  
Beyond my dying day  
  
So be strong my little man  
When Im gone my little man  
You got to be my little man  
So dont you weep my little man  
Go to sleep my little man  
Dont you weep my little man  
You got to be my little man  
So dont you weep my little man
