So youre saying that you dont have rhythm  
But listen at what youre doing right there  
With that stamp and a book youve got a real nice hook  
Sounds to me like youve got rhythm to spare  
  
I have no idea what your talking about  
Ive got as much rhythm as that chair  
What happened to me was a tragedy  
But I dont have to be a millionaire  
Look I got a sweet deal going on here  
Ive got all the books that I can read  
All these sweet old ladies and this carpet from the 80s  
What more could a librarian need  
Besides I aint got rhythm  
No I aint got rhythm  
Said I aint got rhythm  
I aint got rhythm  
  
Youre kidding me right youre youre kidding me  
Dont you see what you were doing right then  
Thats a wicked groove you were starting to move  
Mr you got rhythm times 10  
  
I think perhaps that your not listening  
I find it tedious to repeat  
Its no big crime  
I just cant keep time  
Im telling you I lost the beat  
I dont need my face on tshirts  
Or hit a powerchord guitar  
They were screaming my name  
I guess its a shame  
But I dont need to be a rock star  
Besides I aint got rhythm  
No I aint got rhythm  
Said I aint got rhythm  
I aint got rhythm  
  
I aint got rhythm  
Sounds like rhythm to me  
No I aint got rhythm  
Seems like they all agree  
Said I aint got rhythm  
I aint got rhythm  
But your laying down some funky syncopation  
I aint got rhythm  
But you got that beat  
No I aint got rhythm  
Look at them their stomping their feet  
Said I aint got rhythm  
  
I aint got rhythm  
Its time for you to rock a brand new generation  
Gonna rock a brand new generation  
  
Cause I aint got rhythm  
Would you just go join the band  
Hey Look at me  
Hey I got rhythm
