Conrad the Caterpillar thought he was really killer  
Couldnt wait to build a cocoon original lyrics  
Couldnt wait to buy blue suede shoes recent lyrics  
Spent all his days eatin leaves in the shade  
And stayed when the night set too  
Conrad the Caterpillar knew life would be a thriller  
Soon as the threads was spun  
Wouldnt stop to play in the Caterpillar Games  
Till his own webbing game was done  
  
He said No no I got no time to play  
Got a thousand little legs that dont get me too far in a day  
Im leaving looks like I cant stay  
  
That little pillar he found him a willow  
Spun in with a craftsmans weave  
Wound so tightly to protect him from the light  
And all shapes of water that drop from the leaves  
Conrad the Caterpillar knew he would be a chiller  
And he wound it tighter some more  
Wound it so wide and the ends of his legs got sore  
  
He said No now I cant feel my feet  
Just when I thought it was time to take a stroll on down the street  
Im leaving looks like I cant leave  
What do you know  
Whats all this moving around with inside me  
  
What kind of piller could touch the world of a miller  
Chopping trees to build a new store  
Nobody sees a lonely bump on the tree  
Except a lump whos crying for more  
Conrad the Caterpillar knew life would be a chiller as he wound it tighter
some more  
Anybody stands in the caterpillars place is moving in a standing run  
  
He said No brother I just need some room to fly  
I spent all of my days just trying to keep dry  
Oh Id take a waterfall or a drop from my eye  
I cant see nothin from here anyway I might as well make room and try  
Might as well try  
  
Oh no I just need a little room to play  
Got a thousand little wings and Im gonna use them all today  
Im leaving it looks like I gotta stay
