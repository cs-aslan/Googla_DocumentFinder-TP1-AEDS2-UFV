Woke up early this morning  
As I looked around my world be crumblin down  
What I saw I couldnt believe Who are you  
What might I be Oh the things you do  
  
Stare at the sun one means three  
At the helm insanity if youd look Mama  
Ya just might find but youre too far gone  
Now youre just losin your mind  
  
Wanting to get away one more fix youll be okay  
The things ya do try and try to talk you down  
Youre so damn high cant hear a sound  
Oh whats going on  
  
Once you start you cant stop start to shake  
Fall apart engines burnin  
Burnin out of time youre too far gone  
Now youre just losin your mind  
  
Pass through time without a move  
Youre the one thats being used  
If youd look you must might find  
But youre too far gone now youre just losin your mind
