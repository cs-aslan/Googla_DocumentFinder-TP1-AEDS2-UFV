Verse 1  
You criticize the way I talk You cant know how I feel yeah yeah yeah  
I sympathize with your dark nature you dont know what that takes no no no  
Its a matter of time now cant you see  
Before I turn to your dark enemy  
I hear a voice thats telling me  
  
Chorus  
Im free free of the drama free from the karma free of the beast  
Free out of my head free of the dread the moment we met  
  
Verse 2  
You cant invade your tired old demons I wont commiserate no no no  
You suck the life out of every room how much can I take I dont know  
Like a flower that burns you to the touch  
Its so beautiful but takes so much  
Of the life inside of me
