Way out on the mountain near the sky hiding from the cold realities of life  
Shaking that old road dust off my heels I give my heart and mind the chance to
heal  
Then Ill go somewhere and sing my songs again  
More than likely ride back to the places I have been  
In fairness to my music and my friends so Ill go somewhere and sing my songs
again  
A raccoon stole my minnows in the night I appreciate his need and his appetite  
But like me he doesnt have to roam Lord its true that man cant live on
bread alone  
So Ill go somewhere  
  
Oh it feels so good to have a simple wish where life and death is me and some
old fish  
Poor king sits with a cold beer in his hand  
And he surveys a clear blue kingdom on the sand  
So Ill go somewhere
