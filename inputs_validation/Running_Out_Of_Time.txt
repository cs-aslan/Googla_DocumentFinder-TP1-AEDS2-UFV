Im sittin on my porch  
And watchin the flowers bloom  
I walk through my front door  
Everything is perfect in every room  
But somethings wrong round here  
Im always fighting back the tears  
And even when you come home  
I still feel all alone  
  
I need you to find me  
Im the one you left behind  
I want you to see me  
cause were running out of time  
  
You made it look so pretty  
Such a beautiful family such wonderful friends  
But how were going so dirty  
I dont know whats real  
cause it all feels pretend  
But somethings missing here  
Im always drowning in my fears  
Ive gotta take care of myself  
Before theres left  
  
I need you to find me  
Im the one you left behind  
I want you to see me  
cause were running out of time  
  
Im more than just a pretty face  
Im more than just your wife  
I have my hopes and my dreams too  
This is our song my love  
I need you  
I want you  
cause were running out of time  
  
I have my hopes and my dreams too yeah  
This is our song my love  
  
I need you to find me  
Im the one you left behind  
I want you to see me  
cause were running out of time  
  
I need you find me  
I have no where left to hide  
I want you to see me  
cause were running out of time
