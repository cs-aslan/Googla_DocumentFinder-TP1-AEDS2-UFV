There you come again I see youre having your everlasting smile on your  
Face like now n then  
I cannot hide I cannot fight I cannot go you know you know you  
Know  
Hey do you know  
That you do not have to entertain anybody that you do not have to  
Entertain my cat  
If you dont want that yeah  
It seems that you dont know that youre twisted by your nature n  
Thats the reason  
I hate ya  
Im gone I cant stay another day  
Roll my mind hold my hands up in the air  
So here it comes now  a coupple of hard words yah yah I know this  
Hurts but Im so so happy  
Cause you oh yes yes you do really deserve this Shed a tear when you  
Want me to stop  
So many times you have made people cry So many lies why Im asking  
Im the one who will say hey get out of my way because youre twisted  
Oh yes you are
