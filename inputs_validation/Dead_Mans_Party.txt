Im all dressed up with nowhere to go  
Walkin with a dead man over my shoulder  
  
Waiting for an invitation to arrive  
Goin to a party where no ones still alive  
  
CHORUS  
I was struck by lighting  
Walkin down the street  
I was hit by something last night in my sleep  
Its a dead mans party  
Who could ask for more  
Everybodys comin leave your body at the door  
Leave your body and soul at the door     
Dont run away its only me  
  
All dressed up with nowhere to go  
Walkin with a dead man  
Waitin for an invitation to arrive  
With a dead man    Dead Man     
  
Got my best suit and my tie  
Shiny silver dollar on either eye  
I hear the chauffeur comin to the door  
Says theres room for maybe just one more     
  
CHORUS  
  
Dont run away its only me  
Dont be afraid of what you cant see  
Dont run away its only me
