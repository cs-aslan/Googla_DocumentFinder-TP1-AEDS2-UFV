Whats the worst thing that could happen  
We could change our minds  
That seems to be the hottest topic at this time  
We are sitting around in the meditation dragging chasing  
Wonderin whose holdin whose got the will to draw the line  
  
I know youve got something burning up inside  
Its so unhealthy but so good for me oh  
Said if I didnt know and if I didnt know well if I didnt know that you
loved me would you tell me  
Well God only knows our contradictions to quitting is a hate to love
relationship thing  
A fire under you is so fulfilling  
I fear theres nothing more  
  
Im giving giving you the choke hold  
My flirting with disaster is mighty loved  
Ugggh you youre so bold  
My wanting to kiss you still is not enough  
Im getting over all the comments  
Im feeling statements made by people are nonsense  
Im getting stronger by the minute  
And once I slip into position Ill swing you and turn you all around  
  
You are the sweetest thing Ive found since whenever  
Youre the only way my time is measured  
You might be the silent type  
But your appetizing louder now  
Its crazy how youre killing me  
Woo youre killing me but I like your  
  
Red top and matching bottoms  
You know the ones the ones you got on  
Pull them over your skinny self  
But dont cover your tattoo  
Woo cause I like to look at you yeah  
I love that smell on you  
And I got your special place against this face for tasting too  
  
And I like it natural  
No need for chemicals  
Fogginup my senses  
Youre making me sensless  
Youre calling it sexual  
  
And youre going to get yours my lady  
Might even be today  
And it aint no thing because Ill be rolling right along with youwoowoo  
  
You are the sweetest thing Ive found since whenever  
Youre the only way my time is measured  
You might be the silent type  
But youre appetizing louder now  
Its crazy how youre killing me  
And give us both a break  
And to give us back a taste when the way things were before they made the
laws  
And to give us both a chance  
But it wont be the last romance cause when the weekend starts the guilty
partys on  
  
BREAKDOWN  
Weekend partys over  
Dont stop lets get closer  
Friday got cold shoulder  
Monday got a new composure  
  
Weekend partys over  
Dont stop lets get lower  
I wont blow your cover  
Opportunistic lover  
  
Weekend partys over  
Dont stop lets get closer  
Fridays mediocre  
Monday Im selfexposed now  
  
Weekend partys over  
Dont stop lets supposeah  
I wont blow your cover  
Opportunistic lover
