Madness comes and madness goes  
An insane place with insane moves  
Battles without for battles within  
Where evil lives and evil rules  
Breaking them up just breaking them in  
Quickest way out quickest relief wins  
Never disclose never betray  
Cease to speak or cease to breathe  
And when you kill a man youre a murderer  
Kill many and youre a conqueror  
Kill them all Ooh Oh youre a god  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury have you reached a verdict  
Yes we have you honor we find the defendant guilty on all counts for crimes  
against all humanity  
By virtue of the jurys decision and the power vested in me by the state  
I hereby sentence you to be incarcerated with no possibility of parole for  
life  
Life Whale ya mean life I aint got a life  
Boy your soul better belong to Jesus Hmmmmmm cause your ass belongs to  
me  
Captive honour aint no honour  
No time for questions  
No time for games  
Start kicking ass  
And taking down the names  
A long shit list  
A shorter fuse  
He is untouchable  
And guarantees youll lose  
Inside the bighouse  
His nightmare unfolds  
Before he got there  
His manpussy was sold  
Black blanket welcome  
This tough guys now a bitch  
Praying for death  
It cant be worse than this
