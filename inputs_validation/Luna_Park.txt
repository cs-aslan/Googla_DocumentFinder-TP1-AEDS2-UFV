Shadows on the sun  
Another nights begun  
Its always dark  
In Luna Park  
Wind across the moon  
Electric storms and soon  
A flying spark  
In Luna Park  
  
And when were getting higher  
Were happy  
Somebodys eating fire  
Were happy  
The big wheel in the sky  
Will make you scream  
  
Come on join a line  
The ghost train leaves on time  
Its always dark  
In Luna Park  
On the shooting range  
The plastic prizes never change  
So make your mark  
On Luna Park  
  
And when were getting higher  
Were happy  
Somebodys eating fire  
Were happy  
The big wheel in the sky  
Will make you scream  
  
Thunder I wonder  
A storm will come one day  
To blow us all away  
Like dust on the moon  
In Luna Park  
It cant be dark  
Too soon  
  
A storm is coming soon  
Like dust on the moon  
  
Every night we go  
To the latest horror show  
And hear the screams  
In Luna dreams  
Fortunetellers muse  
On palms that bode bad news  
The futures dark  
In Luna Park  
  
And when were feeling scared  
Were happy  
With circuses and bread  
Were happy  
The whirling fair machines  
Are all we need  
  
Thunder I wonder  
A storm will come one day  
To blow us all away  
Like dust on the moon  
In Luna Park  
It cant be dark  
Too soon
