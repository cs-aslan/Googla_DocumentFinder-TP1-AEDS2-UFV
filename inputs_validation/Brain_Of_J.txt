Whos got the brain of JFK  
Whats it mean to us now yeah  
Pause It sounds distrust  
But I can tell you this is no lie  
  
The whole world will be different soon  
The whole world will be relieving  
  
You youve been taught  
Whipped into shape now they got you in line  
Stand behind the stripes  
There will be order so give it a good mind  
The whole world will be different soon  
The whole world will be relieving  
  
And by name  
The name they gave me  
The name Im letting go  
  
The whole world will be different soon  
The whole world will be relieving  
The whole world will be different soon soon
