Ive got your picture  
That you gave to me  
And its signed with love  
Just like it used to be  
  
The only thing different the only thing new  
Ive got your picture shes got you  
  
Ive got the records  
That we used to share  
And they still sound the same  
As when you were here  
  
The only thing different the only thing new  
Ive got the records shes got you  
  
I got your memory  
Or has it got me  
I really dont know  
But I know is it wont let me be  
  
Ive got your class ring  
That proved you care  
And it looks the same  
As when you gave it dear  
  
The only thing different the only thing new  
Ive got these little things shes got you  
  
Ive got your memory  
Or has it got me  
I really dont know  
But I know it wont let me be  
  
Ive got your class ring  
That proved you care  
And it still looks the same  
As when you gave it dear  
  
The only thing different the only thing new  
Ive got these little things shes got you
