I finally made it through med school  
Somehow I made it through  
Im just an intern  
I still make a mistake or two  
  
I was last in my class  
Barely passed at the institute  
Now Im trying to avoid yah Im trying to avoid  
A malpractice suit  
  
Hey like a surgeon  
Cuttin for the very first time  
Like a surgeon  
Organ transplants are my line  
  
Better give me all your gause nurse  
This patients fading fast  
Complications have set in  
Dont know how long hell last  
  
Let me see that IV  
Here we go time to operate  
Ill pull his indsides out pull his insides out  
And see what he ate  
  
Like a surgeon hey  
Cuttin for the very first time  
Like a surgeon  
Heres a waiver for you to sign  
  
Woe woe woe  
  
Its a fact Im a quack  
The disgrace of the AMA  
Cause my patients die yah my patients die  
Before they can pay  
  
Like a surgeon hey  
Cuttin for the very first time  
Like a surgeon  
Got your kidneys on my mind  
  
Like a surgeon ooh like a surgeon  
When I reach inside  
With my scalpel and my forceps and retractors  
Oh oh oh oh woe oh  
  
Ooh baby yeah  
I can hear your heartbeat  
For the very last time
