Light with the mornings goes  
I live a long forgotten shadow  
Love with the morning goes  
And what to do I just dont know  
The moon is on the run  
Another day to up and lay low  
Mad dogs and noonday sun  
I need the darkness to show  
  
Moondance moondance  
  
There goes a setting sun  
Thats when we turn from strobe to struttin  
Turn on the city lights  
Cause you know Im moody blue  
  
Moondance moondance  
  
The women shadow box  
Theyre dancing tough but the ice is melting  
The music gives what its got  
The moon is looking at you  
  
Moondance moondance moondance
