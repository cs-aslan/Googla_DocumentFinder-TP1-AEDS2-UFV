I want to funk  
I want to ffyou fyounk  
  
Repeat x 2  
I want to funk I want to funk  
I want to ffyou fyounk  
  
Non stop dancing the bus stop  
To the funky music  
Hustle pumpin the muscle  
Blame it on the boogie  
  
Remember the old days  
Remember the OJays  
Walkin in rhythm life was for livin  
  
Chorus  
When you cant find the music  
To get down and boogie  
All you can do is step back in time  
Ball of confusion  
When nothing is new and  
Theres nothing doin step back in time  
  
Keep on truckin along  
Riding on a love train  
And then we can float on  
Youll never go wrong  
  
Chorus  
  
Step back in time  
Step back  
I want to step back step back  
  
Chorus until fade
