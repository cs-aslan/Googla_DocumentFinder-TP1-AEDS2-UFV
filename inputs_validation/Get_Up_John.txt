I never thought Id need you  
But now I find Im wrong  
Come on back sweet mama  
Back where you belong  
Ive rambled over town  
To find that I cant win  
Come on back and pick me up again  
Now if I lose  
If I lose  
Let me lose  
Let me lose  
I dont care  
I dont care  
How much I lose  
If I lose a hundred dollars  
While Im tryin to win a dime  
My baby shes got money all the time  
Of all the other gals Ive known  
Theres none to take your place  
Cause when I get into a jam  
They just aint in the race  
So now that youre back here  
Lets take another round  
With you here by my side  
Babe the deal just cant go down  
Now if I lose  
If I lose  
Let me lose  
Let me lose  
I dont care  
I dont care  
How much I lose  
If I lose a hundred dollars  
While Im tryin to win a dime  
My baby shes got money all the time  
Now if I lose  
If I lose  
Let me lose  
Let me lose  
I dont care  
I dont care  
How much I lose  
If I lose a hundred dollars  
While Im tryin to win a dime  
My baby shes got money all the time
