Im too tired to deceive you  
We cant pretend theres nothing wrong  
Wholl be first to say it  
That the thrill is gone  
And we never get it back  
When we talk of old acquaintance and  
Speak like two strangers all day long  
The only four words that I hear  
Are the thrill is gone  
And we never get it back  
When evening fall Magenta  
And goodnight hangs on and on  
I wont need to go to sleep and dream  
To tell me  
That the thrill is gone  
And we never get it back
