Hear the merry laugh of children  
Hear the chestnut horses neigh  
See the mice all scurry  
See the farmers hurry  
When its time for  
Bringing in the hay  
  
Good smells coming from the kitchen  
Well get lots of treats today  
Cattle are amooing  
Pigeons are acooing  
As they watch us  
Bringing in the hay  
  
Pitchforks shining in the sunlight  
As the farmers work all day  
They were early starting  
And they wont be parting  
Til we finish  
Bringing in the hay
