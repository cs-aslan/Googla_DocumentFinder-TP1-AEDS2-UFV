Its time to face the music  
Tonight I came to use it  
You never know  
Who youre gonna meet in here  
I thought Id never find it  
The dark and handsome kind  
I used to dream of  
And now youre standing there  
Though youre looking good to me  
It doesnt mean that you can do as you please  
  
Oh baby youre the best thing in my life  
But a onetrack mind is what you got  
Oh baby youre the best bet here tonight  
And a onetrack mind is worth a lot  
Ive got no good reason to believe well last for long  
But thats good enough for me till the right man comes along  
  
Ive waited for a lover  
The kind wholl stay forever  
You look to me  
Like the sort of man I need  
Its not the best scenario  
But now Ive found you Im letting you go  
  
Oh baby youre the best thing in my life  
But a onetrack mind is what you got  
Oh baby youre the best bet here tonight  
And a onetrack mind is worth a lot  
For the perfect guy maybe I should be holding on  
And with you I could till the right man  
Till the right man comes along
