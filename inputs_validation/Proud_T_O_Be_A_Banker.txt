Im proud to be a banker  
Im proud to be a banker  
Im proud to be a banker  
Cause I get to play with other peoples money  
  
Im having a lousy day  
I burned my toast and spilled my coffee  
On my best shirt So I had to change and then  
Im late for work So I rush into the meeting  
Where they are discussing what my future in the corporation is  
And I dont really give a damn  
But I dont have another job  
And so I lie and say  
  
Im proud to be a banker  
Im proud to be a banker  
Im proud to be a banker  
Cause I get to talk to stimulating people  
  
I open up my mail  
Hoping that its not a bill but its from the bank  
Saying that I have only 20 hours to go  
To contribute to my RRSP for this tax year  
So I run down to the bank but theres a 20mile lineup  
And Im yelling and Im screaming  
And Im not wearing any pants ah ah ah ah ahhhhh  
  
Im proud to be a banker  
Im proud to be a banker  
Im proud to be a banker  
Cause I get to screw with other peoples lives  
  
I took out 40 bucks  
From the automatic teller It told me  
That I couldnt cause I just had 10  
But that cant be cause I just got paid on Friday  
So I go down to the bank wait an hour in the lineup  
And Im talking to the teller  
She says Wait Ill get your last months statement  
She comes back in 7 hours  
Says Ive got some interest charges and a cheque from Uncle Bill  
That bounced and so theyll have to charge me 40 bucks for that  
And for the box I never opened and I dont have overdraft protection  
And I think Ill die before I pay off all that I owe and I dont even  
Own a car  
  
Im pleased to be a banker  
Im proud to be a banker  
Im pleased to be a banker  
Cause I get to play with other peoples money
