Never thought I see the day  
Never thought I heard you say  
Baby its over I just cant take it  
Dont know what Im gonna do  
Only want to be with you  
  
Now you pretending I just cant fake it  
Lying here on my own Im trying  
Looking for some way to stop it dying  
  
Im only a lonely child  
Inside a lonely man  
Lost in an endless night  
Drowning in tears  
Only a lonely child  
Inside a lonely man  
Caught in the morning light  
Fighting the fears  
Walking down a country lane  
Getting cold in the rain  
  
Darling I cant stop remembering  
When I took your photograph  
You never used to want to laugh  
But I think your smile is the sweetest thing  
Lying here all on my own Im trying  
Looking for some way to stop it dying
