Just look my way  
And Im ready to go  
Oooooooo your sweet lovin  
I cant leave it alone  
You start my heart to pumpin  
Just walkin my way  
I dont care if I feel like a fool  
Ohh sweet feelin  
Got me rockin and a reelin  
Actin like a fool  
Ohh sweet feelin  
Got me rockin and really in love  
Well I know its always said  
That love will break your heart  
That aint so  
Cause I gave my heart to you  
And now I know  
Ooooo Sweet feelin  
Got me dancin on the ceiling  
Actin like a fool  
I dont care if I feel like a fool  
Its just a ohh sweet feelin  
Got me rockin and a reelin  
Actin like a fool  
Ohh sweet feelin  
Got me rockin and really in love
