Ive been so sad  
Since you said my accent was bad  
Hes worn a frown  
This Caledonia clown  
Im just going to have to learn to hesitate  
To make sure my words  
  
On your Saxen ears dont grate  
But I wouldnt know a single word to say  
If I flattened all the vowels  
And threw the are away  
  
You say that if I want to get ahead  
The language I use should he left for dead  
It doesnt please your ears  
  
And though you tell it like a leg pull  
I think your still full of John Bull  
You just refuse to bear  
  
Some days I stand  
On your green and pleasant land  
Now dare I show face  
When my diction is such a disgrace  
  
Oh what can I do  
To be understood by you  
Perhaps for some money  
I could talk like a bee dripping honey
