Ive got a wife and four grown children  
I cant afford their education  
Ive been a prison guard for fourteen years  
That aint exactly a vacation  
Since hes been here hes followed evry rule and I  
Told you my position  
The law says hes got the right to go to school  
We abide by the courts decision  
  
I got a Winchester two forty three  
I like that gun for deer  
  
Upstate November and the air is free  
Feels like hunting seasons here  
Hes the one to keep your eye on  
Hes a sneak yeah but hes quiet  
Hes a trouble maker if I ever seen one  
Next thing ya know its Attica  
And we got a prison riot  
  
There aint no way that punk gets his degree  
And hides behind the constitution  
No way in hell that smart assed spic goes free  
Not while Im in this institution
