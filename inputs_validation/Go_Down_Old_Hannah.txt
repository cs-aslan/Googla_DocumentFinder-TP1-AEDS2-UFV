Lyrics  
Oh we call the sun ol Hannah  
Blazing on my head  
Yes we call the sun ol Hannah  
And her hair is flamin red  
Why dont you go down ol Hannah  
Dont you rise no more  
If you come up in the mornin  
Bring judgment sure  
Well I look at ol Hannah  
She was turnin red  
Well I look at my partner  
He was almost dead  
Said if you get lucky  
Or make it on your own  
Please go down by Julies  
Tell her I wont be long  
Kept sayin I was a good man  
But they drove me down  
Yes I was a good man  
But they drove me down  
Well it look like evrything  
Evrything I do  
Yes it looks like evrything  
I do is wrong
