Where were you when I was fallin down  
Buzzin round your heart  
Whyd you wait till I was moving on  
To come out of the dark  
  
To say Im what you need  
And you could spend your life with me  
  
Chorus  
Well I cant help you now  
sorry baby I cant help you  
No I cant help you now  
keep away Ive fallen in love  
Maybe there was a time  
But sometimes time runs out  
And I cant help you know  
  
Forty days since I stopped countin the days  
And countin the ways that I loved you  
Good long while since I found  
Good enough reasons to stop believin that you  
Are what I really want  
And now that you you do baby I dont  
  
Chorus  
  
Now you sayin the one you need  
And you could spend your life with me  
But I cant help you knowno  
  
I cant help you know  
  
Baby there was a time  
And I wish I could somehow  
But I cant help you  
Cant help you know
