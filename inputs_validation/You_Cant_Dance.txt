He man Ive seen ya  
Think ya rockin it on the floor  
You look like a moron  
Who let you in the door  
To put the question bluntly  
Maybe your feets deformed  
They should slap you in the teeth  
When you put your dancing shoes on  
You cant dance  
  
Why dont you just nail your feet to the floor  
Homeboy whats the use  
Anytime you wanna step aside a party  
First think of an excuse  
You dance like a fat old lady  
Not sayin that fat old ladies aint nice  
But every time you try to get one move right  
The old lady then did it twice  
You cant dance  
  
Youve been a dancing disco disaster  
The worst I ever saw  
They should dropkick you on the neck  
And drag you off the floor  
In every discotheque I see you there  
In the middle of the crowd  
Looking like you got eight or nine  
Left feet dragging all around  
You cant dance  
  
Take my advice dont move  
Youll never get the knack  
If I danced like you Id sneak out the party  
And wouldnt be coming back  
On the floor youre a dinosaur  
Yeah boy thats how you move  
You look like Ralph Cramden or a Donald Duck cartoon  
You cant dance  
  
You wanna come to my party  
I wouldnt give you a chance  
You tried to take breakdance lessons  
Ended up in an ambulance  
Wouldnt it be funny if they put you on solid gold  
You dance like you got arthritis already  
Whatll happen when you get old  
You cant dance  
  
Why are you so stiff  
Is it something that your mother did  
Maybe you grew up around cant dance people  
When you were a cant dance kid  
You live in a cant dance house  
Went out in a cant dance car  
Your doofy cant dance father  
Got drunk in a cant dance bar  
You take a cant dance bath  
Put on your cant dance cologne  
Go out to a cant dance party  
So you wouldnt have to cant dance all alone  
You cant dance  
  
Homeboy will you please get off the floor you moron
