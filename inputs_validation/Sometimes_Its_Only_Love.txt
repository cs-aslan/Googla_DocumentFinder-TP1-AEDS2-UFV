I am still your friend  
Standing by to catch you  
If ever life should let you down  
And you should fall  
You dont need to pretend  
If ever doubt should find you  
I dont need to remind you  
Im there for you before and after all  
I am who I am  
And I would never fool you  
I feel the same way you do  
About honesty  
But do we understand  
How love is sometimes jaded  
It keeps us separated  
Even though well never part  
So to be lovers  
Weve got to understand  
Today is how today begins  
Tomorrows how it ends  
And to be lovers  
Some things we rise above  
Cause sometimes love is wonderful  
But sometimes its only love  
Loving who I am  
Is something that youve taught me  
The kind of love youve brought me  
Takes me through the day  
And even though our minds  
Are sometimes disagreeing  
Our hearts theyre still believing  
Well work it out and stay  
So to be lovers  
Weve got to understand  
Today is how today begins  
Tomorrows how it ends  
And to be lovers  
Some things we rise above  
Cause sometimes love is wonderful  
But sometimes its only love
