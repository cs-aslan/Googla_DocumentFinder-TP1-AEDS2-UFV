In this garden  
This lovely garden  
I build a temple of love  
Walk with the Father  
Wont be a bother  
To touch the Earth as it was  
  
Well farm the land each day  
And in the sunshine we will play  
Glory glory for the day He came  
Our tears had gone away  
  
Well make love in the shade  
And in the ocean we will bathe  
Little fishies in the sea  
Say hooray  
  
I build this garden for us  
  
In this garden  
Our children will grow  
Darling this is a must  
Well be so happy  
Our little family  
So full of love and trust  
  
And darling when were old  
Well close the gates and lock the door  
Our love will never fade away  
When its pure its forever last  
  
And darling when youre cold  
Ill hold you tight and keep you warm  
Little darlin gonna make it through the storm  
Youll never be alone  
  
I build this garden for us  
  
In this garden  
Theyll be no war  
No racial prejudice  
Youll be my brother  
  
Of any color  
Youll just be okay with us  
Well love each day in peace  
In hope that we will one day reach  
  
The rest of the world  
When they are ready to be taught  
The kingdom will come  
Thy will be done  
On Earth as it is in heaven  
  
I build this garden  
I build this garden for us  
  
I build this garden for us
