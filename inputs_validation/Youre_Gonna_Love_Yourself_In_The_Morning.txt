Heaven knows some man has abused you thats why you think Im gonna use you  
You say youd hate yourself in the morning cause you wake up and Id be gone  
But if you give me just one more chance I can prove youre wrong  
Youre gonna love yourself in the morning Im gonna love you all night long  
Youre gonna love yourself in the morning and every morning from now on  
I know what youre thinking and I dont blame you  
Its gonna take a whole lotta love to change you  
When you wake up in the morning youre gonna feel like a brand new girl  
Youre gonna see that it can be such a beautiful world  
Youre gonna love yourself in the morning  
Youre gonna love yourself in the morning and every morning from now on
