Theres a wild wind blowing  
Down the corner of my street  
Every night there the headlights are glowing  
  
Theres a cold war coming  
On the radio I heard  
Baby its a violent world  
  
Oh love dont let me go  
Wont you take me where the streetlights glow  
I could hear it coming  
I could hear the sirens sound  
Now my feet wont touch the ground  
  
Time came a creepin  
Oh and times a loaded gun  
Every road is a ray of light  
It goes on  
Time only can lead you on  
Still its such a beautiful night  
  
Oh love dont let me go  
Wont you take me where the streetlights glow  
I could hear it coming  
Like a serenade of sound  
Now my feet wont touch the ground  
  
Gravity release me  
And dont ever hold me down  
Now my feet wont touch the ground
