Starts with a typical ZZ riff sounds like ZZ meets James Bond  
  
Black fly buzzin buzzin around  
Black fly flyin from town to town  
Black fly lookin around and around  
Whats he gonna do when he finds her  
  
He got the mojo workin overtime  
Makin it layin it on the line  
Chasin his honey with a honeysuckle vine  
Whos so lucky and gets to kiss her  
  
Black fly thats right  
Black fly thats right  
  
Flyin round lookin for a black cat bone  
Flyin with John the conqueror showin  
Messin around with a honeybee  
Will she kiss him or sting him whats it gonna be  
  
Black fly thats right  
Black fly thats right  
  
Black fly buzzin buzzin around  
Black fly flyin from town to town  
Black fly zzzzzn all around  
Fly gonna fly when he find her
