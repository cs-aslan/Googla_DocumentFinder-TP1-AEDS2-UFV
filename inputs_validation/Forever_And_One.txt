What can I do  
Will I be getting through  
Now that I must try  
To leave it all behind  
  
Did you see  
What you have done to me  
So hard to justify  
Slowly is passing by  
  
Forever and one  
I will miss you  
However I kiss you  
Yet again  
Way down in Neverland  
So hard I was trying  
Tomorrow Ill still be crying  
How could you hide  
Your lies your lies  
  
Here I am  
Seeing you once again  
My minds so far away  
My hearts so close  
To stay  
Too proud to fight  
Im walking back into night  
Will I ever find  
Someone to believe  
  
Forever and one  
I will miss you  
However I kiss you  
Yet again  
Way down in Neverland  
So hard I was trying  
Tomorrow Ill still be crying  
How could you hide your lies  
Your lies
