So you want to know whats going on  
When we get wild and were up until dawn  
The parties and the stories theyre all true  
Aint nothing left when were through  
One distant land where its all sin and sand  
  
REFRAIN  
King of Sodom I want the flesh  
Gotta have it I love it to death  
King of Sodom I eatem alive  
Like a savage the strong will survive  
  
Wicked souls a hunger for lust  
You lay it down were goin for bust  
We live a life thats hell of wheels  
You dont know how it feels  
Ride the wind and soon youll all be in  
  
REFRAIN  
  
Sodom and Gomorrah  ooh sweet Gomorrah  
Were the present tribe  the present tribe  
Children of the fire  of the fire  
Burning up alive alive alive alive  
  
REFRAIN
