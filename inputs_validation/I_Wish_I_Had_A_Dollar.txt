Chorus  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everythings gonna be alright  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everythings gonna be alright  
  
Ive been lost in Boston Austin Texas is always sweet  
I stumbled around that Texas town but I never left Sixth Street  
You know its always hard to keep my feet from tryin to run away  
And it seems I spent a lifetime tryin to make everything ok  
  
I want to go down to see her  
Shes my little queen  
I want to go down to tell her  
She means the world to me  
I wish I was down to watch her  
Play that tambourine  
She always brought a smile to me  
  
Id do anything  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everythings gonna be alright  
I wish sometimes that I could say she never told me so  
And Id walk a million miles on down the same old broken road  
Now you can always reap just what you sew I know thats true  
And I pray some day that I wake and my poor feet wont fit these shoes  
  
I want to go down to see her  
Shes my little queen  
I want to go down to tell her  
She means the world to me  
I wish I was down to watch her  
Play that tambourine  
She always brought a smile to me  
Id do anything  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everythings gonna be alright  
If I listened closely I can hear it oh so clear  
  
Like a south bound train like fallin rain like a whisper in my ear  
Everything Id like to hear you know I dont hear much no more  
But I know someday that youll come my way and youll walk right through that
door  
  
I want to go down to see her  
Shes my little queen  
I want to go down to tell her  
She means the world to me  
I wish I was down to watch her  
Play that tambourine  
She always brought a smile to me  
Id do anything  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everythings gonna be alright
