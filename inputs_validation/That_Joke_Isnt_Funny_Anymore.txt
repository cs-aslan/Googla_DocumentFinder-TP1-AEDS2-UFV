Park the car at the side of the road  
You should know  
Times tide will smother you  
And I will too  
When you laugh about people who feel so  
Very lonely  
Their only desire is to die  
Well Im afraid  
It doesnt make me smile  
I wish I could laugh  
  
But that joke isnt funny anymore  
Its too close to home  
And its too near the bone  
Its too close to home  
And its too near the bone  
More than youll ever know   
  
Kick them when they fall down  
Kick them when they fall down  
You kick them when they fall down  
Kick them when they fall down  
You kick them when they fall down  
Kick them when they fall down  
You kick them when they fall down  
Kick them when they fall down  
  
It was dark as I drove the point home  
And on cold leather seats  
Well it suddenly struck me  
I just might die with a smile on my  
Face after all  
  
Ive seen this happen in other peoples  
Lives  
And now its happening in mine  
  
Ive seen this happen in other peoples  
Lives  
And now its happening in mine  
  
Ive seen this happen in other peoples  
Lives  
And now its happening in mine  
  
Ive seen this happen in other peoples  
Lives  
And now its happening in mine  
Oh
