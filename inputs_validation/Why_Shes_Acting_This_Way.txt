Like silent she stands  
like laughter she falls  
from a castle of sand  
like a memory she crawls  
and the mockingbirds grieve  
Cause they cant make her cry  
theyll soon start to believe  
that the lady has died  
what it all goes to show  
it aint my job to say  
for who am I to know  
why shes actin this way  
  
Once again turn away  
if youre sure that its done  
tell your prophets to pray  
tell your bandits to run  
take your eyelids of stone  
they wont do you no harm  
take your cross made of bones  
take your your flypaper arms  
and when everythings placed  
in your coffin and go  
through a scarf round your face  
Cause the subway gets cold  
pack up your sunflower smile  
and your bandana blues  
take your worthless denials  
theyre all youve got left to lose  
take your Tinkerbell lies  
and your weary desires  
take the tears in your eyes  
take your cup full of fire  
give your lover a call  
if your legs start to fail  
and hell come break your fall  
with a bed full of nails  
  
No need to glance back again  
there aint nothin to see  
just this drunken old man  
and this woman and me  
and youve made it quite plain  
that were just wastin time  
and you say that it seems strange  
that Im staying behind  
but you dont worry bout me  
I can make it alone  
Cause I got no place to be  
and I aint far from home
