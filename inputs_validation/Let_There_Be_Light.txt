Let there be light let there be joy  
Let there be love and understanding  
Let there be peace throughout the land  
Lets work together in harmony  
Lets build a better world no suffering  
And in times of darkness just reach out  
Cause there is a promise it wont be denied  
Let there be light let there be joy  
Let there be love and understanding  
Let there be peace throughout the land  
Let there be light let there be joy  
Let there be love and understanding  
Let there be peace throughout the land  
Let there be light let there be joy  
Let there be love and understanding  
Let there be peace throughout the land  
Let there be light let there be joy  
Let there be love and understanding  
Let there be peace throughout the land  
Let there be light let there be joy  
Let there be love and understanding  
Let there be peace throughout the land  
Let there be light let there be joy  
Let there be love and understanding  
Let there be peace throughout the land  
This is truly paradise  
Being here in this celestial garden  
With all the ones you love  
Where nothing dies or ever grows old  
And to be bathed in light  
That cast no shadow  
Yes this is the kingdom within  
Still you know  
Sometimes I miss seeing and feeling  
The spirits dancing in the flesh
