Spendin my vacation in the summer sun  
Gettin lots of action havin lots of fun  
Scorin like a bandit till the bubble burst  
Suddenly it got to be September first  
Woe is me All summer long I was happy and free  
Save my soul the board of education took away my parole  
  
I gotta go back back back to school again  
You wont find me till the clock strikes three  
Im gonna be there till then  
I gotta go back back back to school again  
Whoa whoa I gotta go Back to School Again  
  
Geometry and History its just a pain  
Biology and Chemistry destroys my brain  
dont they know that I deserve a better fate  
Im really much too young to matriculate  
Mama please your childs come down with a fatal disease  
mama said Cmon you lazy bum and get your butt outta bed  
  
You gotta go back back back to school again  
Its bye bye fun get your homework done and better be in by ten  
I gotta go back back back to school again  
Whoa whoa I gotta go Back to School Again  
  
I got my books together and I dragged my feet  
And then I saw this angel boppin down the street  
I said hey pretty baby Hows about a date  
She said Im goin to school and I cant be late  
I could see the look in her eyes was sayin follow me  
And I was caught I thought of playin hooky but on second thought  
  
I gotta go back back back to school again  
You wont find me till the clock strikes three  
Im gonna be there till then  
I gotta go back back back to school again  
Whoa whoa I gotta go Back to School Again
