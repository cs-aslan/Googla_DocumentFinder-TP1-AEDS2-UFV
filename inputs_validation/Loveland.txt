Ima bout to go to Loveland do you wanna go with me  
Ima bout to go to Loveland do you wanna go with me  
Ima bout to go to Loveland do you wanna go with me  
Ima bout to go to Loveland do you wanna go with me  
Ima bout to go to Loveland do you wanna go with me  
  
Ooh its unbelievable  
How your body feels next to mine  
Ooh its uncontrollable  
How you put it down every time  
Girl you know that you got me  
Going up and down  
Fulfilling my greatest fantasy  
Stroking it round and round  
I dont know what else to do but love you suga  
So come on lets cuddle up and make sweet love  
  
You dont need a ticket just get on board  
Ima bout to take you into Loveland  
  
Chorus  
Step in my room  
Take your clothes off  
Hit the shower  
Let you hair down  
Get in my bed  
Making sounds  
Me on top of you rolling around  
Repeat  
  
Ooh we dont know  
What tomorrow will bring  
So we gonna make this last forever  
Ima bout to taste your love  
Till you cant take it anymore sweetheart  
Imagine that said I guarantee to make your body come to me  
Hey baby Im gon set your soul free  
Girl Im bout to take you into Loveland  
  
Chorus  
  
It takes love for the world to go round and round  
Even though it has its ups and down  
Joy is the key to my soul  
Anyone unlock me  
Ooh Lord have mercy  
  
Chorus
