Her skin is copper and her voice is Spanish red  
Her vibe is golden till her anger kills it dead  
She wants the world to see  
A body rich in harmony  
A mouth cruel as death  
  
She rides a fantasy she hasnt tested yet  
She looks in every mirror to check her silhouette  
The turning heads  
The honking horns  
Gave proof to her  
Since she was born  
That love is her game  
  
She loves me Miss Argentina  
Though she hides behind her smile  
She runs free Miss Argentina  
Dripping blood  
With lots of style  
  
She loves to stay in bed and watch the movies play  
She wants a husband who will worship and obey  
The moods that she enjoys like childrens games and football toys  
She laughs without shame  
  
She likes the military and the Rolling Stones  
Her little brother has a Tshirt from Ramones  
Shes shy and sensitive and doesnt know the tougher games  
But boy can she love  
  
Shes easy Miss Argentina  
A masterpiece without a frame  
She runs free Miss Argentina  
But Venus is a dangerous game  
  
She saves my spirit with a humanistic light  
Shes greedy lazy and impossible to like  
She dresses sexually  
And shes afraid of many things  
Like being alone  
  
Shes back with mother now  
Shes over twentyfive  
I tried to keep her but she buried me alive  
In love and birth and jealousy  
And every emotion totally freed  
Screaming at once  
  
But she loves me Miss Argentina  
While she hides behind her smile  
She runs free Miss Argentina  
Dripping blood with lots of style  
Shes lovely Miss Argentina  
A masterpiece without a frame  
Shes easy Miss Argentina  
But Venus is a dangerous game
