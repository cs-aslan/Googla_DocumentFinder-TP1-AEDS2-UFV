I can get up  
On the right side of the bed  
But that wont stop the rain  
From coming down on my head  
I can live my life  
Playing hide and seek  
But when I look inside  
Its hard to make believe  
Ah ah  
  
N lately  
You seem so far away  
I wish I could say something  
But I dont know what to say  
I can feel your eyes  
I dont have to look at you  
Boy discontent  
Isasneakin through  
  
You never really want anything  
But what you really need is everything  
Ill give you something only life can bring  
The calm inside the storm  
Love me a little love me long  
Wo yeah  
The calm inside the storm  
Love me a little love me long  
Dont you know  
You should be holding me  
But youre all locked inside  
Why dont you throw me your keys  
Im like a rockin ship  
On your rollin sea  
You know crash lightnin  
Never frightens me nah  
  
You never really wanted  
But what you really needed  
I want to give you something  
Mmmthe calm inside the storm  
Love me a little love me long  
Love me a little love me long
