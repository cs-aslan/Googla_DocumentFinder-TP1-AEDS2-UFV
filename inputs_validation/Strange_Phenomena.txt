Soon it will be the phase of the moon  
When people tune in  
Every girl know about the punctual blues  
But whos to know the power  
Behind our moves  
  
A day of coincidence with the radio  
And a word that wont go away  
We know what theyre all going to say  
G arrives funny had a feeling he was on his way  
  
We raise our hats to the strange phenomena  
Soul birds of a feather flock together  
We raise our hats to the hand amoulding us  
Sure nuff he has the answer  
He has the answer  
He has the answer  
Na na na na  
On mani padme  
On mani padme  
On mani padme hum  
  
You pick up a paper you read a name  
You go out it turns up again and again  
You bump into a friend you havent seen  
For a long time  
Then into another you only thought about last night  
  
You hear your sister calling for you  
But you dont know where from  
You know theres something wrong  
But you dont want to believe in a premonition  
  
We raise our hats to the strange phenomena  
Soul birds of a feather flock together  
We raise our hats to the hand amoulding us  
Sure nuff he has the answer  
He has the answer  
He has the answer  
Na na na na  
On mani padme  
On mani padme  
On mani padme hum
