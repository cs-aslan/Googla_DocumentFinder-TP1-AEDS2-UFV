Walking down the Frith Street  
Dawn is creeping up on me  
Some girls tears in a taxi  
Five oclock shadows drinking coffee  
  
So this is what it feels like  
This is how it feels now Im finally smiling on the inside  
This is what it looks like  
This is how it looks from the outside staring in  
  
And its glorious just to laugh like us  
And the world will turn itll never stop  
Cause Ive got nothing to hide  
And weve got nothing to lose oh yeah  
  
And its glorious and its all I see  
On a day like this you know its meant to be  
Now Ive got nothing to find  
And Ive got nothing to lose but you  
And its glorious  
  
Drinking wine back in my house  
Remember someone said your name  
I somehow lost the conversation  
Ive fallen a million miles away  
  
So this is what it feels like  
This is how it feels when youre finally walking on the inside  
This is what it looks like  
This is how it looks from the outside staring in  
  
And its glorious just to laugh like us  
And the world will turn itll never stop  
Cause Ive got nothing to hide  
And weve got nothing to lose oh yeah  
  
And its glorious yeah its all I see  
On a day like this you know its meant to be  
Cause Ive got nothing to hide  
And Ive got nothing to lose but you  
  
Keep wanting a little a little more  
Keep walking keep walking  
Keep getting a little a little more  
Keep running keep running  
  
Ooh walking down the Frith Street  
  
And its glorious just to laugh like us  
And the world will turn will never never stop  
Cause Ive got nothing to hide  
And weve got nothing to lose oh yeah  
  
And its glorious and its all I see  
On a day like this I know its meant to be  
Cause Ive got nothing to find  
And Ive got nothing to lose but you  
And its glorious
