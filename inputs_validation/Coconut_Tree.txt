Everybodys got a place they go  
When the old battery gets running low  
Im a sucker for the sand and sea yea  
If I had my way hey Id always be  
  
Way up high in a coconut tree  
Layin low just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High up in a coconut tree  
  
Not to green not too brown  
I shimmy up and I shake the good ones down  
Coconuts a couple of bucks a piece  
And you can do alright if you aint afraid to be  
  
High in a coconut tree  
Layin low just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High in a coconut tree  
  
Yeah theres less stress and the worlds alright  
Its a different point of view  
When youre looking at life  
  
Way up high in a coconut tree  
Layin low low just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High up in a coconut  
  
High in a coconut tree  
Layin low just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High in a coconut tree  
  
High in a coconut tree  
Layin low just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High in a coconut tree  
  
Layin low just my baby and me Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High in a coconut tree

High up in a coconut tree
