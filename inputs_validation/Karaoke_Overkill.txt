Were all so chic living in class A  
Partying and search sweet sorrow today  
When you dont know who your friends are  
And neither do they  
Were all so amused  
And maybe its better that way  
Shes been seen with him  
Hes been seen with her  
Happy propaganda  
Just as their 5 current sur  
Sing my way of meaning  
Karaoke overkill  
  
We all should know better  
But I bet we never will  
Were insecure making me think  
Im not fit to laze your dream  
Ive seen you in my bayer  
Youre a real player  
Taking it easy taking it easy  
We all know we shouldnt  
And that is why we do it  
Heres smugglers house  
Why dont you come and view it  
Sing my way of meaning  
Karaoke overkill  
  
We all should know better  
But I bet we never will  
The sooner the better  
Ill send you a letter  
  
Hanging with your sister  
Playing naked twister  
Down to your joker  
Playing strip poker  
Give us a clue of  
Seeing the night thru  
And youre so kain  
This song aint about you  
  
Hanging with your sister  
Playing naked twister  
Down to your joker  
Playing strip poker
