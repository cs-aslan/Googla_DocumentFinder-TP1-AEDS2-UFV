Youve been passed around from hand to hand  
Cast upon the darkest sands  
Now youre so confused that you can hardly stand  
Forgotten youve forgotten now youre on the run  
Forgotten youve forgotten  
How to live beneath the sun  
How to live beneath the sun  
  
Before you left I thought I knew  
That you would always need me too  
I never thought someday that Id be telling you  
Youve forgotten youve forgotten  
The things you used to feel  
Forgotten youve forgotten  
How to smile for real  
How to smile for real  
  
And for the changes you have made  
Your beauty was the price you paid  
All your dreams rose up and then you watched them fade  
Youve forgotten youve forgotten  
Youve forgotten youve forgotten  
The best is always yet to come  
The best is always yet to come  
The best is always yet to come  
And how to live beneath the sun
