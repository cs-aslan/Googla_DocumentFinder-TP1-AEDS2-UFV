Go and join the army  
Said the father to the son  
See the world around you boy  
And learn to use a gun  
Think youre something special  
Well well make you just the same  
Theres nothing wrong in dying  
After all its just a game  
Just a game  
  
Read the morning paper  
Theres a picture of a cross  
we were proud in them days  
By the way I think you lost  
Trust me when I tell you boy  
That god is on our side  
Even Jesus cheers us on  
Against the other side  
Against the other side  
  
He who shouts the loudest  
Is the one whos in control  
We who never listen  
Are the ones who pay the toll  
Tell us that its time at last  
To make a final stand  
Im glad cause all I wanted  
Was to kill another man  
Just to kill another man
