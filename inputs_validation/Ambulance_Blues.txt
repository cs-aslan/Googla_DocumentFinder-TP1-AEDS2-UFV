Back in the old folky days  
The air was magic when we played  
The riverboat was rockin in the rain  
Midnight was the time for the raid  
  
Oh Isabela proud Isabela  
They tore you down and plowed you under  
Youre only real with your makeup on  
How could I see you and stay too long  
  
All along the Navajo Trail  
Burnouts stub their toes on garbage pails  
Waitresses are cryin in the rain  
Will their boyfriends pass this way again  
  
Oh Mother Goose shes on the skids  
Sure aint happy neither are the kids  
She needs someone that she can scream at  
And Im such a heel for makin her feel so bad  
  
I guess Ill call it sickness gone  
Its hard to say the meaning of this song  
An ambulance can only go so fast  
Its easy to get buried in the past  
When you try to make a good thing last  
  
I saw today in the entertainment section  
Theres room at the top for private detection  
To Mom and Dad this just doesnt matter  
But its either that or pay off the kidnapper  
  
So all you critics sit alone  
Youre no better than me for what youve shown  
With your stomach pump and your hook and ladder dreams  
We could get together for some scenes  
  
I never knew a man could tell so many lies  
He had a different story for every set of eyes  
How can he remember who hes talkin to  
Cause I know it aint me and I hope it isnt you  
  
Well Im up in TO keepin jive alive  
And out on the corner its half past five  
But the subways are empty  
And so are the cafes  
  
Except for the Farmers Market  
And I still can hear him say  
Youre all just pissin in the wind  
You dont know it but you are  
  
And there aint nothin like a friend  
Who can tell you youre just pissin in the wind  
  
I never knew a man could tell so many lies  
He had a different story for every set of eyes  
How can he remember who hes talking to  
Cause I know it aint me and hope it isnt you
