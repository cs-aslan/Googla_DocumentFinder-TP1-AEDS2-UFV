I dont mind the abuse  
It fills in time  
When Im not much use  
But its killing me killing me slowly  
  
They all say  
Im too restless  
But words cut deep  
When youre defenceless  
And theyre killing me but killing me slowly  
  
There was a time when we were fine  
And I could tolerate you  
I do believe that you should leave  
Cause Ive grown to hate you  
Should I be weak and turn my cheek  
Cause Im scared to fall  
But I just dont know you  
And you dont know me at all  
  
Ive been told that loves a celebration  
But Ive lost faith through frustration  
And its killing me but killing me slowly  
  
You paint my picture black  
The jokes on me  
And I dont wanna laugh  
Remember the good times  
Wont you bring them back someday somehow  
  
I dont mind feeling blue  
If I could smile just like you do  
And its killing me killing me slowly  
  
I cant go on alone  
Pretending nothings wrong  
Maybe I just want to belong  
Somewhere somehow somehow
