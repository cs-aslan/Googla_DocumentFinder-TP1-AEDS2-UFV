You used to float just like a boat upon the tide  
You used to run when things were done you used to hide  
You talk of ships you talk of boats you talk of games  
And now youre down you aint around its such a shame  
  
Cause you got something to give  
Something to hold onto  
Why dont you live  
And you just forget about fixing up fate  
Maybe youd stop pick yourself up  
Now its too late Oh  
It aint easy when you fall  
It aint easy when you fall  
It aint easy when you fall  
No it aint no good at all  
  
You didnt know this world aint slow you gotta move  
You made no sound I watched you drown I watched you loose  
Your loneliness you knew it best but its a drag  
Cause in the end I lost a friend I feel so sad  
  
Cause you had something to give  
Something to hold onto  
Why did you live  
If you just forgot about fixing up fate  
Youd be here youd be near  
Now its too late Oh  
It aint easy when you fall  
It aint easy when you fall  
It aint easy when you fall  
No it aint no good at all  
  
Oh oh hey  
It aint easy when you fall
