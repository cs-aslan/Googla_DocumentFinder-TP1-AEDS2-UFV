If its wrong to love you wrong Ill alway be  
Though the world may scorn me darling cant you see  
If its wrong to want you when my day is through  
Gladly I will pay for all my dreams of you  
Though we met too late dear and youll never know  
That without a right to I have loved you so  
I cant change my heart dear youre a part of me  
If its wrong to love you wrong Ill always be  
Though we met too late dear
