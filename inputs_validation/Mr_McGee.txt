I made my head touch my hands  
And its right on me yeah  
I touched the night now its gone  
Felt it right on me yeah  
  
Im runnin hard and the dust  
Now its right on me yeah  
Im riding blind  
And these words are all over me  
  
Chorus  
Oh lost them in the forest  
Oh dawn is almost on us  
Oh spell is gettin stronger  
Oh  
  
Cause my mamas and my daddys  
The wishin that Im wishing too  
Down the well theres nothing that wet  
And its all in my head  
Hear what I heard  
If I didnt dream I dont care  
  
Im thinkin of your style  
I know that spell even the way that  
You  
You gimme what I want  
That kinda thing and that feeling  
So right so right  
Feels good feels good  
Still feel it still feel it  
On me on me  
I feel I feel  
Its on me its on me  
Sorry  
  
Ive worked these hands  
And prepared now its right on me  
  
Chorus  
  
The wishin that Im wishing too  
Down the well theres nothing that wet  
And its all in my head  
Hear what I heard  
If I didnt dream I dont care  
  
So right so right  
Feels good feels good  
Still feel it still feel it  
On me on me

So excited so excited  
See the sun see the sun

Feels good feels good  
Still feel it still feel it  
On me on me
