Ill say goodbye for now  
All this love burns away  
Did you love for long  
Ill let the boys come in  
Theyll crawl for you  
Here am I  
Not talking  
Here am I  
Not sleeping  
Here am I  
Theres no more I can do  
Here am I  
Theres no more I can say  
Here am I  
Not talking  
Here am I  
Not sleeping  
Here am I  
Theres no more I can do  
Here am I  
Theres no more I can say to you  
Im so tired of this  
Please send in someone else  
You play games with me  
But did you win  
How do you feel
