I I can feel the Spirit when it moves down in my soul  
As it comes to make me whole  
I said I I can feel the power as it washes over me  
As it comes to set me free  
Said I I glow nothing can erase the healing  
Nothing can replace the feeling  
Said I I know theres a real move deep inside  
And its too divine to hide say  
If you open up your heart open your mind  
If you give it all away what you will find  
Throw your hands in the air and close your eyes  
And you can never get enough  
Of the love and the power youll receive  
When you fall down and you hit your knees  
So amazing what your eyes will see  
If youre ready when the Spirit moves  
I I can feel the Spirit  
When we bow our heads in prayer  
Let the Lord just take us there  
And I know aint nothin quite the same  
As the fire thats in the place  
When we call upon His name Im telling you  
Cant run and you cant hide  
No need to try at all  
Itll bring a change inside  
When the anointing falls  
Dont need no other high  
Cant get no higher I know  
Dont let it pass you by  
Let the Lord take control  
If you open up your heart open your mind  
If you give it all away what you will find  
Throw your hands in the air and close your eyes  
And you can never get enough  
Of the love and the power youll receive  
When you fall down and you hit your knees  
So amazing what your eyes will see  
If youre ready when the Spirit moves  
If you open up your heart open your mind  
If you give it all away what you will find  
Throw your hands in the air and close your eyes  
And you can never get enough  
Of the love and the power youll receive  
When you fall down and you hit your knees  
So amazing what your eyes will see  
If youre ready when the Spirit moves  
Ooh and when the Spirit falls hear Him call  
You know you should answer go ahead and let go  
Let God take control of your soul  
Know theres nothing better when the Spirit falls let go  
Let God just take control  
You know you should answer cause you  
You cant run and you cant hide  
No need to try at all  
Itll bring a change inside  
When the anointing falls  
Dont need no other high  
Cant get no higher I know  
Dont let it pass you by  
Let the Lord take control  
If you open up your heart open your mind  
If you give it all away what you will find  
Throw your hands in the air and close your eyes  
And you can never get enough  
Of the love and the power youll receive  
When you fall down and you hit your knees  
So amazing what your eyes will see  
If youre ready when the Spirit moves  
If you open up your heart open your mind  
If you give it all away what you will find  
Throw your hands in the air and close your eyes  
And you can never get enough  
Of the love and the power youll receive  
When you fall down and you hit your knees  
So amazing what your eyes will see  
If youre ready when the Spirit moves  
If you open up your heart open your mind  
If you give it all away what you will find  
Throw your hands in the air and close your eyes  
And you can never get enough  
Of the love and the power youll receive  
When you fall down and you hit your knees  
So amazing what your eyes will see  
If youre ready when the Spirit moves
