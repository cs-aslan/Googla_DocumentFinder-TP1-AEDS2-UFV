I dont know what you say  
Every single holy day  
Never in my life I see  
How can it be whats it for me  
  
I know that you know that we know that you know  
Every whats his name  
I know that you know that we know that you know  
What how can it be  
Taking a tumble you know a tumble that you take a tumble  
Its not like this  
Cos Im falling down the stairs Help me cos Ive got no grip oh help me
please  
And I fall  
  
She left me I cant see  
Im blind  
Help me Im so strong  
And then I lose my mind  
I want to be there but you cannot see me with I know whats in your head  
  
I know that you know that we know that you know  
Every whats his name  
I know that you know that we know that you know  
What how can it be  
Taking a tumble you know a tumble that you take a tumble  
Its not like this  
Cos Im falling down the stairs Help me cos Ive got no grip  
And I fall
