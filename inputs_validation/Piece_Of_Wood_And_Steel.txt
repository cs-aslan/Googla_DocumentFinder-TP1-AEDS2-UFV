I can feel your arms around me like it was yesterday  
I can feel your breathing next to me and hear your laughter gay  
You tried to tell me what was right and I told you what was real  
All I ever live for now is this piece of wood and steel  
  
In a world thats full of trouble a world thats full of pain  
Lord many fall beside the road and they never rise again  
Many more are bending low or broken at the wheel  
All I need to carry on is this piece of wood and steel  
  
I was born my mothers only son she loves me all she can  
But there isnt much to say to her since I became a man  
And I often met the devil but I never made a deal  
I just thank the Lord for hands to play this piece of wood and steel  
  
Its face is scarred and beaten like the ragged clothes I wear  
Like the body that God gave me I might give it better care  
But I play it for the ladies and I play it for a meal  
I play the strings just to hear em ring of this piece of wood and steel  
  
Im growing tired of searching now theres nothing much I crave  
Give or take a little time and you can write it on my grave  
Theres nothing more I care to own nothing left to feel  
All I ever wanted was this piece of wood and steel  
  
I can feel your arms around me like it was yesterday  
I can feel your breathing next to me and hear your laughter gay  
You tried to tell me what was right and I told you what was real  
All I ever live for now is this piece of wood and steel  
In a world thats full of trouble a world thats full of pain  
Lord many fall beside the road and they never rise again  
Many more are bending low or broken at the wheel  
All I need to carry on is this piece of wood and steel  
  
I was born my mothers only son she loves me all she can  
But there isnt much to say to her since I became a man  
And I often met the devil but I never made a deal  
I just thank the Lord for hands to play this piece of wood and steel  
Ill be playing this guitar till the day I die
