I live my life like theres no tomorrow  
And all Ive got I had to steal  
Least I dont need to beg or borrow  
Yes Im living at a pace that kills  
Runnin with the devil  
Runnin with the devil  
I found the simple life aint so simple  
When I jumped out on that road  
I got no love no love youd call real  
Aint got nobody waiting at home  
Runnin with the devil  
Runnin with the devil  
You know I I found the simple life werent so simple no  
When I jumped out on that road  
Got no love no love youd call real  
Got nobody waiting at home  
Runnin with the devil  
Runnin with the devil  
Runnin with the devil  
Runnin with the devil  
repeat and fade
