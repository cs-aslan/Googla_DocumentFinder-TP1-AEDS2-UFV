Cold late night so long ago  
When I was not so strong you know  
A pretty man came to me  
I never seen eyes so blue  
You know I could not run away it seemed  
Wed seen each other in a dream  
Seemed like he knew me he looked right through me yeah  
  
Come on home girl he said with a smile  
you dont have to love me yet lets get high awhile  
But try to understand try to understand  
Try try try to understand Im a magic man  
  
Winter nights we sang in tune  
Played inside the months of moon  
Never think of neverlet this spell last forever  
Well summer lover passed to fall  
Tried to realize it all  
Mama says shes worried growing up in a hurry  
  
Come on home girl Mama cried on the phone  
Too soon to lose my baby yet my girl should be at home  
But try to understand try to understand  
Try try try to understand hes a magic man Mama ah  
Hes a magic man  
  
Come on home girl he said with a smile  
I cast my spell of love on you a woman from a child  
But try to understand try to understand  
Oh oh try try try to understand  
Hes a magic man oh hes got the magic hands  
  
Ohs over top  
  
Come on home girl he said with a smile  
You dont have to love me yet lets get high awhile  
But try to understand try to understand  
Try try try to understand hes a magic man yeah oh
