Summer  
Not a bit of breeze  
Neon signs are shining  
Through the tired trees  
Lovers  
Walking to and fro  
Everyone has someone  
And a place to go  
Now listen  
Hear the cars go past  
They dont even see me  
Flying by so fast  
Moving  
Going who knows where  
Only thing I know is  
Im not going there  
Where do you go  
When you feel that your brain is on fire  
Where do you go when you dont even know  
What it is you desire  
Listen  
Laughter everywhere  
Hear it  
Life is in the air  
As the night comes  
And the town awaits  
Sound o children calling  
And the squeal of brakes  
Music  
But a lonely sound  
When you cant help wondring  
Where do I belong
