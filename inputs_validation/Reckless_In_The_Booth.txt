Hook x 2  
My juice is 900 proof  
Only message to the youth  
Im reckless in the booth  
  
I tell you no lies please recognize  
Ill tear your monkey ass to pieces and prize  
Niggas realize its not a disguise  
This hardcore shit will make your home girl strip  
Make you wanna take a sip of that red cup  
Guess what rest up dont give a fuck  
Never did small shit is irrelevant  
Heaven knows only live for the hell of it  
Know the elephant hate anything celibate  
Dont really give a damn what I tell a bitch  
Home going to the moon might see you soon  
Try to get that outlaw out the saloon  
Hear the click clack first then you hear the boom  
Get the fuck off my clap mushroom  
Get out my face before I drop you  
Dont try to gamble with Earl Campbell  
I scramble your eggs boy  
Replace your arms with your motherfucking legs boy  
They call me Dexter David Hester Clyde Drexler  
Mma yous a wrestler

Thats what happen when you get something from nothing  
Any motherfuckers that wanna kick it done out in public  
No Im g motherfucker and its good to be home  
And I say sorry for the wait but I was burning the throne  
Its time to take shit got no time for the hate bitch  
They talk shit cause they aint shit  
Its that rise of the ape shit  
With no cesar catch me rocking the pro  
Like Im on that number 8 shit  
Niggas in the back wit their traps upon their hats  
And they guess they pack all black  
Theyll take your racks on racks on racks nigga  
Thank god the gangsters back  
And we aint gotta put up with this brainless rap  
Oh my goodness ong and Im reckless in the booth  
And I aint never been less than the truth motherfucker
