You call my name then you run for protection  
I reach out to hold ya but its just a reflection  
Throught the looking glass  
  
Now youve been looking at your life through a mirror  
Its time you started seeing things a little bit clearer than  
Through the looking glass  
  
Watch me break through girl  
I still love you girl  
  
I think you love me by the way you come on girl  
Then I turn away for a minute youre gone girl  
Through the looking glass  
  
Ahh  
Youre looking through me  
Like you never knew me  
  
Ive got some things that Im tryin to show ya  
But you fade away how can I get to know ya  
Through the looking glass
