Its time to pack our bags and hit the highway  
And head on back for Christmas holiday  
Ill fall apart when I pull in the driveway  
Its my first time home since brother passed away  
  
His favorite time was always Christmas  
Wed reminisce about the days gone by  
Oh how I wish that he were still here with us  
My memories of him will never die  
  
When the stockings are hung  
Silent Night has been sung  
And Christmas is finally here  
It wont be the same this year  
  
Losing my big brother hurt so badly  
Its helped me learn what Christmas really means  
Theres nothing more important than your family  
Well all the children of the King of Kings  
  
So when the stockings are hung  
Silent Night has been sung  
And Christmas is finally here  
It wont be the same this year  
  
When the stockings are hung  
Silent Night has been sung  
And Christmas is finally here  
It wont be the same this year
