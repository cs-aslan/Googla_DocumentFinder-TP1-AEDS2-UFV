I was lost until You found me  
You came and rescued me  
The day You set me free  
I was looking for something  
  
I will follow You  
Everyday Im running after You  
  
I want to tell You how I feel  
I never felt this way before  
You make me wanna dance like  
Theres no tomorrow  
  
After all the things Youve done for me  
Ive got to tell You now  
You make me wanna shout  
Like theres no tomorrow  
  
Now Im found  
Your grace has saved me  
I give my life to You  
Nothing else Id rather do  
Cause Im living it for You  
  
Ive got to tell You  
What Im feeling  
Ive got to shout  
And praise Your name  
  
Ive got to tell You  
What Im feeling  
Ive got to shout  
Like theres no tomorrow  
  
Like theres no tomorrow
