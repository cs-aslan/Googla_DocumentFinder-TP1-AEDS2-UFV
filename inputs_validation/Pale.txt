The world seems not the same  
though I know nothing has changed  
Its all my state of mind  
I cant leave it all behind  
I have stand up to be stronger  
  
Chorus  
I have to try to break free  
from the thoughts in my mind  
Use the time that I have  
I cant say goodbye  
have to make it right  
Have to fight cause I know  
in the end its worthwhile  
that the pain that I feel slowly fades away  
It will be alright  
  
I know should realize  
time is precious it is worthwhile  
Despite how I feel inside  
have to trust it will be alright  
Have to stand up to be stronger  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh this night is too long  
I have no strength to go on  
No more pain Im floating away  
Through the mist I see the face  
of an angel who calls my name  
I remember youre the reason I have to stay  
  
Chorus
