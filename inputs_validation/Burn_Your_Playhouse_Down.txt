Ive got an achin in my heart  
Arson on my mind  
Im gonna burn your playhouse down  
Ive got a badly broken heart  
Ive bad it from the start  
Youre giving me the run around  
Now if you play with fire  
Its asure to burn  
Ive beard this all of my life  
Go on be on your way Ive bad my say  
Well honey Im through with you for life  
Youll find Im theres one in every yard  
Im getting mighty tired  
Im gonna burn your playhouse down  
Now dont pretend that this is the end  
cause this time were really through  
While you were runflin round  
Burning up the town  
I was settin a trap for you  
Ive got an achin in my heart  
Arson on my mind  
Im gonna burn your playhouse down
