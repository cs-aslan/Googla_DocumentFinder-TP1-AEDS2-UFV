Bells around St Petersburg  
When I saw you  
  
I hope I get what you deserve  
And this is where I find  
  
Smoke surrounds your perfect face  
And Im falling  
  
Pushing a broom out into space  
And this where I find the way  
  
Chorus  
The stadium arcadium  
A mirror to the moon a mirror to the moon  
Well Im forming and Im warning  
State of the art  
Until the clouds come crashing  
  
Stranger things have happened  
Both before and after noon before and after noon  
Well Im forming and Im warning  
Pushin myself  
And no I dont mind asking  
Now  
  
Alone inside my forest room  
And its storming  
  
I never thought Id be in bloom  
But this is where I start  
  
Derelict days and the stereo plays  
For the all night crowd  
That it cannot phase  
And Im calling  
  
Tedious weeds that the media breeds  
But the animal gets what the animal needs  
And Im sorry  
  
Chorus  
  
Stranger things have happened  
Both before and after noon before and after noon  
Well Im forming and Im warming  
Pushin myself  
And no I dont mind asking  
Now  
  
And this is where I find  
  
Rays of dust that wrap around  
Your citizen  
  
Kind enough to disavow  
And this is where I stand  
  
Chorus  
  
Stranger things have happened  
Both before and after noon before and after noon  
Well Im forming and Im warning  
Pushin myself  
And no I dont mind asking  
  
The stadium arcadium  
A mirror to the moon a mirror to the moon  
Well Im forming and Im warning  
State of the art  
Until the clouds come crashing  
  
Stranger things have happened  
Both before and after noon before and after noon  
Well Im forming and Im warning  
To you
