Saturday evening  
  
A narrow path runs along the river  
From the burial ground you might see it  
Leading to a temple of secrets  
Where they meet once a week  
To dance and feast  
  
Lula is dancing to the voodoo drums  
Twisting turning round and round  
  
She is ready to receive the LOA  
She is ready for the God  
This one is Damballah  
  
Voodoo voodoo voodoo  
Voodoo voodoo voodoo  
Total emptiness inside  
As Damballah gets ready for her ride  
  
Casting out from Lulas head  
One of two souls that seems to be dead  
Traveling deep in a trance  
Lulas legs are getting weak  
The LOA has seized its horse  
  
Lula is not the one thats speaking now  
Lula is not the one thats lying now  
  
Drink drink girl drink the chickens blood  
Drink drink girl drink and feed the God  
  
If this is all you think they do oh you better think again  
Cause there is so much more to voodoo oh than meets the eye  
  
Voodoo voodoo voodoo  
Voodoo voodoo voodoo  
  
Human hair on waxen dools pins through their knees  
Pins through their little heads and through their bellics  
Ahh theyre coming to get you theyre coming for you  
Ahh theyre coming to get you theyre coming for you now  
  
Voodoo voodoo voodoo  
Voodoo voodoo voodoo Voodoo
