First Verse  
I gather myself and try to write nicely but I aint feelin that way  
Id rather write raps that incite fights riots and melees  
And they say All XRaided rhyme about is peelin caps  
Prison crap fuckin bitches gettin high and killin cats  
But Im insistin that Im spittin facts  
And yall niggas is spittin lies to feel alive  
While Im livin in prison  
Couldnt feel that Im committin convictions  
What the Hell am I supposed to write  
How could I compose nice  
When Im sittin in this cell at night like  
And steadily socializin with  
Every soldier sodomist murderer rapist  
Burgler racist  
And drug dealers and thug niggas caught up with three strike cases  
Man Im faced with bein in a cage with niggas that love hatred  
That embraced it and can taste it  
And aint feelin no disgrace  
Would be willin to pull your heart out and replace it with a cold one  
More should show love for the young ones to the old ones  
And where they come from is irrelavent  
But theyre gettin here so face it  
Gotta come up in if you think you wouldnt be up in chill  
Revelation I aint got no patience for this fakin  
Hate me and then you can reflect reports straight crip  
Blue and gray bitch  
yall niggas sport pink and turquoise  
Im laced with gunpowder from up out of a 44 caliber   
Say sin see my face sin  
Sick to see cuts and disgrace men  
To replace men but they gotta  
Chorus  
Agree with me  
I just write what I see  
Might not believe in me  
I just write what I see  
I might not like what I see  
But whether its wrong or right  
It aint a song its my life  
I just write what I see  
2x
