Zoo time is she and you time  
The mammals are your favourire type and you want her tonight  
Heartbeat increasing heartbeat  
You hear the thunder of stampeding rhinos elephants and tacky tigers  
This town aint big enough for both of us  
And it aint me whos gonna leave  
Flying domestic flying  
And when the stewardess is near do not show any fear  
Heartbeat increasing heartbeat  
You are a khakicoloured bombadier its Hiroshima that youre nearing  
This town aint big enough for both uf us  
And it aint me whos gonna leave  
Daily exept for Sunday  
You dawdle in to the cafe where you meet her each day  
Heartbeat increasing heartbeat  
As twenty cannibals have hold of you they nead their protein just like you do  
This town aint big enough for both uf us  
And it aint me whos gonna leave  
Shower another shower  
Youve got to look your best for her and be clean everywhere  
Heartbeat increasing heartbeat  
The rain is pouring on the foreign town the bullets cannot cut you down  
This town aint big enough for both of us  
And it aint me whos gonna leave  
Census the latest census  
Therell be more girls who live in town though not enough to go ground  
Hearbeat increasing heartbeat  
You know that   
This town isnt big enough  
Not big enough for both of us  
This town isnt big enough  
Not big enough for both of us  
And I aint gonna leave
