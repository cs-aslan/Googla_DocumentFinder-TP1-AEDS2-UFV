Lord have mercy Feel so good  
I think Im gonna work  
  
I was talking to the judge just before we left the countryside  
Piece of paper in his hand tryin to find the way  
Tryin to rip it out well now Ive got it all around  
Tore the pages up before they brought the curtain down  
  
I remember the day the Drumshanbo Hustle  
When you couldnt hear a bird it was making not a sound  
They were trying to muscle in an easy way to bring the money in  
You were puking up your guts  
When you looked at the standard contract you just signed  
  
Prostitution on the run cepting when it was soliciting  
Tryin to drain them all dry got hung up by the rope  
Magazines and books clearly undefinable  
Wiped the clean slate and pulled the rug from underneath her feet  
  
I remember the day the Drumshanbo Hustle  
When you couldnt hear no birds cause they were making not a sound  
They were trying to muscle in the recording and the publishing  
You were puking up your guts  
When you read the standard contract you just signed alright  
  
New York hooker by the neck reads your Tarot cards and astronomy  
Hey I want to get your stars but dont know your sign  
It was taking time to get the message through to it  
But will hand down shake you one and a letter five T rhyme  
No sign poker  
  
Oh remember the day the Drumshanbo Hustle  
Couldnt hear a bird Lord you couldnt hear no sound  
They were trying to muscle in  
On the gigs and the recording and the publishing  
You were puking up your guts  
When you read the standard contract you just signed  
You were puking up your guts  
When you read the standard contract that you signed  
You were puking up your guts  
When you read the standard contract you just signed
