Everyday when I look in the mirror  
I try to see where my souls at now  
Happy day is it further or nearer  
On the way will I find it somehow  
  
Yesterdays gone  
Love lead me on oh  
I wont ask why  
  
Roll away its only time and the river  
Roll away to the endless sea  
Roll away it could all change tomorrow  
This is life in its glory  
And the river runs free  
Roll away  
  
My dreams build the walls of the city  
Broken hearts tear them all down  
It aint always easy and pretty  
Its just the world turning around  
Give us this day  
Give us this night oh  
Itll be all right  
  
Roll away its only time and the river  
Roll away to the endless sea  
Roll away it could all change tomorrow  
This is life in its glory  
And the river runs free  
Oh roll away  
  
Everyday when I look in the mirror  
I try to see where my souls at now  
  
Roll away its only time and the river  
Roll away to the endless sea  
Roll away it could all change tomorrow  
This is life in its glory  
And the river runs free  
  
Roll away its only time and the river  
Roll away to the endless sea  
Roll away it could all change tomorrow  
This is life in its glory  
And the river runs free  
Roll away ahh oh  
Ahh ha ho
