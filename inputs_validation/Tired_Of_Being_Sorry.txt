I dont know why  
You want to follow me tonight  
When in the rest of the world  
With whom Ive crossed and Ive quarreled  
Lets me down so  
For a thousand reasons that I know  
To share forever the unrest  
With all the demons I possess  
Beneath the silver moon  
  
Maybe you were right  
But baby I was lonely  
I dont want to fight  
Im tired of being sorry  
  
Eighth and Ocean Drive  
With all the vampires and their brides  
Were all bloodless and blind  
And longing for a life  
Beyond the silver moon  
  
Maybe you were right  
But baby I was lonely  
I dont want to fight  
Im tired of being sorry  
  
Im standing in the street  
Crying out for you  
No one sees me  
But the silver moon  
  
So far away  
So outer space  
Ive trashed myself  
Ive lost my way  
Ive got to get to you got to get to you  
  
Maybe you were right  
But baby I was lonely  
I dont want to fight  
Im tired of being sorry  
  
Im standing in the street  
Crying out for you  
No one sees me  
But the silver moon  
  
Maybe you were right  
But baby I was lonely  
I dont want to fight  
Im tired of being sorry  
  
Im standing in the street  
Crying out for you  
No one sees me  
But the silver moon
