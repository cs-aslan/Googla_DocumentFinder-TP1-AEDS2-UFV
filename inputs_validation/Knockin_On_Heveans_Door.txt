Oooohh oooohhh  
  
  
Momma take this badge off of me  
I cant use it anymore  
Its getting dark too dark to see  
Feels like Im knockin on heavens door  
  
Chorus  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
  
  
Momma put my guns in the ground  
I cant shoot them anymore  
That long black cloud is coming down  
I feel like Im knockin on heavens door  
  
Chorus  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
yaaa yaaa  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
  
  
Ooooooooooooohhhhhh
