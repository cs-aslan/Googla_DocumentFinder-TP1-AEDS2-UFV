Look in the mirror and what do you see  
Reflections of a person that used to be  
Youre running round town creating bad debts   
Lets face it baby your life is a mess  
Youre driving fast now and speeding again   
Thatll never help you ease the pain  
Theres nothing in a bottle you can take from the shelf  
Thatll bring you back to earth cause you need help  
  
The angels have mercy on you  
But they cant stop you doing what you wanna do  
May the angels have mercy on you   
Im gonna help you pull through  
Now youre headed down a oneway street   
Let the needle return  
Ive been there who you meet  
Watch out youre gonna get burned  
You cant blame me for the mess youre in   
All your life youve been fooling yourself  
Ill help you if I can   
You know Ill be there  
Lifes too sweet to show this lack of care  
  
The angels have mercy on you  
But they cant stop you doing what you wanna do  
May the angels have mercy on you   
Im gonna help you pull through  
  
Take a look a look at yourself three times  
As the angels have mercy on you
