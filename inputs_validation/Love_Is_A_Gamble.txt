Love Is A Gamble  
  
Back when I was still in school  
I got taught as a rule  
That my heart could always fool my head  
So I tripped and fell a lot  
Learning what true love was not  
Till one evening Mama said we ought to talk  
  
She said love is a gamble  
Its a chance that you take  
You lay your heart down  
And you bet it wont break  
You bet your sweet dreams  
Wont get tattered and torn  
But when that happens  
You must shake off those blues  
Just remember youve got nothing to lose  
But youve had true love since the day you were born  
Since the day you were born  
  
Then she told me all she knew  
About what makes true love true  
And it hasnt much to do with heat  
Young hearts race and then grow still  
Passion cools and always will  
But a river just keeps filling up the sea  
  
You see love is a gamble  
Its a chance that you take  
You lay your heart down  
And you bet it wont break  
You bet your sweet dreams  
Wont get tattered and torn  
But when that happens  
You must dream up some more  
When you find it youll have seen it before  
But youve had true love  
Since the day you were born  
  
Love is a gamble  
Its a chance that you take  
To lay your heart down  
And you bet it wont break  
You bet your sweet dreams  
Wont get tattered and torn  
But when that happens  
You must shake off those blues  
And just remember you got nothing to lose  
Youve had true love  
Since the day you were born  
Since the day you were born
