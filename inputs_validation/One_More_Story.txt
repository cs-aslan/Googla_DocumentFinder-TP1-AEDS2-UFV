One more story  
Then its time for bed  
One more fairy tale  
Then rest your weary head  
One more kiss Ill turn out the lights  
Everythings gonna be all right  
Ill still be here when you wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes say goodnight  
Go to sleep now  
Youve had a busy day  
Hold me in your dreams  
I wont be far away  
One more kiss then Ill turn out the lights  
Everythings gonna be all right  
Ill still be here when you wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes say goodnight  
  
I cant believe just how fast youre growing  
Im gonna cry when youre old enough  
To go and be on your own  
But until that very moment  
Everythings gonna be all right  
Youll still be here when I wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes say goodnight  
Everythings gonna be all right
