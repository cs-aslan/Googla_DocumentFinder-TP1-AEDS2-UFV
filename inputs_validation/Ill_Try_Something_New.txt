I will build you a castle with a tower so high  
Till it reaches the moon  
Ill gather melodies from birdies that fly  
And compose you a tune  
Give you lovin as warm as Mamas oven  
And if that dont do  
Then Ill try something new  
Ill try something new  
  
I will take you away with me as far as I can  
To Venus or Mars  
There we will love with your hand in my hand  
Youll be king of the stars  
Every day we can play on the Milky Way  
And if that dont do  
Ill have to try something new  
Ill try something new  
  
I will bring you a flower from the floor of the sea  
To wear in your hair  
Thank you  
Ill do anything and every little thing to make you happy boy  
To show you that I care  
Ill pretend Im jealous of all the fellas  
And if that dont do  
Then Ill try something new  
Ill try something new
