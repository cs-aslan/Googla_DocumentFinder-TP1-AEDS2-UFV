Cathedral bells were tolling  
And our hearts sang on  
Was it the spell of Paris  
Or the April dawn  
Who knows if we shall meet again  
But when the morning chimes ring sweet again  
  
Ill be seeing you  
In all the old familiar places  
That this heart of mine embraces  
  
All day through  
In that small cafe  
The park across the way  
The childrens carousel  
The chestnut tree  
The wishing well  
  
Ill be seeing you  
In every lovely summers day  
In everything thats light and gay  
Ill always think of you that way  
  
Ill find you in the morning sun  
And when the night is new  
Ill be looking at the moon  
But Ill be seeing you
