Im only human baby  
Aint I allowed to make mistakes  
You put your guilt on me  
And its causing my poor heart to break yeah  
Making me the human that I am  
  
Wont you forgive me baby

Your love can be so strong  
It makes it hard to give some back  
So I try and I try and I give and I give  
And I get so darn excited I cant relax  
Making me the human that I am

When we search for love  
We must be lucky baby  
And its because there are many people in the world  
Who think love is not that necessary  
I had you and I blew it all

And its causing my poor heart to break yeah  
Making me the human that I am  
  
And now I know for sure  
I must be lucky baby  
You chose me out of all the people in the world  
And I think love is very necessary  
Youve forgiven me after all  
Cause I let you know

You put your guilt on me  
And its causing my poor heart to break yeah  
Making me the human that I am  
  
Just like you my love
