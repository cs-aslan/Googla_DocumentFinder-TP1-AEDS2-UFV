Safe at harbor everything is easy  
Off to starboard daylight comes up fast  
Now Im restless for the open water  
Red flags are flying fromhe Coast Guard mast  
They told me to stay I heard all the information  
I motored away and steered straight ahead  
Though the weatherman said  
CHORUS  
Theres a storm front coming mood indigo  
White water running and the pressure is low  
Storm front coming mood indigo  
Small craft warning on the radio  
Ive been sailing a long time on this ocean  
Man gets lonesome all those years at sea  
Ive got a woman my life should be easy  
Most men hunger for the life I lead  
The morning was gray but I had the motivation  
I drifted away and ran into more  
Heavy weather off shore  
CHORUS  
Weve got a low pressure system and a northeast breeze  
Weve got a falling barometer and rising seas  
Weve got the cumulonimbus and a possible gale  
Weve got a force nine blowing on the Beaufort scale  
Im still restless for the open water  
Though she gives me everything I need  
She asked me to stay but Id done my navigation  
I drove her away but I should have known  
To stay tied up at home  
CHORUS
