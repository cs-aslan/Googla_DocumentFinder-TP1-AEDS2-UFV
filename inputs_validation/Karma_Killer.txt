Youve been naughtyvery very naughty  
Are you cut up  
Or do you easily forget  
Are you still around  
Why havent you managed to die yet  
You could prop up the bar in hell  
  
How do you sleep  
Youve never loved  
Why was I never good enough  
You thought youd leave me falling forever  
Karma killer  
  
Needless to say  
I guess you know I hate you  
Youre so full of sin  
Even the devil rates you  
I hope you choke  
On your Bacardi and Coke  
  
How do you breathe  
Why dont you cry  
How come you never ask me why  
Youre not a man stand and deliver  
Karma killer  
  
How do you sleep  
Youve never loved  
Why was I never good enough  
You thought youd leave me falling forever  
  
Karma killer

I hope you choke  
On your Bacardi and Coke  
  
Look what you didnt take from me  
Look what you didnt take from me  
Look what you didnt take from me  
Look what you didnt take from me  
  
I dont need to take revenge  
Cos theyre coming to get you  
Theres no hope for you my friend  
Cos theyre coming to get you
