Bell bottom blues you made me cry  
And I dont want to lose this feeling  
And if I could choose a place to die  
Oh it would be in your arms  
  
Chorus  
Do you want to see me crawl  
Across the floor to you do ya wanna  
And do you want to hear me  
Beg you to take me back  
Im beggin baby  
Cause I dont want to fade away  
Give me one more day  
Please I dont want to fade away  
I dont want to fade away  
In your arms I wanna stay  
  
Its all wrong but its all right  
The way that you do me baby  
Once I was strong but I lost the fight  
Whoa and you wont find a better loser  
  
Chorus  
  
Bell bottom blues dont you say goodbye  
Sure were gonna meet again  
And if we when you do  
Dont you be surprised  
If you find me with another lover  
  
Chorus  
  
Wont you  
Wont you give me one more day please
