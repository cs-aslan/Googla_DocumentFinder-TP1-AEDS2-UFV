Oh Ill never find  
Ill never find some one like you  
Girl you take my breath away  
And when Im with someone new  
Id rather be here with you baby forever  
My heart belongs to you  
Cause I think about you all the time  
I know my love is true  
When were together  
I played around girl  
And I made you cry  
When I looked up  
You were saying goodbye  
Im begging you please  
I need you so bad  
Dont leave me now youre the best that Ive had  
Chorus  
Ill never  
Ill never find someone like you  
No Ill never  
That promise is true  
No Ill never  
Ill never find someone like you  
Oh baby  
Cause I love the way that you are  
And girl I wont no  
I wont let you go  
Cause no one could ever do  
Love you like I love you  
All I have is just my heart  
And my feelings I give to you  
Thats all that I can do girl  
Baby forever  
Oh you dont know that youre hurting me  
Cause its not just a sexual thing  
I wanna share my dreams  
Baby together oh  
Girl Im afraid just to give you that but  
My hearts telling me to hold on to my love  
But when you get close  
I want you to know  
I start to get weak  
And I cant let you go  
Chorus  
Just your smile  
Thats all I need  
Tenderness  
Girl I wont let you down  
Girl I will never find no one that compares to you  
Chorus  
Cause no one could ever do  
And I promise to honour you  
Chorus  
Ill never find someone like you
