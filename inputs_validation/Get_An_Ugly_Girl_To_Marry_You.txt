Chorus  
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life  
Never make a pretty woman your wife  
So from my personal point of view  
Get an ugly girl to marry you  
  
Chorus  
  
A pretty woman makes her husband look small  
And very often causes his downfall  
As soon as he marries her then she starts  
To do the things that will break his heart  
  
But if you make an ugly woman your wife  
Youll be happy for the rest of your life  
An ugly woman cooks meals all the time  
Shell always give you peace of mind  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont let your friends say you have no taste  
Go ahead and marry anyway  
Her face is ugly her eyes dont match  
Take it from me shes a better catch  
  
Chorus  
  
Say man  
Hey baby  
I saw your wife the other day  
Yeah  
Yeah and shes sure is ugly Ha  
Yeah shes ugly but she sure can cook baby  
Yeah alright  
Unfortunately she has acne  
Thats a shame baby  
Yeah baby
