Matter of fact youre on the right track  
My future looks black and blue  
Didnt take long to see I was wrong  
That I still got it strong for you  
Ill come running yeah  
If you want me to  
Ill come running yeah  
Cause Im done in yeah without you  
Id give my last shirt  
To take back the words  
That brought all that hurt upon her  
Both made mistakes  
Had some bad breaks  
But weve got what it takes to go on  
Ill come running yeah  
If you want me to  
Ill come running yeah  
Cause Im done in yeah without you  
Ill come running yeah  
If you want me to  
Ill come running yeah  
Cause Im done in yeah without you
