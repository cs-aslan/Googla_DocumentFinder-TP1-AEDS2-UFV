Once my lover now my friend  
What a cruel thing to pretend  
What a cunning way to condescend  
Once my lover and now my friend  
  
Oh you creep up like the clouds  
And you set my soul at ease  
Then you let your love abound  
And you bring me to my knees  
  
Oh its evil babe the way you let your grace enrapture me  
When well you know Id be insane  
To ever let that dirty game recapture me  
You made me a Shadowboxer baby  
  
I want to be ready for what you do  
Ive been swinging all around me  
Cause I dont know when youre gonna make your move  
Oh your gaze is dangerous  
  
And you fill your space so sweet  
If I let you get to close  
Youll set your spell on me  
So darlin I just want to say  
  
Just in case I dont come through  
I was on to every play  
I just wanted you  
Oh its so evil my love  
  
The way youve no reverence to my concern  
So Ill be sure to stay wary of you love  
To save the pain  
Of once my flame and twice my burn
