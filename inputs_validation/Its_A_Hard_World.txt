I live in a vacumn no air  
Im stuck in back room somewhere  
But it dont bother me amyway cause I know  
Goin to get out soon I got places to go  
  
Theres a big world waiting for me  
I just need a break someone to believe  
but right now Im just tryin to survive  
Livin rough shackin up hangin tough shapin up  
  
Get the picture get the scene I paint fo ryou  
Ah but its worth it all the pain Im goin through  
Beat the sidewalk hear the fast talk everyday  
I dont worry cause I know Im on my way  
  
The view from my window aint too good  
Should be some mail for me soon from Hollywood  
When the phone rings could be big things anytime  
Operator is there somethin wrong with this line  
  
Rejections Ive had a few  
Happens to the best it aint nothin new  
Still I keep on swingin away  
Sgonna be a breakthrough any day  
  
Keep hanging in there thats my philosophy  
And soon Ill find my big chance wait and see  
Some make it fast but they just come and go  
Me Im built to last and thats one thing I know  
  
Those straight life people they dont understand  
Yeah they just want it all laid out and planned  
Me Im not like them I do things my own way  
I know Im gonna break through any day  
  
Life in the city can get you down  
Theres amillion guys out there all snooping around  
You gotta think youre the best beat out all the rest  
And fight your way up to the top of the town  
  
Theres a big world waiting for me  
I just need a break someone to believe  
Right now Im just tryin to survive  
Im know Im gonna get there dead or alive  
  
Im going to reach for the moon  
And all the stars too  
Im gonna get there real soon I know I will  
I want the universe and all the planers too
