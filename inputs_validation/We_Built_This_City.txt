Chorus  
We built this city we built this city on rock an roll  
Built this city we built this city on rock an roll  
  
Say you dont know me or recognize my face  
Say you dont care who goes to that kind of place  
Knee deep in the hoopla sinking in your fight  
Too many runaways eating up the night  
  
Marconi plays the mamba listen to the radio dont you remember  
We built this city we built this city on rock an roll  
  
Chorus  
  
Someones always playing corporation games  
Who cares theyre always changing corporation names  
We just want to dance here someone stole the stage  
They call us irresponsible write us off the page  
  
Marconi plays the mamba listen to the radio dont you remember  
We built this city we built this city on rock an roll  
  
Chorus  
  
Its just another Sunday in a tired old street  
Police have got the choke hold oh then we just lost the beat  
  
Who counts the money underneath the bar  
Who rides the wrecking ball into our guitars  
Dont tell us you need us cause were just simple fools  
Looking for America coming through your schools  
  
Im looking out over that Golden Gate bridge  
Out on a gorgeous sunny Saturday and Im seeing that bumper to bumper traffic  
  
Dont you remember remember  
  
Heres your favorite radio station in your favorite radio city  
The city by the bay the city that rocks the city that never sleeps  
  
Marconi plays the mamba listen to the radio dont you remember  
We built this city we built this city on rock an roll
