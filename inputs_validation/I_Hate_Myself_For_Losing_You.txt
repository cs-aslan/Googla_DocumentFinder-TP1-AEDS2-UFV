I woke up today  
Woke up wide awake  
In an empty bed  
Staring at an empty room  
I have myself to blame  
For the state Im in today  
And now dying  
Doesnt seem so cruel  
And oh I dont know what to say  
And I dont know anyway  
Anymore  
  
I hate myself for losing you  
Im seeing it all so clear  
I hate myself for losing you  
What do you do when you look in the mirror  
And staring at you is why hes not here  
  
You got what you deserved  
Hope youre happy now  
Cause everytime I think of her with you  
Its killing me  
Inside and  
Now I dread each day  
Knowing that I cant be saved  
From the loneliness  
Of living without you  
And oh  
I dont know what to do  
Not sure that Ill pull through  
I wish you knew  
  
I hate myself for losing you  
Im seeing it all so clear  
I hate myself for losing you  
What do you do when you look in the mirror  
And staring at you is why hes not here  
  
I hate myself for losing you  
And oh I dont know what to do  
I wish you knew  
And oh I dont know what to say  
And I dont know anyway  
Anymore  
No no  
  
I hate myself for losing you  
Im seeing it all so clear  
Im seeing it all so clear  
I hate myself for losing you  
What do you do when you look in the mirror  
And staring at you is why hes not here  
What do you say when everythings said  
Is the reason why he left you in the end  
How do you cry when every tear you shed  
Wont ever bring him back again  
I hate myself for loving you
