Wine is fine but whiskeys quicker  
Suicide is slow with liquor  
Take a bottle and drown your sorrows  
Then it floods away tomorrows  
  
Evil thoughts and evil doings  
Cold alone you hang in ruins  
Thought that youd escape the reaper  
You cant escape the Master Keeper  
  
Cause you feel like youre living a lie  
Such a shame whos to blame and youre wondering why  
Then you ask from your cask us there life after birth  
What you sow can mean Hell on this earth  
  
Now you live inside a bottle  
The reapers traveling at full throttle  
Its catching you but you dont see  
The reaper is you and the reaper is me  
  
Breaking laws knocking doors  
But theres no one at home  
Made your bed rest your head  
But you lie there and moan  
Where to hide Suicide is the only way out  
Dont you know what its really about  
  
Wine is fine but whiskeys quicker  
Suicide is slow with liquor  
Take a bottle and drown your sorrows  
Then it floods away tomorrows
