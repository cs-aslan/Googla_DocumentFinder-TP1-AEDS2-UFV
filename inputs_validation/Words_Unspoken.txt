Why sing a lonely song  
The whole world knows that love goes wrong  
Why loose a heart that isnt broken  
It isnt broken it can be broken  
  
Lifes just a show for free  
Come along and watch with me  
The only sins are words unspoken  
Words unspoken never spoken  
  
Sweet things come and go  
Give me shame Ill give you wow  
To live for love isnt so easy  
It isnt easy it wont be easy  
  
How all good men try  
Look around and wonder why  
Can they shape this world to please me  
Can they please me should they please me  
  
And follow and maybe youll correct me  
I wish youd never met me  
For I am no gentle man  
And follow and while you watch and wonder  
Ill pull the world a sunder  
And show you who I am  
  
Send me a gentle dream  
of love so strange its never seen  
And prove how such a love can happen  
It can happen make it happen  
  
Fine things dont abound  
Fade away without a sound  
But hope must never end or slacken  
Never slacken never slacken  
  
And follow and maybe youll correct me  
I wish youd never met me  
I am no gentle man  
And follow and while you watch and wonder  
Ill pull the world a sunder  
And show you who I am
