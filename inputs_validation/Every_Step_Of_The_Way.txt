I spend my time  
Thinkin bout you constantly  
Its true that I want you  
Youre the meaning of success to me  
Cause anything you want  
You can get from me  
Dont try to work it out  
Just let it be  
Emotion has no price  
And love is free  
Ive been going round in circles  
Youre always on my mind  
I need you so bad  
Its driving me out of my mind  
Reflected in your eyes  
Cant you see  
You and I against the world  
Young lions roam free  
Youre always taking me somewhere  
That Ive never seen  
No matter where you go  
Im with you  
Every step of the way  
No matter what you need  
Ive got more every single day  
My heart is full for you  
And Im longing to find you  
Every step of the way  
Im with you  
Every step of the way  
Im right beside you  
Cause anything you want  
You can get from me  
Dont try to work it out  
Just let it be  
Emotion has no price  
And love is free  
Its free and no matter where you go  
Im with you  
Every step of the way  
No matter what you need  
Ive got more every single day  
My heart is full for you  
In your shadow youll find me  
Every step of the way  
Im with you  
Every step of the way  
Im right beside you  
No matter what you do  
No matter what you say  
Im right beside you  
Every single day  
No matter what you do  
Or who you do it to  
No matter where youve been  
No matter what you say  
Or who you say it to  
No matter what you do  
I will stay close to you  
Every step of the way  
Every single day  
Every step of the way
