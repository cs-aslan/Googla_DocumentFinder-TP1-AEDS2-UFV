Its the same old story that they all hand me The Preacher tells me these are
troubled times But I know the Lords been in tougher scrapes then this one
Aint gonna worry aint gonna worry aint gonna worry my mindGot no money
in the pocketYou dont get rich working overtime But as long as you cant
buy the springtime in Virginia I aint gonna worry No I aint gonna worry
Aint gonna worry my mind That is all that ever makes you richer Oh well if
the truth be told Moonlight spins my only silver and the sun is my only
gold Oh ya So go on wishin go on prayin go on sayin Ill hit better
times How in the world could you love me any better Aint gonna worry I
tell ya I aint gonna worry no more Aint gonna worry my mind
