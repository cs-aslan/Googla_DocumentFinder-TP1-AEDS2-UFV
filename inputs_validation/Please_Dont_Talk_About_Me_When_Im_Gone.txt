Oh please dont talk about me when Im gone  
Although our friendship ceases from now on  
  
Hey carmen if you cant say anything real nice  
Its better not to talk at all thats my advice  
  
We are parting  
You go your way  
Ill go mine  
Its best that we do  
Heres a little kiss  
I hope that this brings lots of love to you  
  
Makes no difference how I carry on  
cause baby I know youd better not talk about me when Im gone
