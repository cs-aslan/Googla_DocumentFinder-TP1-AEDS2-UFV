Breeze stop moanin those weird melodies  
My man has left me  
And I cant face the music  
Without singin the blues  
  
Rain your rhythm on my window pane  
Drives me insane because  
I cant face the music  
Without singin the blues  
  
My heart is so broken  
Ive spoken to the Lord for sympathy  
And if He dont help me so help me  
Its the bottom of the deep blue sea for me  
  
Im gonna end this misery  
My man has left me  
And I cant face the music  
Without singin the blues  
  
My heart is so broken  
Ive spoken to the Lord for sympathy  
And if He dont help me so help me  
Its the bottom of the deep blue sea for me  
  
Im gonna end this misery  
My man has left me  
And I cant face the music  
Without singin the blues  
  
I cant face the music
