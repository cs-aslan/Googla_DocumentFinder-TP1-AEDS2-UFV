Cody shouting Alright now  
  
Cody Oh Charlie I know you I want a big one  
You were out here mowing all that lawn  
I got you there walking out the door  
And I dont ever hear your voice again  
I guess youre not taking your things away  
Seem like I never die  
Oh I was singing Lump if I played the same old song  
I can look at the mirror instead  
I know I got my radio and Im walking the line  
Youve got something like a donut when I should find  
But I got nothing here I said Im walking the line  
Charlie can you bring it in  
  
Both  
Who ever said its like Waynes world  
Dont know what Im talking about  
I got you walking out the door  
Charlie trying to figure me out  
I know lifes so funny  
Theres more to my dummy  
Than how much I could say  
I gotta make a little dime for the big time  
Charlie can you bring it in  
  
Charlie  
I got some money I payed at the restaurant  
I told me that I wanna cry  
Ive got the stereo blasting  
Ive got my next TRO rock music and song requests  
I cried to called you on the phone and I got lost and drunk  
I guess you keep cleaning the room  
Ive been reading my old books all day long but you dont ever look at me  
I know your got your radio and youre walking the line  
I got something like a donut when I should find  
But you got nothing here I said Im walking the line  
Cody can you bring it in  
  
Both  
Who ever said its like Waynes world  
Dont know what Im talking about  
I got you walking out the door  
Cody trying to figure you out  
I know life is funny  
Theres more to my dummy  
Than how much I could say  
I gotta make a little dime for the big time  
Charlie can you bring it in
