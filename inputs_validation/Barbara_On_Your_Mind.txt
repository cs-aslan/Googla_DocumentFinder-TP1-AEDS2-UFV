Dolly Parton  
Last night you called me Barbara  
As you lay fast asleep  
And although Im not Barbara  
You wanted me to be  
You whispered words I havent heard  
In such a long long time  
Last night you said I love you  
With Barbara on your mind  
Sometimes I find traces of her kisses on your skin  
And strands of chestnut hair  
That say youve been with her again  
Little traces of her that it breaks my heart to find  
Last night you called me darlin  
With Barbara on your mind  
With Barbara on your mind  
You held me in your arms so tight  
And lying there so close to you  
I cried until day light  
And though you think that I dont know  
Im really not that blind  
Last night you said I love you  
With Barbara on your mind  
Last night you called me darlin  
With Barbara on your mind
