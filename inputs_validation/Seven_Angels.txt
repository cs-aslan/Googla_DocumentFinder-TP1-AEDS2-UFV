If you see me flyin  
all across the sky  
there I go Im flyin high  
  
Six white horses  
a chariot made of gold  
seven lovely angels  
abide my soul  
  
Ive got the moon on my right  
the sun on my left  
the world is behind me  
only one way to go  
thats straight ahead  
thats where Im going  
  
  
Well Ive just stepped out  
out of my grave  
there I go I aint no slave  
in my right hand  
is the sword of truth  
in my left hand  
is the fire of love  
I call to the land  
I call to the sea  
I call to the sky  
Lord have mercy  
wont you hear me  
  
As I look behind me  
what do I see  
a pair of golden wings  
seems to be attached to me  
  
Wings on my back Ive got to fly away  
I just cant wait till tomorrow  
Ive got to fly away  
There I go 1
