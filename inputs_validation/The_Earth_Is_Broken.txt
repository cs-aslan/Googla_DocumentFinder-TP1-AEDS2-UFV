Oh now my brothers been taken away  
Gone are the old times when we used to say  
Oh a woman was younger she knew what to do  
Oh but I look around me now thats not so  
  
Im lost on that open road no peace do I find  
Maybe the windll blow a melody and ease my mind  
  
But soon love is broken theyll take you away  
Oh the wars they been growing as no relief  
And the old men who ruled them oh theyre just like thieves  
They rob from the sunshine oh the air aint so clean  
Our rivers are dirty where once we could see  
  
A smile from your lady friend looking down  
Look at that river hey did you ever shiver  
Well the earth is broken there is no one to save  
  
I remember quite freely only yesterday  
Ah the letter that I read from you read this way  
Take care lonesome Timmy ah dont you start  
Thinking youre the only one year thats gone  
Out on your lonesome road hey lend a hand to your friend  
Yes hes just as lonely and the wind keeps you cold  
  
Remember the rivers that once did flow clean  
  
Ah sometimes I wonder how this old world keeps spinning round  
All the old folks have gone west Lord preparing to die  
All except for a few of us hangers on  
Living each day with trivial hearts  
  
We just stop once in a while cry over the news  
In some foreign far city your brothers shot down  
  
Because there was a reason a gun had a hand  
And the old man killed youth squeezed down its hope  
Now Im just waiting brother waiting for the land  
Soon in my country there wont be a friend  
Each one is trying so hard to defend  
That one one last heartbeat before hes tugged away  
  
Lost in the mechanized efficient world logical skies  
  
Ah but no song was written on without a tear in your eyes  
Are we the last ones the last ones to try
