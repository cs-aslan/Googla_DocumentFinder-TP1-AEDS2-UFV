Comin home from work today I saw our future  
And old man and his wife were holdin hands  
They were sittin on a front porch swing  
Like two young lovers  
I waved to them as I went by then I realized  
That life does not grow dimmer with the settin of the sun  
The best years of our lives still are yet to come  
In our old age love will just get better  
The longer were together well grow stronger everyday  
Our bodies may get weaker and our hair will turn gray  
But love will never fade in our age  love will never fade   
One day the kids will all be grown and theyll be leavin  
And it will be like it was years ago  
Well be sittin on the front porch swing like two young lovers  
cause today I just saw what our future holds
