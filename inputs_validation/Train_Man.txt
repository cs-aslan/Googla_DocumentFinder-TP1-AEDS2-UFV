And over in the teachers home she waited by the phone  
For calls which never rang and people who never sang  
Train man rambled dusty into town and made his daily round  
Train man and he comes in the night  
Brings her no love but hes right  
Yes hes right  
  
Through fog and misty morning dew shed seen his oily face  
And he had touched her heart taken it apart  
  
Though he never stopped to speak a word his voice was all she heard  
Train man and he comes in the night  
  
Brings her no love but hes right  
  
Little girl youre a pretty little girl  
Yes hes right  
Wont you come with me a while  
Little girl in your frilly little world  
Wont you give me your sweet smile  
first solo  
  
If you come tonight bring someone  
If you come tonight bring someone  
Dont come alone  
  
If you come alone dont come  
Dont come  
Dont come  
solo  
Yes I know hes right  
  
Yes I know hes right  
Oh I know hes right  
fade  
She held his hand and whispered soft  
  
I love you train man  
He just grumbled like engine as it rumbles  
And said someday  
Train man and he knows somethings wrong and hes right  
Oh yes hes right
