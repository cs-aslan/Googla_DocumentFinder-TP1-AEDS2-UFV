Keep off of that friend of mine ahahah  
Hes not for you ahahah  
He just wants to spin you a line ahahah  
Theres nothin new ahahah  
Just one thought on his mind  
You know its that kind you shoulda  
Known when you met him you must be blind  
  
Seems like only yesterday  
That girl was mine in every way  
People couldnt part us if they tried  
Now shes turned her head away  
Shes lost her smile shes not so gay  
Wont you come back to my side
