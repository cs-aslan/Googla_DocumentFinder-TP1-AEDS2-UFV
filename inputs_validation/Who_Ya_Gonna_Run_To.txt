Baby please you dont have to explain the reasons  
This is me I know your mind can change like the seasons  
Go your way I know the world is calling your name boy  
Its okay cause what we got it aint gonna change boy  
  
As long as weve been together  
Youve always been the one  
Nobody knows you better  
When all is said and done  
  
When your friends start to trip  
And youre loosin your grip  
And you cant find your way back home  
When your world falls apart  
And youre lost in the dark  
And you know that your all alone  
When you just can deal and you need something real  
Someone thatll always come through  
Who ya gonna run to  
Who ya gonna run to  
  
You and me we go back to jump rope and grade school  
Memories when you were tryin so hard to play cool  
I dont mind I know that you gotta go through your changes  
Take your time sometimes are hard to rearrange it  
  
As long as weve been together  
Youve always been the one  
Nobody knows you better  
When all is said and done  
  
When your friends start to trip  
And youre loosin your grip  
And you cant find your way back home  
When your world falls apart  
And youre lost in the dark  
And you know that your all alone  
When you just can deal and you need something real  
Someone thatll always come through  
Who ya gonna run to  
Who ya gonna run to  
  
There aint nobody who can ever understand like I do  I do  
So when you realize you need the one you said goodbye to bye to  
Look over your shoulder boy and you know who be there  
  
You know Im gonna be right there right there  
  
When your friends start to trip  
And your loosin your grip  
And u cant find your way back home  
When your world falls apart  
And youre lost in the dark  
And you know that your all alone  
When you just can deal and you need something real  
Someone thatll always come through  
Who ya gonna run to  
Who ya gonna run to  
  
When theres nobody else in the world you can put your trust in  
Who ya gonna run to  
And you find all the haters around you they dont mean nothing  
Who ya gonna run to  
Who ya gonna run to
