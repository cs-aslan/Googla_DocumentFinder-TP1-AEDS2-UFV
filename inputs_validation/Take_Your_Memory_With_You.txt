I can read the writing on the wall  
You pretend that nothings changed at all  
Ive got just one thing to ask you if its so  
Just take your memory with you when you go  
  
So I wont have to think about  
The lonely nights Ill be without  
Someone to hold me when the cold wind blows  
Take your memory with you when you go  
  
I walk the floor and wonder what went wrong  
Ill have to find a way to carry on  
Why dont you leave before the heartache starts to show  
Take your memory with you when you go  
  
So I wont have to think about  
The lonely nights Ill be without  
Someone to hold me when the cold wind blows  
Take your memory with you  
So I wont have to miss you  
Take your memory with you when you go
