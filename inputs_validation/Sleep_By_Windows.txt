You can cry by my window  
You can crawl on the floor  
You can scream if you want to  
But I wont unlock the door  
  
You can sleep in bus shelters  
You can sleep in the park  
But Ill rip up the trees  
Until you tear yourself apart  
  
But I dont love you  
No I dont love you  
Do you dream  
  
Back to surveillance  
Open eyes and wash out tear  
A sign that says no exit  
And noone can save you here  
  
I could talk about my programme  
Where everything is white  
I could specialize in pictures  
Where nothings ever right  
  
But I dont love you  
No I dont love you  
Do you dream  
  
We are just sound  
We are just noise  
And we are all here to lie  
Do you dream  
  
You sleep by windows  
You sleep by windows  
  
Do you cry  
Do you dream  
Do you  
Did you
