Dont tell them theyll only drink your tears  
Dont do it not in a hundred years  
You know it  
You feel it I do too  
Just listen  
Something is calling you  
  
What difference do you think that it makes  
If you give or if its you who takes  
I know it  
I feel it you do too  
Just listen  
Youll hear it calling you  
  
What difference do you think that it makes  
If you give or if its you who takes  
I know it  
I feel it you do too  
Just listen  
Youll hear it calling you
