Dont let me cross over  
Loves cheating line  
Im tempted my darling  
To steal you away  
Dont let me cross over  
Stay out of my way  
You know that I love you  
And Im not the stealing kind  
But Im faced with heartaches  
And loves cheating line  
Dont let me cross over  
Loves cheating line  
You belong to another  
And can never be mine  
I know one step closer  
Would be heaven divine  
Dont let me cross over  
Loves cheating line  
Ive tried to forget you  
But what else can I do  
When your eyes keep saying  
That you love me too  
I know if I lose you  
Not a dream will be left  
I dont want to cheat dear  
But I cant help myself  
Dont let me cross over  
Loves cheating line  
You belong to another  
And can never be mine  
I know one step closer  
Would be heaven divine  
Dont let me cross over  
Loves cheating line
