Chorus  
My lawnmower home but my hoes still missin my hoes still missin my
hoes still missin  
My rakes in the shed but my hoes still missin my hoes still missin my
hoes still missin  
Plow in the world but my hoes still missin my hoes still missin my
hoes still missin  
Im bout to lose my head cause my hoes still missin like its greener on
the other side  
  
I take care of the yard everyday I dont know why my hoe got missin  
My rake in good condition my lawnmower in position  
I aint done a damn thing wrong for my hoe to get up and get missin  
Now Id be wrong if I was to dig up the dirt and I saw for myself then
witness  
Well Id tell you about my hoe never had restrictions  
I guess more green was her attention I shoulda kept that hoe in the kitchen  
Got me on a mission left my shed without permission  
Im sheddin tears messin up my vision this hoe gon make me go to prison  
  
Chorus  
  
That hoe cost me my job Im afraid I should of learned mo about the
business  
A hoe is good for diggin I should of know this from the beginnin  
I don got caught slippin now Im tripping out the door somebody else found
interest  
Throw my hoe until I found out until I find out different Better to know then
have intuitions  
Who been in my yard why would anybody split us apart  
I never thought that hoe would get to my heart I found out right off this
bitch came from a bar  
Why this hoe aint in somebody garage I was a gentlemen right from the start  
Ever since I put the hoe in my touch now this bitch wont even spare me the
rod  
  
Chorus  
  
7 years now its all over now hold on goin gotta feel me brah  
Left my home no sign of luck I try to drink Patron so all the memories gone  
All the pain Im trying to pour it in my cup Bought the hoe my last couple of
bucks  
Lost a hoe I never felt this crush like cushion a dutch never this much  
If I would of known my hoe was just temporary  
And I aint talking about the hoe you find in the dictionary  
I feel like going to war like the military  
Somebody gon have to visit the cemetery  
  
Chorus
