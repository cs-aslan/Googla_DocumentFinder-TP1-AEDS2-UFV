Lying soaked in sweat tonight  
Your knuckles white  
you try to fight  
The need for more to get you by  
Youve had enough  
You wonder why  
Even now your body cries  
For chemicals to blind your eyes  
Wonder can you stay this high  
When the cells begin to die  
Forever Forever Forever  
  
Crush it up crush it up  
Take it down take it down  
Smash it up Smash it up  
Falling Down  
  
Swallowed like the medicine  
Thats broken down my happy friend  
Wonder if hell let me in  
When I come to see him when  
Hes Better Better Better  
No  
  
Crush it up crush it up  
Take it down take it down  
Smash it up smash it up  
Falling down  
  
Crush it up crush it up  
Take it down take it down  
Smash it up smash it up  
Falling down  
  
Theres power  
In the powder  
Dissolving in your guts  
  
Theres power  
In the powder  
Dissolving in your guts  
  
Crush it up crush it up  
Take it down take it down  
Smash it up smash it up  
Falling down  
  
Crush it up crush it up  
Take it down take it down  
Smash it up smash it up  
Falling down  
  
Im Falling Crush it up crush it up  
Im Falling Take it down take it down  
Im Falling Smash it up smash it up  
Falling Down  
  
Im Falling Crush it up crush it up  
Im Falling Take it down take it down  
Im Falling Smash it up smash it up  
Falling Down
