Fire on the sky  
Colors flying through her mind  
Desert touch the sky  
Here at the place where she will die  
She is looking far far away  
It seems theres no escape  
From a prison without bars  
Only to follow the bright star  
Shes running all the way  
Fatamorgana  
Only yesterday  
Fatamorgana  
A little girl a little girl  
Longing for her mothers world  
She was just a little girl  
Fatamorgana  
Ah ah ah ah  
Yumah yah yumah  
Min dalamnik  
Min dalam  
Yumah yah yumah  
Min dalamnik  
Min dalam  
Kol hayatik  
Yaahyah  
Homiyah  
Ho mirage  
Shes running all the way  
Fatamorgana  
Only only yesterday  
Fatamorgana  
A little girl a little girl  
Longing for her mothers world  
I was just a little girl  
Fatamorgana  
A little girl a little girl  
Longing for her mothers world  
I was just a little girl  
Fatamorgana  
Mama  
Ah Ah Ah Ah Mirage  
Ahyah yumah  
Ah Ah Mirage
