Ive been your lover  
Youve been my friend  
Love and a friends all you need in the end  
Well keep on growing  
And ever well be  
A friend and a love indivisible  
  
Loving  
The seed were sowing  
Gonna keep it growing  
As long as we can  
  
Sometimes a sunshine day  
Sometimes were rain  
Sunshine and rain keeps the fields ever green you know  
Itll keep our love growing  
Sure as a spring  
The rain and the suns indivisible  
The sunshine and rain indivisible

Gonna keep it growing  
As long as we can  
Uh mama

The seed were sowing  
Gonna keep it right on growing  
As long as we can  
  
Growing  
The seed were sowing  
Gonna keep it growing  
As long as we can  
Oh growing  
The seed were sowing  
Gonna keep it on growing  
As long as we can  
Gonna keep it on growing  
As long as we can
