Countless long nights  
While I stare at the wall  
I ask myself over again  
How did I end up  
In this little hell  
How  did it ever begin  
Oh oh oh oh oh helpess  
Helpless to turn back the clock  
That ticks on  
With its cruel shiny face  
It laughs while it watches  
My every disgrace  I was  
Born a sap  all the  
Nurses laughed when they  
Saw me the first time  
They giggled and they said  
This poor little monsterd be  
Better off dead  
Oh oh oh oh oh helpess  
Helplessly trapped in a body  
Im sure   
Should have never been mine  
I bet that my real ones  
Doing just fine  and I  
Dont belong here I  
Dont belong here  I  
Should be quite rich  
With a big shiny car  
A house with twelve rooms  
I deserve to go far  
Oh oh oh oh oh helpess  
Helplessly falling in love  
But does love  
Really last through the night  
To love  To honor   
To kick and to bite and I  
Dont belong here I  
Dont belong here  
Its all a mistake  
I was destined for greatness  
A leader a prophet   
Theyre just too blind to notice  
Where did this whole silly story begin  
It seems that my mind has gone   
Blank  
I think that Ive messed up a chapter or two  
Perhaps it is best if Im frank  
Oh oh oh oh oh helpess   
Helplessly lost like that  
Poor chap who came  
For an innocent dance  
He left with his brain smeared  
All over his pants cause he  
Didnt belong here he  
Didnt belong here  
He never shouldve left  
That warm cage in a zoo  
His face was so ugly  
What else could I do  
Can you  really blame me I  
Had to smash it  
He left me no choice  
He was just like the others  
I just had to kill him  
With my poor dear old  
Mother  
Oh oh oh oh oh helpess  
Helplessly fucked in the ass  
By a legion of forty excons  
Thats what it feels like  
When you walk all over me  
Dont belong here I  
Dont belong here  
Your eyes burn right through me  
They fill me with fear  
I couldve been at home  
Watching football and drinking beer  
Oh oh oh oh oh helpess so Helpless
