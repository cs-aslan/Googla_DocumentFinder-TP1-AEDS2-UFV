Well you say youll be fine  
When you walk out that door  
Oh will it be that easy  
To see me no more  
  
Well will you be fine  
Are you complete  
Say youll survive  
Down Endless Street  
Down Endless Street  
Down Endless Street  
  
Well say youll be fine  
When you walk out that door  
Oh will it be that easy  
To see me no more  
  
Will you survive  
Are you complete  
Say youll be fine  
Down Endless Street  
Down Endless Street  
Down Endless Street  
  
Will you be fine  
Are you complete  
Say youll survive  
Down Endless Street  
Down Endless Street  
Down Endless Street
