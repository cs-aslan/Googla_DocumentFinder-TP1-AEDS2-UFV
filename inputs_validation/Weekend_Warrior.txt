The rebel of yesterday tomorrows fool  
Who are you kidding being that cool  
  
Trying to break away from running  
With the pack  
But they aint listening so youve  
Gotta go back  
  
Youre a weekend warrior when  
Youre one of the crowd  
But its over just look at you now  
  
Youre not so brave the way you behave  
It makes you sick gotta get out quick  
Its all bravado when youre out  
With your mates  
Its like a different person goes through  
Those gates  
And the game begins  
The adrenalins high  
Feel the tension maybe someone  
Will die  
  
A weekend warrior lately  
A weekend warrior sometimes  
A weekend warrior maybe you aint  
That way anymore  
  
Youve gotta get out gotta get away  
But youre in with a clique its not  
Easy to stray  
Youve gotta admit youre just  
Living a lie  
It didnt take long to work out why  
  
Its hard to say why you got involved  
Just wanting to be part  
Just wanting to belong  
  
A weekend warrior lately  
A weekend warrior sometimes  
A weekend warrior maybe you aint  
That way anymore  
  
Some of the things that youve done  
You feel so ashamed  
After all its only a game isnt it  
And after all the adrenalins gone  
What you gonna do on Monday  
  
A weekend warrior lately  
A weekend warrior sometimes  
A weekend warrior maybe you were  
Never like that at all
