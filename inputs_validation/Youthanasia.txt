Whod believe with the way things are here  
Wed be going anywhere telling people how to live  
Whod believe wed spend more shippin drugs and guns  
Than to educate our sons Sorry but thats what they did  
I cant help but think  
Someones forsaken you and me  
Luck deserted me and the truth beat out my brains  
Men rise on stepping stones of their selves to higher things  
Ive stepped over a lot of bodies on my way  
Thanks for the information dont need no more anything  
We are the damned of all the world with sadness in our hearts  
The wounded of the wars weve been hung out to dry  
You didnt want us anyway and now were making up our minds  
You tell us how to run our lives we run for Youthanasia
