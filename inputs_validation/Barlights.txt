Never in all of my life  
Have I seen eyes as empty as these streets of my city  
On a Saturday night  
All the green of your eyes says Go leave it all behind  
  
But I dont need to be reminded a change is gonna come  
I can feel it on the tip of your tongue  
  
And I feel alive  
  
We met up once wed settled the sun  
Between the heat and the work week  
The fear is we could use some sleep  
But sleep to the superfluous man means better use for beds  
And Ill bet Im coming home alone tonight  
  
I dont need to be reminded that this is how it was  
I moved on I passed a billboard down my block  
That asks if Ive had enough and aloud I say Ive had too much  
When the truth is Im just getting started  
  
Now all the barlights are blinking in time  
To Mexican music its taunting the pavement  
And I feel alive  
  
One of us sings and one of us drinks  
And one of us has nothing at all  
So he calls us all sheep  
Im the Little Bo Peep of the bunch  
I take their tales and Im ready to go  
The he swears hes gotta take this call  
Man I get scared hes gonna leave us too soon  
  
We were the get rich quick kids  
We never got it right  
So we settled for the center of town  
Where all the rich white kids is out looking for a fight  
Got the blond one staring me down  
And I really wanna take a swing  
I cant help but remember James Dean  
See we are part of the few who agree  
That hey he lived life fast  
But he died  
He died  
He died  
  
Me Im gonna live forever  
  
Now all the barlights are blinking in time  
To Mexican music its taunting the pavement  
And for the first time  
In a long time  
I feel alive
