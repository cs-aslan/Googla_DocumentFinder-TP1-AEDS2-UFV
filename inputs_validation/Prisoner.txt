Time has come to say goodbye  
To the broken memories  
Theyre locked inside like prisoners  
In a place that noone sees  
  
Stayed up late with a friend of mine  
Southern comfort till dawn  
We talked about the pains of love  
Shouldve known from  
The start you were wrong  
  
Im just a prisoner  
Dont wanna lock myself away  
Prisoner I get so lonely lonely  
Im a prisoner  
Just when do you think love will stay  
It walks right out on you out on you  
  
Tired blood runs through my veins  
But I cant get no sleep  
You lock my heart  
In these prison walls  
This place Ive got to leave  
  
Im a prisoner  
Dont wanna lock myself away  
Prisoner I get so lonely lonely  
Im a prisoner  
Just when do you think love will stay  
It walks right out on you out on you  
  
The sky is gray its raining  
Like the storm in my heart  
There aint no use explaining  
cause Im leaving leaving  
  
Wont somebody set me free  
Take me away from this misery  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely lonely lonely  
Wont somebody set me free  
Please please set me free
