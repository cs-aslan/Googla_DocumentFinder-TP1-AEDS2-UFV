I walked away from you once before  
I still see you standing at the door  
Trying to find the strength to say goodbye to you  
Maybe we were wrong gotta find whats right for me  
Oh yes we were brave to go our separate ways  
But these days I wonder whos gonna Incomprehensible  
I am nobodys soldier  
Marching to the rhythm of a lonely heart  
I am nobodys soldier  
When my battle is over Ill be nobodys soldier  
Life itself is war enough  
I cant win for you you cant lose for me  
I cant win for you you cant lose for me  
Broken hearts and dreams we left along the way  
Will only give us strength to fight another day  
Maybe I just live too hard and love too much  
But fighting win or lose  
Ill be nobodys soldier  
Marching to the rhythm of a lonely heart  
A lonely heart  
I am nobodys soldier  
When my battle is over Ill be nobodys soldier  
Where do we begin to learn to live again  
Find a place for me and one day well be free  
When lovers part they leave their broken dreams behind  
And their wounded heart to heal  
Still I am nobodys soldier  
Nobodys soldier  
Marching to the rhythm of a lonely heart  
A lonely heart  
I am nobodys soldier  
Nobodys soldier  
When my battle is over Ill be nobodys soldier  
No no no no nobodys soldier  
Nobodys soldier  
Marching to the rhythm of a lonely heart  
Ive got a lonely heart  
Nobodys soldier  
Nobodys soldier  
Nobodys soldier  
Nobodys soldier  
A lonely heart  
Nobodys soldier
