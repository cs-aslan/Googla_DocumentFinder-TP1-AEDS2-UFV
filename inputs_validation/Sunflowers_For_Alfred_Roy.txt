Thank you for forgiving  
Hurtful things Ive done as a child  
Adolescent or woman  
Thank you for embracing a flaxenhaired baby  
Although Im aware you had doubts  
I guess anybodyd have had doubts  
  
Please be at peace father  
Im at peace with you  
Bitterness isnt worth cling to  
After all the anguish weve all been through  
  
Thank you for the mountains  
The lake of the clouds  
Im picturing you and me there right now  
As the crystal cascades showered down  
  
Strange to feel that proud strong man  
Grip tightly to my hand  
Hard to see the life inside  
Wane as the days went by  
Trying to preserve each word  
He murmured in my ear  
Watch part of my life disappear  
  
Father thanks for reaching out and lovingly  
Saying that youve always been proud of me  
I needed to feel that so desperately  
Youre always alive inside of me  
Now youre shining like  
A sunflower up in the sky  
Way up high
