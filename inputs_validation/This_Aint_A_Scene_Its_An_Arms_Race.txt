I am an arms dealer  
Fitting you with weapons in the form of words  
And I dont really care which side wins  
As long as the room keeps singing  
Thats just the business Im in  
  
This aint a scene its a god damn arms race  
This aint a scene its a god damn arms race  
This aint a scene its a god damn arms race  
Im not a shoulder to cry on but I digress  
  
Im a leading man and the lies I weave are ohso intricate ohso intricate  
Im a leading man and the lies I weave are ohso intricate ohso intricate  
  
I wrote the gospel on giving up You look pretty sinking  
But the real bombshells have already sunk Prima donnas of the gutter  
At night were painting your trash gold while you sleep  
Crashing not like hips or cars  
No more like parties  
  
This aint a scene its a god damn arms race  
This aint a scene its a god damn arms race  
This aint a scene its a god damn arms race  
Bandwagons full please catch another  
  
Im a leading man and the lies I weave are ohso intricate ohso intricate  
Im a leading man and the lies I weave are ohso intricate ohso intricate  
  
All the boys who the dance floor didnt love  
And all the girls whose lips couldnt move fast enough  
Sing until your lungs give out  
  
This aint a scene its a god damn arms race  
This aint a scene its a god damn arms race Now you  
This aint a scene its a god damn arms race Wear out the groove  
This aint a scene its a god damn arms race Sing out loud  
This aint a scene its a god damn arms race Oh oh  
This aint a scene its a god damn arms race  
  
Im a leading man and the lies I weave are ohso intricate ohso intricate  
Im a leading man and the lies I weave are ohso intricate ohso intricate
