How long will it take how long will it take to make you need me  
I keep a waiting and a wondering how long will it take  
Well you keep a telling me your love Im winning  
Then you turn right around and you treat me hard and cold  
Well I aint got but one life here Im living  
So if youre gonna love me baby Ive gotta know  
How long will it take how long will it take to make you want me  
How much longer has this old heart gotta break  
How long will it take how long will it take to make you need me  
I keep a waiting and a wondering how long will it take  
  
Now there aint a thing on earth that dont need a loving  
And baby Im no exception to the rule  
But if you keep a putting everything above me  
Well how in this world will I ever get through to you  
How long will it take
