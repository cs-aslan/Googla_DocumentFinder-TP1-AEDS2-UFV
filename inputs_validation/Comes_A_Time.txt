Comes a time when youre driftin  
Comes a time when you settle down  
Comes a light feelins liftin  
Lift that baby right up off the ground  
  
Whoa this old world keeps spinnin round  
Its a wonder tall trees aint layin down  
There comes a time  
  
You and I we were captured  
We took our souls and we flew away  
We were right we were giving  
Thats how we kept what we gave away
