Verse 1  
Bathroom stalls for the powder nose she loves  
High heel shoes with the open toes she loves  
Shes got a good time wrapped in gold she loves  
For you for you  
All red dress with the devil eyes she loves  
So obsessed with the camera lights she loves  
You love her but you cant deny she loves  
The truth the truth  
  
PreChorus  
She loves everybody  
Cant you tell by the signs  
She loves everybody  
She gets off all the time  
Its a dark philosophy  
And it haunts her constantly  
Its a false alarm to me  
Shes a false alarm  
Chorus  
False alarm hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey hey  
  
Verse 2  
Six inch long bout three inch wide she loves  
Dolla dolla bill is her only type she loves  
You love her but youll never be she loves  
The one the one  
Diamonds and the rings are her fantasy she loves  
She chase hearts with the Hennessy she loves  
You love her but youll never be she loves  
Enough enough  
  
PreChorus  
She loves everybody  
Cant you tell by the signs  
She loves everybody  
She gets off all the time  
Its a dark philosophy  
And it haunts her constantly  
Shes a false alarm to me  
Shes a false alarm  
  
Chorus  
False alarm hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey hey  
  
Bridge  
She always leaves the man she loves  
But the diamonds are forever  
She always seems to be alone  
But the diamonds make it better  
  
Chorus  
False alarm hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey  
False alarm hey hey hey hey hey
