Does he love me  
I want to know  
How can I tell if he loves me so  
Is it in his eyes Oh no  
Youll be deceived  
Is it in his eyes Oh no  
Hell make believe  
If you want to know  
If he loves you so  
Its in his kiss  
Or is it in his face Oh no  
Its just his charm  
In his warm embrace Oh no  
Thats just his arms  
If you want to know  
If he loves you so  
Its in his kiss  
Kiss him and squeeze him tight  
And find out what you want to know  
If its love if it really is  
Its there in his kiss  
About the way he acts Oh no  
Thats not the way  
And youre not listening to all that I say  
If you want to know  
If he loves you so  
Its in his kiss
