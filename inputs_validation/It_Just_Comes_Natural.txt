Sun shines clouds rain  
Train whistles blow and guitars play  
Preachers preach farmers plow  
Wishes go up and the world goes round  
  
And I love you  
It just come natural  
It just comes natural  
  
Seasons change rivers wind  
Tumble weeds roll and the stars shine  
Wind howls dawn breaks  
Cowboys riding time slips away  
  
And I love you  
It just come natural  
Its what I was born to do  
Dont have to think it through  
Baby its so easy loving you  
It just come natural  
  
Its what I was born to do  
Dont have to think it through  
Baby its so easy loving you  
  
Fire burns waves crash  
Seeds grow and good things last  
Ships sail dreams fly  
Night falls and full moons rise  
  
And I love you  
It just come natural  
And I love you  
It just come natural  
It just come natural  
It just come natural
