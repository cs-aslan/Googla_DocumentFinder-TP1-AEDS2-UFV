I feel so strange whats wrong with me  
Youve got a problem that you cant see  
But Ive got a feeling that the rumours are true  
I see the girls go a hook in you  
You carry on believing  
That you can take or leave it  
Now who are you deceiving  
Cause when its own up time  
Shes in the back of you mind  
Shes got her hooks in you  
You said youd never let it happen again  
You spend your money and youre deeper in  
Your fairweather friends call two by two  
To let you know whats wrong with you  
But now your heartbeats thumpin  
You watch you nerve ends jumpin  
Well I can tell yo somethin  
When its own up time  
Youre gonna toe the line  
Shes got her hooks in you  
Shes got her hooks in me too
