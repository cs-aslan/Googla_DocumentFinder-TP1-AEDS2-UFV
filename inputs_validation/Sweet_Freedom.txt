As you look around you  
Do you like what you see  
Though it sometimes  
Makes you lonely  
Do you like being free  
And are you sure youll be okay  
Without my company  
I just want you to be happy  
Even if its not with me  
  
Sweet sweet freedom  
Sweet sweet sweet  
Will the line between all this  
And my love ever meet  
Sweet sweet freedom  
Sweet sweet sweet  
  
What Im really tryin to say  
Is that I will be around  
Should you find that after all  
You cant get by  
With what you found  
  
Oh it wasnt just my heart you took  
And gently tossed into the sea  
Though its hard to find  
The words I need  
I guess it was me  
  
Will the line between all this  
And my love ever gonna meet  
Sweet sweet freedom  
Sweet sweet sweet  
  
Oh sweet oh sweet sweet freedom  
So sweet so sweet
