Now greetings to the world  
  
Standing at this liquor store  
Whiskey coming through my pores  
Feeling like I run this whole block  
Lotto tickets cheap beer  
Thats why you can catch me here  
Tryna scratch my way up to the top  
  
Cause my job got me going nowhere  
So I aint got a thing to lose  
Take me to a place where I dont care  
This is me and my liquor store blues  
  
Ill take one shot for my pain  
One drag for my sorrow  
Get messed up today  
Ill be ok tomorrow  
One shot for my pain  
One drag for my sorrow  
Get messed up today  
Ill be ok tomorrow  
  
Me and my guitar tonight  
Singing to the city lights  
Tryna live on more than what I got  
Cause 68 cents aint gonna pay the rent  
So Ill be out here til they call the cops  
  
Cause my job got me going nowhere  
So I aint got a thing to lose  
Take me to a place where I dont care  
This is me and my liquor store blues  
  
Ill take one shot for my pain  
One drag for my sorrow  
Get messed up today  
Ill be ok tomorrow  
One shot for my pain  
One drag for my sorrow  
Get messed up today  
Ill be ok tomorrow  
  
Here comes Junior Gong Im flying high like Superman  
And thinking that I run the whole block  
I dont know if its just because pineapple kush between my jaws  
Has got me feeling like Im on top  
  
Give me this one shot for my pain  
One drag for my sorrow  
Get messed up today  
Ill be ok tomorrow  
One shot for my pain  
One drag for my sorrow  
Get messed up today  
Ill be ok tomorrow  
  
Now greetings to the world  
  
You best believe
