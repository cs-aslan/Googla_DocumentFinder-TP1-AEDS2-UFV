Theres a road that I remember leading to a special place  
Where the door was always open to a smiling face  
Theres a picture on the mantle of a boy that looks like me  
Its always the same theres a stocking with my name  
  
And a candle in the window a flame against the night  
Theres a candle in the window its like Gods perfect light  
It dont take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window  
  
Maybe its just wishful thiking I can hear the sleigh bells ring  
Almost taste teh pie shes baking its Christmas Eve  
  
And theres a candle in the window a flame against the night  
The candle in the window its like Gods perfect light  
It dont take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart  
  
Wherever the years may take me no matter how far I go  
Theres going to be a candle burning its always nice to know  
It dont take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart
