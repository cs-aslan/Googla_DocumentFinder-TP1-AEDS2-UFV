I lost ten points just for being in the right place  
at exactly the wrong time  
I looked right at the facts there but I may as well have  
been completely blind  
So if you see me walking all alone  
Dont look back Im just on my way back home  
theres a train leaves here this morning and  
I dont know what I might be on  
She signed me to a contract baby said it would  
all be so life long  
I looked around then for a reason  
when there wasnt something more to blame it on  
But if time makes a difference while were gone  
Tell me now and I wont be hanging on  
Theres a train leaves here this morning  
and I dont know what I might be on  
ooo ooo ooo etc  
1320 North Columbus was the address  
that I wrote down on my sleeve  
I dont know just what she wanted  
might have been that it was getting time to leave  
and I watched as the smoker passed it on  
and I laughed when the joker said Lead on  
cause theres a train leaves here this morning  
and I dont know what I might be on  
And theres train leaves here this morning  
and I dont know what I might be on
