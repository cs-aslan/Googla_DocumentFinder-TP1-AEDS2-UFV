Look at your young men fighting  
Look at your women crying  
Look at your young men dying  
The way theyve always done before  
  
Look at the hate were breeding  
Look at the fear were feeding  
Look at the lives were leading  
The way weve always done before  
  
My hands are tied  
The billions shift from side to side  
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride  
For the love of God and our human rights  
And all these things are swept aside  
By bloody hands time cant deny  
And are washed away by your genocide  
And history hides the lies of our civil wars  
  
Dyou wear a black armband  
When they shot the man  
Who said peace could last forever  
And in my first memories  
They shot Kennedy  
I went numb when I learned to see  
So I never fell for Vietnam  
We got the wall of DC to remind us all  
That you cant trust freedom  
When its not in your hands  
When everybodys fightin  
For their promised land  
And  
  
I dont need your civil war  
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor  
Your power hungry sellin soldiers  
In a human grocery store  
Aint that fresh  
I dont need your civil war  
Ow oh no no no no no  
  
Look at the shoes youre filling  
Look at the blood were spilling  
Look at the world were killing  
The way weve always done before  
Look in the doubt weve wallowed  
Look at the leaders weve followed  
Look at the lies weve swallowed  
And I dont want to hear no more  
  
My hands are tied  
For all Ive seen has changed my mind  
But still the wars go on as the years go by  
With no love of God or human rights  
Cause all these dreams are swept aside  
By bloody hands of the hypnotized  
Who carry the cross of homicide  
And history bears the scars of our civil wars  
  
I dont need your civil war  
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor  
Your power hungry sellin soldiers  
In a human grocery store  
Aint that fresh  
I dont need your civil war  
No no no no no no no no no no no no  
I dont need your civil war  
I dont need your civil war  
Your power hungry sellin soldiers  
In a human grocery store  
Aint that fresh  
I dont need your civil war  
No no no no no no no no no uhohuh no uhoh uh no  
I dont need one more war  
  
I dont need one more war  
No no no no uhohuh no uhoh uh no  
Whaz so civil bout war anyway
