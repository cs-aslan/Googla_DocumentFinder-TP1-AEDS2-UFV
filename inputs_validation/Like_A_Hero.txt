Baby come save me  
From pain and from fear  
Maybe Im crazy  
Still dreaming you are here  
No more tears my baby  
I cry for you  
No more fears oh maybe  
Im missing you  
  
Like a hero I will smile again  
Like a hero in the midnight rain  
Like a hero I will go  
Miss you more than you will know  
When you break my heart  
Like a hero I will smile again  
Were a woman baby and a man  
And Im needing your sweet love  
Give me more that sweet stuff  
Give me what youve got  
  
Baby be with me  
Its cold and lonely  
Oceans of sorrows  
A man with no tomorrow  
No more tears my baby  
I cry for you  
No more fears oh maybe  
Im missing you
