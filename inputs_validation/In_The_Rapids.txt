Moving down the water  
John is drifting out of sight  
Its only at the turning point  
That you find out how you fight  
  
In the cold feel the cold  
All around  
And the rush of crashing water  
Surrounds me with its sound  
  
Striking out to reach you  
I cant get through to the other side  
When youre racing in the rapids  
Theres only one way thats to ride  
  
Taken down taken down  
By the undertow  
Im spiralled down the river bed  
My fire is burning low  
Catching hold of a rock thats firm  
Im waiting for John to be carried past  
We hold together hold together  
And shoot the rapids fast  
  
And when the waters slow down  
The dark and the deep have noone noone noone noone noone left to
keep  
Hang on John Were out of this at last  
Somethings changed thats not your face Its mine  its mine
