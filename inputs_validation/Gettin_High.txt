I dont care much for smokin weed  
You know Im a man of a different breed  
I dont thrive on drinking alcohol  
Sides Im feelin much too tall  
  
Gettin high  
Gettin high  
Gettin high  
And I dont mean Im gettin stoned  
  
I was just a buckin bronco bomb  
I loved me a billion black and blue eyed blondes  
I never thought I could change  
Yep sure is pretty strange  
  
Gettin high  
Gettin high  
Gettin high  
On something Ive never known  
Ive got a babe of my own  
  
Gettin high  
Ive got a babe of my own  
Ive got a girl of my own
