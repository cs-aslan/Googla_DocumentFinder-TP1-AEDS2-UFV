Tell me what your feeling lately  
You just cant keep it all  
Locked up so deep inside  
Its better just to let it go  
Let my chest be your pillow  
Keep you warm when you get cold  
And when you start to fall  
I wanna let you know  
That we all have our reasons  
They come and go like seasons  
Summer fall through winter spring  
All the heart ache that they bring  
Let this rain wash the pain away  
I pray this love is here to stay  
Been there in your heart from the very start  
I swear to you Im never leavin  
  
You know me  
I aint no cloudy weather  
And when the sun dont shine ima make it better  
Always  
You know me  
I aint no cloudy weather  
And when the sun dont shine ima make it better

Dont cry ima make it better  
Open your eyes dont cry  
Ima make it better  
Always  
Dont cry ima make it better  
Open your eyes sunshine  
Ima make it better  
Always  
  
Ill be your cover be your shelter  
To protect you from the weather  
Tell me what you need  
Count on me to make it better  
Call on me so late at night  
Just to be your guiding light boo  
So when the rain comes fallin  
Ima be the one to catch you  
Im gonna take my time with you  
The storm is coming come inside  
Ive been there too  
Nothin ever gonna hurt you  
As long as Im beside you  
Hold my hand dont close your eyes Im here  
Were gonna make it through  
  
Hey dont go

And when the sun dont shine ima make it better

And when the sun dont shine ima make it better
