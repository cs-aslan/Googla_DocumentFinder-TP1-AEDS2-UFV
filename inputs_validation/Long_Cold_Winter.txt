Ive been down  
Ive been cryin in the dead of night  
Ive been tryin ive been tryin  
To find the time to make it right  
Its gonna be a long cold winter  
Long cold winter without your love  
  
Ive been walkin  
Ive been freezin  
Freezin from a love i left behind  
Ive been searchin ive been searchin  
Cant find my peace of mind  
Its gonna be a long cold winter  
Long cold winter without your love

Baby baby baby ooo im freezin  
Im freezin im freezin im cold  
So so so cold  
Its gonna be a long cold winter  
Long cold winter without your love yea
