You and I in this moment  
Holding the night so close  
Hanging on still unbroken  
while outside the thunder rolls  
Listen now you can her my heart beat  
warm against lifes bitter cold  
  
These are the days  
the sweetest days well know  
  
There are times that scare me  
Well rattle the house like the wind  
both of us so unbending  
We battle the fear within  
All the while life is rushing by us  
Hold it now and dont let go  
  
These are the days  
the sweetest days well know  
  
So well whisper a dream here in the darkness  
Watching the stars till their gone  
And when even the memries have all faded away  
these days go on and on  
  
Listen now you can hear my heartbeat  
Hold me now and dont let go  
These are the days  
evry day is the sweetest day well know  
These are the days
