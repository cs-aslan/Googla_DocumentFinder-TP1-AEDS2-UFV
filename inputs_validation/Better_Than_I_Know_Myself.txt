You were there  at the moment I began  
When the child became a man  
Saw my future in the making  saw the path my life was taking  
You saw a million things Ill never understand  
  
You know me better than I know myself  
Better than I know myself  
Time after time youve shown it to be true  
That no one loves me like you  
  
You are here so let it rain or let it shine  
You are with me all the time  
When Im waking  when Im sleeping  
In the secret thoughts Im keeping  
  
You know everything about this heart of mine  
You know me better than I know myself  
Better than I know myself  
Time after time youve shown it to be true  
  
That no one loves me like you  
Youll be there  when the end of time has come  
And I know youll take me home  
So I thank you for tomorrow  
  
All my joys and all my sorrows  
And I thank you for the greatest thing Ive known  
You know me better than I know myself  
Better than I know myself  
  
Time after time youve shown it to be true  
That no one loves me like you
