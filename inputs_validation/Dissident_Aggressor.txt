Grand canyons of space and time universal  
My mind is subjected to all  
  
Stab Bawl Punch Crawl  
Hooks to my brain are well in  
Stab Bawl Punch Crawl  
I know what I am Im Berlin  
  
Through cracked blackened memories of unit dispersal  
I face the impregnable wall  
  
Stab Bawl Punch Crawl  
Hooks to my brain are well in  
Stab Bawl Punch Crawl  
I know what I am Im Berlin  
  
Exploding reloading this quest never ending  
Until I give out my last breath  
  
Im stabbing and bawling Im punching and crawling  
Hooks to my brain are well in  
Im stabbing and bawling Im punching and crawling  
I know what I am Im Berlin
