Hyde Hyde  
Someone is spending my money for me  
The money I earn I never see  
In all things I do he interferes  
All I know is trouble as soon as he appears  
  
Mister Hyde Mister Hyde Mister Hyde Mister Hyde Hyde  
When I drink my potion my character changes  
My whole mind and body rearranges  
This strange transformation takes place in me  
Instead of myself everybody can see  
  
Mister Hyde Mister Hyde Mister Hyde Mister Hyde Hyde  
Whenever youre with me make sure its still me  
Ive got to the stage I cant tell which Ill be  
The loveable fellow wholl buy you a drink  
Then when hes drunk his hell change in a wink into  
  
Hyde Mister Hyde Mister Hyde Mister Hyde Hyde
