spoken This is a song I wrote with John Prine 4 years ago 1972 and we
tried to put into one song everything that had ever been in any of the
country and western songs we had ever heard Tried to put it all into one
song Serves us right This is what came out  
  
Well it was all I could do to keep from cryin  
Some times it seems so useless to remain  
Youre the one who always tried to change me  
And that is why I will always stay the same  
  
Chorus  
But Ill hang around as long as you will let me  
I never minded standing in the rain  
You dont have to call me darlin darlin  
But you never even call me by my name  
  
No you dont have to call me Freddy Fender  
You dont have to call me Charlie Pride  
You dont have to call me Merle Haggard anymore  
Even though you know youre on my fighting side  
  
Chorus this verse only  
And Im gonna hang around as long as you will let me  
I never minded standing in the rain when nights are cold and lonely  
You dont have to call me darlin darlin  
But you never even call me by name  
  
musical by mouth improv done in a Merle Haggardlike tone no words  
  
spoken Ive seen my name a few times in the phone book  
spoken And on the neon sign above the bar I used to own  
spoken And theres only one thing Im really sure of was that sucker  
Youre gonna hear it when my savior calls me home  
  
spoken Thats a lot to get into one song We left out all the good stuff
Dallas dope divorce dead dogs trains prison Christmas mothers farms and
trucks Mothers prison trucks trains farms Christmas and dead dogs are
essential you cant have a good country song without them things And with
all due respect this song needs mothers prison trucks trains farms
Christmas and dead dogs and is that it Whatever it is  its also 4 minutes
long already theyre going whens he gonna end whens he gonna end in the
booth back there So Ill just tack this verse on the end here  
  
Ever since the dog died and mama went to prison  
Aint nothin round this old farm thats been the same  
Spoken You know when mom broke out last Christmas  
She drove the getaway laundry truck into a train  
  
Chorus  
But Ill hang around as long as you will let me  
I never minded standing in the rain  
You dont have to call me darlin darlin  
But you never even call me by my name
