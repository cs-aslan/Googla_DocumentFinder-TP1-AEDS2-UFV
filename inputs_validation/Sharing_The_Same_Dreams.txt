We found each other  
But little did we know  
That in truth my sisters  
Togetherness can make love grow  
Were always better together  
Than when were apart  
Were sharing the same dreams in our hearts  
Were sharin  
Sharin the same dreams  
Yes You and me  
And good things  
Good things will happen  
If we wait wait and see  
Well make it together  
Sink or swim  
And neither one of us will be  
Out on alimb  
Were sharin sharin the same dreams  
Yes You and me  
We may be different  
But then thats who we are  
Just remember my sisters  
Were reachin for that lucky star  
We share the same joy and laughter sadness and tears  
Were stayin together for years and years
