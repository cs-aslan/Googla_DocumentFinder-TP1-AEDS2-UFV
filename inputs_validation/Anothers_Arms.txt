Late night watching tv  
Used to be you here beside me  
Used to be your arms around me  
Your body on my body  
  
When the world means nothing to me  
Anothers arms anothers arms  
When the pain just rips right through me  
Anothers arms anothers arms  
  
Late night watching tv  
Used to be you here beside me  
Is there someone there to reach me  
Someone there to find me  
  
When the pain just rips right through me  
Anothers arms anothers arms  
And thats just torture to me  
Anothers arms anothers arms  
  
Pull yourself into me  
Anothers arms anothers arms  
When the world means nothing to me  
Anothers arms anothers arms  
  
Got to pull you close into me  
Anothers arms anothers arms  
Pull yourself right through me  
Anothers arms anothers arms  
  
Late night watching tv  
Wish that you were here beside me  
Wish that your arms were around me  
Your body on my body
