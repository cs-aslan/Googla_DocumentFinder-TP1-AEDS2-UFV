Anna Lee Anna Lee the healer  
Healer with the healing hands  
Makes you well as quick as she can  
Youd love to see those smiling eyes  
Of Anna Lee  
  
From the Himalaya mountain side  
Of the Nishigesh  
To a California beach house  
Facing towards the sea  
Goes a gal who got her fame  
By going round healing folks

Healer with the healing hands  
Makes you well as quick as she can  
Youd feel those healing hands  
Of Anna Lee  
  
When she gets a chance to help someone  
Shes really happy

Shell quickly make you see

Just like she did for me
