You try then suffer  
Unemic birther  
Gets in the wayey  
He never earns her  
  
Wohoo  
Cause he did run it easy  
Wohoo  
If I will do the same  
Wohoo  
Cause youre sick and youre easy  
All that you get when you ever say  
Cause youre never  
pleased to see me  
  
I never taught her  
And cause how easy  
Shes not my problem  
Its not my problem  
  
Wohoo  
Cause I know what my name is  
Wohoo  
And I go on again  
Wohoo  
If you ever regret it  
You dont say what you never deem  
Cause youre never  
pleased to see me  
  
Oh Yeah x4
