You had all of them on your side didnt you  
You believe in all your lies didnt you  
The ruiners got a lot to prove hes got nothing to lose and now he  
Made you believe  
The ruiners your only friend well hes the living end to the cattle  
He deceives  
The raping of the innocent you know the ruiner ruins everything he  
Sees  
Now the only pure thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease  
How did you get so big  
How did you get so strong  
How did you get so hard  
How did you get so long  
You had to give them all a sign didnt you  
You had to covet what was mine didnt you  
The ruiners a collector hes an infector serving his shit to his flies  
Maybe there will come a day when those that you keep blind will  
Suddenly realize  
Maybe its a part of me you took to a place I hoped it would never go  
And maybe that fucked me up so much more than youll ever know  
How did you get so big  
How did you get so strong  
How did you get so hard  
How did you get so long  
What you gave to me  
My perfect ring of scars  
You know I can see what you really are  
You didnt hurt me nothing can hurt me  
You didnt hurt me nothing can stop me now
