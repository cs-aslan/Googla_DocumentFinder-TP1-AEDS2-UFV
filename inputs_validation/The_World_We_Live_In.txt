This is world that we live in  
I feel myself get tired  
This is the world that we live in  
  
Well maybe I was mistaken  
I heard a rumor that you quit this day and age  
Well maybe I was mistaken  
  
Bless your body bless your soul  
Pray for peace and self control  
  
I gotta believe its worth it  
Without a victory  
Im so sanctified and free  
Well maybe Im just mistaken  
  
Lesson learned and the wheels keep turning  
  
This is the world that we live in  
I cant take blame for two  
This is the world that we live in  
And maybe well make it through  
  
Bless your body bless your soul  
Pray for peace and selfcontrol  
  
Underneath the waterfall  
Baby were still in this  
  
This is the world that we live in  
Feel myself get tired  
This is the world that we live in  
  
I had a dream that I was falling down  
Theres no next time alone  
A storm wastes its water on me  
But my life was free  
  
I guess its the world that we live in  
Its not too late for that  
This is the world that we live in  
And no we cant go back  
  
This is the world that we live in  
We still want something real  
This is the world that we live in  
I know that  
  
This is the world that we live in
