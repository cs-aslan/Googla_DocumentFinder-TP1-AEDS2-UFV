I have a very good friend in Nashville Tennessee  
Who is a semiprofessional wino  
And during one of our recent and frequent conversations  
We got to talk about his religious philosophy  
And as far as I could determine this is the way he feels about it  
Lord can a drunk go to heaven  
Well frankly I dont see why not  
If the Lord loves the weak and the weary  
Well how come He cant love a sot  
Now I dont drink to hurt anybody  
Why I love everybody I meet  
I can quit any time but I dont want to  
And in fact I quit three times last week  
Now lemme tell you bout some of them preachers  
Lord you know some of em aint worth a dime  
Why theyre flirtin with all of them wider mm yeah  
And one is a wider of mine  
Oh I hear people prayin so fancy  
Why theyd be better off a sendin you mail  
Lord if they couldve heard me last Sunday  
Well Ive prayed em right out of that jail  
Now Lord if a drunk gets to heaven  
To walk on that great Golden Strand  
Would You give me a spot and the shade of a tree  
And remember Im a bourbon man
