Take a look inside  
Ive got nothing to hide oh no  
Ill beat around the bush  
Ive got nothing but time oh no oh no  
  
Youve got me holding on to nothing  
But nothing is all Ive got  
  
Chorus  
Leave me leave me  
Im a shut it all down  
Youve got a tendency to bring a man down  
I give up I give up  
Youve gotta get a gun to make a woman run  
  
So this is what it feels like  
Ill give you the last word  
Its alright its alright its alright  
  
Now this is the town this is the place  
If you are the one to give disgrace a name  
Then So be it  
  
Youve got me holding on to nothing  
But nothing is all Ive got  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
Oh take my car oh take my house  
I never liked that beat up motor mouth  
And it only looks so warm tonight  
Just like a stranger in the candlelight  
  
Take take take take  
Take it all  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
Leave me now  
Leave me now
