Lainie Marsh  
I hear the clock a tickin  
See the sweat upon my brow  
I know my destination  
Nothings gonna stop me now  
Im running on desire  
Baby Ive got nerves of steel  
Coming down to the wire  
Lord above me guide the wheel  
Keep me in your prayers tonight  
Ill be weary upon that road  
I know the finish lines in sight  
But I still have a ways to go  
Theres a junkyard dog a barkin  
In the valley down below  
Hes wanting me to stop and  
Gather up a heavy load  
Aint gonna heed his call  
Aint givin him the time of day  
You mangy mutt once and for all  
I said I threw that stuff away  
I wont have a bit of trouble  
Heading down the straight and true  
Ill fly solo on the double  
Into the yonder blue  
I might need some intervention  
Out upon the icy turn  
In a foggy situation  
Squealin on a hairpin curve  
Im running on desire  
Baby Ive got nerves of steel  
Coming down to the wire  
Lord above me guide the wheel  
Keep me in your prayers tonight  
Ill be weary upon that road  
I know the finish lines in sight  
But I still have a ways to go  
Keep me in your prayers tonight  
Ill be weary upon that road  
I know the finish lines in sight  
But I still have a ways to go  
Got a ways to go got a ways to go
