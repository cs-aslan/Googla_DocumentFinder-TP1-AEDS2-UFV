I ask myself should I put my finger to the left no  
I ask myself should I put my finger to the right no  
I say it really doesnt matter where I put my finger  
Someone else will come along and move it  
And its always been the same  
Its just a complicated game  
  
A little girl asked me should she part her hair upon the left no  
A little girl asked me should she part her hair upon the right no  
I said it doesnt really matter where you part your hair  
Someone else will come along and move it and its  
Always been the same  
Its just a complicated game  
  
A little boy asked me should he put his vote upon the left no  
A little boy asked me should he put his vote upon the right no  
I say it really doesnt matter where you put your vote  
Someone else will come along and move it  
And its always been the same  
Its just a complicated game  
  
They wanted Tom  
They wanted Joe  
To dress em up and stick em out on show  
They were arrows in a very bad aim  
Its just a complicated game  
  
God asked me should he ought to put his world on the left no  
God asked me should he ought to put his world on the right no  
I said God it really doesnt matter where you put your world  
Someone will come along and move it  
And its always been the same  
Its just a complicated game
