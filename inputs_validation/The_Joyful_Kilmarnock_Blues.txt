Im not going to talk about doubts and confusion  
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut  
Id never been to Ayrshire  
I hitched down one saturday  
Sixty miles to Kilmarnock  
To see Hibernian play  
The day was bright and sunny  
But the game I wont relay  
And there was no Kilmarnock Bunnet  
To make me want to stay  
  
But Im not going to talk about it  
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut  
When I started walking at Wishaw  
My eyes obscured my vision  
After five miles on my way  
I began to learn to listen  
  
I walked through the country  
I walked through the town  
I held my head up  
And I didnt look down  
The question doesnt matter  
The answers always aye  
The best view of all  
Is where the land meets the sky
