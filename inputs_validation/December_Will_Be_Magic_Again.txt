December will be magic again  
Take a husky to the ice  
While Bing Crosby sings White Christmas He makes you feel nice  
December will be magic again  
Old Saint Nicholas up the chimney  
Just apopping up in my memory  
  
Ooh dropping down in my parachute  
The white city she is so beautiful  
Upon the blacksoot icicled roofs  
Oh and see how I fall  
See how I fall  
Fall backwards  
Like the snow  
  
Come to cover the lovers  
Cover the lovers  
But dont you wake them up  
Come to sparkle the dark up  
Sparkle the dark up  
With just a touch of makeup  
Come to cover the muck up  
Cover the muck up  
Oh with a little luck  
  
December will be magic again  
Light the canDLelights  
To conjure Mr Wilde  
Into the Silent Night  
Oh its quiet inside  
Here in Oscars mind  
  
December will be magic again  
Dont miss the brightest star  
Kiss under mistletoe  
I want to hear you laugh  
Dont let the mystery go now  
  
Oh dropping down in my parachute  
The white city she is so beautiful  
Upon the blacksoot icicled roofs  
Oh and see how I fall  
See how I fall  
Fall backwards  
Like the snow  
  
Come to cover the lovers  
Cover the lovers  
But dont you wake them up  
Come to sparkle the dark up  
Sparkle the dark up  
With just a touch of makeup  
Come to cover the muck up  
Cover the muck up  
Oh with a little luck  
  
Oh Im coming to cover the lovers  
Oh and Im coming to sparkle the dark up  
Oh and Im coming to cover the muck up
