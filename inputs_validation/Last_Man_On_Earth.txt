I dont know why my whole world came crashin down  
I just woke up in lonely town  
I opened up my eyes and much to my surprise  
Look at this heaven that Ive found  
Dont need to care about tomorrow  
I got no pain I got no sorrow  
  
Im the last man on earth  
So tell me what its worth  
Am I a beggar or a king  
Got no trouble got no time  
Eternity is mine  
I got a whole lot of everything  
  
I can take this town  
And just burn it to the ground  
Smash every window that I see  
I can smoke I can drink  
I can swear an I can stink  
There aint no one to bother me  
No no  
  
Dont need to care about tomorrow  
I got not pain I got no sorrow  
  
Im the last man on earth  
So tell me what its worth  
Am I a beggar or a king  
Got no trouble got no time  
Eternity is mine  
I got a whole lot of everything  
Its all mine  
  
Theres not a single soul to talk to me  
But thats okay I never liked them  
  
Im the last man on earth  
And I know what its worth  
Im not a beggar Im a king  
Got no troubles got no time  
And everything is fine  
Cause Im the king of everything  
Its all mine  
Mine mine mine mine mine mine
