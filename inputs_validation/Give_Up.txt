Give up give up  
Give up youre love to me  
Give up give up  
Give up youre love to me  
  
You better listen well  
When i tell you  
To be on the look out  
You cant call for help  
  
Cause i know you inside out  
Despite all your hideouts  
Im no great pretender  
Ill make you surrender  
  
So come along quietly  
Heres a thought to remember  
I have not met a man yet  
To escape from my dragnet  
  
Give up give up  
Give up youre love to me  
Give up give up  
Give up youre love to me  
Give up give up  
Give up youre love to me  
  
Ill give you just the facts man  
And you can draw all your own conclusions  
Ill keep your mind surrounded  
With chains of love so strong  
  
You cant break through them  
My arsenal is stocked  
With all kinds of seductive weapons  
Although your hearts locked up  
  
My love will assist me  
So that you cant resist me
