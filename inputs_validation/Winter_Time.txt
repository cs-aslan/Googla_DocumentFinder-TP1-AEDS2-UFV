In the winter time  
When all the leaves are brown  
And the wind blows so chill  
And the birds have all flown for the summer  
Im callin hear me callin hear me callin  
  
In the winter time  
When all the leaves are brown  
And the wind blows so chill  
And the birds have all flown for the summer  
Im callin hear me callin hear me callin  
Im callin hear me callin hear me callin  
In the winter time  
  
In the winter time  
When all the leaves are brown  
And the wind blows so chill  
And the birds have all flown for the summer  
Im callin hear me callin hear me callin
