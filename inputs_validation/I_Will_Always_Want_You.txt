Dont go  
Theres so much left to tell you  
You just dont know how need you  
I never said how I cared  
Until now that youre leaving  
I cant hide what Im feeling  
  
Please wait theres so much left to tell you  
I never said how I loved you  
Oh cant you stay one more day  
And Ill try to show all of the love  
That I used to keep from you  
  
Words alone cant make you love me  
But how else am I to say to you  
That I know I will always want you  
  
Help me I cant stop myself crying  
Help me cause I feel like Im dying  
Please cant you stay with me  
Cause I cant live without you my love  
  
Words alone cant make you love me  
But how else am I to say to you  
That I know I will always want you Oh oh oh oh  
  
So help me I cant stop myself crying  
Help me cause I feel like Im dying  
Please cant you stay with me  
Cause I cant live without you my love
