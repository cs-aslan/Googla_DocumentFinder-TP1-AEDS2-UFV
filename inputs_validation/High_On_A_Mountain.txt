High on a mountain top  
We live we love and we laugh a lot  
Folks up here know what they got  
High on a mountain top  
  
High on a mountain top  
Where the rest of the worlds like a little bitty spot  
I aint comin down no never Im not  
High on a mountain top high on a mountain top  
  
Where I come from the mountain flowers grow wild  
The blue grass sways like its goin out of style  
God fearin people simple and real  
Cause up on the ridge folks thats the deal  
  
Well my daddy worked down in the dark coal mine  
Shovelin that coal one shovel at a time  
Never made a lot money didnt have much  
But were high on life and rich in love  
  
High on a mountain top  
We live we love and we laugh a lot  
Folks up here know what they got  
High on a mountain top  
  
High on a mountain top  
Where the rest of the worlds like a little bitty spot  
I aint comin down no never Im not  
High on a mountain top high on a mountain top  
  
Well down in the holler lived my uncle Joe  
Hed pull out his fiddle and rosin his bow  
Wed all sing and dance and we aint gonna stop  
And the moon shine flows behind every rock  
  
High on a mountain top  
We live we love and we laugh a lot  
Folks up here know what they got  
High on a mountain top  
  
High on a mountain top  
Where the rest of the worlds like a little bitty spot  
I aint comin down no never Im not  
High on a mountain top high on a mountain top  
  
Well we lay on our backs and we count the stars  
Cause up here folks Heavens not that far  
  
High on a mountain top  
We live we love and we laugh a lot  
Folks up here know what they got  
High on a mountain top  
  
High on a mountain top  
Where the rest of the worlds like a little bitty spot  
I aint comin down no never Im not  
High on a mountain top high on a mountain top
