Song By Faith Hill and Tim  
If I could win your heart  
If youd let me in your heart  
Id be so happy baby  
Just for these arms to be  
Holding you close to me  
Theres nothing in this world I wont try  
No limit to what Id do  
To make you mine cause  
  
Id climb right up to the sky  
Id take down the stars  
Just to be in your arms baby  
Id go and capture the moon  
Thats what I would do  
Just to hear you say that you love me  
Just to hear you say that you love me  
  
If I could taste your kiss  
Thered be no sweeter gift  
Heaven could offer baby oh baby  
I want to be the one I want to be the one  
Living to give you love  
Id walk across this world just to be  
Close to you cause I want you  
Close to me yeah  
  
Id climb right up to the sky  
Id take down the stars  
Just to be in your arms baby  
Id go and capture the moon  
Thats what I would do  
Just to hear you say that you love me  
Just to hear you say that you love me  
  
For the rest of your life  
for the rest of your life  
Love me for the rest of all time  
oh baby baby  
Just say the word  
And Ill give you my world  
Theres nothing I wont do  
Baby Just to be with you  
Id climb right up to the sky  
Take down the stars  
Just to be in your arms baby  
Id go and capture the moon  
Thats what I would do  
Just to hear you say that you love me  
Just to hear you say that you love me baby  
Just to hear you say that you love me  
Oh I need to hear you say  
That you love me baby  
Just to hear you say that you love me  
Just say you love me  
Just say you need me  
Just to hear you say that you love me
