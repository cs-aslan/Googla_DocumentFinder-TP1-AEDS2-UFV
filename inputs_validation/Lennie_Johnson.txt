Here we go tape rolling  
Sgt Pepper take 6  
  
He doesnt know which way to go  
Even though hes made the dough  
Lennie Johnsons lost his way  
Lennie Johnsons lost his way  
Hes lost his mind  
  
Lennie Johnsons lost his way  
  
He spent his time with words of rhyme  
Hes rang the chime  
We must find  
  
Lennie Johnsons lost his way  
Lennie Johnsons lost his way  
Hes lost his mind  
He had it yesterday  
Lennie Johnsons lost his way  
  
An apple a day keeps the doctor away  
Ive heard them say  
Not today
