Some people get up at the break of day  
Gotta go to work before it gets too late  
Sitting in a car and driving down the road  
It aint the way it has to be  
  
But thats what you do to earn your daily wage  
Thats the kind of world that we live in today  
Isnt where you want to be  
And isnt what you want to be  
  
Give me one more day one more day  
Give me another night just another night  
I need a second chance second chance  
This time Ill get it right This time Ill get it right  
  
Ill say one last time one last time  
Ive got to let you know Ive got to let you know  
Ive got to change your mind Ive got to change your mind  
Ill never let you go Ill never let you go  
  
Youve got to look at life the way it oughta be  
Looking at the stars from underneath the tree  
Theres a world inside and a world out there  
With that TV you just dont care  
  
Theyve got violence wars and killing too  
All shrunk down in a twofoot tube  
But out there the world is a beautiful place  
With mountains lakes and the human race  
This is where I want to be  
And this is what I want to do  
  
Give me one more day one more day  
Give me another night just another night  
I need a second chance second chance  
This time Ill get it right This time Ill get it right  
  
Ill say one last time one last time  
Ive got to let you know Ive got to let you know  
Ive got to change your mind Ive got to change your mind  
Ill never let you go Ill never let you go  
  
Just give me one more chance one more chance  
Give me another night just another night  
With just one more day one more day  
You know Ill get it right You know Ill get it right  
  
Ill say one last time one last time  
Ive got to let you know Ive got to let you know  
If I could change your mind If I could change your mind  
Ill never let you go Ill never let you go
