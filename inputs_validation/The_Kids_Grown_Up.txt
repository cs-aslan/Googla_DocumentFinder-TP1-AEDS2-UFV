Southdown motor co  
2a bus  
You can see right inside  
My parents house  
Sitting at the table and my dinners up  
Its gonna be different when  
The kids grown up  
Gonna save some money  
And quit this job  
Light the way  
Clear the stage  
The kids grown up  
Used to play in the underground  
Hyde park  
Now Im riding in a limousine  
Through the underpass  
Im sitting in an aeroplane  
Its all such a rush  
People all around me making  
So much fuss  
And Ive got a little money  
But it aint gonna burn me up  
If Im in your town  
Tonight I am  watch out  
The kids grown up
