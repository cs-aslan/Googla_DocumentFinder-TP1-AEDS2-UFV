This is the age of machinery  
A mechanical nightmare  
The wonderful world of technology  
Napalm hydrogen bombs biological warfare  
  
This is the twentieth century  
But too much aggravation  
Its the age of insanity  
What has become of the green pleasant fields of Jerusalem  
  
Aint got no ambition Im just disillusioned  
Im a twentieth century man but I dont want to be here  
My mama said she cant understand me  
She cant see my motivation  
Just give me some security  
Im a paranoid schizoid product of the twentieth century  
  
You keep all your smart modern writers  
Give me William Shakespeare  
You keep all your smart modern painters  
Ill take Rembrandt Titian Da Vinci and Gainsborough  
  
Girl we gotta get out of here  
We gotta find a solution  
Im a twentieth century man but I dont want to die here  
  
I was born in a welfare state  
Ruled by bureaucracy  
Controlled by civil servants  
And people dressed in grey  
Got no privacy got no liberty  
cause the twentieth century people  
Took it all away from me  
  
Dont want to get myself shot down  
By some trigger happy policeman  
Gotta keep a hold on my sanity  
Im a twentieth century man but I dont want to die here  
  
My mama says she cant understand me  
She cant see my motivation  
Aint got no security  
Im a twentieth century man but I dont want to be here  
  
This is the twentieth century  
But too much aggravation  
This is the edge of insanity  
Im a twentieth century man but I dont want to be here
