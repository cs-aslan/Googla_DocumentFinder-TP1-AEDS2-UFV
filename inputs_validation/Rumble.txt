Got a new haircut  
It cost me just six bucks  
Filled a plastic bag with the stuff I need in a big dumb car Im off my knees  
Fill it up and make me start again  
Ooh its the rumble and moan  
Transistor AM cassette drone  
Its the sound without a home address and hydromatic hopelessness  
Fill it up and start over again  
Yeah fill it up and start over again and again  
All night  
R A D I O  
Hit me hard and hit me low  
Static engine blow the scene rumble in the old machine  
R A D I O  
Ah hit me just like Lionel Rose  
R A D I O  
I heard stomach and soul  
A rumble underneath my toes  
And it didnt come with a clear face designer punk or daily rate  
Fill it up and make it start again  
Yeah fill it up dont make me start again and again  
All night  
R A D I O  
Hit me hard and hit me low  
Static engine blow the scene a rumble in the old machine  
R A D I O  
Ah hit me just like Lionel Rose  
R A D I O  
A rumble in the old machine  
R A D I O  
A rumble in the old machine  
R A D I O  
Yeah a rumble in the old machine  
R A D I O  
A rumble in the old machine  
Ronnie James D I O  
Fell down like Bocephus under all the noise and grease  
Automatic monostyle rip me up monkey style
