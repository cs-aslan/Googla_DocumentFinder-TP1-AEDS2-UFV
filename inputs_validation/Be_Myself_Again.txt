Let me introduce myself  
Im a woman that youve never seen  
You might know me from somewhere else  
As someone that Ive never been  
  
I gave everything to play the game  
My soul fell apart at the seams  
I fell down like a house of cards  
When somebody pulled the queen  
  
Chorus  
Cause you could spend your life  
Lookin for your own reflection  
Time could blur the lines  
Between whats real and whats projected  
Had I known what I lost  
What I gained what itd cost  
Id still give what remains  
To be myself again  
  
You must believe me when I say  
Dont live someone elses design  
Turn it around like a photograph  
The writings been there all the time  
  
Now you can have all these hopes and dreams  
The ones I cant use anymore  
I dont know what it is you lost  
But I hope you got what you came for  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes I want to leave right now  
Sometimes I want to cry out loud  
I want to let it all hang out  
But I dont want to let you down  
  
Sometimes I want to just lay here  
Sometimes I want to disappear  
I want to show you all my fear  
But I dont want to let you down  
  
Chorus  
  
To be myself again
