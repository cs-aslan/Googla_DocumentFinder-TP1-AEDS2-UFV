Ooh oh oh oh oh oh ooooooh  
I want to be inside your heart  
Thats place the place for me  
But i could understand it wont be easy  
Youve got to prove prove your love to me  
Youve got to prove prove your love to me  
  
Like i say it aint easy  
To let your heart run wild  
So if you want to please me baby  
Then dont act like a child  
But i can understand it won t be easy  
Youve got to prove prove your love to me  
Youve got to prove prove your love to me  
  
It doesnt matter if youre far away  
Or right here by my side  
Thats the way i feel about it  
We cant let the whole thing slide  
  
So if you cant see me  
Right where you are  
They why dont you send for me baby  
By the nearest star  
It wont be easy and youve got to prove  
Youve got to prove prove your love to me  
Youve got to prove prove your love to me  
  
Ooooohhhh oooooohh ooooooh
