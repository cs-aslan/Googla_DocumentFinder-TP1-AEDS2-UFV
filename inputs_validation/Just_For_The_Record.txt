Manys the time Ive been thinking about changing my ways  
But when it gets right down to it its the same drunken haze  
Im serving a sentence to write lifes sentences  
Its only when Im out of it I make sense of this  
  
Just for the record Im gonna put it down  
Just for the record Im gonna change my life around  
  
Just a revolutionary with a pseudonym  
Just a bar room dancer on my final fling  
Just another writer paying off my dues  
Just finding inspiration well thats my excuse  
  
Just for the record Im gonna put it down  
Just for the record Im gonna change my life around  
  
Just another empty gesture with an empty glass  
Just another comic actor behind a tragic mask  
But Ive got no discipline got no self control  
Just a little less painful here when my backs against the wall  
  
Its too late I found its too far Im in two minds  
Both of them are out of it at the bar  
When you say I got a problem thats a certainty  
But I can put it all right down to eccentricity  
Its just for the record its just a passing phase  
  
Just for the record I can stop any day
