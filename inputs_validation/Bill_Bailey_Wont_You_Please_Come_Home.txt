Wont you come home Bill Bailey wont you come home  
I moan the whole night long  
Ill do the cookin honey Ill pay the rent  
I know I done you wrong  
  
Remember that rainy eve that  
I drove you out with nothin but a fine tooth comb  
Yes I know that Im to blame and aint that a shame  
Bill Bailey wont you please come home
