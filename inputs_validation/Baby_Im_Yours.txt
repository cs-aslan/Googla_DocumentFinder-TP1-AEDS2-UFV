Baby Im yours  
And Ill be yours  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
Yours until the rivers all run dry  
  
Your the one until I die  
Baby Im yours  
And Ill be yours  
Until the sun no longer shines  
  
Yours until the poets run out of rhyme  
Your the one until the end of time  
Im gonna stay right here  
By your side  
  
Do my best to keep you satisfied  
Nothing in the world can drive me away  
Cause everyday youll hear me say  
Baby Im yours  
  
Im gonna stay right here  
By your side  
Do my best to keep you satisfied  
Nothing in the world can drive me away  
  
Cause everyday youll hear me say  
Baby Im yours  
And Ill be yours  
Until two and two is three  
  
Yours until the mountain crumbles to the sea  
Your the one until eternity  
Baby Im yours  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
  
Baby Im yours  
Til the rivers all run dry  
Baby Im yours
