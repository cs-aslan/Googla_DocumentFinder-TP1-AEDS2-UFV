Knock knock whos there  
Two thousand and twelve is a brand new year  
Cleaning house singing songs  
Shedding light and righting wrongs  
Ding dong the witch aint dead  
Shes still trying to take my bread  
Four more years til my girls all grown  
Then the bitch gotta have to leave me alone  
Its all good cause Im as happy as a flea  
On a mountain of dogs ya see  
A little music cured all the hurt and put hate in six feet of dirt  
  
I was looking for some heaven  
Theres no need to look no more  
California thiry seven  
Took me right to heavens door  
Knock knock whoah oh  
Rock and Rooll  
California thirty seven took me right to heavens door  
  
Heres to those who didnt think Train could ever roll again  
You were the fuel that I used when inspiration hit a dead end  
San Francisco got it done four one five took the nine one one  
Thank you all for believin in  
We wont let you down again  
Truth is it was attitude  
Replaced greed with gratitude  
Then replaced a pretty key dude  
Its all truth not being rude  
Making love now not mistakes  
Working hard instead of looking for breaks  
Came all the way from the eighth Great Lake  
And fond thirty seven reasons to stay  
  
I was looking for some heaven  
Theres no need to look no more  
California thirty seven  
Took me right to heavens door  
Knock knock whoah oh  
Rock and Rooll  
California thirty seven took me right to heavens door  
  
I was looking for some heaven  
Theres no need to look no more  
California thirty seven  
Took me right to heavens door
