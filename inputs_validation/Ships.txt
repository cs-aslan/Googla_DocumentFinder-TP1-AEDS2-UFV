ian hunter  
  
We walked to the sea just my father and me  
And the dogs played around on the sand  
Winter cold cut the air hanging still everywhere  
Dressed in gray did he say hold my hand  
I said loves easier when its far away  
We sat and watched the distant lights  
  
Were two ships that pass in the night  
And we smile when we say its alright  
Were still here its just that were out of sight  
Like those ships that pass in the night  
  
Theres a boat on the line where the sea meets the sky  
Theres another that rides far behind  
And it seems you and I are like strangers a wide  
Ways apart as we drift on through time  
He said its harder now youre far away  
We only read you when you write  
  
Were two ships that pass in the night  
We both smile when we say its alright  
Were still here oh its just that were out of sight  
Like those ships that pass in the night  
  
Were two ships that pass in the night  
Were two ships that pass in the night  
Were two ships that pass in the night  
  
repeat and fade
