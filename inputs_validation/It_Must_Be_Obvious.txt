Are you feeling alright  
Its easy weve been there before  
But it feels like the flight  
Of the von Trapps does that mean its war  
Oh no  
From my head to my toes  
Im in love with you  
Do you think it shows  
  
Were meant to be friends  
Thats what it says in the script  
Is it really the end  
If sometimes I stray just a bit  
Oh no  
It should be poetry not prose  
Im in love with you  
Do you think it shows  
  
And everyone knows when they look at us  
Course they do it must be obvious  
I never told you now I suppose  
That youre the only one who doesnt know  
  
You were different when  
We met in an ordinary way  
I didnt intend  
To interrupt your own shadowplay  
Oh no  
I wont upset the status quo  
Im in love with you  
Do you think it shows  
  
And everyone knows when they look at us  
Course they do it must be obvious  
Youve never asked me and Im surprised  
That youre the only one who hasnt tried  
  
Everyone knows when they look at us  
Course they do it must be obvious  
I never asked you now I suppose  
That youre the only one who doesnt know  
  
Aah  
When they look at us  
It must be obvious  
Oooh
