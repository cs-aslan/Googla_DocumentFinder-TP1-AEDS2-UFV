Like a bolt of lightning like a bolt of thunder  
Like a cloudy day down at the zoo  
Like a drowning man that will never go under  
That close to you yeah that close to you  
In the middle of the night  
Youd ask me to make you smile  
Youd come on like a one armed child  
With a hole in its shoe poor you  
Everybody oughtta know  
It only hurts you for a little while  
So stop putting yourself on trial  
For something you didnt do  
Not you to me cant we be just like  
Lovers and mothers and brothers and sorrow  
Can I find a little something with a nicer view  
Im hating to plead but Im begging to borrow  
Just to be close to you yeah that close to you  
In the middle of the night  
Youd ask me to make you smile  
Youd come on like a one armed child  
With a hole in its shoe poor you  
Everybody oughtta know  
It only hurts you for a little while  
So stop putting yourself on trial  
For something you didnt do  
Not you to me cant we be just like  
Lovers and mothers and brothers and sorrow  
Can I find a little something with a nicer view  
Im hating to plead but Im begging to borrow  
Just to be that close to you yeah that close to you  
Ooh that close to you yeah that close to you
