As a young boy chasing dragons with your wooden sword so mighty  
Youre St George or youre David and you always killed the beast  
Times change very quickly  
and you had to grow up early  
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet  
  
Chorus  
Youll die as you lived  
In a flash of the blade  
In a corner forgotten by no one  
You lived for the touch  
For the feel of the steel  
One man and his honor  
  
The smell of resigned leather  
The steely iron mask  
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing masters call  
He taught you all he knew  
To fear no mortal man  
and now youll wreak your vengeance in the  
Screams of evil men  
  
Chorus
