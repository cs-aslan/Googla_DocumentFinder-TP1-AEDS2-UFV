FaithWalkin People  
By Amy Grant  
Well it seems with You  
There is something new  
Every time I turn around  
Oh I never really know quite what to expect  
But it wont get me down  
Cause I know You bring  
Each and everything  
Just to teach me how to live  
And the secret of it all is trusting in You  
And the wisdom You give  
So say goodbye to the feelings  
Cause the feelings go away  
Say goodbye to the people  
Cause the people never stay  
And say goodbye to the future  
When it blinds you to today  
And say goodbye to the reasoning  
Thats standing in the way  
Oh weve got to break away  
Break away to be  
Faithwalkin people  
You cant rely on everything you feel  
Faithtalkin people  
We must discern whats really real  
Faithwalkin people  
You cant believe in everything you see  
Faithtalkin people  
Seems like such a mystery  
Daaada ba da dahdat dah  
Da ba dahda ba da dahdat dah  
Da ba latdah dat dah  
But in all the earth  
There is nothing worth  
Half as much as life with You  
Cause the people and things were countin on here  
Theyre gonna pass away too  
But I dont understand  
Everything Hes been  
But I dont really have to know  
Cause Hes giving me a joy thats filling my heart  
But Ive learned to let go  
So say goodbye to the feelings  
Cause the feelings go away  
Say goodbye to the people  
Cause the people never stay  
And say goodbye to the future  
When it blinds you to today  
And say goodbye to the reasoning  
Thats standing in the way  
Oh weve got to break away  
Break away to be  
Faithwalkin people  
You cant rely on everything you feel  
Faithtalkin people  
We must discern whats really real  
Faithwalkin people  
You cant believe in everything you see  
Faithtalkin people  
Seems like such a mystery  
Daaada ba da dahdat dah  
Da ba dahda ba da dahdat dah  
Da ba datdah dat dah
