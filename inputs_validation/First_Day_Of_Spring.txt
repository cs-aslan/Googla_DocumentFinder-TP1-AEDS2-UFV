When I Got Her Love Here  
Look What What Ive Tumbled Upon  
The Woman That Sees Me Me For Me  
Not What Ive Done  
You Give Me This This Bling Bading  
I Give You My Time  
Girl You Make Me Feel Like Everythings Alright  
Youre Sorta Like  
Hearing The Birds Churping In The Morning Light  
Or Maybe Even Recieving A Kiss Goodnight  
Girl You Got Me Believing We Just Might  
End Up Bein More Than Jus Two Friends  
  
When Were Together It Feels Ideal  
The Sunny Weather Puts A Smile Right On My Face  
So Why Would I Ever Turn My Back On What We Had  
Oh Girl  
You Always Bring That First Day Of Spring  
  
We Kept Things Friendly Friendly  
Without Crossing That Boundary  
Darling Im Expressing  
Are You Listening  
You Give Me That That Bling Bading  
To Give You My Time  
Girl You Make Me Feel Like Everythings Alright  
Youre Sorta Like  
Hearing The Birds Churping In The Morning Light  
Or Maybe Even Recieving A Kiss Goodnight  
Girl You Got Me Believing We Just Might  
End Up Bein More Than Jus Two Friends  
  
When Were Together It Feels Ideal  
The Sunny Weather Puts A Smile Right On My Face  
So Why Would I Ever Turn My Back On What We Had  
Oh Girl  
You Always Bring That First Day Of Spring
