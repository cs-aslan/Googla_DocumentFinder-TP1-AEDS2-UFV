Uh yes yes yall feel the beat yall  
Freak freak yall  
You dont stop  
Uh yes yes yall feel the beat yall  
Freak freak yall  
You dont stop  
  
When Def Jam signed me  
They hit the lottery  
It wasnt free but dont call it a robbery  
They underestimated me quite possibly  
Its like that when you a godfather b  
Im the greatest of all time  
You heard that before  
But now when I say it  
It means so much more  
Cause Its so true  
No hype man No crew  
No reason for ghost writers  
Every year I get tighter  
Mothers and daughters agree Im on fire  
Check ya TMobile its all over the wire  
Cross ya legs baby hide ya desire  
You think Im hot  
You preaching to the choir  
Smiling and giggling  
Thirsting like Gilligan  
More flavor than cinnamon  
They rush with adrenaline  
I make em nervous  
I do it on purpose  
I come back hotter  
Every time I resurface  
Drop to ya knees baby  
Praise the king  
Now ask Russell Simmons  
Who built the west wing  
I aint gotta be cocky  
I do the damn thing  
Paint ya girl with strawberry frosting  
Internationally known and respected  
You talk slick Im too large to be affected  
You crank call my cells disconnected  
You keep slipping but my games perfected  
  
Uh yes yes yall feel the beat yall  
Freak freak yall  
You dont stop  
Uh yes yes yall feel the beat yall  
Freak freak yall  
You dont stop  
Uh yes yes yall feel the beat yall  
Freak freak yall  
You dont stop  
Uh yes yes yall feel the beat yall  
Freak freak yall  
You dont stop  
  
Im a star for real my aura is crazy  
Hollywood love me in the streets Im gravy  
Born with a gift to inspire the hood  
You want to out do me and I wish you would  
Im the master separate from all these cats  
Im laughin in 86 I balled like that  
Honey catching feeling from sittin in Maybachs  
Cause her project hall is smelling like Ajax  
Thats understandable but everybody relax  
Hate when folk get money and dont know how to act  
Im a multi millionaire homey thats a fact  
But its not the ice that makes ya wife react  
Been had an entourage and platinum cards  
Been getting Swedish massage in Boca Raton  
What you think all them years I aint pop no Don  
Spend a night in Trump Towers with a blue eyed blond  
I been did it all my Benzes was kitted  
When you talk like a baller you tickle me with it  
But yeah theres money out there come on lets get it  
But Im a get it in such a way you never forget it  
Lets go twenty platinum albums in a row  
Sixty thousand fans a three hour show  
I could care less who drop and blow  
My name is LL baby thats beyond the flow  
  
Uh yes yes yall feel the beat yall  
Freak freak yall  
You dont stop  
Uh yes yes yall feel the beat yall  
Freak freak yall  
You dont stop  
Uh yes yes yall feel the beat yall  
Freak freak yall  
You dont stop  
Uh yes yes yall feel the beat yall  
Freak freak yall

These rap cats get upset with me  
When security clear out the VIP  
If honey want to lounge we gone see ID  
Aint no negotiating you gone pay my fee  
Im the boss I call the shots to keep it hot  
I dont have competition Im bigger than the slot  
While you waste advances on gray market rocks  
I cop municipal bonds and Wal Mart stocks  
A family man but hard as a rock  
And I die for my kids so stay off my block  
They might be impressed with you but Im not  
After all these years I still walk with a bop  
Still keep the ink hot  
Still scheme like a fox  
Still ready to battle  
You dont want your career stopped  
Industry shocked cause I mapped out a plot  
And ran around humble with my joint on cock  
  
Uh yes yes yall feel the beat yall  
Freak freak yall  
You dont stop  
Uh yes yes yall feel the beat yall  
Freak freak yall  
You dont stop  
Uh yes yes yall feel the beat yall  
Freak freak yall  
You dont stop  
Uh yes yes yall feel the beat yall  
Freak freak yall  
You dont stop
