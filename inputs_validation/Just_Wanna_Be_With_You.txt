When you leave me please tell me goodbye  
Please dont go without telling me why  
Cause I would rather be hurt and confused  
I dont wanna read your mind so tell me the truth  
  
Is it anything that I say  
Or is it everything that I do  
Tell me baby cause  
I dont wanna be far from you  
  
Im trying to make you see  
That you belong to me  
Tell me youll stay forever  
I love for a while wont do  
I know that this much is true  
I just want to love you  
  
If you need me Ill be by your side  
Always know that I dont have too much pride  
Just remember that I am you long to  
Look into my eyes and youll find  
Itll always be you  
  
Is it anything that I say  
Or is it everything that I do  
Tell me baby cause  
I dont wanna be far from you  
  
Im trying to make you see  
That you belong to me  
Tell me youll stay forever  
I love for a while wont do  
I know that this much is true  
I just want to love you  
  
The time you know my love is for real  
the time you know is now I feel  
The time you know for sure  
That I will always care for you  
I will always care for you  
  
Im trying to make you see  
That you belong to me  
Tell me youll stay forever  
I love for a while wont do  
I want forever with you  
I just wanna be with you
