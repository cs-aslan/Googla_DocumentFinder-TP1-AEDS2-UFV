This song is not a Backstreet song  
althought Howie sings it with his sister  
I think its important to say that  
  
  
Yesterday is now a memory  
Just a picture on the wall  
Of a life I once shared with you  
Someone who listened when I called  
Bridge  
So many things I should have said to you  
I had the chance and let it slip away  
If I could fly to heaven if I could fly up  
Just to see you one more time just to see you one more time  
Id fly all the way to heaven to heaven  
Just to say that I love you  
The last three words you said to me  
I love you  
Remain an echo in my mind remain an echo in my mind  
Never imagined that youd leave so soon  
I will miss you sweet Caroline  
Bridge  
Chorus  
If I could fly to heaven vuelvo a cielo  
Just to see you one more time quiero verte otra vez  
Id fly all the way to heaven directo al cielo  
Just to say that I love you  
Angel de la guardia Now I lay me down to sleep  
Dulce compania I pray my heart and soul Ill keep  
No me desampares And if I should die before I wake  
Ni de noche ni de dia In your arms my soul youll take  
Chorus  
Te Amo  
Chorus 2 xs  
  
  
This song is in the album of Pollyanna written by Howie D and Pollyanna
