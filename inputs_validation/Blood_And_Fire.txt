You can always tell the winners  
The saints and the sinners  
Down at the starting line  
Im a lucid vision  
Of the unforgiven  
Im your wavetoss guy  
  
Kingsize we were crushin  
Trouble by the dozen  
Stakes have never been higher  
Come back when youre younger  
Cause I can feel the thunder  
1800GUITAR  
  
Ooooh yeahhh  
We came we came we came through blood and fire  
We came we came we came through blood and fire  
  
Now look at all of the people here tonight  
  
Its a world of fools  
Thats just whats expected  
None of em know it  
Or even suspect it  
God must love the lazy  
Shiftless and the crazy  
Puttin so many in life  
  
Ooooh yeahhh  
  
We came we came we came through blood and fire  
We came we came we came through blood and fire  
  
Now look at all of the people here tonight  
  
Forgotten empires  
Lost victories long past  
Every time I bloomed again  
I thought it was the last  
And then something crazy happens  
And boom  
Im doing the victory dance  
  
Told ya I was comin back  
Told ya  
Say you missed me  
Say it  
Say it like ya mean it  
  
You can always tell the winners  
The saints and the sinners  
Down at the starting line  
  
Ooooh yeahhh  
We came we came we came through blood and fire  
We came we came we came through blood and fire  
We came we came we came through blood and fire
