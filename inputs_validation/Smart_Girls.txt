Where did all these smart girls come from  
I dont think that I could choose just one  
Where did all these smart girls come from  
Someone tell me how to get me some  
  
On the floor in the car  
On the seat at the bar  
Wherever I go  
Thats where they are  
  
Smart girls  
Never get enough of those  
Smart girls  
Smart girls  
  
I want to be a bad boy right now  
The real me is dying to hang out  
I know you know what Im talking about  
Ive got a feeling you could show me how  
  
On a bus on a train  
On a boat on a plane  
Im falling in love  
What was your name  
  
Smart girls  
Never get enough of those  
Smart girls  
Sleeping in the buff  
  
Yumi Sherie Alison Mary  
Which one do I want to marry  
Theyre all smart girls  
Theyre all smart girls  
Sheena Lola Fabiola  
Dont you know you make me lose my mind

Smart girls  
Skipping in the buff
