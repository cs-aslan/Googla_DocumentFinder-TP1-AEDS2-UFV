The place I love is a million miles away  
Its too far for the eye to see  
Still its me at least and you cant come there  
No one is allowed at all  
Only animals that love will always only ever could be  
And its always at the back of my mind  
The place I love is overgrown now  
With beautiful moss and colorful flowers  
And goldfish that swim in a pool theres a small brick wall  
  
With neon lighting controlled by lightning  
Im making a stand against the world  
theres those who would hurt us if they heard  
  
The place I love is no where near here  
Not within a mile of those trendy dos  
Where dogs bodies pick you up and graciously give you a lift  
  
With cherished thoughts and bitterness  
Im making a stand against the world  
theres those who would hurt us if they heard  
And thats always in the back of my mind
