Shakespeare  
Mr three o five  
This is to them boys that be in the club  
That talk a whole lot of nothing  
  
Chorus  
Shhh  
Be quiet  
Keep it cool you dont wanna start a riot  
Shh  
Be quiet  
Keep it cool you dont wanna start a riot  
Lets ride lets ride  
Lets go lets go  
Lets ride lets ride lets go lets go  
Lets ride lets ride lets go lets go  
Lets ride lets ride lets go lets go  
Let the beat ride hey hey  
Now let the beat ride hey hey  
Now let the beat ride hey hey  
Now let the beat ride hey hey  
Now let the beat ride  
  
Im rolling  
Through the backstreets  
Them boys dont applaud  
But they clap heat  
Im in that seven forty fizzle  
With them dark boys on it low key  
Blowing that ohee  
Jump out They like whos he  
Im a snatch about two or three  
Its a Dade thing when you speak cocaine  
Slash perico chi chi get the yayo mang  
Im stating facts  
This where we from  
The bottom dog  
This where you come  
When you need it want it dont got it in the drought  
Looking for a good price  
Hit ninety five south  
Ks as in kilos  
Ps as in pounds  
E as in ex  
We got it on deck  
So show some respect  
To the cocaine capital  
Dade County bitch  
  
Shh  
Be quiet  
Keep it cool you dont wanna start a riot  
Im cool Im quiet  
A couple shots will put yo ass on a diet  
This is for them big boys  
Doing them big things  
In the big Chevys  
With them big rims  
Making big noise  
With them big speakers  
And anytime they cook yay  
Its some big beakers  
Listen buddy  
We off the chain  
Now what they do what it is what it aint  
Listen buddy  
We off the chain  
I suggest you hand over them thangs  
I got my game from Jose Antonio Armando Perez Torres  
Ese si era mi consorte  
And I missed ya dad  
But I know you watching me  
With you in heaven  
I know aint stopping me  
The game is mine now  
Im building  
Im just tryna get paper like Seinfeld  
Sign seal deliver its done  
Ready or not here I come  
Dale  
  
Chorus
