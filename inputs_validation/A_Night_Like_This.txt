Sixteen years old looking for a hideaway  
Im a set designer my Mum and Dad  
Thinking Im gay  
Im a lazy bugger but I like my sport  
Like girls and music Im happy happy sort  
Of a guy  
  
But theres one thing Im lacking  
Its sexual experience  
So I ask you my sweetheart  
Save me from this wilderness  
  
Ive dreamed honey of a night like this  
  
Where I come from love is  
Just a hole in the wall  
And the steel mills ring out and generations  
Heed the call  
  
And the rain never stops and the skies are grey  
And the chance of romance  
Slim as a bright sunny day  
  
This is partly the reason  
Im so overwhelmed and shy  
Because your beauty by contrast  
Is gonna make a young man cry  
  
Ive dreamed honey of a night like this  
Ive schemed honey of a night like this  
  
You dont know what it means to a boy from  
A suburban home  
To be left with a woman like you  
Completely alone  
  
Ive dreamed honey of a night like this  
Nice place youve got here babe  
Never seen a house like this  
  
Pool like an ocean bed like a football pitch  
  
All the guys at the boozer wont believe my luck  
But it couldnt have happened to a nicer bloke  
Than me  
  
So here we are the records  
Gotten stuck in the groove  
My knees are trembling cmon baby make a move  
  
Ive dreamed honey of a night like this  
Ive schemed honey of a night like this  
Ive dreamed Ive schemed honey  
Of a night like this  
Ive dreamed honey of a night like this
