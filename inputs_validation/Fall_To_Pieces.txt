I looked away  
Then I looked back at you  
You tried to say  
Things that you cant undo  
If I had my way  
Id never get over you  
Todays the day  
I pray that we make it through  
Make it through the fall  
Make it through it all  
  
Chorus  
And I dont want to fall to pieces  
I just want to sit and stare at you  
I dont want to talk about it  
And I dont want a conversation  
I just want to cry in front of you  
I dont want to talk about it  
Cause Im in love with you  
  
Youre the only one  
Id be with til the end  
When I come undone  
You bring me back again  
Back under the stars  
Back into your arms  
  
Chorus  
And I dont want to fall to pieces  
I just want to sit and stare at you  
I dont want to talk about it  
And I dont want a conversation  
I just want to cry in front of you  
I dont want to talk about it  
Cause Im in love with you  
  
Want to know who you are  
Want to know where to start  
I want to know what this means  
Want to know how you feel  
Want to know what is real  
I want to know everything everything  
  
Chorus  
And I dont want to fall to pieces  
I just want to sit and stare at you  
I dont want to talk about it  
And I dont want a conversation  
I just want to cry in front of you  
I dont want to talk about it  
  
And I dont want to fall to pieces  
I just want to sit and stare at you  
I dont want to talk about it  
And I dont want a conversation  
I just want to cry in front of you  
I dont want to talk about it  
Cause Im in love with you  
  
Im in love with you  
Cause Im in love with you  
Im in love with you  
Im in love with you
