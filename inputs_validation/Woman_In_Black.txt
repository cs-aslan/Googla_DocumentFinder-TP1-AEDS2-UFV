I knew the moment  
I walked through that door  
I felt so close to a burning sensation  
It got so warm  
As I moved across the floor  
My body aching with anticipation  
I saw a dark silhouette at the table  
I tried to talk but I was unable  
She drew me in right under her spell  
I was hypnotized by the sudden temptation  
Of that woman in black shes a mystery  
Shes everything a woman should be  
Woman in black shes got a hold on me  
Shes in control she wont set me free  
She is a woman  
Shes not a girl anymore  
The kind that stirs up a young mans imagination  
Shes dressed to kill  
And Im so ready to fall  
Into her world full of strange fascination  
I see that dark silhouette at the table  
I cant resist my bodys not able  
She draws me in but she teaches me well  
I never need any explanation  
From that woman in black shes a mystery  
Shes everything a woman should be  
I said woman in black got a hold on me  
Shes in control she wont set me free  
Ooh woman in black  
Its too late now  
I cant turn back  
cause Im a fool for that woman  
Woman in black  
Ooh ooh woman in black  
Ooh that woman in black shes a mystery  
Shes everything a woman should be  
That woman in black shes got a hold on me  
Shes in control she wont set me free  
Shes my mysterious mistress  
But she leaves me so helpless  
My woman in black  
Shes a dark senorita  
My woman in black  
No Sunday school teacher  
My woman in black  
Were keeping it a secret  
We meet in the night  
Were partners in silence  
Strangers in daylight
