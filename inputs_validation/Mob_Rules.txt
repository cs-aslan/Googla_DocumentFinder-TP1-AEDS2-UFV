Close the city and tell the people that somethings coming to call  
Death and darkness are rushing forward to take a bite from the wall oh  
  
Youve nothing to say  
Theyre breaking away  
If you listen to fools  
The Mob Rules  
The Mob Rules  
  
Kill the spirit and youll be blinded the end is always the same  
Play with fire you burn your fingers and lose your hold of the flame oh  
  
Its over its done  
the end is begun  
If you listen to fools  
The Mob Rules  
  
Youve nothing to say  
Oh Theyre breaking away  
If you listen to fools  
  
Break the circle and stop the movement the wheel is thrown to the ground  
Just remember it might start rolling and take you right back around  
  
Youre all fools  
The Mob Rules
