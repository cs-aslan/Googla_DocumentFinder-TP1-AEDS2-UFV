The whole worlds broke and it aint worth fixing  
Its time to start all over make a new beginning  
Theres too much pain too much suffering  
Lets resolve to start all over make a new beginning  
  
Now dont get me wrong I love life and living  
But when you wake up and look around at everything thats going down  
All wrong  
You see we need to change it now this world with too few happy endings  
We can resolve to start all over make a new beginning  
  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
  
The world is broken into fragments and pieces  
That once were joined together in a unified whole  
But now too many stand alone Theres too much separation  
We can resolve to come together in the new beginning  
  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
  
We can break the cycle  We can break the chain  
We can start all over  In the new beginning  
We can learn we can teach  
We can share the myths the dream the prayer  
The notion that we can do better  
Change our lives and paths  
Create a new world  
  
And Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
  
The whole worlds broke and it aint worth fixing  
Its time to start all over make a new beginning  
Theres too much fighting too little understanding  
Its time to stop and start all over  
Make a new beginning  
  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
  
We need to make new symbols  
Make new signs  
Make a new language  
With these well define the world  
  
And start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over  
Start all over
