Ive been waiting for so long  
To come here now and sing this song  
Dont be fooled by what you see  
Dont be fooled by what you hear  
  
This is a song to all my friends  
They take the challenge to their hearts  
Challenging preconceived ideas  
Saying goodbye to long standing fears  
  
Dont crack up bend your brain see both sides  
Throw off your mental chains  
  
I dont want to be hip and cool  
I dont want to play by the rules  
Not under the thumb of the cynical few  
Or laden down by the doom crew
