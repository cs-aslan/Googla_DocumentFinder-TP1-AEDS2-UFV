It was rainin hard in Houston when I ran into her  
I searched for conversation but I was lost for words  
Then a cloud of tear filled memories came crashin down on me  
If it hadnt been for the pourin rain Im sure she would have seen  
  
Tears in the rain  
Hidin the pain  
Maybe shed come back  
If she could see me cry  
She thinks Im so strong  
Oh but shes so wrong  
She just couldnt see these tears in the rain  
  
Now Ill regret that moment cause I didnt let her know  
How much I still loved her I was hopin it would show  
But the raindrops and the teardrops ran together on my face  
Now shell never ever know no one can take her place  
  
Tears in the rain  
Hidin the pain  
Maybe shed come back  
If she could see me cry  
She thinks Im so strong  
Oh but shes so wrong  
She just couldnt see these tears in the rain  
  
She thinks Im so strong  
Oh but shes so wrong  
She just couldnt see these tears in the rain
