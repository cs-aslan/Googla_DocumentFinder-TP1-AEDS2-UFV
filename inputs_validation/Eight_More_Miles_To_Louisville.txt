Ive traveled oer the country wide a seekin fortune fair  
Ive been down the two coast lines Ive traveled everywhere  
From Portland East and Portland West and back along the line  
Im goin now to a place thats best that old home town of mine  
Eight more miles and Louisville will come in to my view  
Eight more miles on this old road and I ll never more be blue  
I knew some day that Id come back I knew it from the start  
Eight more miles to Louisville the home town of my heart  
  
Theres sure to be a girl somewhere that you like best of all  
Mine lives down in Louisville shes long and she is tall  
But shes the kind that you cant find a rambling through the land  
Im on my way this very day to win her heart and hand  
Oh eight more miles and Louisville  
  
Now I can picture in my mind a place well call our home  
A humble little hut for two well never want to roam  
The place thats right for that love site is in those bluegrass hills  
Where gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville  
Eight more miles to Louisville
