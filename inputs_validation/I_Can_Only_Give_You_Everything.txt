I cant give you more than what Ive got  
I cant expect to give what I have not  
III can only give ya lovin till the sun goes down  
And until the leaves of summer turn to shades of brown  
  
I try and I try  
But baby you know that I  
Can only give you everything  
  
I cant argue with you to aunderstand  
Cause after all I am just a man  
A you are on my mind  
When stars appear and shadows fall  
And when every little flower close  
And no birds call  
I try and I try  
But baby you know that I  
Can only give you everything  
  
Ill do anything you want me to do  
Cause I dont want to know theres life without you  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Dont ever go and leave me in this world alone  
IIId be like a little child if I was on my own  
  
I try and I try  
But baby you know that I  
Can only give you everything  
  
Everything baby  
A little bit of this a little bit of that  
And everything  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Whoa ooh ooh  
Whoa ooh ooh  
Yeah yeah yeah
