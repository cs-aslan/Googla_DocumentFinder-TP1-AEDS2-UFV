What did I miss here  
What cant you take anymore  
Expecting a whisper  
I heard the slam of a door  
You say that all we ever do is fight  
Gee I dont know that thats true  
Then I wonder am I right  
Or is that part of our problem  
Maybe Im out of my mind  
Maybe Im blocking out the truth  
But it seems like just a little thing  
Like you dont want to listen  
And I cant shut up  
You dont have to smile at me  
We dont have to talk  
All that I ask is you stop  
And remember it isnt always this way  
You have the problem  
It comes with our private jokes  
When youre in a fury  
Laughter gets stuck in my throat  
Sometimes I wonder why we have so much trouble  
Cheering each other up sometimes  
When one or the other of us is down  
Instead its like when youre in a bad mood  
I look at you and I say maybe shes knows something  
I dont know maybe I should be upset  
You dont have to smile at me  
We dont have to talk  
All that I ask is you stop  
And remember it isnt always this way  
The way that I feel  
When you laugh  
Is like laughing  
The way that I feel  
When you cry  
Is so bad
