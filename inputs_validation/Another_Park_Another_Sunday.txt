Im sittin in my room Im starin out my window  
And I wonder where youve gone  
Thinking back on the happy hours just before the dawn  
Outside the wind is blowin  
It seems to call your name again  
Where have you gone  
City streets and lonely highways  
I travel down  
My car is empty and the radio just seems to bring me down  
Im just tryin to find me  
A pretty smile that I can get into  
Its true Im lost without you  
  
Another lonely park another Sunday  
Why is it life turns out that way  
Just when you think you got a good thing  
It seems to slip away  
  
Its warm outside no clouds are in the sky  
But I need a place to go and hide  
I keep it to myself  
I dont want nobody else  
To see me cryin all those tears in my eyes  
  
Another park another Sunday  
Why is it life turns out that way  
Just when you think you got a good thing  
It seems to slip away  
Another park another Sunday  
Its dark and empty thanks to you  
I got to get myself together  
But its hard to do
