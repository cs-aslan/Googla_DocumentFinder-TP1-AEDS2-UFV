Night falls with gravity  
The earth turns from sanity  
Taking my only friend I know  
He lives a lie his name is Hope  
  
Im never what I like  
Im doublesided  
And I just cant hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
Cause Im twisted up Im twisted up inside  
  
The horrors of the night melt away  
Under the warm glow of survival of the day  
Then we move on  
My shadow grows taller along with my fears  
And my friends shrink smaller as night grows near  
  
When the sun is coming window soothes  
And the silver lining rides the hills  
I will be saved for one whole day  
Until the sun make the hills its grave  
  
Im never what I like  
Im doublesided  
And I just cant hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
Cause Im twisted up Im twisted up inside  
  
Im never what I like  
Im doublesided  
And I just cant hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
Cause Im twisted up Im twisted up inside my mind  
  
Repeat x4  
Im semiautomatic  
My prayers schizophrenic  
But Ill live on yeah Ill live on yeah Ill live on  
  
By the time the night wears off the dust is down  
And shadows burn  
I will rise and stand my ground  
Waiting for the nights return  
  
Im never what I like  
Im doublesided  
And I just cant hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
Cause Im twisted up Im twisted up inside  
  
Im never what I like  
Im doublesided  
And I just cant hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
Cause Im twisted up Im twisted up inside my mind
