When I think about love  
Honey you always  
Come across my mind  
Is it the way that you hold me  
Or the way that  
You told me love is blind  
Well its a crime of the heart  
These things Im  
Thinking to myself  
But I cant forget you babe  
Just cant seem to  
Think of nothing else  
  
Got a woman at home  
A family to feed  
Three fine children  
They think the Lord of me  
Now Im standing  
At the crossroads  
Looking for a sign of true love  
  
Well I heard that song  
Says girls just wanna have fun  
Well I guess I  
Bought my ticket honey  
Cause it feels as if  
The ride has just begun  
Well theres two kinds of love  
One is wrong and one is right  
But I cant forget you baby  
Cant forget  
The way you hold me tight  
  
I got a woman at home  
A family to feed  
Three fine children  
They think the Lord of me  
Well Im standing  
At the crossroads  
Looking for a sign of true love  
  
When I think about women  
Honey you always  
Come across my mind  
Is it the way that you told me  
The way you told me love is blind  
Well its a crime of the heart  
These things Im  
Thinking to myself now  
Cant forget you babe  
Cant forget  
The way you make me feel  
  
I got a woman at home  
A family to feed  
Three fine children  
At the crossroads  
Looking for a sign of true love
