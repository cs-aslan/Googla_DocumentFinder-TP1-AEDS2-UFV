I know that Ive been wrong  
And I have no one to hang it on  
So I take you by the hand  
And I ask you please to understand  
I just want to see you smile  
But all I ever do is make you cry  
Hah hah hah hah  
  
Guess Im tough to be around  
Babe youre tough to be away from  
You know every place Ive been  
Every place I wish Id never seen  
Now I just want to see you smile  
But all I ever do is make you cry  
Hah hah hah hah  
  
You know what youre doing  
Its a very special thing to ruin now  
You know what youre doing  
But you dont know why  
Oh oh  
  
Now I know what youve been thinking all along  
Youre saying oh oh no mister wrong  
Oh oh oh mister wrong  
Oh oh oh
