Tears on the pillow  
Is all you leave behind  
And the only thing you know this time  
Is its time to let go  
So put the key under the mat  
And dont you look back just  
  
Rock on baby rock on  
You aint got nothing to lose that aint already gone  
Cause trapped in these blues aint where you belong  
So baby rock on  
  
Let the songs and the static  
Fight for the dial  
Inside an addicts last passin mile  
Well I know it aint easy but the wheels in your hand  
And who knows where youll land so just  
  
Rock on baby rock on  
You aint got nothing to lose that aint already gone  
And may the good Lord God bless you and help you along  
Now baby rock on  
  
And baby dont stop just  
  
Rock on baby rock on  
You aint got nothing to lose that aint already gone  
I know your hearts black and blue but life dont last long  
So baby rock on  
  
Baby rock on
