Just shoot for the stars if it feels right  
And aim for my heart if you feel like it  
Take me away and make it okay  
I swear Ill behave  
  
You wanted control so we waited  
I put on a show now were naked  
You say Im a kid my ego is big  
I dont give a shit and it goes like this  
  
Take me by the tongue and Ill know you  
Kiss me til youre drunk and Ill show you all the moves like Jagger  
Ive got the moves like Jagger  
Ive got the moves like Jagger  
  
I dont need to try to control you  
Look into my eyes and Ill own you with them moves like Jagger  
Ive got the moves like Jagger  
Ive got the moves like Jagger  
  
Baby its hard when you feel like  
Youre broken and scarred  
Nothing feels right but when youre with me  
I make you believe that Ive got the key  
  
Oh so get in the car we can ride it  
Wherever you want get inside it  
And you want to steer but Im shifting gear  
Ill take it from here oh yeah yeah and it goes like this  
  
Take me by the tongue and Ill know you  
Kiss me til youre drunk and Ill show you all the moves like Jagger  
Ive got the moves like Jagger  
Ive got the moves like Jagger  
  
I dont need to try to control you  
Look into my eyes and Ill own you with them moves like Jagger  
Ive got the moves like Jagger  
Ive got the moves like Jagger  
  
You want to know how to make me smile  
Take control own me just for the night  
But if I share my secret youre gonna have to keep it  
Nobody else can see this  
  
So watch and learn I wont show you twice  
Head to toe ooh baby rub me right  
But if I share my secret youre gonna have to keep it  
Nobody else can see this  
  
And it goes like this  
  
Take me by the tongue and Ill know you  
Kiss me til youre drunk and Ill show you all the moves like Jagger  
Ive got the moves like Jagger  
Ive got the moves like Jagger  
  
I dont need to try to control you  
Look into my eyes and Ill own you with them moves like Jagger  
Ive got the moves like Jagger  
Ive got the moves like Jagger
