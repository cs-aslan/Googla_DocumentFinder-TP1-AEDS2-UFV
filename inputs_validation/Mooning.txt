I spend my days just mooning so sad and blue so sad and blue  
I spend my nights just mooning all over you all over who  
  
Oh Im so full of love as any fool can see  
Cause ages up above have hung the moon on me  
  
Why must you go why must I go on mooning so all alone so all alone  
There would be no there would be no more mooning if you would call me  
Up on the phone  
I guess Ill keep on striking poses till my cheeks have lost their roses  
Mooning over you  
  
Ill stand behind youll stand behind you mooning forever more For
evermore  
Someday youll find someday well find me mooning at your front door  
At my front door  
  
Oh everyday at school I watch ya always will until I gotcha  
Mooning too theres a moon up tonight
