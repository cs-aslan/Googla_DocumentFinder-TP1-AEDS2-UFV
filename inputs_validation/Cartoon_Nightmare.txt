Welcome to Forgotten Freshness Volume 3  
  
Draw something make sure you dont forget your red pen  
cause we gonna need it when you draw the blood in  
pspspspsychopathic records baby all offensive powers  
our planes highjacked head for record label towers  
drink of choice Faygo rocknrye with hennesey  
i like marijuana that is sent from tennessee  
Im sick of rock guitars always lacin our shit  
we bout to get wicked for the sixth the sixth the sixth the sixth  
I like cuttin heads off blood trail through the house  
down to the basement where I hollow them out  
  dontt you reach for the phone  
Im gonna cut you up and voodoo drums with your bones  
  
CHROUS  
Cartoon Nightmares  
Science fiction brain incision  
Cartoon Nightmares  
Satellites and televisions  
Wont you draw me  
Liquid lines of technicolor color  
I will hurry right there  
walk like an Egyptian  
  
Im like Richard Remeriz the stalker  
and I didnt even know it  
Of course I mean without the ACDC and the money  
Local Rappers from my city they wanna talk smack  
But they be so wack they aint worth dissing back  
Worth Yo  Nope  
Break yo head pull out ya brain  
pass it down the line we call it the train  
Look at that girl 2x  
Booty in the pants 2x  
Shakin that thing 2x  
Like WHUT WHUT WHUT WHUT  
If you were Andre The Giant that shit would be slick  
You could finger fuck a girl and she would think its your dick  
Blood ozes down the screen  
Off the page and magazine  
Off the table to the floor  
Cross the tile out tha door  
  
CHORUS  
  
ICP headin back to St Louis  
Nelly scoot over me and shaggy bout to do this  
Theres an arm in my trunk Whaa  
An arm in my trunk Where  
Underneath the tire theres an arm in my trunk  
Ive seem to recognize this plaaaace  
up in county jail

Me and Jumpsteady killa hookers at night  
check my bumper hell if  and blood in the light  
Me and Billy Bill we put a arm in shaggys trunk  
He woulda never noticed but it stunk soo bad  
Theres an arm in my trunk  HEY YOU  
Gimme a subway bun Yeaaa  
knuckel deep in mayo like yumm  
  
CHORUS  
Cartoon Nightmares Walk Like An Egyptian
