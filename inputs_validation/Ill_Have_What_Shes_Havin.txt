No I dont want no Jack n Coke  
Please sit me where there aint no smoke  
Dont want nothin cloudin up my eyes  
But you see that girl all over there  
Actin like shes on thin air  
There got to be a secret to her smile  
Well I think that I just found him  
And hes twirlin her around  
Id like to place my order  
You might want to write this down  
  
Ill have what shes havin  
I want what shes got  
Someone sweet as he can be  
And by the way that hot  
A tall order I suppose  
But if you could find me one of those  
Ill have what shes havin  
  
Well I like the way he looks at her  
Its plain to see he knows the words  
That makes her shine from 40 feet away  
If theres any justice in this world  
Hes got a twin who wants a girl  
Who looks like me excuse me while I pray  
So if you could slip my number  
In that pocket on his hip  
It would be appreciated  
And reflected in your tip  
  
Ill have what shes havin  
I want what shes got  
Someone sweet as he can be  
And by the way that hot  
A tall order I suppose  
But if you can find me one of those  
Ill have what shes havin  
  
A tall order I suppose  
But if you can find me one of those  
Ill have what shes havin  
  
Well I know its wrong to think of it  
But why should she have all of it  
Ill have what shes havin  
  
Oh Ill have what shes havin
