The family life it was divine  
She sat alone with tired eyes  
patiently listening to the sighs  
  
I found out  
I found out  
She never has the time  
I found out  
to make his demons  
  
They snatched her willingly she left  
They wondered why shed accepted that  
She knew that shed be saved but how  
She knew that future kid was on the prowl  
  
I found out  
I found out  
We could both run wild  
I found out  
me and futures child  
  
I found out  
I found out  
We could both run wild  
I found out  
Me and futures child  
I found out  
Nevers far too long  
for me to sing this song
