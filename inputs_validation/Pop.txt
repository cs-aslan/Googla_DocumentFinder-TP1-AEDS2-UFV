Sick and tired of hearing all these people talk about  
Whats the deal with this pop life and when is it gonna fade out  
The thing you got to realize what we doing is not a trend  
We got the gift of melody we gonna bring it til the end  
  
It doesnt matter  
bout the car I drive or what I wear around my neck  
All that matters  
Is that you recognize that its just about respect  
It doesnt matter  
About the clothes I wear and where I go and why  
All that matters  
Is that you get hyped cause well do it to you every time  
come on now  
  
Chorus  
Do you ever wonder why this music gets you high  
It takes you on a ride feel it when your body starts to rock  
your body starts to rock  
Baby you cant stop  
you cant stop  
And the musics all you got come on now  
This must be pop  
  
Dirty pop that you cant stop  
I know you like this dirty pop  
This must be pop  
  
Now why you want to try to classify the type of thing we do  
Cause were just fine doin what we like can we say the same for you  
Tired of feelin all around me animosity  
Just worry about trust cause Ima get mine people cant you see  
  
It doesnt matter  
bout the car I drive or the ice around my neck  
All that matters  
Is that you recognize that its just about respect oh  
It doesnt matter  
About the clothes I wear or where I go and why  
All that matters  
Is that you get hyped cause well give it to you every time  
come on  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh  
Man Im tired of singing  
Dirty dirty dirty pop  
Dirty pop  
Do you ever wonder echo  
NSync  
oh Do you ever wonder why  
every wonder why  
This music gets you high  
music gets you high  
It takes you on a ride feel it when your body starts to rock  
when your body starts to rock  
Baby you cant stop  
baby dont stop  
And the musics all you got come on now  
This must be  
  
Chorus
