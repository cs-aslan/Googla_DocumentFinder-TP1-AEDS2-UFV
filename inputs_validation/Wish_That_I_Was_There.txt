The sun has fallen  
Another day gone without you  
My heart keeps calling  
I seem to forget my lonely days  
Its more than a feeling  
Its something that cant be explained  
  
Chorus  
I wish that I was there1 I wish that I was there  
When youre not here I wish that I was there  
I wish that I was there I wish that I was there  
When youre not here I wish that I was there  
  
You were falling  
Now Im coming round again  
I was calling  
Cause without you its the end  
I just want to see you a little more  
I just want to be with you some more  
  
Chorus  
  
And you make me feel  
Wont you take me when youre not here  
Its been raining here  
And I just want you to be near  
I just want to see you a little more  
I just want to dream of you some more  
I just want to see you a little more  
I just want to be with you some more  
  
Chorus x2
