Now there was a time when they used to say  
That behind every great man there had to be a great woman  
But in these times of change you know that its no longer true  
  
So were comin out of the kitchen  
  
Cause theres something we forgot to say to you  
We say  
  
Sisters are doin it for themselves  
  
Standin on their own two feet an ringin on their own bells  
Sisters are doin it for themselves  
  
Now this is a song to celebrate  
The conscious liberation of the female state  
Mothers  
Daughters and their daughters  
Too  
  
Woman to woman  
Were singing with you  
The inferior sex has got a new exterior  
  
We got doctors  
Lawyers  
Politicians  
Too  
Everybody  
Take a look around  
Can you see  
Can you see  
  
Can you see theres a woman right next to you  
We say Sisters are doin it for themselves  
  
Now we aint makin stories and we aint layin plans  
  
Cause a man still loves a woman and a woman still loves a man  
Just the same though   
  
Sisters are doin it for themselves  
Now there was a time when they used to say  
Sisters are doin it for themselves  
  
Sisters are doin it for themselves
