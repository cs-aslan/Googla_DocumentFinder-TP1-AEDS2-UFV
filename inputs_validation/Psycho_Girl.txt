honest john plain  
If Id known then what I know now  
Id do it all again cause Im crazy and how  
About my mixedup messedup pretty little psycho girl  
I shouldve given her a swift body swerve

A freakedout spacedout crazy little psycho girl  
Psycho girl  look what youre doing  
How come you have to be this way  
Psycho girl  youll be my ruin  
With the softy things you do  the silly things you say  
Oh oh psycho girl  
Shes my cross to bear my ball and chain  
A monkey on my back she gets into my brain  
But I love my washed out freaked out psycho girl  
Yeah if Id known then what I know now

Psycho  psycho girl
