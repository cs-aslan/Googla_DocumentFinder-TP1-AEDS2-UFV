Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
Dont you think its a pretty good plan  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
Take me to the islands put my feet in the sand  
Rockin to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean  
Singin silent night with the palm trees a blowing  
  
Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
Dont you think its a pretty good plan  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
Well if youre thinkin bout gettin me a present this year  
Let me put a bug in your cute little ear  
How bout two tickets to a tropical shore  
Where we dont have to wear these winter clothes anymore  
Instead of turkey well have mahi mahi grillin  
And pina coladas in the blender chillin  
  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
Take me to the islands put my feet in the sand  
Rockin to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean  
Singin silent night with the palm trees blowing  
  
Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
Dont you think its a pretty good plan  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
Well everybodys praying for a Christmas of white  
Come to think about it thatll be alright  
As long as its sand and not snow on the ground  
And everyday our skin gets a little more brown  
  
Well string some lights in a coconut tree  
I rub some oil on you and you can rub some on me  
  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
I can see us baby on the beach hand in hand  
Rocking to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean  
Baby wont you say you and me will be goin  
  
Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
I can almost feel my toes in the sand  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
Dont worry baby well celebrate plenty  
Ill buy you some shades and a brand new bikini  
We wont have to worry bout the holiday rush  
Itll be you and me falling deeper in love  
  
Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
Dont you think its a pretty good plan  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
