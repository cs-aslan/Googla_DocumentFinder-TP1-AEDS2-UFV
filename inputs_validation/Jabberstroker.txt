Cling to the sides brainboy  
we lost our number selves in jail  
leaving a groovy wit matter on a sailing sky  
alive and jabberstroking  
sinking around you now  
around you now  
around you now  
sinking around you now  
around you now  
around you now  
  
Wings are wise lameboy  
louder people build a fighting bore  
dig the fast track fucker  
ancenstral public dig the fast track  
  
Hes the one with the talkin rockbull  
clings to edge of the pool  
Greg Case  
Examine number one  
at cause and at manners  
bounded to protect a fighting bully  
go around you now  
around you now  
around you now  
sinking full around you now  
around you now  
around you now  
  
On a silent sky  
dig the fast track  
alive and jabberstrokin  
dig the fast track fucker  
think of a wide lane boy  
dig the fast track  
promise you will go and fight  
dig the fast track fucker  
access to the priveleges  
dig the fast track fucker  
dig the fast track fucker  
dig the fast track for her  
dig the fast trip  
dig the fast track
