Ashes to ashes  
Thats how it ends  
You go from heartache to heartache  
As you make amends  
Just bigger and bigger  
But two steps back  
You want something from nothing  
And youre so exact  
  
You think youre a rich man  
Now you misbehave  
Youre not a free man running  
Just a comfortable slave  
  
So selfish  
You got more than you can use  
But you still dont see  
Youre so selfish  
And youre running out of room  
  
Deeper and deeper  
As you forge ahead  
Higher and higher  
But youve been mislead  
Harder and harder  
You grind the stone  
Faster faster faster  
Till youre skin and bones  
  
Too much ambition  
Without relief  
That aint heaven  
But its what you teach  
  
So selfish  
You got more than you can use  
But you still dont see  
Youre so selfish  
And youre running out of room  
  
The world was made in seven days  
Your heads are bowed to Gods in praise  
Civilized man can only be saved  
When courage and wisdom are finally raised  
  
Whos got the answer  
Give me the cure  
Dont rush to judgment  
Until youre sure  
  
So selfish  
You got more than you can use  
But you still dont see  
Youre so selfish  
And youre running out of room
