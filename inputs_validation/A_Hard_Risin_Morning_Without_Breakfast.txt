Today when I awoke  
The morning blues hung over me  
So I looked it straight in the eye  
I jumped into the shower  
For bout an hour  
Aw it was fine  
Yeah It helps me all the time  
Its soothin to my mind  
Just to see those blues  
Go slippin down the drain  
Now I usually have my breakfast  
Which consists of tasty spam  
Yeah I could eat it all day long  
But I only love one brand  
And I cant find it way out here  
So I have to take a pass  
And settle for some hash  
When I drive and youre not here  
Oh sweet sweet spam
