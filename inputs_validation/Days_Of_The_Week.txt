Monday back from the dead  
Im letting it go back for another one  
  
Tuesday shoot me in the head  
Im takin it back  takin it back  
Ill take it back  
  
Wednesday shes lookin for a friend  
Shell get what she wants  
Cant seem to get enough  
  
Thursday its more than I can stand  
Im holdin her down holdin her down  
Shes down again  
  
I gotta find a way to find her  
Where could she be  
Four days of the week  
She thinks Im the enemy  
  
One day left me for dead  
Woke up on the floor time for another one  
Two days shes leavin me again  
Cant take it no more  
Out through the open door  
Three days shes found herself a friend  
She got what she wants  
Still never get enough  
Four days shes back with me again  
Shes pullin me down pullin me down  
Im down again  
  
Mondays gone  
Tuesdays fadin  
Wednesdays gone  
Thursdays all but wasted now
