I stayed awake for hours again last night  
Searchin for a reasoning to keep up the fight  
Ive made choices Ill regret  
Ive got problems I dont get  
I didnt wanna carry the heavier load  
You cant always take the middle road  
There comes a time when you make up your mind  
And the point gets left behind  
  
Chorus  
Lets wait one more day for the conversation  
One more day to make it right  
Lets get away from the confrontation  
One more day just buying time  
  
For years and years you can drift along  
And write another verse to an endless song  
Wait one more day til the time is right  
Hopin that you both see the light  
You wont see the light  
  
Chorus  
  
Im not afraid to be alone  
Im not afraid to be alone  
  
I stayed awake for hours again last night  
Searchin for a reasoning to keep up the fight  
Ive made choices I dont regret  
Ive got problems and problems and problems  
  
Chorus  
Just buying time Repeat x2
