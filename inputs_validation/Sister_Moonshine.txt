Ooo when I was a small boy  
Well I could see the magic in a day  
But now Im just a poor boy  
Well maybe its the price you have to pay  
If you lock your dreams away  
If noone wants to listen  
  
Whats the story  
I wish Id been a minstrel  
Just think of all the maidens I could call  
OhI wish Id been a gypsy  
Then maybe I could read the crystal ball  
Cause surrounded by these walls  
Just makes me feel uneasy  
  
I said hey Sister Moonshine  
Wont you send me a little sun  
I said hey Sister Moonshine  
Whos a stranger to everyone  
  
So MAKE US ALL LAUGH  
Make us all cry  
MAKE US ALL GIVE   
Make us all try  
Give us a secret show us the light  
Well strike up the music light up the sky  
  
MmmIf I was a lion  
Well I could be the king off all the plains  
MmmIf is was an eagle  
Well maybe I could fly above the rains  
Oh fly above the pain  
But I know Im only foolin  
  
I said hey Sister Moonshine  
Wont you send me a little sun  
I said hey Sister Moonshine  
Whos a stranger to everyone  
  
So MAKE US ALL LAUGH  
Make us all cry  
MAKE US ALL GIVE   
Make us all cry  
I said hey Sister Moonshine  
I said hey Sister Moonshine  
I said hey said hey  
I said hey I said hey Sister Moonshine
