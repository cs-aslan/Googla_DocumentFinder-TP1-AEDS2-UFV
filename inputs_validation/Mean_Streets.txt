Raised up with two kinds of people  
The good ones and the bad  
I was taught from early on  
The only choice I had  
Now I see its clear to me  
What was in the plan  
Had to walk the walk and talk the talk  
And try to be a man  
I swear the wind took me away  
But now Im here again today yeah  
  
Chorus  
Im back on the mean streets back on the mean streets  
Oh its the only thing I know  
Never change me never change me  
It was born in my soul  
And it dont take much to make me mad  
Push me a little and I bring back  
Ive a mean streak oh  
Yeah Im back on the mean streets  
  
Somebody stole my money I heard a brother say  
Used to wed fight it out that was yesterday  
Just cause youre packin son dont make you a man  
If you shoot to kill whats the thrill  
Why dont you understand  
Each time I walk outside my door  
We need a change and thats for sure  
  
Chorus  
  
Do you ever think about where youre goin  
Have you ever thought about where you been  
Will you ever pass this way again  
Theres a fear and you know it  
But inside you cant show it  
No where for you to run and hide  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah Im back on the mean streets baby  
Im back on the mean streets  
Im back on the mean streets  
Mean streets  
It dont take much to take me back
