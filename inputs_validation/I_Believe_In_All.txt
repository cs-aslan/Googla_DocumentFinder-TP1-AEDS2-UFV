I can take em all  
So I leave you with this thought  
There is a fire in the sky  
I dont need no alibi  
See I believe in all  
  
Do you hear me when I say  
That I got to walk this way  
There is a fire in the sky  
I dont need no alibi  
See I believe in all  
  
Chorus  
And III will catch you when you fall  
That is what Im gonna do  
And IIII will catch you if you call  
That is what Im gonna do  
  
I can see for miles  
And I can see you when your cries  
There is a fire in the sky  
I dont need no alibi  
See I believe in all  
  
Do you hear me when I say  
That I gotta walk this way  
There is a fire in the sky  
I dont need no alibi  
See I believe in all  
  
And III will catch you when you fall  
That is what Im gonna do  
And IIII will catch you if you call  
That is what Im gonna do
