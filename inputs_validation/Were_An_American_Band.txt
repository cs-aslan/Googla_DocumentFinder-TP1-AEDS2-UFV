Out on the road for forty days  
Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze  
Sweet sweet Connie was doin her act  
She had the whole show and thats a natural fact  
  
Up all night with Freddie King  
I got to tell you pokers his thing  
Booze and ladies keep me right  
As long as we can make it to the show tonight  
  
Were an American Band  
Were an American Band  
Were comin to your town  
Well help you party it down  
Were an American band  
  
Four young chiquitas in Omaha  
Waitin for the band to return from the show  
A feelin good feelin right and its Saturday night  
The hotel detective he was outta sight  
  
Now these fine ladies they had a plan  
They was out to meet the boys in the band  
They said Come on dudes lets get it on  
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down  
  
Were an American Band  
Were an American Band  
Were comin to your town  
Well help you party it down  
Were an American band  
  
Were an American band  
Were an American band  
Were comin to your town  
Well help you party it down  
Were an American band

Well help you party it down
