Sticks and stones will break my bones  
But I always will be true  
And when your mama is dead and gone  
Ill sing this lullaby just for you  
What becomes for the little boys  
Who never comb their hair  
Theyre lined up all around the block  
On The Nickel over there  
  
So you better bring a bucket  
There is a hole in the pail  
If you dont get my letter  
Then youll know that Im in jail  
What becomes for the little boys  
Who never say their prayers  
Theyre sleepin like a baby  
On The Nickel over there  
  
If you chew tobacco and wish upon a star  
Youll find out where the scarecrows sit  
Just like punchlines between the cars  
I know a place where a royal flush  
Can never beat a pair  
And even Thomas Jefferson  
Is On The Nickel over there  
  
So ring around the rosie youre sleepin in the rain  
And youre always late for supper  
And man you let me down let me down again  
I thought I heard a mockingbird Roosevelt knows where  
You can skip the light with grady tuck  
On the Nickel over there  
  
So what become for the little boys  
Who run away from home  
The world just keeps gettin bigger  
Once you get out on your own  
So heres to all the little boys  
The sandman takes you where  
Youll be sleepin with a pillowman  
On the Nickel over there  
  
So lets climb up through that button hole  
And fall right up the stairs  
Ill show you where the short dogs grow  
On the Nickel over there
