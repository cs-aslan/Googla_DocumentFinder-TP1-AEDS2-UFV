Theres a picture on my kitchen wall  
Looks like Jesus and his friends involved  
Theres a party getting started in the yard  
Theres a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive  
Was I too young to see this with my eyes  
  
By the pool last night apparently  
The chemicals werent mixed properly  
You hit your head and then forgot your name  
And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain  
And now your altitude and memorys a shame  
  
Chorus  
What about taking this empty cup and filling it up  
With a little bit more of innocence  
I havent had enough its probably because when youre young  
Its OK to be easily ignored  
I like to believe it was all about love for a child  
  
And when the house was left in shambles  
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass  
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around  
Well Im far too old to care about that now  
  
Chorus  
  
Its kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce  
Ive been enjoying both my Christmases and my birthday cakes  
And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age  
and they never check to see my grades  
What a fool Id be to start complaining now  
  
Chorus  
  
It was all about love
