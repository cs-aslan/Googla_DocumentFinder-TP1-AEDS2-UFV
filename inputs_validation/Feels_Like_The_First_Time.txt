I would climb any mountain sail across the stormy sea  
If thats what it takes me baby to show how much you mean to me  
And I guess that its just the woman in you that brings out the man in me  
I know I cant help myself youre all in the world to me  
  
Chorus  
It feels like the first time feels like the very first time  
It feels like the first time it feels like the very first time  
  
I have waited a lifetime spent my time so foolishly  
But now that I found you together well make history  
And I know that it must be the woman in you that brings out the man in me  
I know I cant help myself youre all my eyes can see  
  
And it feels like the first time like it never did before  
Feels like the first time like weve opened up the door  
Feels like the first time like it never will again never again  
  
Chorus  
  
Open up the door wont you open up the door  
  
Chorus
