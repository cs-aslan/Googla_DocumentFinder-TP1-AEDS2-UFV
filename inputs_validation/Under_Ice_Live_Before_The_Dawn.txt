Verse 1 All

Everywhere so white  
  
Verse 2 Kate Bush Chorus  
The river has frozen over  
Not a soul on the ice  
Only me  
Skating fast  
  
Verse 3 Chorus  
Im speeding past trees  
Leaving little lines in the ice  
Cutting out  
Little lines  
In the ice  
  
Verse 4 Chorus  
Splitting splitting sound  
Silver heels  
Spitting spitting snow  
  
Verse 5 Kate Bush Chorus  
Theres something moving under  
Under the ice  
Moving under ice  
Through water  
Trying to Its me get out of the cold water  
Its me  
Something Its me  
Someone  help them

Oh  
No
