Its like Im fallen out of bed  
From a long weary dream  
The sweetest flowers and fruits are hanging from trees  
Falling off the giant bird thats been carrying me  
Its like Ive fallen out of bed  
From a long and vivid dream  
Just exactly as I remember  
Every word  
Every gesture  
  
And my heart in my mouth  
Like Im fallen out of bed  
From a long and vivid dream  
Finally Im free of all the weight Ive been carrying  
  
And as that woman blows her cover  
In the eye of the beholder  
Im a fish now out of water  
Falling off a giant bird thats been carrying me  
  
I fell open  
I laid under  
At the tip out  
I was just your number  
I want stay on it  
And get back under  
  
And if you think this is over  
Then youre wrong  
If you think this is over  
Then youre wrong  
If you think this is over  
Then youre wrong  
  
Wake me up wake me up  
If you think this is over  
Then youre wrong  
Wake me up wake me up  
Like Im fallen out of bed  
From a long and vivid dream  
Finally Im free of all the weight Ive been carrying  
  
When at last youll give in  
When at last youll give in  
  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Wake me up
