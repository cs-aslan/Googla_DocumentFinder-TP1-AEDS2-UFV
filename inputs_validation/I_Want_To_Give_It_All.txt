Here I am again  
Ive come to see you smile  
I know you understand  
I have to say again  
Its only for awhile  
  
And still youre always here  
Just waiting for my call  
I wish I knew a Way  
To give more than I do  
I want to give it all  
  
CHORUS  
It doesnt happen every day  
But it happened to me once before  
Those early years I threw away  
Now I only have to hear your voice  
To make me feel so sure  
That your love is why  
I want to give it all  
  
Dont the minutes fly  
And hours just seem so few  
With days apart so long  
Its hard to spend my time  
When Im so far from you  
  
And still youre always there  
Just waiting for my call  
I wish I knew a way  
To give more than I do  
I want to give it all
