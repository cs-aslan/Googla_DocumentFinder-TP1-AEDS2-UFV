Being round you is driving me crazy  
Watching you run is making me lazy  
Youre trying to buy a place in my head  
Telling me lines Ive already read  
Speaking my name to try to confuse me  
Say it again youre starting to lose me  
  
Thats alright Im okay  
It happens every single day  
Its all the same  
But Im not blind  
  
Its all about you  
Not me  
Its all about the things that youre expecting me to be  
Theres not enough time  
To live  
And all that youre expecting me to give  
  
Its all about you  
Not  
Me  
Its all about you  
Not  
Me  
  
Youre building my prison brick by brick  
Eating your words is making me sick  
You get what you want cause nothing is sacred  
Youre reading my mind and leaving me naked  
You say I gotta give before I receive it  
One of these days Ill believe it  
  
Its all about you  
Not me  
Its all about the things that youre expecting me to be  
Theres not enough time  
To live  
And all that youre expecting me to give  
  
Its all about you  
Not  
Me  
Its all about you  
Not  
Me  
  
  
Thats alright Im okay  
It happens every single day  
Its all the same  
But Im not blind  
  
Its all about you  
Not me  
Its all about the things that youre expecting me to be  
Theres not enough time  
To live  
And all that youre expecting me to give  
  
Its all about you  
Not  
Me  
Its all about you  
Not  
Me  
Its all about you  
Not  
Me
