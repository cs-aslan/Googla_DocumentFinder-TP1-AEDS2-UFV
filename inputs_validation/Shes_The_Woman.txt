A little low on cash  
But Im high on luck  
I wanna be your knight  
In shining pickup truck  
With a Chevy for my summer home  
Lets get the party started  
Its looking like the city towed  
My other apartment  
  
She got a doorbell sign that said  
Bring it or dont ring it  
Shes the woman  
Shes the woman  
Shes the woman  
Shes the woman  
  
Fate is my pimp  
But she was cool  
Said if youre doin business with me honey  
What does that make you  
Some Casablanca gin joint  
Youre a nervous wreck  
Your IQ plummets fourteen points  
Her thunder thong around your neck  
  
The song aint dirty  
Its really just the way we sing it sing it  
Shes the woman sing it  
Shes the woman  
Shes the woman  
Shes the woman  
  
She wanted something to regret  
Tomorrow morning  
This suburban garageatrois  
Was worth exploring  
Yeah dreams come true  
But it remains to be seen  
By the time mine usually do  
Its no longer me  
  
She got a doorbell sign  
You better bring it or dont ring it  
Shes the woman  
Shes the woman  
Shes the woman
