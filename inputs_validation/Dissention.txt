Found out youre really something  
They talk about you  
Then turn your confidence against you  
Now into nothing  
  
Grinning from the daze  
Petrified and blazed  
Feels good to know they care  
Special friends simply two faced  
  
You couldnt let go  
Your talking got you here  
Tearing up everyone  
Respect you dont know  
  
They say Im jaded  
Cause they know its true  
With all those silly people  
On the wonder wheel  
  
Glizen from the daze  
Purified and crazed  
Feels good to hear them share  
Hateful friends simply two faced  
  
You couldnt let go  
Your talking got you here  
Tearing up everyone  
Respect you dont know  
  
Dont waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Dont waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Dont waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Dont waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Dont waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Dont waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Dont waste your fucking time  
Let live  
Dont waste your fucking time  
Dont waste your fucking time  
Dont waste your fucking time  
Dont waste your fucking time  
Dont waste your fucking time  
Dont waste your fucking time  
Dont waste your fucking time  
Dont waste
