A psycho drive twisted in my head  
Silence broken  
but theres nothing said  
I got a nightmare from a fantasy  
Will the voices ever set me free  
I can hear em  
I can hear em  
Someone wake me when its over  
I can see em  
I can see em  
I can see em  
Over and over again  
I saw it happening like dejavu  
They tried to tell me  
But they couldnt get through  
In my head I hear the voices scream  
I need someone to tell me what it means  
I can hear em  
I can hear em  
Someone wake me when its over  
I can see em  
I can see em  
I can see em  
Over and over again  
Whoa  
Who turned off the lights  
Whoa  
A shadow in the night  
Whoa  
It wasnt meant to be  
I cant take this alone  
Dont leave me on my own tonight  
Oh no I cant take it alone  
Dont leave me on my own tonight  
Shattered dreams lay next to broken glass  
I wonder if tonight will be my last  
I need an angel who will rescue me  
To save me from my mental symphony  
I can hear em  
I can hear em  
Someone wake me when its over  
I can see em  
I can see em  
I can see em  
Over and over again  
Whoa  
Who turned off the lights  
Whoa  
A shadow in the night  
Whoa  
It wasnt meant to be  
I cant take this alone  
Dont leave me on my own tonight  
Oh no I cant take it alone  
Dont leave me on my own tonight
