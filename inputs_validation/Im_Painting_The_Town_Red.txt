A smile on my face  
A song on my lips  
Pretending is all I do  
Im painting the town red  
To hide a heart thats blue  
  
Im gay with the crowd  
I play with the crowd  
But oh if they only knew  
Im painting the town red  
To hide a heart thats blue  
Must I go on carrin on  
  
My merry song is just pretend  
Loving you so wanting you so  
Where will it end how will it end  
  
A smile on my face  
A song on my lips  
But never forgetting you  
Im painting the town red  
To hide a heart thats blue
