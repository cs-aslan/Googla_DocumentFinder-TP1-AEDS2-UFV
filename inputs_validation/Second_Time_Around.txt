Oh oh oh yeah  
Babe  
  
Last time I thought we had this talk  
Boy you were getting ready to leave  
I thought that baby you were done  
Cause for a while you could barely look at me  
  
This time I thought that wed be fine  
That Id forget the things that you said  
I tried crossing out your words  
  
But baby you can not forget the past  
Oh oh oh oh babe  
Can not forget the past  
Oh oh oh oh Still baby Babe  
  
Im so unpredictable  
You dont know what to think  
So unemotional  
Wonder if Im even still in love  
You see  
I dont know what to tell you now  
Its always harder the second time around  
  
Im so unpredictable  
Just like you used to be  
So unemotional  
Boy I cant forget the way you were with me  
I dont know what to tell you now  
Its always harder  
The second time around  
  
The second time around  
  
We tried going back to Joes  
That always was our favourite place  
Long rides baby by the coast  
Do you remember where we stayed  
  
Last time we where hanging out  
You were acting kind of strange  
Now its the second time around  
Im sorry now its me that feels this way  
Oh oh oh oh babe  
My heart just speaks to me  
Its me that feels this way  
Oh oh oh babe  
  
I now you are the one that is hurting  
  
Im so unpredictable  
You dont know what to think  
So unemotional  
Wonder if Im even still in love  
You see  
I dont know what to tell you now  
Its always harder the second time around  
  
Im so unpredictable  
Just like you used to be  
So unemotional  
Boy I cant forget the way you were with me  
I dont know what to tell you now  
Its always harder  
The second time around  
  
Im not sure the best way to say this  
But I cant pretend to love you no more babe  
This ferris wheels got me crazy  
Maybe the second time around is not meant for us babe  
Not meant for us babe heyyeah  
  
Im so unpredictable  
You dont know what to think  
So unemotional  
Wonder if Im even still in love  
You see  
I dont know what to tell you now  
Its always harder the second time around  
  
Im so unpredictable  
Just like you used to be  
So unemotional  
Boy I can forget the way you were with me  
I dont know what to tell you now  
Its always harder  
The second time around  
  
Im so unpredictable  
You dont know what to think  
So unemotional  
Wonder if Im even still in love  
You see  
I dont know what to tell you now  
Its always harder the second time around  
  
Im so unpredictable  
Just like you used to be  
So unemotional  
Boy I can forget the way you were with me  
I dont know what to tell you now
