Close your eyes  
Rest your head  
Let your spirits rise  
Sleepy head  
Rest your mind  
Its been well fed  
You can be what you want to  
And it doesnt matter who you are  
It doesnt matter where you are  
If you wish upon a star  
If you wish upon a star  
And it doesnt matter who you are  
It doesnt matter where you are  
If you wish upon a star  
If you wish upon a star  
Close your eyes  
Say goodnight  
Hug your lover  
Real tight  
Let your dreams  
Into your heart  
Let your dreams take flight  
And it doesnt matter who you are  
It doesnt matter where you are  
If you wish upon a star  
If you wish upon a star  
It doesnt matter who you are  
It doesnt matter where you are  
If you wish upon a star  
If you wish upon a star  
It doesnt matter who you are  
It doesnt matter where you are  
If you wish upon a star  
If you wish upon a star
