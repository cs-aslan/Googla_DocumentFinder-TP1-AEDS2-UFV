Pariah from society  
Addicted to sobriety  
A product of a virgin birth  
Another god on earth  
Yes thats your fantasy  
  
You say that you can read my mind  
Be careful of what you might find  
You think that you can be like me  
And see what my eyes see  
But youre no friend of mine  
  
Do you believe every word I say  
Make your own truth and get out of my way  
  
Im your pariah  
For you desire  
Aint no messiah  
Just your pariah  
  
An angel or the Antichrist  
A symbol of your own device  
Pathetic in your own sad way  
Youre just one pill away  
From taking my advice  
  
Do you believe every word I say  
Make your own mind and get out of my way  
  
Im your pariah  
For you desire  
Aint no messiah  
Just your pariah  
  
Do you believe that Im from Heaven  
That I descended from the sky  
The graven image of a pseudo icon  
To worship me on high  
  
Im not your savior  
I got no wings to fly  
Just your pariah  
Dont look to me when your life is over  
  
Im your pariah  
For you desire  
Aint no messiah  
Just your pariah  
  
Aint no messiah  
Just your pariah
