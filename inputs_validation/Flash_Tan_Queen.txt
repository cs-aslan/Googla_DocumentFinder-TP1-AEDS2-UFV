Diamond studded man  
Ruby coated plan  
Makes my heart ache to think that money could take you from me  
Midnight dream  
Almost made me scream  
Nightmares came now that money took you from me  
  
Chorus  
Well youre a flash tan queen from the southern shores  
Like a rotten peach layin in the Georgia sun  
Well you can lay all day get your back real brown  
But a dollar can take away your frown  
  
Fat rat queen  
Golden limousines  
All of these things just come between you and me yeah  
  
Lacy white gown  
Just makes me want to frown  
My heart aches now that moneys taken you from me  
  
Chorus  
  
Shakes me apart  
Make believe hall  
Im feelin like a flower stuck on somebodys wall  
  
Midnight dream  
Lord it made me scream  
My heart aches now that money took you from me  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh youre a flash tan queen
