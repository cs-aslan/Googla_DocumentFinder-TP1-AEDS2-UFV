Staring all alone  
And your grace and style  
Cut me to the bone  
With your razor blade smile  
I watched you playing pool  
Its all around the school that I love you  
  
I love your gypsy hair  
And dark brown eyes  
Always unprepared  
For your pointed replies  
Cynical and lean  
I lie awake and dream about you  
  
If you only knew  
What Im going through  
Time and again I get ashamed  
To say your name  
Its hard to grin and bear  
When youre standing there  
My lips are dry  
I catch your eye and look away  
  
Sitting in my room  
Ive got it bad  
Crying for the moon  
They think Im mad  
They say it isnt real  
But I know what I feel and I love you  
  
But I would give my life  
For a single night beside you
