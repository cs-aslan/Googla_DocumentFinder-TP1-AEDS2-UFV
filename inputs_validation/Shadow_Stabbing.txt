Say it all  
Say it all  
Say it all  
  
Say it all  
Say it all  
Say it all  
Say it all  
Say it all  
Say somebody  
Has got to say it all  
Somebody  
Has got to say it all

Im so tense  
My heart cant forget about this self defense

And my breath comes fast

Yeah adjectives on the typewriter  
He moves his words like a prize fighter  
The frenzied pace of the mind inside the cell
