Late night the speakers pumpin  
Fleshtoflesh grindnbumpin  
Hot pants green and yellow  
Round thighs feeling mellow  
The beat of the ghetto  
Corn rows bees and Afros  
the deed buzz from Nassau  
Id love to show the night

Dont let the music stop  
Girl gon make that Boongie drop

Black heat fills the dance hall  
Lovebirds got the back wall  
Junglers boot like labels  
High heels on the tables  
Bare feet on the dirt floor  
No one cares if youre poor  
every lock in the door  
aint coming home tonight  
  
Go sister roll on it  
Dont let the music stop  
Girl gon make that Boongie drop

Like Petra remember hah  
Remember me from the basement parties

Brother rubbing so close stepping on my Nikes  
At the red light never give me red light  
Only give me green light you know what I mean right  
After my Red Stripe hop up on my motorbike  
Show me what the motor like

All of my Guyanese girl theyre Bohemians  
All of my Jamaicans shake it for me shake it then
