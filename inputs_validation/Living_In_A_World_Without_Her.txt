My girl could break my heart  
And tear my soul apart  
Couldnt see myself living in a world  
Without her  
Shes a tear shes a scream  
Takes me high but my worst dream  
Could I survive living in a world  
Without her  
My mommy said open the door  
I didnt want to be that boy  
All my friends told me Id pull through  
But all thats said and all thats done  
Wont persuade me that Im wrong  
I know Id die living in a world  
Without her  
All my hopes and all my dreams  
Rest with her or so it seems  
I never want to see the world  
Without her  
Shes a saint shes a clown  
Picks me up when Im down  
Thered be so much missing from the world  
Without her  
Tangled up in falling vines  
She took my hand I know shes mine  
Pickin up the pieces of the past  
Well I awoke before the dawn  
Dreamed wed fought and she had gone  
Now I know how it feels  
Without her  
An empty club when we first met  
Sharing our last cigarette  
How could I have lived in a world  
Without her  
The sweetest girl I ever had  
Shes the best she must be mad  
Theres no way I living in a world  
Without her  
We walked four miles to get back home  
Through the crowds we walked alone  
She told me all about her last stand  
The sun came up and lit the scene  
She looked so fine so I see  
Theres no way Im living in a world  
Without her  
There aint no way I am living in a world  
Without her  
Theres just no way I am living in a world  
Without her
