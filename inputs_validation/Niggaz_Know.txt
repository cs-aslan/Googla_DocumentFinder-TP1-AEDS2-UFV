Verse  
Armed and dangerous call the law  
Stick to the script no audible  
Country ass nigga with an Audemar  
Cant spell the shit but I order more  
French hoes treat me like Charles De Gaulle  
Get good head on the Autobahn  
Hit hood hoes out in Baltimore  
Pack the shows like wall to wall my God  
Five steps like Dru Hill  
Came home from the first tour with  
Bad credit and a school bill  
Middle finger to the bursar  
Finally famous but  
Aint too much really change with us  
Straight up weed no angel dust  
Label us notorious that was 97  
Saw my old teacher and she asked how Im livin  
You aint know my shit drop bitch 911  
Gettin more hoes than that nigga John Legend  
Gettin more hoes than that nigga John Legend  
Nigga you should too if you knew  
What this game would do to you  
Look at all the bullshit Ive been through  
Better me than you  
  
Bridge  
I must confess I copped the chains  
I hit the club I made it rain  
I hit the road I made a name  
I came home I aint the same  
I aint the same  
I aint the same

Stole a nigga flow I could sue yall niggas

But a grown ass man and I will step to yall niggas

My shit long need a hair salon  
Get it cut shut the fuck up  
And wipe your face with my money til your tears is gone

Cant afford a whip but you buyin ass  
This Fresh Prince nigga I aint Jazz  
Fucked yo bitch nigga I aint ask  
She pitched it to me like Sosa Oh God

Deny that rather try that but I never fly that  
Keep hoes bicoastal  
And they buy postals aint shit for free

Later on shell be sippin me literally  
Picture me at the tiptop  
With your bitch liplocked on my dick when my shit drop
