She asked me if I was a singer then called me hasbeen  
She said she really like my band in the early 90s  
I said stop saying those mean things my ego is so fragile  
And the she called me a poseur punk  
Why dont I drink up and get the hell out  
Cause Im a sellout  
  
That berating kinda bumped me out so I left the prakside  
I walked to my Volvo and noticed I had a couple slashed tires  
But adding injury and insult to vandalism  
Someone took a key to my door and boldly spelled out  
Youre a sellout  
  
It says on the side of my car that Im a sellout  
I play a Korean guitar but Im a sellout  
Im a sellout
