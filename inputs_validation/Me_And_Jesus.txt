Me and Jesus got our own thing goin  
Me and Jesus got it all worked out  
Me and Jesus got our own thing goin  
We dont need anybody to tell us what its all about  
  
1st Verse  
I know a man who once was a sinner  
I know a man who once was a drunk  
And I know a man who once was a looser  
He went out one day and made an alter out of a stump  
  
2nd Verse  
Jesus brought me through all of my troubles  
Jesus brought me through all of my trials  
Jesus brought me through all of my heartaches  
And I know that Jesus aint gonna forsake me now

3rd Verse  
We cant afford any fancy preachin  
We cant afford any fancy church  
We cant afford any fancy singin  
You know Jesus got a lot of poor people out doin his work
