I saw what you did thats untold  
Glass of wine in her hand  
I knew she would make her connection  
At her feet was a full loose man  
Chorus  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes you just might find  
Youll get what you need  
Youll get what you need  
Well I went down to the demonstration  
Just to get my best share of abuse  
Singing were gonna bounce our frustration  
And if we dont were gonna blow a 50amp fuse  
Chorus  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes you just might find  
Youll get what you need  
Youll get what you need  
Well I went to the Chelsea drugstore  
Just to get your prescribtion filled  
I was in line with Mr Jimmy  
And man man did he look ill  
We decided that we should get a cola  
My favorite flavor cherry red  
I sang my song to Mr Jimmy  
And he said one word to me and that was dead  
And I said to him  
Chorus  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes you just might find  
Youll get what you need  
Youll get what you need  
I saw what you did in Reception  
In a glass was a bleeding man  
She was practice in the arts of deception  
You can tell by the blood stains on her hands  
Chorus  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes you might find  
Youll get what you need  
Chorus  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes you might find  
Youll get what you need  
Youll get what you need
