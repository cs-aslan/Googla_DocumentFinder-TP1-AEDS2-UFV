Driftin on a memry

All we need is candelight  
And a song ooh yeah  
Soft and slow

Sad to see  
Anew horizon slowly comin into view  
I wanna be livin for the love of you  
All that Im givin is for the love of you

Lovely as a ray of sun  
That touches me when the morning comes  
Feels good to me

Smoother than than a gentle breez  
Flowing through my mind with ease  
Soft as can be  
When youre in love with me

Ridingthe waves of your love  
Enchanted with your touch  
Seems to me we can sail together  
In and out of misery

RAP  
Aha  
Youre my lollipop  
Youre my lemondrop  
Youre my sweet pea  
Youre my queen bee  
When i look into your eyes  
Like a ray of sunshine  
Youre the kind of girl  
I wanna sport  
When Im on a roller ride  
Its love Im livin  
All for you  
The first girl in my life  
That Ill always be true  
Some get jealous  
Of what we got  
But theres no way to stop  
All the feelings we got  
Just the little things  
That made me gig with you  
The way you look in my eyes  
The way you find the time  
The way you touch my hand  
When Im not in demand  
The way you make me feel fine  
When Im cryin at night  
Paradise within my mind  
So i huff and I puff  
But you know I aint trippin  
I told you before that Ill only be livin  
For the love of you my boo  
I wanna be livin  
For the love  
For the love of you girl  
All that Im givin  
Is for the love of you  
Thats why everything I do  
I do for you  
Might as well  
Sign my name on a card  
That could say it better  
Time will tell  
Cause it seems that  
Ive done just about  
All that I can do  
I wanna be livin for the love of you  
All that Im givin is for the love of you  
Is for the love of you
