Calling all these other guys  
Im seeing something I didnt before  
Is that a new look in your eyes  
Now you dont believe that Im asking for more  
  
I saw you walking down the street  
With another girl who looks just like me  
People always say we look so happy  
He took my love but he didnt take me  
  
He aint with me he aint with me  
He says he loves me but he dont look in my eyes  
But Ill take it till its all gone cause  
He aint with me but at least Im not alone  
  
You say you laughed with your old girlfriend  
Youre doing nothing to encourage the end  
I could be charming on long distance too  
And if you want Ill make it easier for you  
  
Communication is the key  
Interrogation dont work for me  
You saw that other guy smiling at me  
If you were here I wouldnt act so free  
  
He aint with me he aint with me  
He says he loves me but he dont look in my eyes  
He likes to hold my hand in public  
Stranger cant you see he aint with me  
He aint with me he aint with me no more  
He aint with me he aint with me  
  
I guess fate really has my number  
Every time you wander away  
I reconsider all the time you said youd stay  
  
He aint with me he aint with me  
He aint with me no more  
He likes to hold my hand in public  
He aint with me he aint with me  
But Ill take it till its all gone cause  
He aint with me but at least Im not alone  
He aint with me
