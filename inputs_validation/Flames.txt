The pressure is mounting  
Im ready and countin  
Theres something Ive got to be  
  
Im fearless Im feeling  
Scared senseless who needs this  
Still something Ive got to be  
  
There is no going back this is what we know  
We come to entertain asking you to follow  
Be born to selfdestruct here it comes again  
A desire to go down in flames  
  
My hearts racing my legs shakin  
Is more drama in the making  
I had a feeling this day would come  
  
So are we really good or just delirious  
But if you stop us now it could get serious  
Im sorry mama for what Ive become  
  
There is no going back this is what we know  
We come to entertain asking you to follow  
Be born to selfdestruct here it comes again  
A desire to go down in flames  
  
You can turn it off but it never stops  
Madness or not I risk everything Ive got  
And if Ive got to do it all over again  
Id still believe in these friends  
And the mess they get me in  
  
There is no going back this is what we know  
We come to entertain asking you to follow  
Be born to selfdestruct here it comes again  
A desire to go down in flames  
  
Flames flames
