Im a new pair of eyes  
Every time I am born  
An original mind  
Because I just died  
  
And Im scanning the horizon for someone recognizing  
That I might have been queen  
For every sun that sets there is a new one dawning  
For every empire crushed there is a brand new nation  
  
Let the waters rise  
Ive ridden each tide  
From the gates of the city  
Where the first born died  
  
And I might have been queen  
I remember the girl in the fields with no name  
She had a love  
Oh but the river wont stop for me  
No the river wont stop for me  
  
Im a new pair of eyes  
An original mind  
With my senses of old  
And the heart of a giant  
  
And Im searching through the wreckage  
For some great recollection  
That I might have been queen  
  
For every sage that falls  
Theres an ancient child  
  
And I might have been queen  
I remember the girl in the fields with no name  
She had a love  
Oh but the river wont stop for me  
No the river wont stop for me  
  
I look up to the stars with my perfect memory  
I lived through it all and my futures no shock to me  
I look down but I see no tragedy  
I look up to my past my spirit running free  
I look down I look down and Im there in history  
Oh Im a soul survivor  
  
Soul survivor on the river but it wont stop  
I might have been queen  
Soul survivor on the river but it wont stop  
I know the secret combination
