Some people might say my life is in a rut  
But Im quite happy with what I got  
People might say that I should strive for more  
But Im so happy I cant see the point  
Somethings happening here today  
A show of strength with your boys brigade and  
Im so happy and youre so kind  
You want more money  of course I dont mind  
To buy nuclear textbooks for atomic crimes  
And the public gets what the public wants  
But I want nothing this societys got  
  
Chorus  
Im going underground going underground  
Well the brass bands play and feet start to pound  
Going underground going underground  
Well let the boys all sing and the boys all shout for tomorrow  
  
Some people might get some pleasure out of hate  
Me Ive enough already on my plate  
People might need some tension to relax  
Me Im too busy dodging between the flak  
What you see is what you get  
Youve made your bed you better lie in it  
You choose your leaders and place your trust  
As their lies wash you down and their promises rust  
Youll see kidney machines replaced by rockets and guns  
And the public wants what the public gets  
But I dont get what this society wants  
  
Chorus  
  
We talk and talk until my head explodes  
I turn on the news and my body froze  
The braying sheep on my TV screen  
Make this boy shout make this boy scream  
Going underground Im going underground
