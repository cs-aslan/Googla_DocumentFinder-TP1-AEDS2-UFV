You can put it down to lack of patience  
You can put it down to lack of sleep  
But its in my head to stay in bed  
Tucked under the sheets  
They said if you try to get on Id get on  
They said there were chances  
But now my chance has gone  
And I know what you think  
What you think about me  
Thoughts like that sink home  
To you were not deep  
Now it may be a sad reflection  
On the way young people feel  
But early Monday morning  
Is losing its appeal  
I open my curtains at 7am  
Just so you think Im up with the rest of the men  
And I know what you think  
What you think about me  
Thoughts like that sink home  
To you were not deep  
Youd do yourself a favor if you gave yourself a break  
But thats one risk youd never take  
The evenings yours the mornings mine  
But dont knock me Im doing fine  
Youd do yourself a favor if you gave yourself a rest  
But just for now you know whats best  
And I know what you think  
What you think about me  
Thoughts like that sink home  
To you were not deep
