Someones drinking all alone  
Someones left the TV on  
I dont suppose  
No I dont suppose  
  
Someones sleeping in my bed  
Someones let the genie in  
I dont suppose  
No I dont suppose  
  
You know who you are  
Who you are  
Who you are today  
  
Babys gone and died again  
Taken by the tide again  
And its no surprise  
She hates goodbyes  
  
Someones folding paper planes  
Someones on the line again  
Someones crying at the sonnet  
Someones hiding from someone  
  
I dont suppose no I dont suppose  
You know who you are  
Who you are  
Who you are today
