If youre there and you care  
And you listen very careful darling  
Youll hear my prayer  
  
And if you hear loud and clear  
You would get a million kisses from me  
Somewhere somehow  
  
And if the nights a lonely time for you  
Just listen to the words I gave to you  
Let the song of ours play one more time  
Somewhere somehow  
Ill be there  
  
Went out walkin in the morning  
Standing in the pouring rain  
Let it run all over me  
  
Stayed up late last night  
Tryin to put all the things right  
Then your tears roll over me  
  
And if the nights a lonely time for you  
Just listen to the words I gave to you  
Let the song of ours play one more time  
Somewhere somehow  
Ill be there  
  
If youre there and you care  
Youll get a million kisses from me  
Somewhere somehow  
  
And if you feel like I feel  
Love cuts the deepest part of me  
Somewhere somehow  
  
And if the nights a lonely time for you  
Just listen to the words I gave to you  
Let the song of ours play one more time  
Somewhere somehow  
Ill be there
