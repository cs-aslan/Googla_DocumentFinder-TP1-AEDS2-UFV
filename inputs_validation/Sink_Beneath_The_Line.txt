Solstice sun it sank beneath the line  
And the commoners were  
  
Drunken upon the hillside  
Or so the story goes  
I guess she followed along  
So she could  
  
Watch their games  
Sink beneath the line little girl  
Peak above the shrine them commoners were  
Harvest moon it peaked above the shrine  
And the crawlers emerged multitudious  
Silly girl she sat upon their doorway  
Just poppin a squat  
Thats when she  
  
Felt the squirms  
My underpants  
All I know is that she wanted to be part of the crowd  
I couldve told her she was welcome here anywhere  
  
But instead she combed the outskirts lookin inside  
And then she sat upon a bughill  
This was when things started to get rough  
  
An armyodepinchers climbed their creepy ways  
Right inside her 501 cutoffs  
And her skin took on a hue of a chemical unknown to me thats right  
They were biting her beneath the line  
  
She was a sitting on atop their shrine  
I wish I couldve warned her  
She shouldve worn underpants  
Theres bugs crawling everywhere and shit  
I cant believe it
