Words and music by bob seger  
I woke up with this feeling  
There was something I wanted to say  
So I wrote you a song  
  
Lately girl Ive been dreamin  
Dreamin bout you all through the day  
So I wrote you a song  
  
Hope the words will be right  
When I see you tonight  
Youll know how I feel  
Im no longer alone  
Think Ive found me a home  
And I think its real  
  
I woke up with this feeling  
Havent felt it for quite some time  
So I wrote you a song  
  
All these thoughts Ive been dreaming  
Somehow Ive got to make them right  
Got to make them belong  
Everytime that youre here  
Everytime that youre near  
Everything is real  
Im no longer alone  
Think Ive found me a home  
And I think its real  
So I wrote you a song
