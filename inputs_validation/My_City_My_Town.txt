Those mighty wheels keep rollin on  
On to that crazy place  
That still feels like home  
The world outside is rushing by  
It feels good to take that road  
Time after time  
  
I dont know how you feel  
My heart is beating fast  
It has been way too long  
But here I am Im back  
  
Its good to know youre still around  
Youd never let me down in my city  
You get my feet back on the ground  
Youd never let me down in my city  
  
No regrets well just a few  
You havent lost a thing  
Im still crazy for you  
  
I dont know how you feel  
Are you excited too  
It has been way too long  
Tonight Im back with you  
  
Its good to know youre still around  
Youd never let me down in my city  
You get my feet back on the ground  
Youd never let me down in my city  
  
Ive been no stranger  
To every corner of your heart  
Your dream still lives inside of me  
  
I dont know how you feel  
My heart is beating fast  
It has been way too long  
But here I am Im back  
  
In my city my town  
Deep in my heart Im so proud  
Of my city my town  
Ill never ever let you down  
  
Its good to know youre still around  
Youd never let me down in my city  
You get my feet back on the ground  
Youd never let me down in my city  
My city my town
