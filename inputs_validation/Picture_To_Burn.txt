State the obvious  
I didnt get my perfect fantasy  
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me  
So go and tell your friends that Im obsessive and crazy  
Thats fine  
Ill tell mine  
Youre gay  
By the way  
  
I hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
Youre a redneck heartbreak  
Whos really bad at lying  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
As far as Im concerned youre  
Just another picture to burn  
  
Theres no time for tears  
Im just sitting here  
Planning my revenge  
Theres nothing stopping me  
From going out with all of your best friends  
And if you come around saying sorry to me  
My daddys gonna show you how sorry youll be  
  
Cause I hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
Youre a redneck heartbreak  
Whos really bad at lying  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
As far as Im concerned youre  
Just another picture to burn  
  
If youre missing me  
Youd better keep it to yourself  
Cause coming back around here  
Would be bad for your health  
  
Cause I hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
  
Youre a redneck heartbreak  
Whos really bad at lying  
  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
In case you havent heard  
  
I really really hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
Youre a redneck heartbreak  
Whos really bad at lying  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
As far as Im concerned youre  
Just another picture to burn  
  
Burn burn burn baby burn  
Just another picture to burn  
Baby burn
