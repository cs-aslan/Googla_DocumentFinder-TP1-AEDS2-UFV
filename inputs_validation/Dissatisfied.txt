Why baby why are you still so sad  
When you know how much I need you  
I hate to see you feel so bad  
When I try so hard to please you  
You know Id do anything  
Just to see you smile againg  
Theres nothing I wouldnt do  
Just to take away a little pain  
You make me feel ooooh ooh ooh oooooh  
Dissatisfied dissatisfied  
You make me feel ooooh ooh ooh oooooh  
Dissatisfied dissatisfied  
My home is yours and I want you to know  
That I need you to depend on  
Any everything you feel Im feeling too  
And I just hope you havent forgotten  
How can I make the sunshine through  
So we can be happy again  
Oh baby theres got to be a way  
Just to take away a little pain  
You make me feel ooooh ooh ooh oooooh  
Dissatisfied dissatisfied  
You make me feel ooooh ooh ooh oooooh  
Dissatisfied dissatisfied  
Please dont say you dont love me anymore  
Cause I couldnt ease up on you  
Youre the only reason for all my joy  
And without you what would I do  
Cause Id do anything  
Just to see you smile againg  
Theres nothing I wouldnt do  
Just to take away a little pain  
You make me feel ooooh ooh ooh oooooh  
Dissatisfied dissatisfied  
You make me feel ooooh ooh ooh oooooh  
Dissatisfied dissatisfied  
You make me feel ooooh ooh ooh oooooh  
Dissatisfied dissatisfied  
You make me feel ooooh ooh ooh oooooh  
Dissatisfied dissatisfied  
You make me feel ooooh ooh ooh oooooh  
Dissatisfied dissatisfied
