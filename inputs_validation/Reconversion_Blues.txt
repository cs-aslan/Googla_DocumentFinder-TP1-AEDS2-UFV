I got those reheehee reconversion blues  
I got those reheehee reconversion blues  
Cant wait to buy a new automobile  
And a pair of twotone shoes  
I can walk right past my draft board  
And I wont get no dirty looks  
I can go down to the grocer  
Without takin my ration books  
I got those reheehee reconversion blues  
I can drive in a gas station  
And get most anything I choose  
I forgot the taste of bacon  
Butter and whipped cream cake  
At night I wake up screamin  
Bring me a nice fat juicy steak  
I got those reheehee reconversion blues  
Im gonna buy my baby nylons  
All the nylons she can use  
No more fish on Tuesdays  
I get plenty meat in my stews  
Theres plenty of cigarettes and chewing gum  
And nuts and bolts and screws  
I got those reheehee reconversion blues  
If someone say for the duration  
Brother Im gonna blow my fuse  
Im gonna reconvert my baby  
With a house and a diamond ring  
Were gonna lock our door this winter  
And we wont come out till spring  
I got those reheehee reconversion blues  
Im gonna buy a brand new radio  
That dont know how to get the latest news
