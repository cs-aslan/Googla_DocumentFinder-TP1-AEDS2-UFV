Well Ive stuck out in your street  
And Im lookin for some kind of halo  
When somebody says to me boy  
Shes too young to know  
  
Chorus  
Well I didnt make your time  
I never said you were mine  
Dont you think you show  
I guess Ill have to teach you how to roll  
Met you outside school  
when sure no one was lookin  
And your teacher looks at me  
all his envy growin  
  
Chorus  
  
I said take it easy baby  
you sure know whats showin  
And I cant help myself  
without your friends all knowin  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus  
You got a long long way to go
