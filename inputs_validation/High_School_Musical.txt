Here we go come on  
Alright little louder now  
Hey  
  
Lookin forward from center stage to Graduation Day  
Time to get the future started  
What we leave what we take with us  
No matter what its somethin were part of  
  
We learned to fly together  
Side by side  
I just hope the rest of my life  
Would feel as good as my  
  
High School Musical  
Who says we have to let it go  
Its the best part weve ever known  
Step into the future well hold on to  
  
High School Musical  
Lets celebrate where we come from  
With friends whove been there all along  
Just like our high school high school musical  
  
Improvisation without a script no ones written it  
And now we have the chance to  
Someday well be lookin back memories well had  
All the songs that we lived through  
  
The best of times  
So why leave them behind  
Why cant the rest of my life

We have to live and to learn to see the truth

Nothings ever impossible into the future we all free fall  
But forever well always have high school
