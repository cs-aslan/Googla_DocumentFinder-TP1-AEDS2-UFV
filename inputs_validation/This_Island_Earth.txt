Furious the exodus walks  
Along the maddening march of death  
With the furor and the masses  
Whose supremacies is the dominion  
Alien bodies stiff and cold  
Your inner sane turns numb  
You transform into a rage  
Too naive to understand  
  
And as they go on the sacrifice grows  
Were living on ground zero fire  
This island earth  
Target locked systems checked enter code  
Were living on ground zero fire  
Fire this island earth  
  
Locked up in a room  
Human beings in a cage  
The sentence a scienced death  
As they pull the triggers of ray guns  
Evil blackened eyes of youth  
Absorbing lifes hidden anguish  
Death thrown all about the ground  
Or those who wouldnt fight  
  
And as they go on the sacrifice grows  
Were living on ground zero fire  
This island earth  
Target locked systems checked enter code  
Were living on ground zero fire  
Fire this island earth  
  
Were living on this island earth this island earth  
Were living on this island earth this island earth  
Were living on this island earth this island earth  
Were living on this island earth
