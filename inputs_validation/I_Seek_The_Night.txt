I seek the night  
And I rest my head  
On my weary bed  
And I think about you  
  
And times on my mind  
Ive been thinking about  
What Im doing without  
With a boy like you  
Whats a girl to do  
  
Yesterday was more or less  
Just like the day before  
And time dont matter  
When theres nobody else around  
  
Yesterday is dead and gone  
And all I believe is in now  
I believe and how my time has come  
  
Why sleep at all  
Just to rest my head  
On a lonely bed  
And to dream alone  
  
Times on my mind  
And the last I heard  
He was like a bird  
Dont know where he flew  
And whats a girl to do  
  
Whats a girl to do  
Whats a girl to do
