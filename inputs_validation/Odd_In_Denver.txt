We started the tour out in Denver Colorado  
I made the first one but I did not make the second show  
Cause I met this girl there that brought about quite a big change  
But I odd in Denver and I just cant remember her name  
  
I guess you could say that my love life would not up to part  
Too many nights alone had left some permanence scars  
She told me shed love me and I told her Id do the same  
Then I odd in Denver and I just cant remember her name  
  
I brought it on myself and I guess that I shouldnt complain  
Doc said son you cant do anymore of that cocaine  
But she made me higher than all of those expensive things  
But I odd in Denver and wish I could remember her name  
  
I turned to other things tryin to make my daydreams real  
But they dont take the place of the womans face and her feels  
She treated me nice and I like to find her again  
But I odd in Denver and I just cant remember her name  
I brought it on myself kinda overdid it in Denver  
And I just cant remember her name
