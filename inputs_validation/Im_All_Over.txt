I always knew that there would be someone somewhere  
Who had it in for me  
I always knew that there would be noone nowhere  
Who was anything like me  
Im all over  
All over  
All over  
Im the only one  
Im hanging around  
Going nowhere  
Waiting for it to happen to me  
I always knew that there would be noone nowhere  
Who was anything like me  
Im all over  
All over  
All over  
Youre the only one  
I always knew that there would be someone somewhere  
Who had it in for me  
I always knew that there would be noone nowhere  
Who was anything like me  
Im all over  
All over  
All over  
Youre the only one
