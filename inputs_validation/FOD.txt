Somethings on my mind  
Its been for quite some time  
This time Im on to you  
  
So wheres the other face  
The face I heard before  
Your head trips boring me  
  
Lets nuke the bridge we torched 2000 times before  
This time well blast it all to hell  
  
Ive had this burning in my gut now for so long  
My bellys aching now to say  
  
Stuck down in a rut  
Of dislogic and smut  
A side of you well hid  
  
When its all said and done  
Its real and its been fun  
But was it all real fun  
  
Lets nuke the bridge we torched 2000 times before  
This time well blast it all to hell  
  
Ive had this burning in my guts now for so long  
My bellys aching now to say  
  
To say  
Your just  
A fuck  
I cant explain it cause I think you suck  
  
Im taking pride  
In telling you to fuck off and die  
  
Ive had this burning in my guts now for so long  
My bellys aching now to say  
  
Im taking pleasure in announcing this to you  
So listen up cause you might miss  
  
Your just  
A fuck  
I cant explain it cause I think you suck  
  
Im taking pride  
In telling you to fuck off and die  
  
Good night  
  
I was alone  
I was all by myself  
No one was looking  
I was thinking of you  
  
Oh yeah did I mention  
I was all by myself  
All by myself  
All by myself  
All by myself  
  
I went to your house  
But no one was there  
I went in your room  
I was all by myself  
  
I remember we had  
Such wonderful times  
When Im all by myself  
All by myself
