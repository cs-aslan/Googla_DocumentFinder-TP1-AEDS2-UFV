Hello like before  
Id never come here  
If Id known that you were here  
I must admit though  
Thats its nice to see you dear  
You look like youve been doing well  
  
Hello like before  
I hope weve grown  
Cause we were only children then  
For laughs I guess we both can say  
I knew when  
But then again thats kiss and tell  
  
Hello like before  
I guess its different  
Cause we know each other now  
I guess Ive always known  
Wed meet again somehow  
So that it might as well be now
