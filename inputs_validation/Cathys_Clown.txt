The weightlifter and a library tech you know  
Made a big decision in the magazine row  
Ill open my catalogue just enough to let you in  
And shell drop beers like you drop vitamins  
Did you ever never wanna let somebody down  
Was you ever thinking that youd be Cathys clown now shes around  
The protein pills and the Gstrings you left in her flat  
Are just enough to get your Dewey Decimal back  
You lift her to work just before your daily workout begins  
And shell stack up like you stack vitamins  
Did you ever never wanna let somebody down  
Was you ever thinking that youd be Cathys clown now shes around Hey
