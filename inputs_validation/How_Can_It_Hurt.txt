Maybe youre just too upset inside  
To give it to me straight  
Maybe youve become too angry and too close to crying  
To say anything I can understand  
Or maybe youre just coming in over my head  
Maybe youre just too upset inside  
Too upset inside  
  
How can it hurt if I dont understand  
How can it hurt if I dont understand  
  
Youre never gonna square with me I know  
So what is there to say  
Theres a million words that we could share tonight  
Why do you walk away  
And I could write you off and its over with  
Like a damaged car I cant afford to fix  
But everything inside me wants to heal your pain  
You wont explain you wont explain  
  
How can it hurt if I dont understand  
How can it hurt if I dont understand  
How can I help if I dont understand  
  
How can it hurt how can it hurt  
Well I dont understand
