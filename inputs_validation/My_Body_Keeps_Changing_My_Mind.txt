You youre driving me wild  
Youre making me fall in love  
In love with you baby I  
Im losing control  
I dont want to let go yet  
Till you want me  
You youre all that I need  
Youre all that I want  
And Id sure love to love you I  
I gotta go slow  
Keep it under control now  
Till you want me  
  
chorus  
But my body keeps changing my mind  
Keeps changing my heart  
When were dancing  
My body says love you tonight  
To drive me out of my mind  
When were dancing  
  
Verse 1  
Well I know it wouldnt be right  
To say take me home tonight  
But when we get to dancing  
When I see you dancing  
When it comes to dancing  
My body keeps changing my mind  
You its you in my heart  
Its you on my mind  
And you just cant help it  
I should give it some time  
And wait for the right sign  
That you want me  
Cause  
  
Repeat chorus   
  
Repeat Verse 1  
  
And we fly together across the floor  
My hearts crying out for more  
Cause I just cant resist you  
  
Repeat Verse 1  
  
You know  
  
Repeat chorus
