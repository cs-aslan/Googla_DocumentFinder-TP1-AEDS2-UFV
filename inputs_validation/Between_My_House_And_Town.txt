They finally got the nerve to tell me  
Your no longer wanted hangin around  
I knew all along it woulda happened  
So there thisa new place darlin that I found  
  
And its just on the outskirts of somewhere  
The only traffic is downward bound  
Its alright to try our love cause Ive been so far out  
Perhaps the sun will go down between my house and town  
  
Please dont feel sorry darlin cause you hurt me  
Love just moved away for your your little man  
I could feel this bad bad day acomin  
So theres this new place darlin that I plan  
  
And its just on the outskirts of somewhere  
The only traffic is downward bound  
Its alright to cry out loud cause Ive been so far out  
So that the sun will go down between my house and town  
  
Yeah the sun will go down between my house and town
