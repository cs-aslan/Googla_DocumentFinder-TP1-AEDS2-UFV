Paperlate paperlate  
Paperlate paperlate  
  
Paperlate oh Im sorry but there is no one on the line  
Paperlate oh Im sorry but rest easy no news is good news  
  
Oh its too easy to live like clockwork  
Tick tock watching the world go by  
Any change would take too long  
So dry your eyes  
Ooh its too easy to live in a cold sweat  
Just sitting dripping in pools below  
You can wipe your face  
Kill the pain  
But the fever wont go no no  
  
Paperlate  
Pull it together now  
Put your feet back on the ground  
Paperlate  
Ooh dont worry now  
Youre not alone  
Look around you  
Paperlate  
Ooh Im sorry but theres no one on the line  
Paperlate  
Ooh Im sorry but rest easy no news is good news  
  
Oh its too easy to compute your future  
Taking no risks and playing too safe  
Any change would take too long  
So dry your eyes  
Ooh its too easy to talk about rocking the boat  
Making changes and changing track  
But youd better not lock that door  
Cause youll be coming back  
  
Ah youre breathing faster  
Silence the only sound  
Theres no need to be nice on the way up  
Cause youre not coming down  
  
Paperlate paperlate  
Paperlate paperlate  
Paperlate paperlate  
Paperlate paperlate  
  
Paperlate  
Ooh Im sorry but theres no one on the line  
Paperlate  
Oh Im sorry but rest easy no news is good news
