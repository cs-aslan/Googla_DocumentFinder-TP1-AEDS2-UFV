Theres no holding me back  
Im not driven by fear  
Im just driven by anger  
And youre under attack  
Im just climbing up slowly  
Im the one and only  
The tease the way you lie  
The stumble in your mind  
The fear the hope inside  
They hit here  
Hit here  
  
But whatever you need  
Ever you got  
Ever you want  
Ill take back again  
Whatever you need  
Ever you got  
Ever you want  
  
Ill take back again  
Theres no holding me back  
Im not driven by fear  
Im just driven by anger  
And youre under attack  
Im just climbing up slowly  
Im the one and only  
The tease the way you lie  
The stumble in your mind  
The fear the hope inside  
  
They hit here  
Hit here  
But whatever you need  
Ever you got  
Ever you want  
Ill take back again  
Whatever you need  
  
Ever you got  
Ever you want  
Ill take back again  
Though whatever you need  
Ever you got  
  
But whatever you need  
Ever you got  
Ever you want  
Ill take back again  
Whatever you need  
Ever you got  
Ever you want  
  
Ill take back again  
Whatever you need  
Ever you got  
Ever you want  
Ill take back again  
But whatever you need  
Ever you got  
  
Whatever you oh oh  
Whatever you oh oh oh oh  
Whatever you oh oh  
Whatever you oh oh oh oh
