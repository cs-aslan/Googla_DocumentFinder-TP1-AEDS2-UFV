Well whos that awalkin down the street  
Pickin up those dainty little feet  
Whos the one that catches my eye  
Everytime she passes by  gee whizz its you  
  
Ever since we said goodbye all because of a little white lie  
Let me tell you why we parted listen now to what my heart says  
  
Chorus  
Gee whizz its you youre the one thats makin me blue  
Gee whizz its you youre the one who cant be true  
  
Little darlin wont you hear my plea  
Wont you please come back to me  
We can pick up where we started listen now to what my heart says  
Ummmm  gee whizz its you  
  
Instrumental  
  
Chorus

Ummmm  gee whizz its you  
  
Gee whizz its you  
  
Gee whizz its you  
  
Fade Out
