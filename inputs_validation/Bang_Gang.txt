We dont care  
Cause were in a gang  
Parties that we go end up in a bang  
Look at us funny and well shoot you dead  
While were there well fill em with lead  
We follow the gangs we are the worst  
Well be the last one  
But we werent the first  
Weve been in a gang for a year and a half  
There goes our future  
But we live in the past  
Lets go out shoot some people tonight  
We use guns cause we dont wanna lose the fight  
When we fight its 20 on 1 its funny that way  
Its much more fun everyone knows that were so bad  
Our knives are long and our day is short  
Our nights our long and our days are sad  
But we dont care cause were in a gang
