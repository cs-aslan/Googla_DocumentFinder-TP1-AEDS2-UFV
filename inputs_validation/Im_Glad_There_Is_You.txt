  
Said I many times love is illusion  
A feeling result of confusion  
With knowing smile and blazing sigh  
A cynical soandso was i  
I felt so sure so positive  
So utterly unchangingly certain  
But I never was aware of love and you  
And suddenly I realized  
There was love and you  
And I and i  
In this world of ordinary people  
Extraordinary people  
Im glad there is you  
In this world of overrated pleasures  
Of underrated treasures  
Im so glad there is you  
I live to love I love to live with you beside me  
This role so new Ill muddle through with you to guide me  
In this world where many many play at love  
And hardly any stay in love  
Im glad there is you  
  
In this world where many many play at love  
And hardly any stay in love  
Im glad there is you  
More than ever Im glad there is you
