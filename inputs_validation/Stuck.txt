You shove your way  
Through the room from the street  
And finally to me  
You ask me what Im drinking  
  
My friend Johnny  
Tugging on my sleeve  
Asks if I wanna leave  
But what Im really thinking is  
  
Why cant it be easy  
Easy  
Why dont you leave  
Leave me  
Leave me be  
I can see you swaying  
I cant hear what youre saying  
  
Im sitting here stuck  
And plastered to my seat  
I think up a reason to leave  
When you finally stop speaking  
Ill take a long slow  
Walk down Washington Street  
Half asleep on my feet  
Half aware if Im dreaming  
  
Ill go home alone  
A sinking stone  
A switched off telephone  
Ill go on and be free  
A frozen breeze  
A fallen down factory  
But I still see you swaying  
And I cant hear what youre saying  
  
I just lost the plot  
Got a little caught  
In a little knot  
I just hit a wall  
Had a little fall  
Felt the swinging wrecking ball  
  
And why should that be  
Why dont you tell me  
Why dont you tell me  
Im sure youll tell me  
Why dont you tell me  
I guess youll tell me  
Tell me
