Messing around Ive wasted my time for years  
Listening to friends who keep filling me up with ideas  
Having deep talks with scholars who sound so fine  
Hearing this sham is like getting drunk on cheap wine  
  
Well its time for a change  
Ive got to move on  
Theres got to be more than this  
The feeling is strong  
  
Look in better places gonna look inside  
Gonna get higher something is pulling me on  
Breaking down the old ways feeling no regret  
Gone are the shaky sands Ive been building on  
  
Well its time for a change  
Well Ive lost lots of friends  
Ive got to move on  
By sticking to my ground  
Theres got to be more than this  
I dont give a damn  
The feeling is strong  
Just look what Ive found  
  
Here I come now got no time to frown  
Nothing in my way now nothing can bring me down  
Feel that surge open the doors around  
Higher and higher the world is my hunting ground  
  
Well its time for a change  
Ive got to move on  
Theres got to be more than this  
The feeling is strong
