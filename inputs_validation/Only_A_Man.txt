Well you know it is hard  
Being a long time apart  
But its you that I love dont you see  
  
And when I go away  
You say please stay okay  
I want you to stay only with me  
  
Well you know it is hard  
All these girls are so smart  
And they see me all over the place  
  
Well they phone me at night  
Ask me out for a bite  
I can see all the lust in their face  
  
All these chicks really know  
That next day I will go  
And they will never see me again  
  
So when Im back home  
And we both are alone  
I can feel all you love and your pain  
  
Woman Im only a man  
Do the best that I can as you know  
Woman Im only a man  
Do the best that I can as you know  
Now you know how I feel  
Nothing is real  
  
Well its hard to say no  
When youve done a good show  
And they all want you to celebrate  
  
Well I try to refuse  
Try to make some excuse  
But at this point its mostly too late  
  
Yeah I start feeling good  
And I get in the mood  
I guess youll know what I mean  
  
These chicks all around  
Its so hard to keep count  
Its like a schizophrenic dream  
  
Woman Im only a man  
Do the best that I can as you know  
Woman Im only a man  
Do the best that I can as you know  
Now you know how I feel  
Nothing is real  
  
Well you know it is hard  
Being a long time apart  
But its you that I love dont you see  
  
And when I go away  
You say please stay okay  
I want you to stay only with me  
  
Well you know it is hard  
All these girls are so smart  
And they see me all over the place  
  
Well they phone me at night  
Ask me out for a bite  
I can see all the lust in their face  
  
Woman Im only a man  
Do the best that I can as you know  
Woman Im only a man  
Do the best that I can as you know  
Now you know how I feel  
Nothing is real  
  
Woman Im only a man  
Do the best that I can as you know  
Woman Im only a man  
Do the best that I can as you know  
Now you know how I feel  
Nothing is real
