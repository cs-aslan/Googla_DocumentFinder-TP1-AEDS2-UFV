Go on you know youre only one  
Set me free  
You take me up and turn around  
But let me in  
Take this shadow from my eyes  
And tell me everything  
Take the desert from my soul  
And lift me up from down below  
Let me take some pride in your creation  
Cause I have lived alone in castles that were lonely  
And I have cursed the dawn and wondered why I do  
Well I have wondered why I live  
Now I know you must forgive  
Let me stand inside your magic shadow  
The night is coming faster  
And youre feeling all unchained  
In the north there is a jungle  
Where rockets are aflame  
And I hope that in the desert  
There are ships and there is noise  
And above the greatest city  
There will shine a magic shadow  
And a voice  
Its taking long but Im getting strong as I grow old  
Please believe me let the magic reach me and I will unfold  
Ill step aboard with you onday  
And see my dust just melt away  
And then Ill step inside your magic shadow  
Dreamers  
Oooohoooooohooooooohhhhhhh  
Magic shadows  
Oooohoooooohooooooohhhhhhhh  
Have you seen have you seen  
Have you seen have you seen  
Have you seen have you seen  
Have you seen have you seen magic shadows  
Have you seen have you seen magic shadows  
Have you seen have you seen magic shadows  
Have you seen have you seen magic shadows  
Oooohoooooohooooooohhhhhhhh  
Oooohoooooohooooooohhhhhhhh  
Oooohoooooohooooooohhhhhhhh  
Oooohoooooohooooooohhhhhhhh  
Oooohoooooohooooooohhhhhhhh  
Oooohoooooohooooooohhhhhhhh
