We fell in love and I made you the world  
I spent all my time tryin to satisfy you girl  
Just one thing that I cant figure out  
Closer I get farther baby I am out  
  
30 days 30 days out  
Well Im six days runnin but Im 30 days out  
30 days 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt  
  
The roof was leakin honey where we live  
And Im wonderin whats that something that you wont give  
I started loving you but I gotta stop  
You got me mostly waitin for that other shoe to drop  
  
30 days 30 days out  
You keep me six days runnin but Im 30 days out  
30 days 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt  
  
Tried to talk about whats goin on  
You just smile and tell me Baby there aint nothin wrong  
In your smile theres a sign in red  
It said Thousand miles of hard road dead ahead  
  
30 days 30 days out  
Yeah Im six days runnin but Im 30 days out  
30 days 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt  
  
30 days 30 days out  
Well Im six days runnin but Im 30 days out  
30 days 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt
