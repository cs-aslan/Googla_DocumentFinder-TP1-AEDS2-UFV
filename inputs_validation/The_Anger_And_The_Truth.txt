Wheres the anger  
  
There comes a day when you finally realize  
That everything youve been taught was a fucking lie  
They always said that you should always tell the truth  
Do as I say but dont do as I do  
  
Wheres the anger  
Wheres the fucking truth  
Did you lose it somewhere in your youth  
  
Sometimes its hard to see the enemy  
The left the right or the fence of apathy  
The sheep or the wolf its a thinly veiled disguise  
Movements are worthless if theyre plagued with lies
