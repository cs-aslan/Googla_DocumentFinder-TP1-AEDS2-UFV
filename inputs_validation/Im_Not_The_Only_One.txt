Verse 1  
You and me we made a vow  
For better or for worse  
I cant believe you let me down  
But the proofs in the way it hurts  
  
For months on end Ive had my doubts  
Denying every tear  
I wish this would be over now  
But I know that I still need you here  
  
Chorus  
You say Im crazy  
Cause you dont think I know what youve done  
But when you call me baby  
I know Im not the only one  
  
Verse 2  
Youve been so unavailable  
Now sadly I know why  
Your heart is unobtainable  
Even though lord knows you kept mine  
  
Chorus  
You say Im crazy  
Cause you dont think I know what youve done  
But when you call me baby  
I know Im not the only one  
  
Bridge  
I have loved you for many years  
Maybe I am just not enough  
Youve made me realize my deepest fear  
By lying and tearing us up  
  
Chorus  
You say Im crazy  
Cause you dont think I know what youve done  
But when you call me baby  
I know Im not the only one  
I know Im not the only one  
  
You say Im crazy  
Cause you dont think I know what youve don  
But when you call me baby  
I know Im not the only one  
I know Im not the only one  
  
Outro  
I know Im not the only one  
And I know  
I know Im not the only one
