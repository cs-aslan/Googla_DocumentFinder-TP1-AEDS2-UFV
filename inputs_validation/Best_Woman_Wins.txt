Who do you think you are  
What do you think this is  
A game you can play tryin to steal him away  
Well I dont need a heartache like this  
Well dont think I dont go through hell  
But heaven is what we both want  
Hes easy to love but hes hard to give up  
And if you think I will well youre wrong  
The best woman wins I will fight til the end  
Ill lay down and die if I must  
Ill beg and Ill plead I will suffer and bleed  
But he must make a choice between us  
This soap opera play that were in  
Is just like you watch on tv  
But I never thought that Id ever get caught in it  
Starring you him and me  
In love as in war all is fair  
So a fight to the finish begins  
When you fight from desire you fight fire with fire  
So may the best woman win  
The best woman wins I will fight til the end  
Ill lay down and die if I must  
Ill beg and Ill plead I will suffer and bleed  
But he must make a choice between us  
So may the best woman win  
May the best woman win  
May the best woman win  
Ill never give up or give in  
So may the best woman win best woman win  
The best woman win best woman win  
The best woman win best woman win  
Ill never give up or give in  
So may the best woman win  
May the best woman win  
May the best woman win best woman win  
Ill never give up or give in  
So may the best woman win
