Some fellows look at the eyes  
Some fellows look at the nose  
Some fellows look at the size  
Some fellows look at the clothes  
I dont care if her eyes are red  
I dont care if her nose is long  
I dont care if shes underfeed  
I dont care if her clothes are wrong  
First I look at the purse  
Some fellows like the smiles they wear  
Some fellows like the legs that talk  
Some fellows like the style of their hair  
They want the waist line to be small  
I dont care if their legs all vein  
I dont care if their teeth are big  
I dont care if she wears a ring  
Why waste time looking at the waist line  
Cause first I look at the purseyeah  
A woman can be as fine as can be  
Kisses sweeter than honey  
That dont mean a thing to me  
If you aint got no money baby  
Cause if the purse is fat thats where its at yeahaa  
Some fellows like the way they walk  
The way they swing and sway  
Some fellows like the way they talk  
If they can talk talk all day  
I dont care if she waddles like a duck or talks with a lisp  
I still think Im in good luck if the dollar bills are crisp  
Cause first I look at the purseyeah yeah  
Keep an eye on the money  
Womans got to have some fine greenbacks hah  
I aint greedy guys  
Oh I dont want to work no more
