Women of a certain age  
They learn to rely and judge all his responses  
Having played the mating game  
She doesnt waste time cause all that she wants is  
Really honest emotions  
Ones he cant help but show  
Though I hardly know your name  
I know about love and I know  
  
I dont want to lose you  
I dont even want to say goodbye  
I just want to hold on  
To this true love true love  
  
Women who have made mistakes  
Are a little afraid they dont like taking chances  
She will play the waiting game  
Shes never impressed by those manly advances  
I know Ive only just met you  
Maybe I should know better  
But when you look at me that way  
Theres something inside thats so right  
  
I dont want to lose you  
I dont even want to say goodbye  
I just want to hold on  
To this true love true love  
I dont want to lose you  
And I always want to feel this way  
Cause every time Im with you  
I feel true love true love  
  
Tell me youre real  
Youre not pretending  
Lets make a deal  
My hearts depending on you
