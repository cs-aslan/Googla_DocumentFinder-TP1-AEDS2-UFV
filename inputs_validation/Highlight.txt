Chorus  
Day to day  
Youre the hi Highlight  
Day to day  
Youre the hi Highlight  
  
Youre the bright side of my darkness  
You remove my gloom  
You picked me up when times got rough  
Im glad you had some room  
To love and hold me close to your heat  
To keep me safe and warm  
Youre the height of my desire  
You set off my alarm  
  
Chorus  
  
I cant wait to see you  
From one moment to the next  
With you I never know what new thrill to expect  
Your perfect sense of timing  
Keeps me coming back for more  
Youre the spark that lights my fire  
Its you that I adore  
  
Chorus
