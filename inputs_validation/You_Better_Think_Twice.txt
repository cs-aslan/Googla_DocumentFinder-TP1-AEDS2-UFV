I kow it aint none of my business  
When it comes to the affairs of your heart  
Its really hard for me to say this  
But you troubles gettin ready to start  
Well Ive heard you say how much you love him  
You think someday youll be his bride  
Baby you just cant trust him  
Cause Ive known the boy all of my life  
  
So you better think twice before you roll the dice  
You better think twice before you give you heart away  
  
You really must think Im something  
Talkin trash about my best friend  
I just hate to se eyou wind up with nothing  
Cause youre way too good for him  
And I know that you dont believe me  
But Ive been with him when hes runnin around  
He dont mean to hurt nobody  
He aint never gonna settle down  
  
So you better think twice before you roll the dice  
You better think twice before you give you heart away  
  
You better think twice  
You better think twice  
You better think twice  
You better think twice
