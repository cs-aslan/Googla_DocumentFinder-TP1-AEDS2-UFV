What child is this  
That lay to rest  
On Marys lap is sleeping  
Whom Angels greet with anthem sweet  
And shepards watch are keeping  
  
This  this is Christ the King  
Whom shepards guard  
And Angels sing  
Haste haste to bring him love  
The babe the son of Mary  
  
So bring him incence gold and merth  
Come peasants king to honor him  
The King of Kings salvation brings  
And loving arms enthrone him  
  
This this is Christ the King  
Whom shepards guard  
And Angels sing  
Haste haste to bring him love  
The babe the son of Mary  
  
This this is Christ the King  
Whom shepards guard  
And Angels sing  
Haste haste to bring him love  
The babe the son of Mary
