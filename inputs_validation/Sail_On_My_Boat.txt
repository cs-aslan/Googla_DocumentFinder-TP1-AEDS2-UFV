Im gonna sail on my boat and keep it afloat forever  
Nobodys gonna tell me how it wont stay together  
I got a waiting ticket wont you sail it  
Nobodys whos staying asleep knows what Im saying  
  
Im gonna throw out a rope and keep it afloat its granted  
Independence  
Im gonna wake and take us all to where oh  
Nobodys gonna talk me down by stormy weather  
  
Got to sail my boat  
Got to keep afloat  
I get the need to keep on when Im sailing  
  
Ill sail across dont make it a choice Ill plan it  
Nobody ever thought you wouldnt take you for granted  
Ill tie the ropes that keep me afloat and sailing  
Nobody ever taught me teach what Im playing  
  
Gonna lift up my voice and sing you a song romantic  
Independence  
  
Repeat chorus  
Hold on in love take it to where you never  
Nobodys gonna tell me how it wont stay together  
Ive got a freedom ticket lets go sailing  
Nobodys whos staying asleep knows what Im saying  
  
Repeat chorus twice
