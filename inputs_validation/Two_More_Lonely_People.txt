I need to feel your heartbeat  
When you say you love me  
I dont want to hear it  
If its something that you dont mean  
  
If I had to leave you now  
There would be an empty space  
It doesnt matter anyhow  
You can take your things  
And go your own way  
  
And theres two more lonely people  
In the world tonight  
Baby you and I  
Are just two more lonely people  
Who gave up the fight  
Yeah wrong or right  
Well you know my heart is aching  
You dont have to break it  
If love dont change your mind  
Then theres two more lonely people tonight  
  
I dont want the pictures  
I dont want your sympathy  
We dont have to be friends  
We dont have to be enemies  
  
In my head I break it down  
And Im absolutely sure  
That you and I could work it out  
Or we could kill the lights  
On what we had before  
  
And theres two more lonely people  
In the world tonight  
Baby you and I  
Are just two more lonely people  
Who gave up the fight  
Yeah wrong or right  
Well you know my heart is aching  
You dont have to break it  
If love dont change your mind  
Then theres two more lonely people  
  
Well we got something special  
That should be enough  
Nothing is predictable  
When it comes to love  
Maybe lately baby  
Its been a little rough  
But if you walk away tonight  
  
Well be two more lonely people  
In the world tonight  
Baby you and I  
And just two more lonely people  
Who gave up the fight  
  
And theres two more lonely people  
In the world tonight  
Baby you and I  
And just two more lonely people  
Who gave up the fight  
Yeah wrong or right  
Well you know my heart is aching  
You dont have to break it  
If love dont change your mind  
Then theres two more lonely people tonight
