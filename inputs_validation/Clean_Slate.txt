Envy of a sense of true identity a sign of confidence to see  
Because when she said I love that music too  
She meant Only as long as you want me too  
So sad we dont see until we become what they want us to be  
Its too late  
I dont know why  
But what they want me to do  
I do it  
Powered by wealth  
Changing myself  
And if they only knew that I knew it  
And it seems that the real life will have to wait  
Because the worlds so busy  
So busy cleaning a clean slate  
Oh  
Ahh hoping to find whats mine  
So I can lead a full life  
Use a knife  
And dig in like a cannibal  
Out for  
For myself but all the things I want are serving someone else  
I dont know why  
But what they want me to do  
I do it  
Powered by wealth  
Changing myself  
And if they only knew that I knew it  
And it seems that the real life will have to wait  
As the world keeps cleaning its cleaning  
The spin cycle runs round  
A clear decision can be found  
Cant think when my mind  
My mind runs round
