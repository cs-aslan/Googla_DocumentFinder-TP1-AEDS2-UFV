Love comes love goes  
But a certain feeling never lets me be  
Somehow I know  
Quite a part of mes unchanged since youve been gone  
Like a sturdy tree thats seen a thousand seasons  
I still shed my leaves in winter  
To grow them back in spring  
To welcome life again  
To welcome you  
So goes my life  
Still believing dreams of having you around  
Too bad memories  
Feed the mind and not the heart where I want you to be  
So I ask myself what you have left behind for me  
To go on each day to live as if  
I had you once again  
What else is there thats real  
But all the pain that I feel  
So let the pain remain forever in my heart  
For every throb it brings is  
One more moment spent with you  
Ill let the pain bring on the rain  
If thats the only way  
If theres no other way to be with you again  
So goes my life  
Still believing dreams of having you around  
Too bad memories  
Feed the mind and not the heart where I want you to be  
So I ask myself what you have left behind for me  
To go on each day to live as if  
I had you once again  
What else is there thats real  
But all the pain that I feel  
So let the pain remain forever in my heart  
For every throb it brings is  
One more moment spent with you  
Ill let the pain bring on the rain  
If thats the only way  
If theres no other way to be with you again  
Ooohso let the pain remain forever in my heart  
For every throb it brings is  
One more moment spent with you  
Ill let the pain bring on the rain  
If thats the only way if thats the only way  
If theres no other way to be with you again
