Harley didnt have no education he could hardly read and write  
He was locked into a deadend occupation his future didnt look too bright  
He worked eighteen years on the assembly line  
Just gettin by with a little bit of overtime  
And that could be the end of this story of mine but its just the beginning  
Late one night when he was workin graveyard Harley got himself this big  
idea  
All hes have to do is change one little screw a save millions of dollars a  
year  
So he worked and he saved till he could open his own shop  
Money started rollin in like it wasnt gonna stop  
So Harley bought a mountain built a mansion on top  
So the losers could see whom was winnin  
Only in America with nothin but a dream only in America where every mans  
king  
  
First Harleys daughter Janet found a guru she gave him everything she  
owned  
Then Harley junior joined some kind of rockband  
And walked around all day about half stoned  
His wife watched TV all the time cause she got bored  
Then one day she found a TV preacher she adored  
And she gave all of Harleys hard earned money to the Lord  
Harley started drinkin wound up in Betty Ford to see if he could by a  
happy ending  
Then some kid who worked in Harleys factory he got himself this big idea  
Figured out how to do it with compures drove Harley out of business in a  
year  
Now Harleys back working the assembly line  
Just gettin by with a little bit of overtime  
But dont count Harley out cause he aint the quittin kind  
He stares at that computer with one thing on his mind  
How to make them things more userfriendly  
Only in America  
Only in America
