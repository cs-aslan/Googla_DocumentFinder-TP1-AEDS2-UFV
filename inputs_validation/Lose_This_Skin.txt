Come with me I wont hide  
Were going on a ride  
We meet each day use time to see  
While were young and almost free  
  
Ive got to lose this skin Im imprisoned in  
Got to lose this skin Im imprisoned in  
  
Do not turn or hate to see  
All the things you think weve got  
Do not turn or hate to see  
What happened to the wife of Lot  
  
Were alone or so they say  
Were not on our own in that way  
When were alone its real tough going  
We can take a part in someone elses play  
  
Come with me I thought he said  
But thats not him anymore hes dead  
Whats it like to be so free  
So free it looks like lost to me
