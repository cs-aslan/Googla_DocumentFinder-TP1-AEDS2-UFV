Well youre damned if you do  
Youre damned if you dont  
Catch 22  
Youre so very close yet so far  
You gave your best shot  
Still no cigar  
  
Working your fingers  
Down to the bone  
Running with sinners  
Your lifes just a loan  
  
Catch 22  
  
They say you can  
They say that you cant  
Catch 22  
  
The limits the sky  
But they lock you inside  
Youre livin a lie  
Youll never know why  
  
Workin your fingers  
Down to the bone  
Running with sinners  
Your lifes just a loan  
  
Catch 22  
  
Catch 22  
You think you will win  
But you always lose  
Catch 22  
  
They think theyre so strong  
They think theyre so wise  
You know they are wrong  
They tread on thin ice  
  
Working your fingers  
Down to the bone  
Running with sinners  
Your lifes just a loan  
  
Catch 22  
  
Catch 22  
You think you will win  
But you always lose  
Catch 22  
  
They think theyre so strong  
They think theyre so wise  
You know they are wrong  
They tread on thin ice  
  
Workin your fingers  
Down to the bone  
Running with sinners  
Your lifes just a loan  
Catch 22
