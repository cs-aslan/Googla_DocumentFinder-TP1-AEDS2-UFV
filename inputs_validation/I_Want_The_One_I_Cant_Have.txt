On the day that your mentality  
Decides to try to catch up with your biology  
  
Come round   
Cause I want the one I cant have  
And its driving me mad  
Its all over all over all over my face  
  
On the day that your mentality  
Catches up with your biology  
  
I want the one I cant have  
And its driving me mad  
Its all over all over all over my face  
  
A double bed  
And a stalwart lover for sure  
These are the riches of the poor  
  
A double bed  
And a stalwart lover for sure  
These are the riches of the poor  
  
And I want the one I cant have  
And its driving me mad  
Its all over all over my face  
  
A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails  
Raised on Prisoners Aid  
He killed a policeman when he was  
Thirteen  
And somehow that really impressed  
Me  
And its written all over my face  
  
Oh these are the riches of the poor  
These are the riches of the poor  
  
I want the one I cant have  
And its driving me mad  
Its written all over my face  
  
On the day that your mentality  
Catches up with your biology  
  
And if you ever need selfvalidation  
Just meet me in the alley by the  
Railway station  
Its all over my face  
Oh
