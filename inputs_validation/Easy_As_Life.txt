This is the moment  
When the Gods expect me  
To beg for help  
But I wont even try  
  
I want nothing in the world  
But myself to protect me  
But I wont lie down  
Roll over and die  
  
All I have to do is  
To forget how much I love him  
All I have to do is  
Put my longing to one side  
  
Tell myself that  
Loves an ever changing situation  
Passion would have cooled  
And all the magic would have died  
  
Its easy its easy  
  
Until I think about him  
As he was when I last saw him  
And how he would have been  
Were I to be with him today  
  
Tender in his manner  
And my selfconsolation  
All I ever wanted  
And Im throwing it away  
  
Its easy easy as life  
  
All I have to do is  
To pretend I never knew him  
On those very rare occasions  
When he steals into my heart  
  
Better to have lost him  
When the ties were barely binding  
Better the contempt  
Of the familiar cannot start  
  
Its easy its easy  
  
Until I think about him  
As he was when I last touched him  
And how he would have been  
Were I to be with him today  
  
Those very rare occasions dont let up  
They keep on coming  
All I ever wanted  
And Im throwing it away  
  
Its easy its easy as life  
  
And then I see the faces  
Of a worn defeated people  
A father and a nation  
Who wont let a coward run  
  
Is this how the Gods reward  
The faithful through the ages  
Forcing us to prove that  
All the hardest things weve done  
  
Are easy so easy  
  
And though Ill think about him  
Until the earth draws in around me  
And though I choose to leave him  
For another kind of love  
  
This is no denial no betrayal  
But redemption  
Redeemed in my own eyes  
And in the pantheon above  
  
Its easy its easy  
Its easy as life
