Im trapped here as my senses bleed  
I cant recall which things I need  
You show up late and stumble in  
Unsure if you are still Corrine   
  
My captive gaze inside your eyes  
Reveal a thing youve tried to hide  
Attempting to record this view  
Reflections drive me out of you  
  
Time for the meatstick  
Bury the meatstick  
Take out the meatstick time  
Whoa shocks my brain  
Whoa shocks my brain  
  
Time for the meatstick  
Bury the meatstick  
Take out the meatstick time  
Whoa shocks my brain  
Whoa shocks my brain  
  
But long before this scene concludes  
The end Im seeking still eludes  
My every effort to apply  
My will to moments passing by  
  
But everytime we say goodbye  
The pain I cant identify  
Reveals to me the hidden door  
That leads to several moments more  
  
Time for the meatstick  
Bury the meatstick  
Take out the meatstick time  
Whoa shocks my brain  
Whoa shocks my brain  
  
Time for the meatstick  
Bury the meatstick  
Take out the meatstick time  
Whoa shocks my brain  
Whoa shocks my brain  
  
Time for the meatstick  
Bury the meatstick  
Take out the meatstick time  
Whoa shocks my brain  
Whoa shocks my brain  
  
Time for the meatstick  
Bury the meatstick  
Take out the meatstick time  
Whoa shocks my brain  
Whoa shocks my brain  
  
Time for the meatstick  
Bury the meatstick  
Take out the meatstick time  
Whoa shocks my brain  
Whoa shocks my brain  
  
Whoa shocks my brain  
Whoa shocks my brain  
  
Holy shit thats making all kinds of rules  
Im not even going to go there  
Hey just for a second Ill just go for a second  
Oh meatstick Ah I dont know On a string  
Time for the meatstick  
Bury meatstick  
Bury meatstick time  
Oh meatstick  
Hey that song could be the next cha cha  
  
Oooh
