Susan spent the weekend at her stately home  
Crying at the lions on the garden wall  
And then shed sigh  sneak away  
Look at her style  free the day  
  
Oh no not me  I wouldnt  
Oh no not me  I couldnt  
Thats all she says her money and her place  
They just dont mean a thing  
  
Susan met the lords and dukes of everywhere  
Smiling kissing wishing that theyd go to hell  
And then shed laugh  wonder why  
Take a nap  sit and cry  
  
Oh no not me  I wouldnt  
Oh no not me  I couldnt  
Thats all she says her money and her place  
They just dont mean a thing
