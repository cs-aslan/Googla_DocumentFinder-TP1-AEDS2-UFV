With the music of life my soul is out of tune  
And I feel like Im growing old much too soon  
My love for you I just couldnt convey  
And the keys to my happiness I let slip away  
Now Im a man without a dream  
Ive got a heart that has no hope  
All my senses are numb  
Losing you Ive become  
A man Im just a man without a dream  
Instead of striving to reach my goals and my aims  
I got distracted with meaningless games  
For just an illusion I traded love that was real  
Now my eyes cannot see and my heart cannot feel  
Now Im a man without a dream  
Ive got a heart that has no hope  
All my senses are numb  
Losing you Ive become  
A man Im just a man without a dream  
Sometimes I think Im a prisoner of fate  
Doomed to find out things a little too late  
And so I must play this broken mans role  
Unless you come home girl and bring back my soul  
Cause Im a man without a dream  
Ive got a heart that has no hope  
All my senses are numb  
Losing you Ive become  
A man Im just a man without a dream  
Without a dream  
Without a dream
