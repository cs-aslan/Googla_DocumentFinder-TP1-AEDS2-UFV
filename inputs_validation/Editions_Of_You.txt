Well Im here looking through an old picture frame  
Just waiting for the perfect view  
I hope something special will step in to my life  
Another fine edition of you  
A pinup done in shades of blue  
Sometimes you find a yearning for the quiet life  
The country air and all its joys  
But badgers couldnt compensate at twice the price  
  
For just another night with the boys oh yeah  
And boys will be boys will be boys  
They say loves a gamble hard to win easy lose  
And while sun shines youd better make hay  
So if life is your table and fate is the wheel  
Then let the chips fall where they may  
In modern times the modern way  
  
And as I was drifting past the Lorelei  
I heard those slinky sirens wail whooo  
So look out sailor when you hear them croon  
Youll never been the same again oh no  
Their crazy music drives you insane this way  
So love leave me do what you will  
Who knows what tomorrow might bring  
Learn from your mistakes is my only advice  
  
And stay cool is still the main rule  
Dont play yourself for a fool  
Too much cheesecake too soon  
Old moneys better than new  
No mention in the latest Tribune  
And dont let this happen to you
