Fatal fascination for the seedy part of town  
Walk down the street and your head spins round  
Dont be seen alone without your friends at night  
Take a gun or a knife to the low life  
  
Dont have to be born into this society  
Pay for love but the hate comes free  
Bring enough money for the rest of your life  
Dont bring your wife to the low life  
  
Bringing us there to the degredation  
Always keep your back to the wall  
No rewards for your infatuation  
Low life  
No life at all  
  
Yeah low life low life  
In here to long to be afraid anymore  
You cant reach the bed so you sleep on the floor  
You get so stoned you think you could fly  
But you wont get high on the low life  
  
Low life low life  
Low life low life  
Low life low life  
Low life low life
