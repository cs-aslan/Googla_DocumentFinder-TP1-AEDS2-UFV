Well you thought Id be waitin up when you came home last night  
Youd been out with all the boys and you ended up half tight  
But liquor and love they just dont mix leave the bottle or me behind  
And dont come home a drinkin with lovin on your mind  
  
No dont come home a drinkin with lovin on your mind  
Just stay out there on the town and see what you can find  
Cause if you want that kind of love well you dont need none of mine  
So dont come home a drinkin with lovin on your mind  
 steel  guitar   
You never take me anywhere because youre always gone  
And many a night Ive laid awake and cried here all alone  
Then you come in a kissin on me it happens every time  
No dont come home a drinkin with lovin on your mind  
  
No dont come home a drinkin  
No dont come home a drinkin with lovin on your mind
