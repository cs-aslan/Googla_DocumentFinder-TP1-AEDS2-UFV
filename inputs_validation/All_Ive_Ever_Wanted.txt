If you only know  
What I feel for you  
If you only lived for me  
The way I live for you  
Id be in heaven  
My dreams would come true  
  
Cause all Ive ever wanted  
Is you  
And you alone  
And I love you so  
More than you could ever know  
All Ive ever wanted  
Is you  
  
If you were my own  
To caress and hold  
I would shower you with love  
And drown within your soul  
Because I live and breathe for you  
And I really need you to know  
  
That all Ive ever wanted  
Is you  
And you alone  
And I love you so  
More than you could ever know  
All Ive ever wanted  
Is you  
  
Everything I do is for you  
You are every part of me  
And I dont want to face  
Another day  
Alone  
Without our love  
  
Cause all Ive ever wanted  
Is you  
And you alone  
And I love you so  
More than you could ever know  
All Ive ever wanted  
Is you
