Follow the Nile Deep to much deeper  
The Pyramids sound lonely tonight  
  
The sands run red in Lands of the Pharaohs  
Their symmetry gets right inside me  
  
I cannot stop to comfort them  
Im busy chasing up my demon  
Oh Im in love with Egypt  
  
My Pussy Queen knows all my secrets  
Ill never fall in love again  
  
I drift with Dunes  
I whisper of the tombs  
They offer me Egyptian Delights  
  
Shes got me with that feline guise  
Got me in those Desert eyes  
Oh Im in love with Egypt
