People point us out and shake their heads in shame  
In gossip circles we are talked about  
Darlin on you I hold no legal claim  
But here we are again hidin out  
  
The kisses that you give make our wrong seem so right  
Its too late to stop theres no doubt  
We said we wouldnt meet tonight my dear  
But here we are again hidin out  
  
The ones were tied to we know well hurt my dear  
Though were hoping they dont find us out  
Sooner or later we know well be caught  
But here we are again hidin out
