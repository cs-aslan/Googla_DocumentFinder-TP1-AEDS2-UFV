Gonna stay in bed today  
cause I cant stand the light  
Dont know why I get so down  
  
I wont be much fun tonight  
And I cant believe  
You still want to hang around me  
  
Its not so pretty all the time  
You dont mind  
To you its alright  
  
As I am is how you take me  
Never try to push or make me different  
When I talk you listen to me  
  
As I am is how you want me and  
I know Ive found the pieces missing  
Im looking at him  
  
Im not the girl you think you see  
But maybe thats a lie  
You almost know me better than  
Me myself and I  
  
Dont know a lot of things  
But I know what I got  
Its not so perfect everyday  
I dont have to try  
cause it all falls into place  
  
As I am is how you take me  
Never try to push or make me different  
When I talk you listen to me  
  
As I am is how you want me and  
I know Ive found the pieces missing  
Im looking at him  
  
Face to face eye to eye  
Youre standing there  
Feels good on the inside  
  
I dont mind I dont care  
Youre standing there  
Seein me for the first time  
  
Seein me for the first time  
Seein me for the first time  
  
As I am is how you take me  
Never try to push or make me different  
When I talk you listen to me  
  
As I am is how you want me and  
I know Ive found the pieces missing  
Im looking at him  
  
Found the pieces missing  
Take me as I am  
When I talk you listen  
Take me as I am  
  
Found the pieces missing  
Take me as I am
