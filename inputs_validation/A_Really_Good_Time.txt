Youre heard enough  
Of the blues and stuff  
Youre pretty swell now  
Cause youre pretty tough  
But I dont have to tell you  
How hard it can be to get by  
  
You never bothered  
About anyone else  
Youre well educated  
With no common sense  
But love thats one thing  
You really need to get by  
  
All your troubles  
Come from yourself  
Nobody hurts you  
They dont care  
Just as long as you show them  
  
A really good time  
All the things  
You used to do  
A trip to the movies  
A drink or two  
They dont satisfy you  
They dont tell you anything new  
  
You know I dont talk much  
Except to myself  
Cause Ive not much to say  
And theres nobody else  
Whos ready and willing  
And able to know me I guess  
Listen to me  
Im not finished yet  
Theres something to tell you  
That I cant forget  
Just have a really good  
  
Theres a girl  
I used to know  
Her face is her fortune  
Shes got a heart of gold  
She never goes out much  
But boy when she does  
  
Then you know  
Shes got no money  
Well maybe a dime  
But she knows what shes worth  
And thats reason why  
Shes gonna make it  
  
Shes got what it takes  
Youll appreciate that  
Shes probably late  
But I know  
And you know  
We all know  
Shell have a really good time
