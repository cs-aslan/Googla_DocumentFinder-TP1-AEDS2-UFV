Goin down to Rosies  
Stop at Fanny Mays  
Gonna tell Fanny what I heard her boyfriend say  
Now dont you start me talkin  
Ill tell everything I know  
Im gonna break up this signifyin  
Cause somebody gotta go  
Jack gave his wife two dollar  
Go down to the market  
Get out on the street ol George stopped her  
He knocked her down  
And blacked her eye  
She get back home and tell her husband a lie  
Now dont you start me talkin  
Ill tell everything I know  
Im gonna break up this signifyin  
Cause somebody gotta go  
She borrowed some money  
To go to the beauty shop  
Im goin to a place where I can get my hair sot  
Now dont you start me talkin  
Ill tell everything I know  
Im gonna break up this signifyin  
Cause somebody gotta go
