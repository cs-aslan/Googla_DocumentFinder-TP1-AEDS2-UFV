Say what you mean mean what you say  
Say what you mean mean what you say  
  
Lets walk into the forest  
Only witnessed by the moon  
And the breeze that once would chill us  
Now excites  
Say what you mean mean what you say  
And well touch the secret places  
As the earth beneath us breathes  
And the raw exquisite ecstasy  
Rushes in  
  
Say what you mean mean what you say  
Yeah yeah yeah Yeah yeah yeah
