When I wake up in the morning love  
And my heart is filled with pain  
The smile I had upon my face is gone  
Cant see the sunshine from the rain  
When I think of you then the world is alright with me  
Lord just one thought of you and I know its gonna be  
A lovely day lovely day  
  
Jesus youre the lover of my soul  
The fire that burns deep within  
You are the joy this world cant take away  
The spirit tells me this will never end  
When I think of you then the world is alright with me  
Lord just one thought of you and I know its gonna be  
A lovely day lovely day  
  
I know you going through some stuf now  
Feeling ruff now feel like givin up now  
But how can you learn if you dont fall  
But how can you walk if first you dont crawl  
But through it all you keep blessing me  
While people keep on pressin me and stressin me  
Because they never hear a preacher flow  
Lets come together with one heart one mind  
Until we see the sunshine  
When I think of you then the world is alright with me  
Lord just one thought of you and I know its gonna be  
A lovely day lovely day  
  
A lovely day yeah
