Well ya know when youre young  
Theres such a distance between you and your family  
Just cant see things from the same point of view  
  
Papa wants a lawyer and mama she wants an author  
And all you want is for them to want you  
  
Well I saw lot of bad signs and we had some real bad timesback on the east
coast  
And I guess you could say it took california to bring us close  
There was a lot of hard livin and some stone cold women on the east coast  
And I saw my papa turn away when I need him the most  
And california shes an angel  
Lo so heavenly dressed  
And the pacific shes a woman  
The lord must have loved her best  
I got a california rainbow to come give them thunder clouds a rest  
And the mountain is my friend now she put me to her test  
Well you know every father has dreams and schemes for his own kid  
And dreaming it aint been declaired no capital crime  
But I just hope when I grow up to have my own kids  
Ill love them all I can and let em make their own minds  
Now you know how a mother can hold the son through understanding  
And my father he once held me close by crying  
Whoa and my mamas love it dont ever leave me standing  
And papas love it just leaves me smiling  
Whoa and my mama shes a rainbow  
Gotta see hen on sunday when shes dressed  
Whoa and my papa hes a good man he gives me and mama his best  
Whoa my mama shes a rainbow come to give them thunder clouds a rest  
And my family is my friend now california put us through her test
