Girl give me something to feel on  
So please believe we gone be twerking it out  
By the end of the night baby

Around your waist and kiss your face  
Wouldnt trade this feeling for nothing  
Not even for a minute  
And Ill sit here long as it takes  
To get you all alone  
But as soon as you come walking my way

Around your waist and kiss your face
