Hello Hooray Let the lights grow dim  
Ive been ready  
  
Ready as this audience thats coming here to dream  
Loving every second evry moment evry scream  
Ive been waiting so long to sing my song  
And Ive been waiting so long for this thing to come

Roll out Roll out with your American dream and its recruits  
Ive been ready  
Roll out Roll out with your circus freaks and hula hoops  
Ive been ready  
  
Ready as this audience thats coming here to dream  
Loving every second evry moment evry scream  
Ive been waiting so long to sing my song  
And Ive been waiting so long for this thing to come  
Yeah  Ive been thinking so long I was the only one  
  
I can stand here strong and thin  
I can laugh when this thing begins

So strong  
God I feel so strong  
I am so strong
