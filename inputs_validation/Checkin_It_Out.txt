Weve got to put our heads together  
Im sure that we can work it out  
Im weighin up the situation  
And checkin it out  
Takin it further  
Takin it further  
Checkin it out  
  
This is a workin situation  
Im tellin you without a doubt  
Weve gotta pull it all in tight baby  
Checkin it out  
Takin it further  
Takin it further  
Checkin it out  
  
And all the obstacles along the way  
Sometimes may feel so tremendous  
There are guides and spirits all along the way  
Who will befriend us  
  
Lets talk it out across the table  
Make sure that we leave nothin out  
Get into it like a meditation  
Start checkin it out  
Takin it further

Checkin it out  
  
And all the obstacles along the way  
Might be tremendous  
There are guides and spirits all along the way  
Who will befriend us  
  
Lets talk it out across the table  
Make sure that we leave nothin out  
Get into it love meditation  
Start checkin it out

And you come back
