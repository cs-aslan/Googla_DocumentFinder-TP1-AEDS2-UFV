Looking at the clouds in the sky  
Floating image in my mind  
Land of beauty and land of peace  
Now I wonder where this place is from  
  
The evidence is everywhere  
I start to run now Im scared  
Strange beings all around  
Come everyone to this place Ive found  
  
Im feeling psyched to be walking  
I wonder why  
All my joys could be open  
No more cries  
  
My eyes are clear and now Im cured  
Dont you wanna be for sure  
I know my rights Im allowed to die  
So Id rather swap your different guise  
  
Its in my head if you will find  
Mother love from all mankind  
You look above and then you shout  
No other way to say your head is alright  
  
Feeling psyched to be walking  
I wonder why  
All my joys could be open  
No more cries  
  
Im feeling psyched to be walking  
I wonder why  
All my joys could be open  
No more cries
