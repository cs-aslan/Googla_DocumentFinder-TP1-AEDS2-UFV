Well Im a crazy mixed up kid  
And I love to dance like this  
Well I love to rock n roll  
Because it satisfy my soul  
  
Well I love to jump and shout  
Hey it really knock me out  
You give me music with a beat  
Itll knock me off my feet  
  
I dont care what you heard  
This is a crazy mixed up world  
  
Crazy mixed up world  
Crazy mixed up world  
Crazy mixed up world  
Im in a crazy mixed up world  
  
When I loosen up down inside  
My feet begin to glide  
My heart goes pump pump pump  
The music makes me jump jump jump  
  
I cant control myself no more  
Music got me on the floor  
Well Im crazy aint you heard  
Im in a crazy mixed up world  
  
Crazy mixed up world  
Crazy mixed up world
