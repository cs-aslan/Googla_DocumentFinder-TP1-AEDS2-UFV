Enjoy it or get out the game  
Its such a shame to lose a game  
So use your brain and play it sane  
Its just a game in another plane  
And when I call you on the phone  
Then show me that youre really home  
Lets share this thing and I will sing  
Live life like a diamond ring  
I can tell you something
