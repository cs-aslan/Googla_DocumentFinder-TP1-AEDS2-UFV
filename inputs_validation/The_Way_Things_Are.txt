I wouldnt know what to do with another chance  
If you gave it to me  
I couldnt take the embrace of a real romance  
Itd race right through me  
Im much better off the way things are  
Much much better off better of by far by far  
I wouldnt know what to say to a gentle voice  
Itd roll right past me  
And if you chalk it up youll see  
I dont really have a choice  
So dont even ask me  
Im much beter off the way tings are  
Much much better off better by far  
  
So keep on calling me names keep on  keep on  
And Ill keep kicking the crap til its gone  
And Ill keep on killing  
You could get me to settle  
And as soon as I settle  
I bet Ill be able to move on  
  
How can I fight when were on the same side  
How can I fight beside you  
  
So keep on calling me names keep on keep on  
And Ill keep kicking the crap til its gone  
If you keep on killing  
You could get me to settle  
And as soon as I settle  
I bet Ill able to move on
