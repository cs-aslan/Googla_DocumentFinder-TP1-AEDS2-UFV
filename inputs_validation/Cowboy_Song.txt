I am just a cowboy lonesome on the trail  
The starry night the campfire light  
The coyote call and the howlin winds wail  
So I ride out to the old sundown  
  
I am just a cowboy lonesome on the trail  
Lord Im just thinking bout a certain female  
The nights we spent together riding on the range  
Looking back it doesnt seem so strange  
  
Roll me over and turn me around  
Let me keep spinning til I hit the ground  
Roll me over and let me go riding in the rodeo  
  
I was took in Texas I did not know her name  
Lord all these southern girls they seem the same  
Down below the border in a town in Mexico  
I got my job busting broncs for the rodeo  
  
Roll me over and turn me around let me keep spinnin till I hit the ground  
Roll me over and let me go running free with the buffalo  
  
Roll me over and Ill turn around  
And Ill move my fingers up and down  
Up and down  
  
Its okay amigo just let me go  
Riding in the rodeo  
  
Roll me over and turn me around let me keep spinning till I hit the ground  
Roll me over and let me go riding in the rodeo  
Roll me over and set me free the cowboys life is the life for me
