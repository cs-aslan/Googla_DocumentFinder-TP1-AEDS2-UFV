And the wise man said I dont want to hear your voice  
And the thin man said I dont want to hear your voice  
And theyre cursing me  
And they wont let me be  
Theres nothing to say  
And theres nothing to do  
Stop whispering start shouting  
Stop whispering start shouting  
  
And my mother say We dontt love you son some more  
And the buildings say Let me spit on your face some more  
And the feeling is  
That theres something wrong  
Cause I cant find the words  
And I cant find the song  
  
Stop whispering start shouting  
Stop whispering start shouting  
  
Dear Sir I have a complaint  
Cant remember what it is  
Thats why Im here  
  
Stop whispering start shouting  
Stop whispering start shouting
