Its been a mystery  
But still they try to see  
Why something good can hurt so bad  
Caught on a oneway street  
The taste of bittersweet  
Love will survive somehow somewhere  
  
One love feeds the fire  
One heart burns desire  
One love whos crying now  
Two hearts born to run  
Wholl be the lonely one  
One love whos crying now  
  
So many stormy nights  
So many wrong or rights  
Neither could change their headstrong ways  
And in a lovers rage  
They tore another page  
The fighting is worth the love they save  
  
One love feeds the fire  
One heart burns desire  
One love whos crying now  
Two hearts born to run  
Wholl be the lonely one  
One love whos crying now  
  
Only so many tears you can cry  
Til the heartache is over  
And now you can say your love  
Will never die  
  
Whoa ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
One love feeds the fire  
One heart burns desire  
One love whos crying now  
Two hearts born to run  
Wholl be the lonely one  
One love whos crying now
