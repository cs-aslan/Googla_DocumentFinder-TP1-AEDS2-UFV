I was nothing It didnt matter to me  
Ah there were tags all over my sleeve  
There was water outside the windows  
and children in the streets   rats with tags  
  
Aint got a passport  
Aint got my real name  
Aint got a chance sport at fortune and fame  
And I walk these endless streets wont you give me a lift  
A lift A lift On your citizen ship  
  
They were rioting in Chicago movement in LA  
Sixtyeight it broke up the Yardbirds  
We were broke as well  
Took it underground MC borderline up against the wall  
The wall The wall  
Show your papers boy  
  
Citizen ship we got memries  
Stateless they got shame  
Cast adrift from the citizen ship  
lifeline denied exiled this castaway  
  
Blind alley in New York City in a foreign embrace  
If youre hungry youre not too particular about what youll taste  
Men in uniform gave me vinegar spoon of misery  
But what the hell I fell I fell  
It doesnt matter to me  
  
Citizen ship we got memries  
Citizen ship we got pain  
Cast adrift from the citizen ship  
lifeline denied exiled this castaway  
  
I was caught like a moth with its wings outta sync  
Cut the chord Overboard Just a refugee  
Lady liberty lend a hand to me Ive been cast adrift  
Adrift Adrift Adrift Adrift Adrift Adrift  
  
On the citizen ship we got memries  
Citizen ship we got pain  
Lose your grip on the citizen ship  
youre cast youre cast away  
On the citizen ship you got memry  
Citizen ship you got pain  
Citizen ship you got identity  
A name A name A name    
  
Whats your name son  
Whats your name     
Whats your name  
   
Nothing I got nothing  
  Jersey  
Give me your tired your poor  
Give me your huddled masses  
your wartorn    
Give me your wartorn and your    
Lift up your   unto me  
Ah mythology
