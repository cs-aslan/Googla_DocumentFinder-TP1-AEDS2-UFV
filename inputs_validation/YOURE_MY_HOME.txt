I close my eyes  
And I can feel that youre a part of me  
You are my home  
Though Im afar Im in your company  
Im in you  
  
I play my song  
And I can hear youre in my melody  
My life my home  
No matter what with you Ill always be  
  
Refrain  
Youre my home  
And together we share this love for us  
To be happy and free  
Youre my home  
And together well strive to make this world  
A better place to be  
  
Come take my hand  
Come fill your heart with all the love you see  
Let every child  
Be what they are be what they want to be  
  
Youre my home  
And together we share this love for us  
To be happy and free  
Youre my home  
And together well strive to make this world  
A better place to be  
  
For you and me
