Let me get back to the sea  
Let me be stormy and let me be calm  
Let the tide in and set me free  
  
Im flowing under bridges  
Then flying through the sky  
Im traveling down cold metal  
Just a tear in babys eye  
  
Let me flow into the ocean  
Let me get back to the sea  
Let me be stormy and let me be calm  
Let the tide in rush over me  
  
I am not the actor  
This cant be the scene  
But I am in the water  
As far as I can see  
  
Im remembering distant memories  
Recalling other names  
Rippling over canyons  
And boiling in the train
