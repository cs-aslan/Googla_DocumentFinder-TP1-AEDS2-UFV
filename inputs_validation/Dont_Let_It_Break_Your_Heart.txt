And if I lost the map  
If I lost it all  
I fell into the trap  
Then she goes  
  
When youre tired of waiting you just  
Find you never had to stop  
Come on baby dont let it break your heart  
  
Those heavenly regrets  
Still on me though  
Trying to catch a cannonball  
And so burning tired  
  
Ohohohoh through my veins is flowing  
From a shipwreck I heard a call  
Well she said  
  
When youre tired of aiming your arrows  
Still youll never hit the mark  
Ohohoh even if your aims are shadows  
Still we never gonna part  
  
Come on baby dont let it  
Break your heart  
Dont let it break your heart  
Dont let it break your heart  
  
Dont let it break your heart
