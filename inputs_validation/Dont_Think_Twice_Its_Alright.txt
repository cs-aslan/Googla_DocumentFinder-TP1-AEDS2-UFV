It aint no use to sit and wonder why babe  
It dont matter anyhow  
An it aint no use to sit and wonder why babe  
If you dont know by now  
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn  
Look out your window and Ill be gone  
Youre the reason Im travelin on  
Dont think twice its all right  
  
It aint no use in turnin on your light babe  
That light I never knowed  
An it aint no use in turnin on your light babe  
Im on the dark side of the road  
Still I wish there was somethin you would do or say  
To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talkin anyway  
So dont think twice its all right  
  
It aint no use in callin out my name gal  
Like you never did before  
It aint no use in callin out my name gal  
I cant hear you any more  
Im athinkin and awonderin all the way down the road  
I once loved a woman a child Im told  
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul  
But dont think twice its all right  
  
Im walkin down that long lonesome road babe  
Where Im bound I cant tell  
But goodbyes too good a word gal  
So Ill just say fare thee well  
I aint sayin you treated me unkind  
You could have done better but I dont mind  
You just kinda wasted my precious time  
But dont think twice its all right
