Shaking your head like its all wrong  
Before youre here youre already gone  
And even with the light all around you  
Youre all alone in the dark  
  
Youre breaking your own heart  
Taking it too far down a lonely road  
You say its just one love  
But when its close enough you just let it go  
The very thing youve been the most afraid of  
Youve been doing it from the start breaking your own heart  
  
Too many tears too many falls  
Its easier here behind these walls  
But you dont have to walk in the shadows  
When life is so hard  
  
Youre breaking your own heart  
Taking it too far down a lonely road  
You say its just one love  
But when its close enough you just let it go  
The very thing youve been the most afraid of  
Youve been doing it from the start breaking your own heart  
  
Youre breaking your own heart  
Its not too late Im still right here  
If only you let go of your fears  
  
Youre breaking your heart  
Taking your own heart down a lonely road  
You say its just one love  
But when its close enough you just let it go  
The very thing youve been the most afraid of  
Youve been doing it from the start breaking your own heart  
Youre breaking your own heart
