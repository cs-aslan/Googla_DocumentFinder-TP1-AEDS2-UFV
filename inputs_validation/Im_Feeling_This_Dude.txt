I got no regret right now Im feeling this  
The air is so cold and low Im feeling this  
Let me go in his room Im feeling this  
I want to take off his clothes Im feeling this  
Show me the way to bed Im feeling this  
Show me the way you move Im feeling this  
Fuck it its such a blur Im feeling this  
I love all the things you do Im feeling this  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
Ill leave when I wanna  
  
Where do we go from here  
Turn all the lights down now  
Smiling from ear to ear Im feeling this  
Our breathing has got too loud Im feeling this  
Show me the bedroom floor Im feeling this  
Show me the bathroom mirror Im feeling this  
Were taking this way too slow Im feeling this  
Take me away from here Im feeling this  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
Ill leave when I wanna  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
Ill leave when I wanna  
  
This place was never the same again  
After you came and went  
How can you say you meant anything different  
To anyone standing alone on the street  
With a cigarette on the first night we met  
  
Look to the past and remember your smile  
And maybe tonight I can breathe for awhile  
Im not in this scene I think Im falling asleep  
But then all that it means is Ill always be dreaming of you  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
Ill leave when I wanna  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
Ill leave when I wanna  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
Ill leave when I wanna  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
Ill leave when I wanna  
  
Are we alone do you feel it so lost and disillusioned
