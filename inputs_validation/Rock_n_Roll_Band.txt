Sitting in the darkest corner  
In the tender light I saw her face  
She was looking so sad and lonely  
Someone help me someone save me  
I could see the look she gave me oh  
Oh yeah and there was one thing only  
That I knew I could do  
  
Lets go girl  
Its a beautiful place this world  
Come on baby lets dance  
To the rocknroll band  
Lets go now  
Let me show you that I know how  
Come on baby lets dance  
To the rockn roll band  
Come on baby lets dance  
To the rockn roll band  
Youve been sitting there for hours  
Try to hide behind the flowers now  
Baby we could have fun together  
Come on cheer up lets get started  
No use being brokenhearted now  
Oh yeah youre gonna feel much better  
Yes I know that you will  
  
Lets go girl  
Its a beautiful place this world  
Come on baby lets dance  
To the rockn roll band  
Lets go now  
Let me show you that I know how  
Come on baby lets dance  
To the rockn roll band  
Come on baby lets dance  
To the rockn roll band
