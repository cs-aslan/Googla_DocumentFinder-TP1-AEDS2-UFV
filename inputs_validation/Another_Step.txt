Never ever felt this way before  
You are that one that Im craving for  
Another step nearer your heart  
Another step closer to knowing you  
Another step nearer your heart Im on my way  
I never thought it could happen  
Being close to someone like you  
But you know this isnt just a minute affair  
If we make time and take a lot of care  
As I love everything about it  
Theres such a good feel about it  
And I know where Im gonna be  
If you take a step closer to me  
Another step nearer your heart  
Another step closer to knowing you  
Another step nearer your heart Im on my way  
I couldnt even describe it  
Though I tried I couldnt find the words  
When youre stumbling through life  
And love is one step away  
And you carry on or do you stay  
Weve got to promise faithfully  
To hang on to each other and never leave  
Thats the way loves gonna be  
If you take a step closer to me come on now  
Another step nearer your heart  
Another step closer to knowing you  
Another step nearer your heart Im on my way  
The only way to deal with affairs of the heart  
Youve got to jump right in doesnt matter who starts  
Take a step nearer come over here  
Together we can make it tonight  
Oh we can make it tonight  
Another step another step  
Another step nearer your heart  
Another step closer to knowing you  
Another step nearer your heart Im on my way  
Another step nearer your heart  
Another step closer to knowing you  
Another step nearer your heart Im on my way  
Im on my way Im on my way
