Three million megahertz superduper processors  
Gotta two hundred gig harddrive  
thirtytwo inch screen and a scanner machine  
Boy you wasting too much time  
I say get out of that house  
Pull away from that mouse  
Theres a mountain stream calling your name  
Son you been missing  
Some mighty good fishing  
And a whole lot of better things  
  
Im an American offline  
Im into having a good time  
It does you good to get some sunshine  
Every once in a while  
Get out and drive your 69  
And sip some honky tonk wine  
Hot women in the nighttime  
Im an American offline  
  
I got a cabin in the country where I go sometimes  
To clear my head and get away  
Got my channel on TV no laptop for me  
Cold beer smile on my face  
Now take my advice  
You better think twice  
Before you turn that damn computer up  
Theres so much more to see than that old office routine  
So forget all that logon stuff  
  
Be an American offline  
Go out and have yourself a good time  
Now dont you think you need some sunshine  
On that lily white business suit skin  
Why dont you go and get a beach front room  
Make some noise and wear your hat in the pool  
Make some love in the day time  
Be an American offline

Go and play that slide guitar  
Check out those hot Atlanta bars  
Meet some friends and make some homemade wine til the sunshines  
Im an American offline  
  
Process me baby
