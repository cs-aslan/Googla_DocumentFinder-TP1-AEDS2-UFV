She wont drink and she wont swear  
You cant take her anywhere at all  
She got style but she dont care  
She left me beyond repair before  
Shell pass you by boy  
Shell try you and tie you in knots  
Run for cover  
Cos brother shes calling the shots  
Falling in and falling out  
When you know what shes about youre fine  
You lost both swings and roundabouts  
Cant you see youre running out of time  
Shell pass you by boy  
Shell try you and tie you in knots  
Run for cover  
Cos brother shes calling the shots  
Shell make you cry  
Wave bye bye as she takes what youve got  
Booked another  
And lovers still calling the shots  
Shell pass you by boy  
Shell try you and tie you in knots  
Run for cover  
Cos brother shes calling the shots  
Shell pass you by boy  
Shell try you and tie you in knots  
Run for cover  
Cos brother shes calling the shots
