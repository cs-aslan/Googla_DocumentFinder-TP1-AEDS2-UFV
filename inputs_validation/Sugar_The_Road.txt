Having a good time baby  
Youre having a ball  
Your daddy dont dig what you look like  
Dont dig it at all  
Dont understand  
What youre going through  
No no no no no no he dont  
  
He says theres only one way that you stay alive  
Keep working for your pension till youre sixty five  
Hey no no dont dig it at all  
  
Youve grown up a big girl baby  
Youre doing all right  
You sleep in the daytime baby now  
Youre leaping all night  
Got your own scene  
Said youre doing fine  
My my my doing fine girl  
  
Live like you want let them call you a freak  
Youll be a baby factory when youre married a week  
Oh no no no can you live in a box Get out get out  
  
Youre having a good time baby  
Youre loving your life  
Theres more things ahead now baby  
Than being a wife  
Well I love your mind  
Cause you know its free  
Little darlin  
  
Dont worry about the people who scream and shout  
Just give them fifty years and they might forget it out  
Hey yeah Ive gotta have me a good time  
Darling let it all hang out
