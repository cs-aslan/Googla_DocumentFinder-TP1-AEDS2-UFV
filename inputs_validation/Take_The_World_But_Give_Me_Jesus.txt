Ive thrown it all away that I might gain a life in You  
Ive found all else is loss compared to the joys of knowing You  
Your beauty and Your majesty are far beyond compare  
Youve won my heart now this will be my prayer  
Chorus  
Take the world but give me Jesus  
Youre the treasure in this life  
Take the world but give me Jesus  
Is my cry  
Now Ive seen You as the Savior I will leave the rest behind  
Take the world but give me Jesus is my cry  
Into the world I go that I might live this life of love  
I wont be overcome for You are in me and You are strong  
For time and for eternity I know Im in Your care  
Youve won my heart now this will be my prayer
