I could feel it when we said goodnight  
We both knew it had to end  
We couldnt make it right  
But we still come back again  
Dont be sad cause we gave the best we had  
  
Were better off now better off now  
Maybe we just dont know it  
Better off now better off now  
Maybe this time  
Were better off saying goodbye  
  
I know Ill never feel the same  
After loving you this way  
Id do it all again  
Though I know my heart would break  
Once youve loved like this how do you admit  
  
Were better off now better off now  
Maybe we just dont know it  
Better off now better off now  
Maybe this time  
Were better off saying goodbye  
  
Maybe we just dont know it  
Better off now better off now  
Its hard to realize  
Were better off saying goodbye  
  
Close your eyes and Ill be there  
If you ever think you need me  
  
Were better off now better off now  
Maybe we just dont know it  
Better off now better off now  
Maybe this time  
Were better off saying goodbye
