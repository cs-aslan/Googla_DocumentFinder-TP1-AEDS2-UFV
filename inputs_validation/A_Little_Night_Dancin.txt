Written by John Mellencamp  
  
Well west of Zion  
They got a hot spot brewing  
Handcuffs and kisses  
For the people who live there  
  
Guitar players playing  
Cinderella saying  
Hey boys get that spoon to my nose  
And well run through the midnight air  
  
CHORUS  
Night night whoa night dancin  
Hey just a little little little night dancin  
Night night whoa night dancin  
Hey just a little little little night dancin  
  
Sodom and Gomorah  
They run the roadhouse  
They keep everything jumping  
As the drummer keeps the beat  
  
And its really something when those kids start bitchin  
Yeah it starts me itching  
As I jump to my feet  
  
CHORUS  
CHORUS
