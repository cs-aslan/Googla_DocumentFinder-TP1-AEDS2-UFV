When I get up in the morning  
Got a world of trouble on my mind  
And nothin seems too easy  
When your clocks tickin quarter to five  
Make my way down to the door  
Cant put my troubles on no shelf  
Cause when nobody worries for you  
You got to worry for yourself  
  
Cruisin in my four wheels  
Its got everything I need inside  
Think Ill stop and fill it up for the ride  
Man said that be twenty dollars  
Mister by the way hows your health  
I said mister heres your money  
Now you keep your questions for yourself  
  
And its my life that Im livin  
Wouldnt want to be no one else  
So if you dont like how I dot it  
Ya better keep it to yourself  
Kick it in  
When I get up in the morning  
Got a world of trouble on my mind  
And nothin seems too easy  
When your clocks tickin quarter to nine  
Make my way down to the door  
Cant put my troubles on no shelf  
Cause when nobody worries for you  
You got to worry for yourself  
  
And its my life that Im livin  
Wouldnt want to be no one else  
So if you dont like how I do it  
Ya better keep it to yourself  
  
And its my life that Im livin  
Wouldnt want to be no one else  
So if you dont like how I do it  
Fuckin keep it to yourself
