Its a marshmallow world  
In the winter  
When the snow  
Comes to cover the ground  
Its the time for play  
Its a whipped cream day  
I wait for it all year round  
Those are marshmallow clouds  
Being friendly  
In the arms  
Of the evergreen trees  
And the sun is red  
Like a pumpkin head  
Its shining  
So your nose wont freeze  
The world is your snowball  
See how it grows  
Thats how it goes  
Whenever it snows  
The world is your snowball  
Just for a song  
Get out and roll it along  
  
Its a yumyummy world  
Made for sweethearts  
Take a walk  
With your favorite girl  
Its a sugar date  
What if spring is late  
In winter  
Its a marshmallow world  
  
The world is your snowball  
See how it grows  
Thats how it goes  
Whenever it snows  
The world is your snowball  
Just for a song  
Get out and roll it along  
Its a yumyummy world  
Made for sweethearts  
Take a walk  
With your favorite girl  
Its a sugar date  
What if spring is late  
In winter  
Its a marshmallow world  
In winter  
Its a marshmallow world  
In winter  
Its a marshmallow world
