I saw you walk  
You know you say  
Like a ghost you know to me babe  
Come back boots make you look slick  
Oh now I see you walk home from school  
You got so lost on the way  
You got me feeling like a kid  
But this man is no kid you know  
So Im not goin pull your hair  
I fall so hard inside the idea of you  
Thats why with you cant say what I mean  
Wanna to stay but I think Im gettin outta here  
I fall so hard inside the idea of you  
Aw there you go again  
Oh I dont know  
And I see you walk past with your friends  
Aw and I saw you laugh and whisper  
And I Ill talk I want you here  
But you turn back and smile at me  
Aw you got me feeling ok with that  
So Im not goin pull your hair  
I fall so hard inside the idea of you  
Thats why with you cant say what I mean  
Wanna to stay but I think Im gettin outta here  
I fall so hard inside the idea of you  
Bus stop dreamer  
The late night  
You with me  
Theres something moving  
You cant stop saying that you love me  
You love me you love me  
Enough enough you make me shy  
But baby I wake up  
I saw you  
I fall so hard inside the idea of you  
Thats why with you cant say what I mean  
Wanna to stay but I think Im gettin outta here  
I fall so hard inside the idea of you  
Oh its so go on baby say it
