I could have done better things  
If someone shut my mouth  
Or somebody clipped my wings  
So many wasted evenings  
Talking the same sweet talk  
Always the last ones leaving  
Waking up when fortunes knock  
  
Ive no regrets no I couldnt think of one  
We both kept the road  
The road that we stumbled on  
You and me walking home  
Fighting the morning light  
Just making our way through days  
But making out like thieves at night  
  
I cant help wondering  
Cant help wondering why  
I cant help wondering  
Cant help wondering why  
  
Sometimes you wake up screaming  
All my life I must be dreaming  
Ive been wrong  
And Im not strong  
But Ill be the one that keeps rolling on  
  
Born to this generation  
Never made to wait  
Looking like fools sometimes  
A couple of blind men at the gate  
  
I cant help wondering  
Cant help wondering why  
I cant help wondering  
Cant help wondering why
