Every time  
We have a fight  
We flip a coin  
To see whos right  
  
Why do we have to gamble just to see whos right  
Why cant we arbitrarily resolve a fight  
But with youre style of gamblin theres no chance to win  
Thats how it is and thats the way its always been  
  
Heads you win  
Tails I lose  
Heads you win  
Tails I lose  
Bad news  
  
If we were playing cards youd be the one to deal  
Youd play with loaded dice and fix the roulette wheel  
You pick em at the races like Ive never seen  
And then you make me pay off like a slot machine  
  
Heads you win  
Tails I lose  
Heads you win  
Tails I lose  
Bad news  
  
Oh well match me honey match me honey
