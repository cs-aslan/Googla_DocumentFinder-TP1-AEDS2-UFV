Heres a little trap  
That sometimes catches everyone  
When todays as far as we can see  
Faith in bright tomorrows  
Giving way to resignation  
Thats how it is  how its going to be  
  
Its such a cloudy day  
Seems well never see the sun  
Or feel the day has possibilities  
Frozen in the moment   
The lack of imagination  
Between how it is and how it ought to be  
  
Heres a little trap  
That sometimes trips up everyone  
When we tire of our own company  
Sometimes were the last to see beyond the days frustrations  
Thats how it is  how its going to be  
  
Its such a cloudy day  
Seems well never see the sun  
I feel the day is all uncertainty  
Burning in the moment  trapped by the desperation  
Between how it is and how it ought to be  
  
Foot upon the stair  
Shoulder to the wheel  
You cant tell yourself not to care  
You cant tell yourself how to feel  
  
Thats how it is  
Another cloudy day
