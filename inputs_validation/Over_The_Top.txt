Down in the city  
Where the girls look pretty  
Some just like a miracle  
  
Theyre so attractive  
So hyperactive  
But theyre cool and they talk cynical  
  
Give me a chance  
I dont want romance  
Dont be so serious oh nooo  
  
Lets get some action  
Some real satisfaction  
Youre so mysterious  
I cant wait any longer  
  
Tonights the night  
I want you to show me baby  
Tonights the night  
Now is the time the time to go over the top  
  
Youre running me down  
And dont you ever stop messing around over the top  
Youre running me down  
And dont you ever stop messing around  
  
Move around around around  
  
Down in the city  
Where the girls are pretty  
Some just like a miracle  
  
Oooh Im on the road  
Get out of control  
Im losing my mind  
Its time to get wild  
  
Tonights the night  
I want you to show me baby  
Tonights the night  
Now is the time the time to go over the top  
  
Youre running me down  
And dont you ever stop messing around over the top  
Youre running me down  
And dont you ever stop messing around over the top  
  
Youre running me down  
And dont you ever stop messing around over the top  
Youre running me down  
And dont you ever stop messing around  
  
Move around around around  
  
Tonights the night  
I want you to show me baby  
Tonights the night  
Now is the time the time to go over the top  
  
Youre running me down  
And dont you ever stop messing around over the top  
Youre running me down  
And dont you ever stop messing around over the top  
  
Youre running me down  
And dont you ever stop messing around over the top  
Youre running me down  
And dont you ever stop messing around  
  
Move around around around
