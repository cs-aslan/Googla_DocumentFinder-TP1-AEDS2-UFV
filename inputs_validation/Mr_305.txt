To all the djs out there I appreciate the love  
Lets show em why Pitbull one of the rawest Mr 305  
Im one of the best one of the rawest  
Nah I aint perfect but bitch Im flawless  
Nah I aint stupid but the flow is retarded  
Barely made high school the streets was my college  
Rappin here for years workin and grindin  
On the streets if you copped it I supplied it  
Ive worked everything every drug you name it  
Ive seen families get tied up for missin payments  
Keep thinking that this thing is just entertainment  
Disrepect get introduced to the pavement  
Catch me somewhere on the islands of Caymen  
Me I see the future yall boys cavemen  
Now its cartoons and tv shows  
First album gold remix did for El Mariel in stores  
I hustle I hustle I grind I grind  
Thats why they call me Mr 305
