Come stop your crying  
It will be all right  
Just take my hand and hold on tight  
I will protect you from all around you  
I will be here dont you cry  
  
For one so small you seem so strong  
My arms on hold you keep you safe and warm  
This bond between us cant be broken  
I will be here dont you cry  
  
Cause youll be in my heart  
Yes youll be in my heart  
From this day on  
Now and forever more

Always  
  
Sometimes we cant express the way we feel  
You learn to trust but you cant explain  
We may seem different but deep inside us  
Were not that different at all  
  
Cause youll be in my heart  
Yes youll be in my heart  
From this day on  
Now and forever more  
  
No matter what happens  
Theres one thing I know  
Weve got each other  
To help us grow  
Youll see in time  
I know  
I know  
  
When destiny calls you you must be strong  
I may not be with you so you gotta hold on  
Youll see in time  
I know  
  
Well always be together cause  
  
Youll be in my heart  
Always youll be in my heart  
From this day on  
Now and forever more  
  
Oooh Youll be in my heart  
No matter what they say
