one two three four  
  
Found myself out on a limb  
But Im happier than Ive ever been  
But this guitar cant keep from crying  
  
Learned to get up when I fall  
Can even climb rolling stone walls  
But this guitar cant keep from crying  
  
This here guitar can feel quite sad  
Can be high strung sometimes get mad  
Cant understand or deal with hate  
Responds much better to love  
  
I though by now you knew the score  
But you missed the point just like before  
And this guitar cant keep from crying  
  
this guitar it cant keep from crying  
This guitar cant keep from crying  
  
This here guitar can feel quite sad  
Can be high strung sometimes get mad  
It cant understand or deal with hate  
Responds much better to love  
  
While you attack create offence  
Ill put it down to your ignorance  
But this guitar it cant keep from crying  
This guitar cant keep from crying  
  
This guitar cant keep from crying  
This guitar cant keep from crying
