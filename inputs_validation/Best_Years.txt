Somebody help me  
Im feeling low  
Ive been down for so long  
Dont know which way to go  
Drowning in sorrow  
In deep misery  
Someone throw me a line  
Im clean out of time  
Lord Ive got to break free  
  
You came along like a sun in the night  
Took me out of the shadows  
Into the light  
  
Caught in a crossfire  
Of heartache and pain  
Searching so many years  
Thro a river of tears  
Always shot down in flames  
  
You came along like a sun in the night  
Took me out of the shadows  
Into the light  
  
Chorus  
Now these are the best years  
Truly the best years of my life  
The best years of my life  
  
Bad luck and trouble  
Everyday of my life  
Every lonely lonely night  
Like a cold hearted twist of the knife  
  
You came along like a sun in the night  
Took me out of the shadows  
Into the light  
  
Chorus  
  
Somebody help me  
Im feeling low  
Ive been down so long  
Babe Ive got to let go  
  
You came along like a sun in the night  
Took me out of the shadows  
Into the light  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeats Til Fade  
The best years of my life
