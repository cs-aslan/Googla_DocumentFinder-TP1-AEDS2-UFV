Hey you hey you Devils little sister  
Listening to your twisted transistor  
Hold it between your legs  
Turn it up turn it up  
The wind is coming through  
Cant get enough  
  
Chorus  
A lonely life where no one understands you  
But dont give up because the music do  
Music do  
Music do  
Music do  
Music do  
Music do  
Music do  
  
Because the music do  
And then it its reaching  
Inside you forever preaching  
Fuck you too  
Your screams will whisper  
Hang on you  
Twisted transistor  
  
Hey you hey you finally you get it  
The world it can eat you if you let it  
And as your tears fall on  
Your dress your dress  
But when shes coming through  
Youre in a mess  
  
Chorus  
  
Because the music do  
And then it its reaching  
Inside you forever preaching  
Fuck you too  
Your screams will whisper  
Hang on you  
Twisted transistor  
Music do  
Music do  
Music do  
Music do  
  
Hey you hey you this wont hurt a bit  
This wont hurt a bit this wont hurt  
Says who Says who  
Anesthetize this bitch  
Anesthetize this bitch Im not the time  
Just let me be  
Between you and them things  
  
Because the music do  
And then it its reaching  
Inside you forever preaching  
Fuck you too  
Your screams will whisper  
Hang on you  
Twisted transistor
