Good evening people welcome to the show  
Got something here I want you all to know  
When laughin people bring on primal screams  
You got to think of what its gonna take to make your dreams  
Make it  
Dont break it  
I said make it  
Dont break it  
Do then ya feel like the worlds coming down on you  
You know that history repeats itself  
But you just learned so by somebody else  
You know you do you gotta think up fast  
You gotta figure what its gonna take to make it last  
Make it  
Dont fake it  
Said make it  
Dont fake it  
Better weather pull yourself together  
Dont be catchin the blues  
Better weather pull yourself together  
What have you got to lose  
Youre only paying your dues  
If youre gone Ill get you anyway  
Although you know what youve been going through
