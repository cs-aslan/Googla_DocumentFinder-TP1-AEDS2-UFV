I was backstage at a festival in Germany  
talking to a cute fair skinned brunette  
I asked her if she wanted to have a beer and if she liked our set  
I noticed that her hair was longer in the back  
I figure thats cause shes Canadian  
Thats why I was surprised when she told me she was fully lesbian  
  
Thats when I realized it was Sara or maybe it was Tegan  
Im pretty sure that it was Sara  
Cause Johnny Sampson said she was the cooler one  
  
I told her I was a big fan of her band  
She asked me if I had a favorite song  
I admitted that Id never actually heard them but I like kd lang  
  
I told her this Jew knows about the Junos  
And how they got robbed three times in a row  
And then I asked her if she knew of anyone who was selling pills or blow  
  
Thats when I creeped out Sara or maybe I just pissed her off  
When I asked her if her sister and her had ever had a threesome  
Where they both ganged up one girl a forgy or a five some  
Do they think strapons are groovy and had they ever seen the movie  
Bound and did they like Jennifer Tilly did they like Jennifer Tilly  
  
Sara said she preferred Gina Gershon Angelina Jolie  
In the Gia movie that was on HBO  
And If These Walls Could Talk made Tegan cry a lot  
After that I forgot what she said  
Thats the problem with Diazepam so many things I dont remember  
But Ive got a sinking feeling its not that Im a clairvoyant  
  
But I think that I creeped out Sara I was creeping out on Sara  
I hope it wasnt Tegan cause Matt Skiba said she is the cooler one
