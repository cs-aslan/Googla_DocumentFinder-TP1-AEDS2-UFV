Im not what youve sized me up to be inside your head  
No way you could ever see me how I really am  
Be careful what you say  
Because some things never change  
Its such a waste of time but its so strange  
Youre only right when somethings wrong  
  
Youve tried to give me everything that I could never have  
I thought that you were trying to improve upon yourself  
Be careful what you say  
Because some things never change  
Its such a waste of time but its so strange  
Youre only right when somethings wrong  
  
Are you ready to do something about it  
Or is it already too late  
Ive given up everything  
It hasnt changed a single thing  
Are you ready to do something about it  
Or will you take the easy way  
I can already see you start to disappear  
The takeaway
