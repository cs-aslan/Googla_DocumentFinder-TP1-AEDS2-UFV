Little girl lost  
In a forest of dreams  
Its a dark old wood  
And its damp with dew  
Hoot owl hoots  
For a moment it seems  
Something big and cold  
Got a hold of you  
Just when everything gets scary  
Daddys come round for his darlin again  
Hold my hand with your little fingers  
Daddys loving arms gonna gather you in  
  
Aint no way the bogeyman can get you  
You can close your eyes the world is gonna let you  
Your daddys here and never will forget you  
I will take you home  
I will take you home  
Gonna carry you back home  
In my arms  
I will take you home  
  
Long is the road  
We must travel on down  
Short are the legs  
That will struggle behind  
I wish i knew for sure  
Just where were bound  
What we will be doin  
And what were gonna find  
Wherever we go there will be birds to cheer you  
Flowers to color in the fields around  
Wherever we go Ill be right here near you  
You cant get lost when youre always found  
  
Aint no fog thats thick enough to hide you  
Your daddys gonna be right here beside you  
If your fears should start to get inside you  
I will take you home  
I will take you home  
Gonna carry you back home  
In my arms  
I will take you home
