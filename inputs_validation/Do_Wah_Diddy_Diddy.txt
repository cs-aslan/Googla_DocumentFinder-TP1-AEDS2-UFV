There she was  
Just awalkin down the street  
Singin  
Dowah diddydiddy down diddydo  
Poppin her fingers  
And shufflin her feet  
Singin  
Dowah diddydiddy down diddydo  
She looked good  
She looked fine  
She looked good she looked fine  
And I nearly lost my mind  
Before I knew it  
She was walkin next to me  
Singin  
Dowah diddydiddy down diddydo  
She took my hand  
Just as natural as can be  
Singin  
Dowah diddydiddy down diddydo  
We walked on  
To my door  
We walked on to my door  
Then we kissed a little more  
I knew we were falling in love  
I told her all the things  
That Id been dreamin of  
Now were together  
Nearly every single day  
Singin  
Dowah diddydiddy down diddydo  
Were so happy  
And that how were gonna stay  
Singin  
Dowah diddydiddy down diddydo  
Im hers  
Shes mine  
Well Im hers shes mine  
Wedding bells are gonna chime  
I knew we were falling in love  
I told her all the things  
That Id been dreamin of  
Were togther  
Nearly every single day  
Singin  
Dowah diddydiddy down diddydo  
And were so happy  
And that how were gonna stay  
Singin  
Dowah diddydiddy down diddydo  
Im hers  
Shes mine  
Im hers shes mine  
Wedding bells are gonna chime  
Dowah diddydiddy down diddydo
