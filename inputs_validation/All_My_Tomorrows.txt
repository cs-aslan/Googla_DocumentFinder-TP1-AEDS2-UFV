Today I may not have a thing at all except for just a dream or two  
But Ive got lots of plans for tomorrow and all my tomorrows belong to you  
Right now it may not seem like spring at all were drifting and the laughs are
few  
But Ive got rainbows planned for tomorrow and all my tomorrows belong to you  
No one knows better than I that love keeps passing me by that way  
But with you there at my side Ill soon be turning the tide just away  
As long as Ive got arms to cling at all its you Ill be clinging to  
And all the dreams I dream beg or borrow on some bright tomorrow will all come
true  
And all my tomorrows belong to you  
As long as Ive got arms to cling at all
