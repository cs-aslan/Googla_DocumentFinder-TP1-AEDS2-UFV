I tried to let it go  
But Im addicted to your chemicals  
I got a piece I want an overdose  
I love the way she gets so physical  
Fucks like an animal  
  
In night I just imagine how you put your love on me  
Lights off lighted on  
Ready for some action  
Baby come and give it to me  
  
Cause Im a freak  
The way youre poppin and droppin  
All over me  
No I dont want you to stop it  
Yeah Im a freak  
Baby I cant lie  
When you move like that  
I got a one track mark  
Cause Im a freak  
Yeah Im a freak  
Cause Im a freak  
Yeah Im a freak  
  
Yeah baby there you go lets go  
Stealing my heart just like a criminal  
No turning back this time is critical  
You move your body like a miracle  
Baby here we go  
  
In night I just imagine how you put your love on me  
Lights off lighted on  
Ready for some action  
Baby come and give it to me  
  
Cause Im a freak  
The way youre poppin and droppin  
All over me  
No I dont want you to stop it  
Yeah Im a freak  
Baby I cant lie  
When you move like that  
I got a one track mark  
Cause Im a freak  
Yeah Im a freak  
Cause Im a freak  
Yeah Im a freak  
  
Baby you pop and lock it  
Drop it I watch it for sure  
Baby you rollin and rocking  
Move it I use it lets go  
You know I leak it and do the things that they make you explode  
You dont believe me mami just let me go low  
Because Im a freak thats a no  
Now can I get big big big baby back it up nice and slow  
I just wanna skip skip skip ride out and go  
I came I saw I conquered on to the next lets go  
  
Yeah Im a freak  
The way youre poppin and droppin  
All over me  
No I dont want you to stop it  
Yeah Im a freak  
Baby I cant lie  
When you move like that  
I got a one track mark  
Cause Im a freak  
Yeah Im a freak  
Cause Im a freak  
Yeah Im a freak  
  
Its The Cataracs  
  
From the hotel room to the DJ booth  
On the bathroom seat yes Im just a freak  
And when the sun goes down gotta let it out  
Baby dont blame me Im just a freak
