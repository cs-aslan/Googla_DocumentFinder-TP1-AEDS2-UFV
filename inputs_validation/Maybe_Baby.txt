Maybe baby Ill have you  
Maybe baby youll be true  
Maybe baby Ill have you for me  
  
Its funny honey you dont care  
You never listen to my prayer  
Maybe baby Ill have you for me  
  
Well you are the one that makes me glad  
And you are the one that makes me sad  
When someday you want me oh well  
Ill be there wait and see  
  
Maybe baby Ill have you  
Maybe baby youll be true  
Maybe baby Ill have you for me  
  
Well you are the one that makes me glad  
And you are the one that makes me sad  
When someday you want me oh well  
Ill be there wait and see  
  
Maybe baby Ill have you  
Maybe baby youll be true  
Maybe baby Ill have you for me  
  
Maybe baby ooh
