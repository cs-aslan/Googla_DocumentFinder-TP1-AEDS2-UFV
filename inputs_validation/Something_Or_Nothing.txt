Theres never a day  
When Ive got nothing to do  
Something to me  
Might mean nothing to you  
  
So dont dont dont dont  
Look at me strangely now  
Well find the line  
Thats in the middle and run  
  
Something something or nothing  
  
You say you love to spend days  
But I will save mine  
Waiting for the sun in your eyes  
To turn the river to wine  
  
But dont dont dont dont  
Look at me strangely now  
Were gonna find the line  
Thats in the middle and run
