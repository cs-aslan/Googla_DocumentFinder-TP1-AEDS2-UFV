South of the border  
American dollars  
Take you a long long way  
Beach side bungalow  
Sand between your toes  
Nobody knows your name  
  
Theres a worm at the bottom of a bottle  
Thats well within my reach  
And the heart that you broke will soon be a joke  
As soon as he and I meet  
  
Chorus  
Oh forgettins cheap in Mexico  
Shell be there waitin and she wont say no  
Tequila loves me  
Even if you dont  
  
Madame tequilas a fine senorita  
All my compadres conquer  
She wont lie she wont leave  
In your hour of need  
So were raisin our glasses to her  
  
They say vamos ay charlo delgado  
It means drink it all down til you see  
The bottom of the glass and its kickin your ass  
Boys the next rounds on me  
  
Chorus Repeat 3X  
Oh forgettins cheap in Mexico  
Shell be there waitin and she wont say no  
Tequila loves me  
Even if you dont
