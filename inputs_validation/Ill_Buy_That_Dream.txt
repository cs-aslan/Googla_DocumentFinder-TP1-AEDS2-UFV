Imagine me with my head on your shoulder  
And you with your lips getting bolder  
A sky full of moon and a sweet mellow tune  
Ill buy that dream  
Imagine you in a gown white and flowery  
And you thanking Dad for your dowry  
A church full of folks and those last minute jokes  
Ill buy that dream  
A honeymoon in Cairo with a brand new auto gyro  
When home I rocket in a wink  
Well settle down at Dallas in a little low crazy palace  
Oh its not as crazy as you think  
Imagine me on our first anniversary  
With some one like you in the nursery  
It doesnt sound bad and if it can be had  
Ill buy that dream  
A honeymoon in Cairo in a brand new auto gyro  
When home I rocket in a wink  
Well settle down at Dallas in a little coocoo palace  
Its not as crazy as you think  
Imagine me on our first anniversary  
With some one like you in the nursery  
It dont sound bad and if it can be had  
Ill buy that dream
