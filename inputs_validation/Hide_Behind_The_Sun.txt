Tonight everything but me  
Taken out to sea  
All gone  
A wish written in the sand  
Washed away tomorrow  
This time  
Look what Ive become  
  
Didnt run  
Run from what youd done  
Didnt hide behind the sun  
  
And I wanted everything  
Salted you could bring me  
Daylight  
A dream burning in the sky  
Leaves my spirit dry  
And you lied  
Now look what Ive become  
  
Didnt run  
Run from what youd done  
Didnt hide behind the sun  
Couldnt run  
Lost in what youd done  
Look what Ive become  
  
This time  
Look what Ive become  
Didnt run  
Run from what youd done  
Didnt hide behind the sun  
Couldnt run  
Lost in what youd done  
Look what Ive become
