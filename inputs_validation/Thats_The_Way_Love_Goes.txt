Like a moth to a flame  
Burned by the fire  
My love is blind  
Cant you see my desire  
  
Thats the way love goes  
  
Come with me dont you worry  
Im gonna make you crazy  
Ill give you the time of your life  
Im gonna take you places  
Youve never been before and  
Youll be so happy that you came  
Oh Im gonna take you there  
  
Chorus  
  
Thats the way love goes  
  
Dont mind if I light candles  
I like to watch us play and  
Baby Ive got on what you like  
Come closer baby closer  
Reach out and feel my body  
Im gonna give you all my love  
Oh sugar dont you hurry  
Youve got me here all night  
Just close your eyes and hold on tight  
Oh baby dont stop dont stop  
Go deeper baby deeper  
You feel so good Im gonna cry  
Oh Im gonna take you there  
  
Repeat Chorus
