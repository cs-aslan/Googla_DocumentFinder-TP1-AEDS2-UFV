Big Will the high roller  
Strolling through with an entoruage  
Hard to camaflouge when you livin this large  
I be smooth like debarge with a five car garage  
  
Out for the night with my squad and we be flossin down the fifteen  
My whole auroa gleamin  
Who that kid in the green v  
Envy brother schemin  
  
I aint thinkin bout them  
Racing chicks in the pink bm  
With my speakers tweakin  
Freakin off this weekend  
  
In Las Vegas boss players all across the board move makers and shakers  
Money cant break us but the places it can take us  
Big will in the limelight rhyme tight  
And we goin have some fun tonight  
  
Repeat x2  
Now how we do it  
you know its Big Willie style baby  
Now how we doin it  
you know its Big Willie style  
  
Im in a five star casino shuttin crap tables down boom  
Non bettin willie watchers standin around  
Strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes lookin at us  
How bad they want to be us parlay  
  
Charlie Mack got my back with his eyes on my stack  
Brothers dont know how to act when you drive a fourfive black  
People stop and stare havin drinks at the bar  
A round for everybody with these big willie cards  
  
From civllians to stars they want to know who we are  
Its me big Will Nas Escobar JL Omar  
Carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to exit  
  
Chorus  
  
Its Left Eye with a tight crew  
Representin like its ladies night  
Comin right through  
Dont be spiteful  
  
Plus an eyeful  
Sportin hot pink  
Rocks in the link  
In the drop with a mink  
  
Like my shit dont stink  
Got you in the palm with a bomb like Sadamm  
Blowing up spots then runnin off with the pot  
Left Eye ready for action  
  
The main attraction  
Im in the fast lane passin  
Breakin you down like fractions  
While we be rappin about things that really happen  
  
Big willie style Philly style lets make it happen  
With mademouselle from gezals to versace  
With a sweet smell  
This female leadin the posse  
  
Got jokes like Cosby  
In the lots where the cars be  
With no apologies its Left Eye  
Big Will let the champagne spill  
  
Is it a mans thing for real  
Can us girls roll wit yall  
What the deal  
  
Chorus  
  
Well now its lookin like a car show  
Convoys and whips on the strip  
Pullin up in the six makin brothers sick  
For real  
  
Big Will household name  
Entertainer  
Gold handle cane and matchin gators  
Swervin lane  
  
In pole position rolling deep like a comalition  
In soul position and can rock a whole convention  
Movie screens to the club scene  
My whole crew lookin clean  
  
Shine with a diamond gleam  
Step above where the players be  
Dont hate me  
One is where they rate me  
  
Lately you could find me  
Behind the door marked VIP  
Eating grapes under the AC  
Big willie style is how we do it  
  
Chorus  
  
This one goes out to all the big willies
