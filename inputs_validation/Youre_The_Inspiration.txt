You know our love was meant to be  
The kind of love that lasts forever  
And I need you here with me  
From tonight until the end of time  
  
You should know everywhere I go  
Youre always on my mind in my heart  
In my soul  
  
Youre the meaning in my life  
Youre the inspiration  
You bring feeling to my life  
Youre the inspiration  
want to have you near me  
I want to have you hear me sayin  
No one needs you more than I need you  
  
And I know yes I know that its plain to see  
Were so in love when were together  
And I know that I need you here with me  
From tonight until the end of time  
  
You should know everywhere I go  
Always on my mind in my heart  
In my soul  
  
Youre the meaning in my life  
Youre the inspiration  
You bring feeling to my life  
Youre the inspiration  
want to have you near me  
I want to have you hear me sayin  
No one needs you more than I need you  
  
Youre the meaning in my life  
Youre the inspiration  
You bring feeling to my life  
Youre the inspiration  
want to have you near me  
I want to have you hear me sayin  
No one needs you more than I need you
