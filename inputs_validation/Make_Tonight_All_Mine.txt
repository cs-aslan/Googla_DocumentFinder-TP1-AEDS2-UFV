Oh baby now Ive been watchin you girl  
When you dance you steal the show  
Just like you stole my heart  
When the lights were low  
All the guys are waiting  
Pleading just to hold you tight  
Oh darling no no no please not tonight  
  
Cause now youre in my arms girl  
You thrill my soul  
Cmon hold me close  
Rock me slow  
Baby never let me go  
  
CHORUS  
Oh baby make tonight all mine  
I can make you happy  
Just gimme a try  
Oh Ive waited such a long long time  
Make tonight all mine  
Baby I  
Can satisfy you  
Gonna lectrify you  
Cmon let me prove it  
Show you I can do it  
  
Ive been walkin like a shadow  
Right behind you by myself  
While youve been walking home  
With someone else  
Dont you know it hurts me  
Seeing you with other guys  
Oh darling no no no please not tonight  
  
When the partys over let me walk you home  
Ill hold you close  
Rock you slow  
Never never let you go  
  
Oh baby make tonight all mine  
I can make you happy  
Just gimme a try  
Oh Ive waited such a long long time  
Make tonight all mine  
Baby I  
Oh all all mine mine mine mine yeah

Oh Ive waited such a long long time
