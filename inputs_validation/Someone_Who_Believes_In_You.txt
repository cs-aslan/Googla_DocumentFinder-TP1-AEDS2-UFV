When theres a dark storm on your horizon  
And you think you cant get through it  
Just put your hand in my hand  
And Ill show you how to do it  
When the future looks uncertain  
You can count on me to be there  
And when your heart and soul are hurtin  
Just look and youll see me there  
Just follow where I lead  
Ill give you what you need  
A love thats always true  
And someone who believes in you  
So when youre searching for that rainbow  
I will help you find it  
And when a mountain stands before you  
I will help you climb it  
Just follow where I lead  
Ill give you what you need  
A love thats always true  
And someone who believes in you  
Its time to come alive  
Your moment has arrived  
Ill bring out the best in you  
We can have it all  
No we will never fall  
Looking down from our celestial view  
Just follow where I lead  
Ill give you what you need  
And Ill tell you something else  
Youll start believing in yourself  
Its an easy thing to do  
When you have someone who believes in you  
Someone who believes  
Someone who believes  
Im someone who believes  
And youve got someone who believes in you
