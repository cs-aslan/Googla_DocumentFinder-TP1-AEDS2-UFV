Dont need you

Dont trust anyone around cant stand you

I wasnt born for lovin I was born to raise hell  
I wasnt born for lovin I was born to raise hell  
  
I hate you and I hate this town  
I mean you and this pitiful town  
I hate you you just make me laugh  
  
I wasnt born for lovin I was born to raise hell  
I wasnt born for lovin I was born to raise hell

Its such a pity now you want me to go Go  
  
A lot of talk not enough action  
Lot of lies but no real reaction  
Lot of ways but no real emotion  
  
I wasnt born for lovin I was born to raise hell  
I wasnt born for lovin I was born to raise hell  
  
I hate you you like me No  
You like our music now dont yah No  
Its such a pity now you want me to go Go

Love your makeup  
Love your nose  
Love your eyes  
Love your clothes  
Youre pretty useless  
  
I hate you and I hate this town  
I mean you and this pitiful town  
I hate you you just make me laugh  
  
I wasnt born for lovin I was born to raise hell  
I wasnt born for lovin I was born to raise hell  
  
I hate you you like me No  
You like our music now dont you No  
Its such a pity now you want me to go Go  
  
I was born to raise hell
