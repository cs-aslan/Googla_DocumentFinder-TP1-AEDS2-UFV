I dont want your money  
It dont mean a thing  
I dont need no fancy clothes  
Or a diamond ring  
I dont have to ride in style  
In your limousine  
I dont want no trouble  
Tax or Uncle Sam  
All I want is you  
I want to be your natural man  
I dont need your prestige  
Cause I got my pride  
I dont want your social standing  
Id rather stand outside  
I dont have no time to worry  
Bout your greedy jive  
I dont want your money  
I dont like that game  
All I want is you  
I want to be your natural man
