Im just asittin in the balcony  
Just awatchin the movie  
Or maybe its a symphony I wouldnt know  
I dont care about the symphonies  
Just acymballs and atimpanies  
  
Im just asittin in the balcony on the very last row  
Ill hold your hand and Ill kiss you too  
The features over but were not through  
Just asittin in the balcony  
  
Holdin hands in the balcony  
Just asittin in the balcony on the very last row  
  
We may stop lovin to watch Bugs Bunny  
But he cant take the place of my honey  
Just asittin in the balcony  
Just asnootchin in the balcony  
  
Just asittin in the balcony on the very last row  
Just ahuggin and akissin  
With my baby in the very last row
