From the way that you acted  
To the way that I felt it  
It wasnt worth my time  
And now its sad cause all I missed  
Wasnt that good to begin with  
And now Ive started you begging  
Saying things that you dont mean  
It isnt worth my time  
A lines a dime a million times  
And Im about to see all of them  
  
Goodbye to you  
Youre taking up my time  
  
You call my name when I wake up  
To see things go your way  
Im coughing up my time  
Each drags a drop of blood a grain  
A minute of my life  
Its all Ive got just to stay down  
Why the fuck am I still down  
Im hoarding all thats mine  
Each time I let just one slip by  
Im wasting what is mine  
  
Im about to see a million things  
I thought Id never see before and I  
Im about to do all the things Ive dreamed of  
And I dont even miss you at all
