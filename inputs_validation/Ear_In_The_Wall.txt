Hello can you hear me I might not be alone  
Dont see anyone near me but I just wont go home again  
Lets meet in the morning I just cant speak tonight  
This is more than a warning be silent till its light  
  
And then you know Ill be there waiting for someone to believe me  
Remembering it all makes my flesh start to crawl  
Ive seen an ear in the wall  
  
This time it could prove it but youve heard this all before  
Cry wolf and youre moving to a special kind of danger zone  
I need a witness somebody just like you  
So bring an exorcist a wizard and the holy ghost  
  
You know Ill be there waiting for someone to believe me  
Remembering it all makes my flesh creep and crawl  
Ive seen an ear in the wall  
  
One more reason one more time  
Someones searching through my mind  
Now where am I supposed to go  
Its not who you are its who you know  
Whats it gonna be  
  
I knew you would answer Im the curiosity  
You could miss a chance because the fool might see reality  
There it is in the corner you must be going blind  
Whats wrong Were you born before your God invented eyes  
  
Its got to be there grinding away at my secrets  
Its growing so dark and you cant see it all  
Ill turn on some lights so youre sure not to fall  
Its next to the eye in the wall
