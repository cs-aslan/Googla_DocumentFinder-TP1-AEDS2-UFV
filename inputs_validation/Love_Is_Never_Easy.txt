Love should be easy  
Its such a natural thing  
Nothing feels like the feeling  
Only love can bring  
  
Love can be laughter  
Or heartaches in disguise  
You could love a lifetime  
And never realize  
  
Chorus  
Love is never easy  
Dreams are always hard to hold  
Love is never easy  
But its more precious than gold  
More precious than gold  
More precious than gold  
  
Love is forever  
Until the day that it ends  
Love can just be for lovers  
Love can be for friends  
  
So dont give up looking  
And dont be afraid to fall  
Cause when you find that one love  
Youll know its worth it all
