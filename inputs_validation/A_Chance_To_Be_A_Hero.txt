When I was young at heart I never had much money  
But I never let faith depart I kept it right beside me  
When I was only seventeen I knew just what I wanted to be  
On the stage on the front page with the spotlight shining  
The spotlight shining on me  
Take a chance to be a hero a chance to play in this game  
A chance to be somebody who youre gonna recognize my name  
A chance to be a hero a shot at the big time  
A chance to be somebody new a chance to be a hero  
Funny how time can fly right through you fingers  
When the parade passes by you know its too late then  
When your lifelong fantasy floats underneath the door  
Down the stairs out on the street it wont be coming back  
It wont be coming back anymore  
Take a chance to be a hero a chance to play in this game  
A chance to be somebody who youre gonna recognize my name  
A chance to be a hero a shot at the big time  
A chance to be somebody new a chance to be a hero  
When your lifelong fantasy floats underneath the door  
Down the stairs out on the street it wont be coming back  
It wont be coming back anymore  
Take a chance to be a hero a chance to play in this game  
A chance to be somebody who youre gonna recognize my name  
A chance to be a hero a shot at the big time  
A chance to be somebody new I only wanna be  
Only wanna be I wanna be a hero
