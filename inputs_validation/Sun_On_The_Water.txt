Sun on the water  
Making it hard to see  
Sun on the water  
Lapping around my feet  
  
Sun on the water  
Making it hard to see  
Sun on the water  
Lapping around my feet  
  
A farmers daughter  
Living a long time ago  
She had a notion  
To go where the rivers flow  
  
Farmers daughter  
Walked for a year and a day  
When she reached the ocean  
Grew a tail and swam away  
  
It was the place where she felt free  
And Heaven lies under the sea  
Hell is just dry land to me  
When Im dreaming  
  
Sun on the water  
Lapping around my feet  
Sun on the water  
Making it hard to see  
  
Sun on the water  
Lapping around my feet  
Sun on the water  
Making it hard to see  
  
I want to be the one to say  
Im happy here and here Ill stay  
I wont remember yesterday  
When Im dreaming  
  
It was the place where she felt free  
And Heaven lies under the sea  
Hell is just dry land to me  
When Im dreaming
