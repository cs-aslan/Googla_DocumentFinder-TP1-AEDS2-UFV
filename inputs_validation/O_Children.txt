Pass me that lovely little gun  
My dear my darling one  
The cleaners are coming one by one  
You dont even want to let them start  
  
They are knocking now upon your door  
They measure the room they know the score  
Theyre mopping up the butchers floor  
Of your broken little hearts  
  
O children  
  
Forgive us now for what weve done  
It started out as a bit of fun  
Here take these before we run away  
The keys to the gulag  
  
O children  
Lift up your voice lift up your voice  
Children  
Rejoice rejoice  
  
Come on come on  
Come on come on  
  
Here comes Frank and poor old Jim  
Theyre gathering round with all my friends  
Were older now the light is dim  
And you are only just beginning  
  
O children  
  
We have the answer to all your fears  
Its short its simple its crystal clear  
Its round about its somewhere here  
Lost amongst our winnings  
  
O children  
Lift up your voice lift up your voice  
Children  
Rejoice rejoice  
  
The cleaners have done their job on you  
Theyre hip to it man theyre in the groove  
Theyve hosed you down youre good as new  
And theyre lining up to inspect you  
  
O children  
  
Poor old Jims white as a ghost  
Hes found the answer that we lost  
Were all weeping now weeping because  
There aint nothing we can do to protect you  
  
O children  
Lift up your voice lift up your voice  
Children  
Rejoice rejoice  
  
Hey little train Were jumping on  
The train that goes to the Kingdom  
Were happy Ma were having fun  
And the train aint even left the station  
  
Hey little train Wait for me  
I once was blind but now I see  
Have you left a seat for me  
Is that such a stretch of the imagination  
  
Hey little train Wait for me  
I was held in chains but now Im free  
Im hanging in there dont you see  
In this process of elimination  
  
Hey little train Were jumping on  
The train that goes to the Kingdom  
Were happy Ma were having fun  
Its beyond my wildest expectation  
  
Hey little train Were jumping on  
The train that goes to the Kingdom  
Were happy Ma were having fun  
And the train aint even left the station
