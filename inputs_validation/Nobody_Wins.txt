Any more it doesnt matter  
Whos right or wrong  
Weve been injuring each other  
For much too long  
And its too late to try to save  
What might have been  
Its over  
Nobody wins  
  
Make believin in forever  
Is just a lie  
And it seems a little sadder  
Each time we try  
Cause its a shame to make  
The same mistakes again  
And again  
Its over  
Nobody wins  
  
Weve gone too far too long  
Too far apart  
The lovin was easy  
Its the livin thats hard  
And theres no need to stay and see  
The way it ends  
Its over  
Nobody wins
