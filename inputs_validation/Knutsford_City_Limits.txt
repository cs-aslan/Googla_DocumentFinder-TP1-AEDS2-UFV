You said I was northern scum  
I was wounded baby  
Thats fighting talk where Im from  
And Im not moving baby  
Spent my life dancing with shadows in strobe lights  
Its alright everything mellows in sunlight  
  
And now Londons got its gimmicks  
And New Yorks had its minute  
But Knutsford City limits  
Ill never change  
  
Londons got its gimmicks  
And New Yorks had its minute  
But Knutsford City limits  
Ill never change  
  
Ive been runny nearly all my life  
It left me broken baby  
When the meter ran out on life  
I used my tokens lady  
You said I was Northern scum  
I was wounded baby  
Thats fighting talk where Im from  
And Im not moving baby  
  
Londons got its gimmicks  
And New Yorks had its minute  
But Knutsford City limits  
Ill never change  
  
Saw one transmission  
On the television  
Saying I cant do my job  
Well I just kept dancing  
Dont hate me cause Im handsome  
And the beat will never stop
