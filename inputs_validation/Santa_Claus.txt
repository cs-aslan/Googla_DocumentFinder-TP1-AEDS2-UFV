I think I saw ol santa through my window christmas eve  
My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe  
It mustve been ol santa cause I saw his big red hat  
And I know my mom and dad cant fly like that  
  
And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door  
The same ol christmas trick my dad had played since I was four  
He stands outside my bedroom yelling ho ho ho because  
He knows I dont believe in santa claus  
  
I think my daddy sees me  
Peeking from my door  
But he pretends hes santa anyway  
Every year he tries to fool me  
But Im a big boy now I dont believe in santa or his sleigh  
No way  
  
So I went back to bed and I curled up nice and tight  
I stared out my window and looked into the night  
And then all of a sudden through my window I could see  
Santa claus was flying by and smiling at me  
  
Chorus  
Santa claus santa claus  
It mustve been ol santa claus  
Santa claus santa claus  
Happy ho ho ho to you  
  
Then I heard ol rudolph tellin me to come outside  
He told me that ol santa wanted me to take a ride  
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh  
Then ol santa took me up up and away  
  
We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below  
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show  
It was really past my bedtime and so ol santa said  
little boys like you should be in bed  
  
So I hollered ho ho ho  
And I put on santas hat  
Then he let me hold the reins awhile  
We pulled up to my window  
And I jumped back in my room  
And I waved goodbye to santa with a smile  
  
When I woke up christmas morning it was clear and bright  
My parents said my window had blown open in the night  
I smiled as I told them that it mustve been the cat  
And they asked me where I got my big red hat  
  
Chorus
