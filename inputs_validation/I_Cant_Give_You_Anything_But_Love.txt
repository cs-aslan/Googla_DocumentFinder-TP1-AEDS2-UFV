Gee but its tough to be broke kid  
Its not a joke kid its a curse  
My luck is changing its gotten from  
simply rotten to something worse  
Who knows some day I will win too  
Ill begin to reach my prime  
  
Now though I see what our end is  
All I can spend is just my time  
  
I cant give you anything but love baby  
Thats the only thing Ive plenty ofbaby  
  
Dream awhile scheme awhile  
Were sure to find  
  
Happiness and I guess  
All those things youve always pined for  
  
Gee Id like to see you looking swell baby  
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesnt sell baby  
  
Till that lucky day you know darned well baby  
I cant give you anything but love  
  
Rome wasnt built in a day kid  
You have to pay kid for what you get  
But I am willing to wait dear  
Your little mate dear will not forget  
  
You have a lifetime before you  
Ill adore you come what may  
  
Please dont be blue for the present  
When its so pleasant to hear you say  
  
I cant give you anything but love baby  
Thats the only thing Ive plenty ofbaby  
  
Dream awhile scheme awhile  
Were sure to find  
  
Happiness and I guess  
All those things youve always pined for  
  
Gee Id like to see you looking swell baby  
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesnt sell baby  
  
Till that lucky day you know darned well baby  
I cant give you anything but love
