Youve got me feelin emotions higher higher  
I feel good I feel nice  
I feel good satisfied

Higher than the heavens above

Intoxicated flyin high  
Feels like a dream  
When you touch me tenderly  
I dont know if its real  
But I like the way I feel inside  
Youve got me feelin emotions  
Deeper than Ive ever dreamed of  
Youve got me feelin emotions  
Higher than the heavens above  
In the morning when I rise  
You are the first thing on my mind  
And in the middle of the night  
I feel your heartbeat next to mine  
It feels like a dream  
When you love me tenderly

To make me lose control  
When youre lookin into my eyes  
You make me feel so high oh baby
