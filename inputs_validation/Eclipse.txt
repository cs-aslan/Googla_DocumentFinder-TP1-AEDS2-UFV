The sun is slowly fadin in the western sky  
Sometimes it takes forever the day to end  
Sometimes it takes a lifetime  
Sometimes I think Ill never see the sun again  
  
Theres a heavy smog between me and my mountains  
Its enough to make a grown man sit and cry  
Its enough to make you wonder  
Its enough to make the world roll up and die  
  
I think its kind of interesting the way things get to be  
The way that people work with their machines  
Serenitys a long time comin to me  
The fact I dont believe that I know what it means  
  
In the east a shaded moon is hangin lazily  
I do believe I saw the old man smile  
I do believe I did  
I do believe hes been laughin all the while  
  
I think its kind of interesting the way things get to be  
The way that people work with their machines  
Serenitys a long time comin to me  
The fact I dont believe that I know what it means any more  
  
When the sun is slowly fadin in the western sky  
Sometimes it takes forever the day to end  
Sometimes it takes a lifetime  
Sometimes I think Ill never see the sun again  
  
The sun again  
Sun again
