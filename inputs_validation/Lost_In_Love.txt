I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice  
And it dont count for much  
But Im not letting go  
I believe theres still much to believe in  
  
So lift your eyes if you feel you can  
Reach for a star and Ill show you a plan  
I figured it out  
What I needed was someone to show me  
  
You know you cant fool me  
Ive been loving you too long  
It started so easy  
You want to carry on  
  
Chorus  
Lost in love and I dont know much  
Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch  
But Im back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted  
  
So lift your eyes if you feel you can  
Reach for a star and Ill show you a plan  
I figured it out  
What I needed was someone to show me  
  
You know you cant fool me  
Ive been loving you too long  
It started so easy  
You want to carry on  
  
Chorus  
  
You know you cant fool me  
Ive been loving you too long  
It started so easy  
You want to carry on  
  
Chorus  
  
Now Im lost lost in love lost in love lost in love  
Now Im lost lost in love lost in love lost in love  
Lost in love lost in love lost in love  
Lost in love lost in love lost in love
