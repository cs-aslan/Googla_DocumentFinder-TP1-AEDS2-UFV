Harryasaboy singing  
I got a girl with a little rubber head  
Rinse her out every night just before I go to bed  
She never talk back like a lady might do  
An she looks like she loves it every time I get through  
And her name is  
AaretI  
FIsee I cry  
Al dont be shy  
Artificial rhonda  
With the plastic pie  
Her eyes is all shut in a ecstasy face  
I can cram it down her throat people any old place  
Then I throw the little switch on her battery pack  
n I can poot it I can shoot it till it makes her gack  
And her name is  
AaretI  
FIsee I cry  
Al dont be shy  
Artificial rhonda  
With the plastic pie  
Ensemble
