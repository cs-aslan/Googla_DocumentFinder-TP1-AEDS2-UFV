How will you praise me When youre not around  
You say you love me then you hit the ground  
Make up your mind babe I wont be here long  
Just let me know babe when I sing this song  
  
Chorus  
Dont leave me waiting time is moving on too fast  
stop hesistating cuz our love will never last  
Im moving on dont try to grab me back Im moving on  
  
Boy Im on my own cuz you let me cry these tears  
you walked away now I cant face none of my fears  
I need you boy please come back to me  
I need you boy please cant you see  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont leave me waiting oooh I wont stay for you you let me go too  
Many times youve let out love goooooo
