Lyin in my bed  
Thoughts in my head  
Visions of you  
But I cant get through the night  
  
So pick up the phone  
I know youre home  
Youre playin with my heart  
And you know that it just aint right  
  
Its just a game of love love love  
And even though its hard baby  
I can never give you up  
  
Youre the one Im dreamin of  
I cant live without your love  
Tonight  
And its you that I adore  
Youre the one that I live for  
Inside  
Of you Im dreamin of you  
  
So I get in the car  
But I didnt get far  
Cause the radio played  
Every song that I sang with you  
  
Yesterdays gone  
And it may be true  
But you know that  
Ill never get over you  
  
Its just a game of love love love  
And even though it hurts me baby  
I can never give you up  
  
Cause youre the one Im dreamin of  
I cant live without your love  
Tonight  
And its you that I adore  
Youre the one that I live for  
Inside  
Of you Im dreamin of you  
  
You you gave me love  
Love gave us hope and strength  
To carry on and  
You you gave me faith  
When I was fallin down  
You would pick me up my love  
  
Youre the one Im dreamin of  
I cant live without your love  
Tonight  
And its you that I adore  
Youre the one that I live for  
Inside  
Baby baby baby baby  
Youre the one Im dreamin of  
I cant live without your love  
Tonight  
And its you that I adore  
Youre the one that I live for  
Inside  
Baby  
Im dreamin of you
