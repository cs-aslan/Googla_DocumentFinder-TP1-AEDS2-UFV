Bridge  
When your groove comes down on you  
You can do what you wanna do  
When your groove comes down on yo  
You can do what you wanna do  
  
Theres a lot of dancin going round  
You tried them all and put some down  
Everybodys got their own way of movin  
It dont matter as long as were groovin  
  
Chorus  
Walk on  
Walk the rockway  
Walk on  
Walk the rockway  
Walk on  
Walk the rockway  
Walk on  
Walk the rockway

Chorus

Just walk over here and Ill get down with ya
