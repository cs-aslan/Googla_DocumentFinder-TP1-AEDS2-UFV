Suzie walks her dog but it dont solve  
All the mysteries  
Hanging with the guys making with the guys  
Playing hard to please  
  
Back in 63 she was made for me  
We were having fun  
Wasnt long before I could not ignore  
Shes about hanging out  
  
Campus queen dreams  
Shattered years ago  
And Im the one who knows  
  
Its the same country love song  
Different words a different melody  
Its the same country love song  
  
Mama said to me John you got to be  
Honest to yourself  
Keeping up the pace losing in the race  
Further on the shelf  
  
I want to write a country love song  
Tell them nothings wrong  
Suzie did my heart  
  
There is nothing more something said before  
Seeest la vie mon cherie  
Lady Luck me and sexy so and so  
And Im the one who knows
