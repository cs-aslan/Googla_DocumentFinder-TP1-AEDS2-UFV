If somebody tells you Look out boy  
That stuff youre doins way too strong  
Pay them no mind just give us time  
Keep your head you cant do no wrong  
Please dont worry bout no jury  
Theres so many of us anyway  
If somebody tries to bust you  
Cause you had their daughter late last night  
Dont get me wrong  
But you must be strong and you just cant get uptight  
Please dont worry bout no jury  
Theres so many of us anyway  
If somebody says you look funny  
Cause the way you dress to them aint right  
Say Hey cant you see you look funny to me  
But Im just tryin to be polite  
Please dont worry bout no jury  
Theres so many of us anyway  
Please dont worry bout no jury  
Theres so many of us anyway  
Please dont worry bout no jury  
Theres so many of us anyway
