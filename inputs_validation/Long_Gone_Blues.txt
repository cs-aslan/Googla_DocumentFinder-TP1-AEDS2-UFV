Talk to me baby  
Tell me whats the matter now  
Tell me baby whats the matter now  
Are you tryin to quit me baby  
But you dont know how  
  
Ive been your slave  
Ever since Ive been your babe  
Ive been your slave  
Ever since Ive been your babe  
  
But before I see you go  
I see you in your grave  
  
Im a good gal  
But my love is all wrong  
  
Im a good gal  
But my love is all wrong  
  
Im a real good gal  
But my love is gone
