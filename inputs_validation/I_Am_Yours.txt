When all my hopes and dreams  
Have been betrayed  
I stand before you  
My hands are empty  
  
I am yours if you are mine  
I am yours if you are mine  
  
I fall and stumble  
Flat on my face  
And Im shamed and humble  
In disgrace  
  
I am yours if you are mine  
I am yours if you are mine  
  
When voices call me  
To question my faith  
When misperception  
Taints my love with hate  
  
I am yours if you are mine  
I am yours if you are mine  
  
When time decides  
You wont stop for me  
When the hawks and vultures  
Are circling  
  
I am yours if you are mine  
I am yours if you are mine
