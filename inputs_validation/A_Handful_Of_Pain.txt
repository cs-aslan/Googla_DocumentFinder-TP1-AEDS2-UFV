I still remember every hour  
Every second has been ours  
Far away from any burden  
We met eyes without a curtain  
Headless into a new sensation  
Weather brain nor fear or patience  
Careless we had a game to play  
You crossed my way for twenty days  
Why dont you just heal  
The yearning that I feel  
Hey what we called a game  
Is more than just a handful of pain  
We go the wrong ways  
Cause I believe its more than just a handful of pain  
We go the wrong ways  
Cause I believe its more than just a handful of pain  
  
Were different colours different nature  
Both we were like pupil and teacher  
Its a puzzle with two pieces  
Still not done cause one still misses  
Helpless I go through unknown stages  
A chapter of life which has missing pages  
Tortures not only physical  
It pains unbound  
Way way down  
Why dont you just heal  
The yearning that I feel  
Hey what we called a game  
Is more than just a handful of pain  
We go the wrong ways  
Cause I believe its more than just a handful of pain  
We go the wrong ways  
Cause I believe its more than just a handful of pain
