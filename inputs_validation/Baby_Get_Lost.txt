Well good morning baby welcome back to town  
How do fine papa welcome back to town  
Youre doing so much travelling never know  
When youll be around  
Youre a fine and mellow fella  
But youre stubborn as a mule  
You love me like an angel  
But you treat me like a fool  
Twofaced daddy dont hand me no doublecross  
Youll see any time Im ready  
I can tell you baby get lost  
Youre cheating on the outside  
Doing anything you choose  
You better come back on the inside  
cause you got too much to lose  
Dont want no trouble Ive got to be the boss  
And if you cant play it my way  
Well now baby get lost  
I try to stop your cheating  
But I just dont have the time  
cause I got so many men that  
Theyre standing right in line  
Keep cool papa you got to come across  
cause any time Im ready yes any time Im ready  
You know when Im ready  
I can tell you baby get lost  
Why dont you get lost
