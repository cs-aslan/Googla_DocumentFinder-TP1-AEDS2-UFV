Youre layin here with me were holding each other it feels good so it must
be right  
Youve touched me into thinking this could go on forever  
I dont care if forever is just for tonight  
Lets go as far as this feeling will take us weve never been there together
before  
Lets go as far as this feeling will take us  
And Ive got a feeling well come back for more  
  
Im like a forest and youre like a wildfire thats spreading all over me  
Baby come with me lets go to heaven  
At moments like this girl thats where we should be  
Lets go as far as this feeling  
  
For that kind of feeling well come back for me
