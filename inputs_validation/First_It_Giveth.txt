Im in you  
Youre in me  
I cant tell  
  
Youre so cruel  
More than me  
It is true  
Thats right  
  
Loyal to  
Only you  
Up your sleeve  
  
I want some come on take it  
Of all of you its yours  
Trickin me  
  
First it giveth  
Then it taketh away  
  
I would beg  
I would plead  
I would shake  
  
On a hook  
Dangling  
By the way  
  
Im so young  
And beautiful  
Thats right  
Im slick  
Im no fool  
  
Time goes by  
Tables turn  
Now I know  
  
First it giveth  
Then it taketh away
