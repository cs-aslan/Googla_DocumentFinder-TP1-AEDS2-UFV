Oh Im a dark diamond  
Ive turned hard and cold  
Once was a jewel with fire in my soul  
Theres two sides of a mirror  
One I couldnt break through  
Stayed trapped on the inside wound up losing you  
  
Tell me how does it work  
How do you make things fit  
Spent all my life trying to get it right  
Ive put it together and it falls apart  
I thought to myself I might understand  
But when the walls built  
And the heart hardens  
You get a dark diamond  
Dark diamond  
  
Oh Im a dark diamond  
But youre something else  
You read me more than I read myself  
The one star I could count on  
Only comet I could trust  
You burnt through my life to the true meaning of love
