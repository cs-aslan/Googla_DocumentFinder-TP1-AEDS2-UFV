My mouth was a crib and it was growing lies  
I didnt know what love was on that day  
My hearts a tiny bloodclot I picked at it  
It never heals it never goes away  
  
Burned all the good things in the eden eye  
We were too dumb to run too dead to die2x  
  
This was never my world you took the angel away  
I killed myself to make everybody pay2x  
  
I would have told her that she was the only thing  
that I could love in this dying world  
But the simple word of love itself  
already died and went away  
  
This was never my world you took the angel away  
I killed myself to make everybody pay2x  
  
Burned all the good things in the eden eye  
We were too dumb to run too dead to die2x  
  
This was never my world you took the angel away  
I killed myself to make everybody pay4x  
  
Her hearts a bloodstained egg  
We didnt handle with care  
Its broken and bleeding  
and we can never repair2x  
  
and we can never repair
