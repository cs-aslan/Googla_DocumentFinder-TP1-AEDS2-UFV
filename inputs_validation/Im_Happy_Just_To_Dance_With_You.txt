Before this dance is through  
I think Ill love you too  
Im so happy when you dance with me  
  
I dont wanna kiss or hold your hand  
If its funny try and understand  
There is really nothing else Id rather do  
Cause Im happy just to dance with you  
  
I dont need to hug or hold you tight  
I just wanna dance with you all night  
In this world theres nothing I would rather do  
Cause Im happy just to dance with you  
  
Just to dance with you  
Is everything I need  
Before this dance is through  
I think Ill love you too  
Im so happy when you dance with me  
  
If somebody tries to take my place  
Lets pretend we just cant see his face  
In this world theres nothing I would rather do  
Cause Im happy just to dance with you  
  
Just to dance with you  
Is everything I need  
Before this dance is through  
I think Ill love you too  
Im so happy when you dance with me  
  
If somebody tries to take my place  
Lets pretend we just cant see his face  
In this world theres nothing I would rather do  
I discovered Im in love with you  
Cause Im happy just to dance with you
