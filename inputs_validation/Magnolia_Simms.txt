Love to me is blueeyed and blonde  
Oh thats sweet Magnolia  
Apple pie on the window still warm  
Thats my sweet Magnolia  
  
Walking under a sky thats so blue  
After rain has fallen  
When shes walking so close by my side  
My troubles seem to just run and hide  
  
ladee dadumb etc  
Well walking under a sky thats so blue  
After rain has fallen  
When shes walking so close by my side  
My troubles seem to just run and hide  
  
Magnolia Simms is my little doll  
I cant live without her  
For if she goes my world will just fall  
Stay with me Magnolia  
Sound of record skipping  
Stay with me Magnolia
