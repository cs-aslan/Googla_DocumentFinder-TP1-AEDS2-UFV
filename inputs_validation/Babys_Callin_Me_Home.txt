Babys callin me home  
She keeps on callin me home  
Hate to see her cryin  
My baby knows Im dyin  
But she keeps on callin me home  
  
Baby knows Ive been wrong  
But she keeps on callin me home  
Hate to see her cryin  
My baby knows Im dyin  
When she keeps on callin me home  
  
Babys callin me home  
She keeps on callin me home  
Hate to see her cryin  
My baby knows Im dyin  
When she keeps on callin me home  
My babys callin me home  
Mm  
My babys callin me home
