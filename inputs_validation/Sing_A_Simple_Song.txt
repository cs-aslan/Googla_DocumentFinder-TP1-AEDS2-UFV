Yeah yeah yeah oh yeah  
Im talking talking talking talking talking talking in my sleep  
Im walking walking walking walking walking in the street  
Time is passing I grow older things are happening fast  
All I have to hold on to is a simple song at last  
Let me hear you say ya ya ya ya ya ya  
Let me hear you say ya ya ya ya ya ya  
Sing a simple song you gotta try a little  
Doremifasolatido  
Doremifasolatido doremifasolatido  
Ya ya ya ya ya oh yeah oh yeah  
Im living living living life with all its ups and downs you too  
Im giving giving giving love and smiling at the frowns me too  
Youre in trouble when you find its hard for you to smile  
A simple song will make it better for a little while  
Let me hear you say ya ya ya ya ya  
Let me hear you girls yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Im talking talking talking talking  
Im walking walking walking walking  
Im living living living living  
Im giving love and so much love  
Everybody sing together  
Ya ya ya ya ya oooo  
Let me hear you say ya ya ya ya ya  
Time for you ladies to do your thing
