You ask me if I love you and I choke on my reply  
Id rather hurt you honestly then mislead you with a lie  
and who am I to judge you on what you say or do  
Im only just beginning to see the real you  
  
Chours  
Sometimes when we touch the honestys too much  
and I have to close my eyes and hide  
I wanna hold you till I die till we both break down and cry  
I wanna hold you until the fear in me subsides  
  
Romance and all its strategies leaves me battling with my pride  
but through the insecurity some tenderness survives  
Im just another writer still trapped within my truth  
a hesitant prize fighter still trapped within my youth  
  
Chours  
  
At times Id like to break you and drive your knees  
At times Id like to break through and hold you endlessly  
  
Chours
