Sometimes Im right then I can be wrong  
My own beliefs are in my songs  
A butcher a banker Jack Irons on drums  
Makes no difference what group Im in  
I am everyday people  
  
Then its the blue ones who cant accept  
The green ones for living with  
The black ones tryin to be a skinny one  
Different strokes for different folks  
And so on and so on and scooby dooby dooby  
  
Ooh sha sha  
We gotta live together  
  
I am no better and neither are you  
Were all the same whatever we do  
You love me you hate me  
You know me and then  
Still cant figure out the scene Im in  
I am everyday people  
  
Then its the new man  
That doesnt like the short man  
For being such a rich one  
That will not help the poor one  
Different strokes for different folks  
And so on and so on scooby dooby dooby  
  
Ooh sha sha  
We got to live together  
  
There is a yellow one that wont  
Accept the black one  
That wont accept the red one  
That wont accept the white one  
  
Different strokes for different folks  
And so on and so on and  
Scooby dooby dooby  
Ooh sha sha  
I am everyday people
