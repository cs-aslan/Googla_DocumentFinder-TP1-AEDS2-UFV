We were going together for a long long time and it breaks my heart girl  
To see you walking with some other guy  
I been sitting alone here with a worried head  
Ive been talking to some downtown girls but dont believe the things that I
have said  
  
Cause girl dont you know I only tried to hide the pain when I said  
I dont really love you I dont really want you  
I dont want to have you I dont really love you  
  
Now were hitting the daylight morning looking sad  
Never knew a guy could feel as lonely as Im feelin oh so bad  
Time is going slowly dragging like a weight  
Like to say Im sorry but deep down in my heart its just too late  
  
Cause girl dont you know I only tried to hide the pain when I said  
I dont really want you I dont really need you  
I dont want to have you I dont really love you  
  
We were going together for a long long time  
And it breaks my heart girl to see you walking with some other guy  
Still I keep on trying lonely as Ive been  
Got to get your sweet sweet smile to get that lovin feeling back again  
  
Cause girl dont you know I only tried to hide the pain when I said  
I dont really want you I dont really need you I dont want to have you  
I dont really love you I dont really want you I dont really need you  
I dont want to have you I dont really love you
