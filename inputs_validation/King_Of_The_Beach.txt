Let your fighting scars heal in the sun  
of a bright windy day  
Let your cold blades sleep in the sand  
till its rusted away  
  
Washed each night in the waves  
while you sleep away each memory  
And you wake to find yourself  
a new king to be  
  
Away from the dark  
moving into the light  
King of the shadows  
gives up on the fight  
  
He kicks of them shoes  
throws them away  
Theres nobody here now  
except this salty blue day  
  
Out of sight  
Out of reach  
Hes king of the beach  
  
Whatever I was  
well Im not that now  
I tell you because  
it may help you somehow  
  
So kick of them shoes  
and throw them away  
Cause theres nobody here now  
except this salty blue day
