Hey I can see that smile on your face  
Tonight memories will never erase  
And I feel like our time has come  
Our hearts are beating wild as one  
True love I know is hard to find  
But you tonight youre mine  
Didnt we have the time of our life tonight  
Didnt we have the time of our life tonight  
Hey I hope you feel the same way I feel  
Cause tonight the moon the stars  
This moment so real  
To once we have everything  
Our hearts have a song to sing  
We now know that dreams come true  
Cause now theres me and you  
Didnt we have the time of our life tonight  
Im saying didnt we have the time of our life tonight  
Im saying didnt we have the time of our life tonight  
Oh yeah didnt we have the time of our life tonight  
Didnt we dance the night away  
What can I say to you  
You make life a holiday  
Lets go and play  
Lets go and play  
Didnt we have the time of our life tonight  
Im saying didnt we have the time of our life tonight  
Im saying didnt we have the time of our life tonight  
Im saying didnt we have the time of our life tonight  
Come on and sing the song  
Come on and sing along  
Didnt we have the time of our life tonight  
Oh yeah didnt we have the time of our life tonight
