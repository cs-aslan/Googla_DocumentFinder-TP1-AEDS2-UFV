Oh dont you know that  
Jesus died to wash your sins away  
Oh please heed His call in sin dont fall  
Were getting closer to the grave each day  
were getting closer to the grave each day  
Mortal man wont you stop now and pray  
Leave the road of sin alone let Jesus lead you home  
Were getting closer to the grave each day  
They nailed His hands they pierced His sides  
On His head the thorns did lay  
Be prepared to go one thing we know  
Were getting closer to the grave each day  
On the judgment day when the book is read  
Therell be no use to pray  
So each day you live love and forgive  
Were getting closer to the grave each day
