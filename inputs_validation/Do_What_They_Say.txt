Walk away when youre angry  
Brace yourself theres nothing to gain  
Old enough to know the outcome  
More blood its always the same  
  
Chorus  
Arent we cool and arent we calm  
For facing death we run it on  
Arent we cool and arent we calm  
The God reserved a false alarm  
Arent we cool and arent we calm  
For facing death we run it on  
  
Do what they say  
Or they take it away  
Id rather be dead than  
Carry on  
  
Wait  
But you live dont be cursing  
You mustnt take gods name in vain  
Wait  
Put your knife forward the curtain  
Impulsives you must refrain  
  
Chorus  
  
Do what they say  
Or they take it away  
Id rather be dead than  
Carry on  
  
So we carry on  
With this burden  
I cant remember anything  
I cant be certain  
  
Arent we cool and arent we calm  
For facing death we run it on  
Do what they say  
Or they take it away  
Id rather be dead than  
Carry on
