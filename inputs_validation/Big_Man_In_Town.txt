Big man in town  
  
Each day as I grow older  
The nights are getting colder  
Some day the sun will shine on me  
Money I dont have any  
Im down to my last penny  
But darling dont cry over me  
  
Ill be a big man in town honest honey  
Ill be a big man in town promise darling  
Ill be a big man in town just you wait and see  
Youll be proud of me  
  
They think that Im a rover  
But my roving days are over  
Someday your folks will welcome me  
I went away a small man  
But Ill come home a tall man  
Then what a pretty bride youll be  
  
Ill be a big man in town honest honey  
Ill be a big man in town promise darling  
Ill be a big man in town just you wait and see  
Youll be proud of me  
  
Im gonna make it just wait and see  
Im gonna make it just wait and see  
Just wait and see  
Girl Im gonna make it just wait and see
