Feeling good bout the way i am  
How come you cant just let me be  
Oh Ive got no use for your master plan  
No ones running this life but me  
  
Oh cause i i have to stand on my own  
No i cant lean on nobody else  
Cause i i learned a long time ago  
Ive got to keep looking out for myself  
  
And you can keep all that junk to yourself  
You keep warning me about the way Im going  
But my futures looking just fine  
And Ive got no use for your scary tales  
  
Im sure Ive got long till i die  
Cause my time you know it more important to me  
Then to talk about angels and hell  
Cause i Ive read the bible before  
  
And it keep it right there on the shelf  
And you can keep all that junk to yourself  
Yes Im feeling real good bout my life right now  
And Im sure that for you its all true  
  
If it makes you happy enjoy yourself  
Im so glad its working for you  
But for me you know Ive got to stand on my own  
No i cant lean on nobody else  
  
Cause i Ive learned a long time ago  
Got to keep looking out for myself  
And you can keep all that jive to yourself  
And you can keep all that junk to yourself  
  
And you can keep all that junk to yourself
