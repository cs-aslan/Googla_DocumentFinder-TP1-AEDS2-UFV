Explosive situation  
I got no explanation  
Love has shout out of the blue  hitting me and you  
It isnt just attraction  
Its more a chain reaction  
Our love is no ricochet  wont go astray  
I cant light the fuse and then retire  
Loves got me in its line of fire  
Oo baby youre dynamite  
Theres never been another love so exciting  
Oo baby its dynamite  
Youve got the power of thunder and lightning  
Youre dynamite  
Your lips are so inviting  
My senses are igniting  
I know our love is here to stay  wont go away  
Its bigger by the hour  
Loves overwhelming power  
Is moving irresistibly  through you and me  
I cant light the fuse and then retire  
Loves got me in its line of fire  
Oo baby youre dynamite  
Theres never been another love so exciting  
Oo baby its dynamite  
Youve got the power of thunder and lightning  
Youre dynamite  
I cant light the fuse and then retire  
Loves got me in its line of fire  
Oo baby youre dynamite  
Theres never been another love so exciting  
Oo baby its dynamite  
Youve got the power of thunder and lightning  
Youre dynamite
