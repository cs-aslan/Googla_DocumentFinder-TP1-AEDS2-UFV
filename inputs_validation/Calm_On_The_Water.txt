Dolly Parton  
In a dream I was walkin in a beautiful field  
I was gathering flowers at the foot of a hill  
When a bright light descended and it spread oer the land  
Jesus stood on the mountain and He held out His hand  
Then He came down from the mountain headed down to the sea  
And the children strowed flowers in the path at His feet  
And He was filled with compassion and the beasts from the wild  
Came as gentle as lambs and they all walked at His side  
Theres a calm on the water a hush in the crowd  
Theres peace in the valley theres a stillness about  
Theres a light in the darkness theres joy in His love  
Aint that a wonderful feelin let us lift Him up  
Then He suddenly vanished from the crowd down below  
Reappeared on the mountain in a radiant glow  
He said your questions are many but the answer is love  
Ill draw all men unto me if I be lifted up  
Theres a calm on the water a hush in the crowd  
Theres peace in the valley theres a stillness about  
Theres a light in the darkness theres joy in His love  
There is life everlasting let us lift Him up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
He said if I be lifted up what did he say  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
He said if I be lifetd up  
Lets lift Him higher and higher  
And higher and higher each day  
Lets lift Him up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
Oh if I be lifted up  
Theres a calm on the water a hush in the crowd  
Theres peace in the valley theres a stillness about  
Theres a light in the darkness and joy in His love  
Its a wonderful feelin lift Him up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
He said if I be lifted up thats what he said  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
If I be lifted up
