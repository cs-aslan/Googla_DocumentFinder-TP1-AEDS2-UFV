Rousseau walks on trumpet paths  
Safaris to the heart of all that jazz  
Through I bars and girdersthrough wires and pipes  
The mathematic circuits of the modern nights  
Through huts through Harlem through jails and gospel pews  
Through the class on Park and the trash on Vine  
Through Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue  
Through savage progress cuts the jungle line  
  
In a lowcut blouse she brings the beer  
Rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear  
Those cannibalsof shuck and jive  
Theyll eat a working girl like her alive  
With his hardedged eye and his steady hand  
He paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines  
And he hangs a moon above a fivepiece band  
He hangs it up above the jungle line  
  
The jungle line the jungle line  
Screaming in a ritual of sound and time  
Floating drifting on the airconditioned wind  
And drooling for a taste of something smuggled in  
Pretty women funneled through valves and smoke  
Coy and bitchy wild and fine  
And charging elephants and chanting slaving boats  
Charging chanting down the jungle line  
  
Theres a poppy wreath on a soldiers tomb  
Theres a poppy snake in a dressing room  
Poppy poisonpoppy tourniquet  
It slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit  
And metal skin and ivory birds  
Go steaming up to Rousseaus vines  
They go steaming up to Brooklyn Bridge  
Steaming steaming steaming up the jungle line
