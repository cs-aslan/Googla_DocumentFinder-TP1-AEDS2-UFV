They say dont stop believing  
Give no room to reason  
Build it and they will come  
Ive no quibble with that drivel  
Its alright for some  
But I was born in a European nation  
In the twentieth century  
And what Ive seen and what Ive learned  
Means its not right for me  
  
Thy say dont stop believing  
Cause if you stop believing  
Very soon youll regret it  
But what they believe  
Is you can believe  
And still end up in a fiery pit  
So I sit in this European nation  
In the twentyfirst century  
And I know someones got it wrong  
Is it them or is it me  
  
During the deepest darkest nights  
I feel that they must be right  
But when I see the morning light  
Science wins again  
  
They say dont stop believing  
Cause if you just believe  
Your futures like the shining sun  
I say I would believe  
But theres all these beliefs  
What if I pick the wrong one   
When I look at the European nations  
Down through the centuries  
Every single belief system  
Ended up causing grief incalculable grief  
And if you ask me now  
I think thats what I believe
