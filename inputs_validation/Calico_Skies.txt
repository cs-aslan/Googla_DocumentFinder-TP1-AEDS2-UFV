It was written that I would love you  
From the moment I opened my eyes  
And the morning when I first saw you  
Gave me life under calico skies  
  
I will hold you for as long as you like  
Ill hold you for the rest of my life  
  
Always looking for ways to love you  
Never failing to fight at your side  
While the angels of love protect us  
From the innermost secrets we hide  
  
Ill hold you for as long as you like  
Ill hold you for the rest of my life  
  
Long live all of us crazy soldiers  
Who were born under calico skies  
May we never be called to handle  
All the weapons of war we despise  
  
Ill hold you for as long as you like  
Ill hold you for the rest of my life  
Ill hold you for as long as you like  
Ill love you for the rest of my  
For the rest of my life
