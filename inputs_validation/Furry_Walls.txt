Yeeeaaahhh  
  
Yeeeaaahhh  
  
When the world slips you a Geoffrey  
Stroke the furry wall  
Stroke the furry wall  
  
Furry walls dont bring me down  
Furry walls please stay around  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Furry walls kiss me to sleep  
Furry walls please help me weep  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Furry walls can take you on a magic carpet ride  
Furry walls surround you till you got no place to hide  
Let your furry fingers be your guide  
  
Furry walls turn out the light  
Furry walls please stay the night  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Furry walls says have a taste  
Furry walls sit on my face  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Maybe Im in heaven with the furry skies above  
All around the furry clouds look heres a furry dove  
Let me stroke your furry walls of love  
  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Furry walls I am amazed  
Furry walls were in a daze  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Dont be in a hurry things are not the way they were  
Shaggy walls of loveliness its all a furry blur  
Maybe Im in heaven with the furry skies above  
All around the furry clouds look heres a furry dove  
Let the walls caress you in a showering of love  
  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Furry walls Im gonna cry  
Furry walls please let me hide  
  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Furry walls  
Furry waalls  
Furry walls
