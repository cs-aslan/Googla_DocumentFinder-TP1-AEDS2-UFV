When the world is on your shoulder  
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down  
If you cant hang with the feelin  
Then there aint no room for you this part of town  
Cause were the party people night and day  
Livin crazy thats the only way  
  
Chorus  
So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf  
And just enjoy yourself  
Groove let the madness in the music get to you  
Life aint so bad at all  
If you live it off the wall  
Life aint so bad at all live life off the wall  
Live your life off the wall live it off the wall  
  
You can shout out all you want to  
Cause there aint no sin in folks all getting loud  
If you take the chance and do it  
There there aint no one whos gonna put you down  
Cause were the party people night and day  
Livin crazy thats the only way  
  
Chorus  
  
Do what you want to do  
There aint no rules its up to you aint no rules its all up to you  
Its time to come alive  
And party on right through the night all right  
  
Gotta hide your inhibitions  
Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul  
Want to see an exhibition  
Better do it now before you get too old  
Cause were the party people night and day  
Livin crazy thats the only way  
  
Chorus  
  
So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf  
And just enjoy yourself  
Come on and groove yeah and let the madness in the music get to you  
Life aint so bad at all  
If you live it off the wall  
  
So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf  
And just enjoy yourself  
Come on and groove yeah and let the madness in the music get to you  
Life aint so bad at all  
If you live it off the wall
