Never had a gift for beein so sure  
Oh no no  
Never thought Ive see you walkin that door  
Oh nayeah  
I can make you feel youre the queen  
No remedy no compromise  
Oh  
Would you rather be right here with me  
I want you right here next to me  
  
Do you relly wanna stay  
I can take ya slow  
Do you wanna walk away  
Let it go  
Girl Im believing youre the ready just to say goodbye  
Ill be standing in the rain case you change your mind  
  
Do you relly wanna stay  
I can take ya slow  
Do you really wanna go
