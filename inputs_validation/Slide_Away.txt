So take your time  
I wonder if youre here just to use my mind  
Dont take it slow  
You know Ive got a place to go  
You always do that  
Something Im not sure of  
But just for today  
Let go and slide away  
  
I was thinking maybe we could go outside  
Let the night sky cool your foolish pride  
Dont you feel alive  
These are your times and our highs  
  
So take your time  
I wonder which cup youll drink from  
I hope its mine  
Beause you always do that something  
Something Im not sure of  
But just for today  
Let go and burn away  
Cause I read your mind  
I need it because it takes me where I cant find  
Because you always do that something  
Something Im not sure of  
But just for today  
Let go and burn away  
  
Repeat  
  
Slide away burn away  
Slide away burn away  
I read your mind  
I read your mind  
Cause it takes me to where I cant find
