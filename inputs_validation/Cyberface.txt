He lies in wait  
For one mistake  
Morphing on your screen  
  
Those who dare  
Or the unaware  
Download him for a scream  
  
Dont access the site  
Or beware his megabyte  
  
No virus scan  
Detects the man  
Or the deadly tasks he plans  
  
Drooling lips  
His circuits lit  
He crouches for attack  
  
Spider like on the web  
Alive and well  
But you are dead  
Iniquitous in every way  
Now hes come out to play  
  
Cyberface  
Iron will  
Programmed to corrupt and kill  
Cyberface  
No escape  
He is interfaced to Hell  
  
Once hes summoned and installed Cyberface  
Hell infest your motherboard Cyberface  
  
Now hes got a grip  
He will strip away your flesh  
Alive yet dead  
A fiend obsessed  
Hell crash your system down  
Once in place  
Hell simulate  
Your life its worthless now  
  
God forsaken  
Grotesque mind  
An entity  
Thats come alive  
Boot your screen  
And suddenly  
Approaching fast and mean  
  
Once hes summoned and installed Cyberface  
Hell infest your motherboard Cyberface
