Why I love you though you treat me bad  
Cause when I look at you Im looking through the mirror of love  
Oh the mirror of love and you look alright  
Cause when I look at you Im looking through the mirror of love  
Youre such a cool lover  
But youre such a cruel lover  
Treat me like Im a fool  
I hate you but you know I would kill for you  
Youre a mean and obscene lover  
But I would have no other  
Even though you treat me bad  
You were the best man I ever had  
Cause through the mirror of love mirror of love  
When I see you through the mirror of love  
Youre alright and I forget that youre bad  
Cause when I look at you Im looking through the mirror of love  
Why I love you though you treat me bad  
Cause when I look at you Im looking through the mirror of love  
The mirror of love you sure look alright  
I see your reflection when Im looking through the mirror of love  
Youre a crude and a rude lover  
But I would have no other  
You slap me down treat me bad  
Youre a twotiming swine and you drive me mad  
Youre a mean and obscene lover  
But you are my dream lover  
Cause even though you treat me bad  
You were the best man I ever had  
Cause through the mirror of love mirror of love  
I see your reflection in the mirror of love  
And youre alright though you treat me bad  
When I see you Im looking through the mirror of love  
Oh the mirror of love sure look alright  
Cause when I see you Im looking through the mirror of love
