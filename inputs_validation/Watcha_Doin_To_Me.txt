You drive me to drink  
But Im in for the whole trip I promise  
You wont go out with the drunk on the road  
Or use yer fork to search for the toast  
Girl I aint easy  
And any ass could see  
But I cant believe  
Just watcha doin to me  
Im falling this way and I  
Im stumbling over there but I  
Cant believe watcha doin to me  
The sweetest sound yeah  
To knock this lightweight down but I  
I cant believe watcha doin to me  
Shake my trunk  
And I wake like from a three day drunk  
As my branches hit the ground  
Im finally comin around  
Bury me deep in my  
Oh my wedding shoes  
Lay me flash  
Just fifty bucks cash its the  
One day I never wanna lose  
Im falling this way and I  
Im stumbling over there but I  
Cant believe watcha doin to me  
The sweetest sound yeah  
To knock this lightweight down but I  
I cant believe watcha doin to me  
Im falling this way and I  
Im stumbling over there but I  
Cant believe watcha doin to me  
The sweetest sound yeah  
To knock this lightweight down but I  
I cant believe watcha doin to me  
I never felt so jealous or felt so alive  
I feel like I could run  
I feel like I could die  
I cant believe watcha doin to me  
I cant believe watcha doin to me
