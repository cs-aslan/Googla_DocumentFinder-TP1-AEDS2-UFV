Out on the perilous deep  
Where danger silently creeps  
And storms so violently sweeping  
Youre drifting too far from shore  
  
Chorus  
Drifting too far from shore  
Youre drifting too far from shore  
Come to Jesus today  
Let Him show you the way  
Youre drifting too far from shore  
  
Today the Tempest rose high  
And clouds oer shadow the sky  
Sure death is hovering neigh  
Youre drifting too far from shore  
  
Drifting too far from shore  
Youre drifting too far from shore  
Come to Jesus today  
Let Him show you the way  
Youre drifting too far from shore  
  
Why meet a terrible fate  
Mercies abundantly wait  
Turn back before its too late  
Youre drifting too far from shore  
  
Drifting too far from shore  
Youre drifting too far from shore peaceful shore  
Come to Jesus today Let him show you the way  
Youre drifting too far from shore
