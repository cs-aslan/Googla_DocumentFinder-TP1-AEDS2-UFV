I got a brand new car  
And I like to drive real hard  
I got a brand new car  
And Im feeling good so far  
  
Take her on the highway for a little spin  
I want to see the kind of shape shes in  
And I got a brand new star  
Jack her up baby go on open the hood  
I want to check if her oil smells good  
Mmmm smells like caviar  
  
Give her some stick  
Push her too far  
Right to the brink  
  
Hear the motor running  
Yeah shes right in sink  
Tell me if shes thirsty  
Would she like a drink  
And Im stopping at this bar  
  
Slinky like a panther  
You can hear her purr  
Touch her on the seat  
Go on feel the fur  
And I got a brand new star  
  
Feel the juice  
Foot to the floor  
Take some abuse  
  
I got a brand new car  
And I drive her in the dark  
And I got a brand new car  
I think Ill stop and park
