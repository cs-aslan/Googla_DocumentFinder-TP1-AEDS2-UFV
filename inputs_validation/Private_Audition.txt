How are you  
You can start anytime  
Got an appointment to keep for seven nights I couldnt sleep  
Im in a state of disbelief its my big chance on magic street  
I followed this fashion doll down the famous hall  
Ginger wont be long at all she said Take a number youll be called  
I said Im gonna show him what I can do  
Now its just between us two  
In the grand tradition private audition  
I said Im gonna show him what I can do  
And now its just between us two  
In the grand tradition private audition yeah  
Wish I knew then what I know now  
I dont know what I did wrong I thought I really laid it on  
But when he called out for some more I gave him my standard encore  
I gave him the Swanee River the good ship Rockin Rye  
The Stars and Stripes Forever and the good old pal of mine  
But that aint what he was on about he was casting for his couch  
He said Come baby show me what you can do  
And now its just between us two  
In the grand tradition private audition  
You said Baby baby show me what you can do  
And now its just between us two  
Its a grand tradition private audition yeah
