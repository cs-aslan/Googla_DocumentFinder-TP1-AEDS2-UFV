Coming In Hot  
Firin some shot  
Coming in red hot  
Its a musical shot  
CHORUS  
I just clean up me nuzzle  
I just load me barrel  
And I cock me hammer  
Cause Im gonna pull my trigger  
CHORUS  
One minute after dozing  
I thought that I was a blazing  
My blood it was a boiling  
It was amazing  
CHORUS  
Next day it went higher  
Whole a me catch a fire  
I couldnt take it no longer  
I haffe chokin on some cold ice water  
CHORUS  
I got up the other day  
My heat it never went away  
103 on the hour  
I had to head for the shower  
CHORUS
