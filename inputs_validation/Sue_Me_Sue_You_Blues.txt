You serve me  
And Ill serve you  
Swing your partners all get screwed  
Bring your lawyer  
And Ill bring mine  
Get together and we could have a bad time  
  
Its affidavit swearing time  
Sign it on the dotted line  
Hold your Bible in your hand  
Now all thats left is to  
Find yourself a new band  
  
Were gonna play the sue me sue  
You blues  
Were gonna play the sue me sue  
You blues  
  
Hold the block on money flow  
Move it into joint escrow  
Court receiver laughs and thrills  
But in the end we just pay those  
Lawyers theit bills  
  
When you serve me  
And I serve you  
Swing your partners all get screwed  
Bring your lawyer  
And Ill bring mine  
Get together and we could have  
A bad time  
  
Were gonna play the sue me sue  
You blues  
  
Im tired of playing the  
Sue Me Sue You Blues
