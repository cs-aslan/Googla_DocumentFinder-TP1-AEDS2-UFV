One subtle look  
God help me  
Is all it took  
To sell me  
One single word  
Unspoken  
Your name unheard  
And Im broken  
  
The sun and the moon  
And the stars in the sky  
Are laughing  
Theyve seen it all before  
For the wind in the trees  
And the waves on the seas  
Its the same thing  
They cant take any more  
  
One gentle touch  
And Im helpless  
Its all too much  
For my senses  
One simple prayer  
Denied me  
When youre not there  
Beside me  
  
The sun and the moon  
And the stars in the sky  
Are laughing  
Theyve seen it all before  
For the wind in the trees  
And the waves on the seas  
Its the same thing  
They cant take any more
