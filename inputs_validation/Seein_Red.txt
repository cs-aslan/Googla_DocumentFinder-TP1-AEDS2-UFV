Im seein red  
Dont think youll have to see my face again  
Dont have much time for sympathy  
Cause it never happened to me  
Youre feelin blue now  
I think you bit off more than you could chew  
And now its time to make a choice  
And all I wanna hear is your  
  
So follow the leader down  
And swallow your pride and drown  
When theres no place left to go  
Maybe thats when you will know  
Follow the leader down  
And swallow your pride and drown  
When theres no place left to go  
Maybe thats when you will know  
  
And foolish lies  
Well cant you see I tried to compromise  
Cause what you say aint always true  
And I can see the tears in your eyes  
And what you said now  
Cant stop the words from running through my head  
And what Id do to get through to you  
But youd only do it again  
  
So follow the leader down  
And swallow your pride and drown  
When theres no place left to go  
Maybe thats when you will know  
Follow the leader down  
And swallow your pride and drown  
When theres no place left to go  
Maybe thats when you will know  
  
Well I can confess I dont know what to make from all this mess  
Dont have much time for sympathy  
But it never happened to me youre feelin down now  
I dont know where Ill be when you come around  
And now its time to make a choice  
And all I wanna hear is your voice
