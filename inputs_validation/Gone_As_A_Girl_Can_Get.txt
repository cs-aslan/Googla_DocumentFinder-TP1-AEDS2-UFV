Well I havent seen her lately and she never calls  
She dont ask my friends about me gives no clues at all  
Yeah the fire might still be burnin yeah  
But Id say shes about as gone as a girl can get  
  
She dont even show up in my dreams at night  
But my stubborn ol memory keeps holdin on tight  
Sure makes it hard to forget  
Shes about as gone as a girl can get  
  
Shes outta here she disappeared without a trace  
More or less unimpressed by the tears on my face  
Her destination unknown she just dropped out of sight  
Last seen headin right on out of my life  
Like a stranger I aint never met  
Shes about as gone as a girl can get  
  
Shes outta here she disappeared without a trace  
More or less unimpressed by the tears on my face  
Her destination unknown she just dropped out of sight  
Last seen headin right on out of my life  
Like a stranger I aint never met  
Shes about as gone as a girl can get  
  
Like a stranger I aint never met  
Id say shes about as gone as a girl can get
