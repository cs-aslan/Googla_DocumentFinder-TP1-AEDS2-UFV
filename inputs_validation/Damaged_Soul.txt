Born in a graveyard adopted by sin  
I cultivate evil thats living within  
A preacher tried saving my black damaged soul  
Possessed by a demon that had full control  
  
The time it is coming when all life will end  
With doomsday approaching to hell well descend  
Religion wont save me the damage is done  
The future has ended before its begun  
  
Deaths hand and the crazy I cant stand the light of day  
Watching all the victims on their knees as they pray  
God of the almighty never answers their call  
Satan is just waiting for the righteous to fall to him  
  
I dont mind dying cause Im already dead  
Pray not for the living Ill live in your head  
Dying is easy its living thats hard  
Im losing the battle between Satan and God
