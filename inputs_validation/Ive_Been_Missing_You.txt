Its not because Ive just been caught  
Its not as if I planned this  
I didnt give a single thought  
One big misunderstanding  
I see how things look from your side  
I see how youre hurting  
The reason that I didnt hide  
One big misunderstanding  
So I blew it again just like I always do  
Its too late for sorry this much is true  
I did what I did  
Just to make my way through  
One more day far away from you  
And Ive been missing you  
  
Its not the first wont be the last time  
Ive been caught redhanded  
To tell the truth I cannot lie  
One big misunderstanding  
I havent got an alibi  
And I cant stop them talking  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
One big misunderstanding  
  
So I blew it again just like I always do  
For the things that I did Im saying sorry to you  
But I did what I did and I paid my dues  
Ive been missing you
