Tall in the saddle we spend Christmas Day  
Driving the cattle over snow covered plains  
All of the good gifts given today  
Ours is the sky and the wide open range  
  
Back in the cities they have different ways  
Football and eggnog and Christmas parades  
Ill take my blanket Ill take the reins  
Its Christmas for cowboys wide open plains  
  
A campfire for warmth as we stop for the night  
The stars overhead are Christmas tree lights  
The wind sings a hymn as we bow down to pray  
Its Christmas for cowboys and wide open plains  
  
Its tall in the saddle we spend Christmas Day  
Driving the cattle over snow covered plains  
So many gifts have been opened today  
Ours is the sky and the wide open range  
  
Its Christmas for cowboys wide open plains
