Rage burns cant push it aside now  
Cant forgive this grudge is alive now  
All the rage eats you up inside  
Can you leave it behind  
  
What a surprise   
Youre fucked with again Yeah  
Its a way of life you need to get over  
All the rage just eats you alive  
  
Can you leave it behind  
I dont know where itll end  
The sun has set  
And I cant be friends  
  
I dont know if I can forgive  
The day is long  
But you were so dead wrong
