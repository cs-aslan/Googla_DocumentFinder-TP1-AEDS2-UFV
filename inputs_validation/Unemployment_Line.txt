Words and music by Robb Rabbitt MacKay  
Now theres a new craze agoin round  
Its gettin bigger in most every town  
From New York City out to Hollywood  
Got everybody in the neighborhood  
CHORUS  
Down in the unemployment line  
You got yourself a place and I got mine  
We been here waitin since the clock struck nine  
Down in the unemployment line  
Now every day youve got to fight the horde  
Just to read whats on the bulletin board  
When you go back and try and claim your space  
Some other sucker come and stole your place  
CHORUS  
I hope the people in the government  
Tell us how were gonna pay the rent  
How were gonna get enough to eat  
No that the workin man is obsolete  
If things keep goin like they seem they do  
Wont be long before theyre down here too  
And they can be a part of this here mob  
Workin nine to five to find a job  
CHORUS
