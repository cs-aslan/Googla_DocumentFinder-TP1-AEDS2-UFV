Well I dont like it when I see your eyes dartin  
Back and forth across the room  
And I dont like it when I see you doin dances  
Baby that I aint used to  
  
But thats the kind of fella I am  
Thats the kind of fella I am  
Im a jealous kinda fella  
And I might fall in love with you  
Im a jealous kinda fella  
And I just might fall in love with you  
Hey  
  
Well I dont like it when you try to impress me  
With your daddys jewels and his car  
And I dont like it when I hear you talkin  
Bout your exboyfriend the movie star  
  
What I like is when you walk me home  
And you let me hold you tight  
But I dont like it when I hear that you learned  
All this from some other guy  
  
But thats the kind of fella I am  
Thats the kind of fella I am  
Im a jealous kinda fella  
And I might fall in love with you  
Im a jealous kinda fella  
And I just might fall in love with you  
Hey  
  
So look out  
  
But thats the kind of fella I am  
Thats the kind of fella I am  
Im a jealous kinda fella  
And I might fall in love with you  
Im a jealous kinda fella  
And I just might fall in love with you  
Hey
