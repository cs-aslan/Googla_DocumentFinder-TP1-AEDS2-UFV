What do you say to someone who feels like theyve lost it all  
Over the edge with no one there to break their fall  
And what do you say to someone who feels so unloved  
Giving themselves away a little bit every day just to be good enough  
And what do you say to a hopeless soul who cant remember their way home  
And everything is out of their control  
  
Chorus  
There is no valley there is no darkness  
There is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus  
There is no moment there is no distance  
There is no heartbreak He cant take you through  
So before you think that youre too lost to save  
Remember there is nothing greater than grace  
  
What do you say to someone whose life is on the line  
And theyre unsure what happens after their last breath in time  
What do you say to someone whose built a wall you cant break through  
And its so hard for them to hear the truth  
  
There is no valley there is no darkness  
There is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus  
There is no moment there is no distance  
There is no heartbreak He cant take you through  
So before you think that youre too lost to save  
Remember there is nothing greater than grace  
  
So dont lose hope dont let go  
Dont give up you are not alone  
  
There is no valley there is no darkness  
There is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus  
There is no moment there is no distance  
There is no heartbreak He cant take you through  
So before you think that youre too lost to save  
So before you think that youre too lost to save  
Remember there is nothing greater than grace
