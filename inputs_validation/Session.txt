I dont know when it got this way  
I dont know how long shes gonna stay  
Every week its the same in her room  
Thats why I came  
  
Here I go I go again  
Our rendezvous never seem to end  
I know where Ill be Ill make this confession  
Back in her bed for another goddamn session  
  
Chorus  
Ill never learn  
God knows I try  
Keep coming back for session  
And I dont know why  
Ill never learn Ill never see  
Just tell me why these sessions got a hold on me  
  
Some might say its a fling  
For all I know it dont mean a thing  
Either way I cant complain  
Aint no strings  
Guess I got it made  
  
Here I go I go again  
Our rendezvous never seem to end  
I know where Ill be  
Ill make this confession  
Back in her bed for another goddamn session  
  
Chorus
