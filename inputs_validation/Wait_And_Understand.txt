I saw you yesterday with another girl  
When you looked my way  
I just pretended I didnt see you  
What else can I do  
  
Chorus  
You were all Ive wanted  
Cause you just dont seem to care  
You took me for granted  
And I dont think it is fair  
But my heart keeps telling me  
That youd be there for me  
And Ill just wait and understand  
  
When you looked my way  
I just pretended I didnt see you  
What else can I do  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
But my heart keeps telling me  
That youd be there for me  
So Ill just wait and understand  
  
Ooh
