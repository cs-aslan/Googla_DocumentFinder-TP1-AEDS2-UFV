Isnt it strange Feels like Im lookin in the mirror  
What would people say if only they knew that I was  
Part of some geneticists plan  
Born to be a carbon copy man  
There in a petri dish late one night  
They took a donors body cell and fertilized a human egg and so I say  
  
I think Im a clone now  
Theres always two of me just ahangin around  
I think Im a clone now  
Cause every chromosome is a handmedown  
  
Look at the way we go out walking close together  
I guess you could say Im really beside myself  
I still remember how it began  
They produced a carbon copy man  
Born in a science lab late one night  
Without a mother or a father  
Just a test tube and a womb with a view  
  
I think Im a clone now  
Theres always two of me just ahangin around  
I think Im a clone now  
Cause every chromosome is a handmedown  
I think Im a clone now  
And I can stay at home while Im out of town  
I think Im a clone now  
Cause every pair of genes is a handmedown  
  
Signing autographs for my fans  
Come and meet the carbon copy man  
Livin in stereo its all right  
Well I can be my own best friend and I can send myself for pizza so I say  
  
I think Im a clone now  
Another one of mes always hangin around  
I think Im a clone now  
Cause every chromosome is a handmedown  
I think Im a clone now  
Ive been on Oprah Winfrey Im world renowned  
I think Im a clone now  
And every pair of genes is a handmedown  
I think Im a clone now  
Thats my genetic twin always hangin around  
I think Im a clone now  
Cause every chromosome is a handmedown
