The street looks different tonight  
Something has changed  
I had this picture in mind  
But its just not the same  
  
Had this great expectation  
About a heart thats free  
I thought thats what I wanted  
Would be waiting for me  
  
Chorus  
Baby somethings missing tonight  
Something aint feeling right  
Baby somethings wrong and Im so confused  
Baby somethings missing inside  
Something I cant find in the night  
I finally realized what Im missing is you  
  
In this crowd of old friends  
Why do I feel alone  
I thought Id fall back in step  
This is where I belong  
  
I thought that freedom was a voice  
Calling from the dark  
Now I see I was only free  
When you were in my heart  
  
Chorus  
  
I thought that freedom was a voice  
Calling from the dark  
Now I see I was only free  
When you were in my heart  
  
Chorus
