Christmas time  
Comes once a year  
Christmas times  
The time that all should bring  
Good cheer  
Once a year  
  
Oh Christmas bells  
They keep ringing  
Little children  
Are singing  
Waiting for  
Dear old Santa  
To bring all the toys  
For girls and boys  
  
Christmas time  
Comes once a year  
Christmas times  
The time that all should bring  
Good cheer  
Once a year  
  
Christmas cards  
To send away  
To the ones  
Who brought us  
Still our friends  
Once a year  
  
Christmas bells  
They keep ringing  
Little children  
Are singing  
Waiting for  
Dear old Santa  
To bring all the toys  
For girls and boys

The Christmas bells will ring

The day has come  
Its Christmas time  
Once a year
