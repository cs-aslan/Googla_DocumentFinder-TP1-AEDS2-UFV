If I could only win your love  
Id make the most of everything  
Id proudly wear your wedding ring  
My heart would never stray when youre away  
  
If I could only win your love  
Id give my all to make it live  
Youll never know how much I give  
If I could only win your love  
  
Oh how can I ever say  
How I crave your love when your gone away  
Oh how can I ever show  
How I burn inside when you hold me tight  
  
If I could only win your love  
Id give my all to make it live  
Youll never know how much I give  
If I could only win your love  
  
Oh how can I ever say  
How I crave your love when your gone away  
Oh how can I ever show  
How I burn inside when you hold me tight  
  
If I could only win your love  
Id give my all to make it live  
Youll never know how much I give  
If I could only win your love
