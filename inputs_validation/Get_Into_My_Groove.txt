Politicians knocking at my door  
Heads of nations rotten to the core  
Tell me how are you gonna change the world  
When you havent got the love  
  
I still remember your promise from the past  
And here you are with another that wont last  
You tell me how youre gonna change the world  
When you havent got the love  
  
Dont shake me by the hand  
Pretend to understand  
To get into my mind  
You got to get into my groove  
Step into my shoes  
Come and feel my blues  
To comprehend my life  
You got to get into my groove  
  
You say youre standing for the hungry and the weak  
But your words are as hollow as the glory that you seek  
Tell me how youre gonna change the world  
When you havent got the love  
  
You want the world to see your point of view  
But your eyes are closed to the pain we must undo  
Tell me how youre gonna change the world  
When you havent got the love  
  
Before you tell the world about the things that they should do  
Stop and take a look whats going on inside of you  
Divisions are the consequences of the games you play  
Look inside you
