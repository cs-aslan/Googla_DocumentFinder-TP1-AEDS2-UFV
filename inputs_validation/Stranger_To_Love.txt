Take me oh I need it now  
Shake me to love somehow  
I need warm embraces yes I do  
I need smiling faces to look into  
I know that time erases the wounds of man  
  
Love is not all I crave  
I know theres a world to save  
But Ive always done my best  
And I think Ive passed every test  
  
But theres something about a brand new heart  
  
Send me a stranger to love  
I need a stranger to love  
Send me a stranger to love  
So I can leave my past behind  
My past behind my past behind mmm my past  
My past behind my past behind  
  
I know that love may not come  
But if I can dream like everyone  
Id dream the warming feelin of an early spring  
Id dream the magic elation a touch can bring  
I wanna capture the feelin of a newborn heart  
  
Send me a stranger to love  
Send me a stranger to love  
I need a stranger to love  
So I can leave my past behind  
My past behind my past behind yeah yeah yeah  
My past behind my past behind  
  
Send me a stranger to love  
I wanna stranger to love oh yeah  
Send me a stranger to love  
So I can leave my past wanna throw it out the door  
My past behind  
Ooh ooh baby baby my baby yeah  
My past behind  
My past behind my past behind  
  
Ive been lookin for a brand new mind  
Theres somethin bout a brand new start
