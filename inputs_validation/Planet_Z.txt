Sitting in my easy chair  
I got no friends but I really dont care  
I dont remember birthdays  
I dont remember names  
People talk to me  
I know not what they say  
Well my political policy is laissezfaire  
You keep off my thoroughfare  
My weeds grow like roses  
My gardens like greed  
My temples are discotheques for refugees  
  
Chorus  
Its all about me  
On my very own Planet Z  
Where Im lonely but Im free  
Nothing gets in my way  
I think Im gonna have to stay right here  
Repeat  
  
Well my pizza delivery guys they all wear suits  
And all my musicians they play in the nude  
The lawyers wear nipple rings  
They kiss my ass  
And the french horn players are  
In the most demand  
  
Chorus  
  
Planet Z  
You cant predict the weather  
But its fine with me  
Cant you see  
I dont like when you bother me  
Planet Z  
The stars are brighter in my galaxy  
Thirteen moons revolve around around around  
  
Chorus  
  
Well these lovely little snowflakes are everywhere  
Theyre the spitballs that you blow in my hair  
Well I wont remember your birthday  
I wont remember your name  
Just keep talking to me  
Im not listening  
  
Chorus
