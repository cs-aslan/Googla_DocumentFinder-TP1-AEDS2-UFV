Someone elses date  
In someone elses door  
Theres a girl with cherry Chapstick on and nothing more  
Its such a lurid pose  
And she seems this close  
But not to me  
  
Clear as day  
Crawling home at night  
Wondering why the girls dont look at me when I walk by  
And the way they make me feel is way too real to believe  
  
Wondering what it could be like if I could be that smooth  
I could think about all that I missed out  
Its hard to do  
  
Someone elses date  
In someone elses door  
Theres a girl with cherry Chapstick on and nothing more  
Its such a lurid pose  
And she seems this close  
But not to me  
  
Running around in circles all day long
