Intro  
My momma aint raise no fool nigga  
Matter of fact maybe she did  
My momma raised a fool haha  
But that dont mean we cant get rich  
Too rich too rich  
Thats what they say  
  
Verse 1  
Humble beginnings rich ass endings  
Pockets on swole big ass benjies  
Started off losin man it wasnt choosin  
Stuck with my niggas now we all winnin  
Rollin up paper ball like a Laker  
Top on the building Im high as a scraper  
What can I say now cops know my name now  
No time to play round Im rich and Im paid now  
Stay on that piece for shit for niggas that spray rounds  
Hear all the talk they gon come see you any day now  
Try not to fade now try to find a way out  
Nobodies innocent nigga get down or lay down  
Made so much money but look how Id paid out  
Dont trust the bank no more so I went and got a safe in my house  
Guess all these diamonds on my wrist what you blinkin about  
Its all my money on my mind when Im thinkin about  
  
Hook  
Try to be the best that I can  
They got the right decisions handle it like a man  
You know I try to do shit with my heart  
They talk but I dont listen  
I just finish what I start  
You know I tried the niggas that said I cant  
They got the right decisions handle business like a man  
You know I try when people say I should change  
Sometimes Im done with trying Im just trying to be the same  
  
Verse 2  
Niggas still hating critics still waiting  
Said that Id change my ways and start catching these cases  
But never said Id stop counting these faces  
Flyin new places buying them cases  
Niggas want problems I dont entertain it  
Cause if its real problems Its not entertainment  
Im rollin a joint up precise like a painter  
The grind is what made us the grind is what made us  
Now the niggas that I grew up with lookin richer  
Too much turnin up the club owners tryin to censor  
Tatted everywhere my full body full of scriptures  
Pull up in the phantom paparazzi takin pictures  
Sellin so much swag we should be your swag vender  
Big winner in the club big cash spender  
Throwin signs to my man like he a damn pitcher  
Some shit you cant witness my nigga we been business  
  
Hook  
Try to be the best that I can  
They got the right decisions handle business like a man  
You know I try to do shit with my heart  
They talk but I dont listen  
I just finish what I start  
You know I tried the niggas that said I cant  
They got the right decisions handle business like a man  
You know I try when people say I should change  
Sometimes Im done with trying Im just trying to be the same
