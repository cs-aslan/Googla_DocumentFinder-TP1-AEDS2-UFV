The sheltering shade of the forest  
Calling calming silence  
Accompanied only by the full moon  
The howling of the night wolf  
And the path under my bare feet  
The Elvenpath  
  
Sung female  
Hearing music from the deepest forest  
Songs as a seduction of sirens  
The elffolk is calling me  
  
Tapio Bearking Ruler of the forest  
Mielikki Bluecloak Healer of the Ill and sad  
Open the gate and let me follow the uncarven path  
  
The way to the lands  
Where as a hero I stand  
The path where Beauty met the Beast  
Elvenpath  
Its the honesty of these worlds  
Ruled by magic and mighty swords  
That makes my soul long for the past  
Elvenpath  
  
The moonwitch took me to a ride on a broomstick  
Introduced me to her old friend home gnome  
Told me to keep the sauna warm for him  
  
At the grove I met the rest  the folk of my fantasies  
Bilbo Sparhawk goblins and pixies  
Snowman Willow trolls and the seven dwarves  
The path goes forever on  
  
The way to the lands  
Where as a hero I stand  
The path where Beauty met the Beast  
Elvenpath  
Its the honesty of these worlds  
Ruled by magic and mighty swords  
That makes my soul long for the past  
Elvenpath  
  
Spoken male  
Long ago  
In the early years of the Second Age  
Great elven smiths forged rings of power  
  
Sung female  
As I return to my room  
And as sleep takes me by my hand  
Madrigals from the woods  
Carry me to neverland  
In this spellbound night  
The worlds an elvish sight  
In this spellbound night  
The worlds an elvish sight  
  
But then the Dark Lord learned  
The craft of ring making and made the master ring
