Im in love with a German film star  
I once saw in a bar  
Sitting in a corner in imperfect clothes  
Trying not to pose  
For the cameras and the girls  
Its a glamorous world  
Im in love with a German film star  
I once saw in a movie  
Playing the part of a real troublemaker  
But I didnt care  
It really moved me it really moved me
