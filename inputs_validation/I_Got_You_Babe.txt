People say that we dont know  
What love is or how to make it grow  
Well I dont know if all thats true  
Cause you got me and baby I got you  
Oh babe I got you babe I got you babe  
Say our love wont pay the rent  
Before its earned our moneys all been spent  
I guess thats sure we dont have a lot  
But at least Im sure of all the things weve got  
Oh babe I got you babe I got you babe  
I got flowers in the spring yeah  
Ive got you Ive got you to wear my ring  
And when Im sad youre a clown  
And when I get scared youre always around  
Let them say we are wrong  
I dont care with you I cant go wrong  
But with our love like yours and mine  
There aint no hill or mountain we cant climb  
Oh babe I got you babe I got you babe  
I got you to hold my hand  
I got you to understand  
I got you to walk with me  
And I got you to talk with me  
I got you to kiss goodnight  
I got you hold me tight  
I got you I wont let go  
I got you to love me so  
Oh babe I got you babe I got you babe  
I got you babe I got you babe I got you babe
