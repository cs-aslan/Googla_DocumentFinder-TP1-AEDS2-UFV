I was lost till you were found  
But I never knew how far down  
I was falling  
Before I reached the bottom  
I was cold and you were fire  
And I never knew how the pyre  
Could be burning  
On the edge of the ice field  
  
And the now chilly California wind  
Is blowing down our bodies again  
And were sinking deeper and deeper in the chilly California sand  
Oh I know you belong inside my aching heart  
And cant you see my faded Levis bursting apart  
And dont you hear me crying  
Oh Babe dont go  
And dont you hear me screaming  
How was I to know  
  
Im in the middle of nowhere  
Near the end of the line  
But theres a border to somewhere waiting  
And theres a tankful of time  
Oh give me just another moment to see the light of the day  
And take me to another land where I dont have to stay  
  
And Im gonna need somebody to make me feel like you do  
And I will receive somebody with open arms open eyes  
Open up the sky and let the planet that I love shine through  
  
For crying out loud  
You know I love you  
For crying out loud  
You know I love you  
For crying out loud  
You know I love you  
  
I was damned and you were saved  
And I never knew how enslaved  
I was kneeling  
In the chains of my master  
  
I could laugh but you could cry  
And I never knew just how high  
I was flying  
Ah with you right above me  
  
Im in the middle of nowhere  
Near the end of the line  
But theres a border to somewhere waiting  
And theres a tankful of time  
Oh give me just another moment to see the light of the day  
And take me to another land where I dont have to stay  
  
And Im gonna need somebody to make me feel like you do  
And I will receive somebody with open arms open eyes  
Open up the sky and let the planet that I love shine through  
  
For crying out loud  
You know I love you  
For crying out loud  
You know I love your  
For crying out loud  
You know I love you  
  
For taking in the rain when Im feeling so dry  
For giving me the answers when Im asking you why  
And my oh my  
For that I thank you  
  
For taking in the sun when Im feeling so cold  
For giving me a child when my body is old  
And dont you know  
For that I need you  
  
For coming to my room when you know Im alone  
For finding me a highway and driving me home  
And you gotta know  
For that I serve you  
  
For pulling me away when Im starting to fall  
For revving me up when Im starting to stall  
And all in all  
For that I want you  
  
For taking and for giving and for playing the game  
For praying for my future in the days that remain  
Oh Lord  
For that I hold you  
  
Ah but most of all  
For cryin out loud  
For that I love you  
  
Ah but most of all  
For cryin out loud  
For that I love you  
  
Ah but most of all  
For cryin out loud  
For that I love you  
  
When youre crying out loud  
You know I love you
