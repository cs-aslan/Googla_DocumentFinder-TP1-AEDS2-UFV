Touche damour  
Yours is a sunny day  
Of this Im sure  blowing my clouds away  
Ijust dont know what this will do to me  
I only want it to be  
Touche damour  
Touche damour  
Yeah  
Touche damour  
Im sailing around the room  
Like never before could never have come too soon  
I want this dance to last forever  
For it to last forever more  
Touche damour  
Touche damour  
Yeah  
I want this dance to last forever  
For it to last forever more  
Touche damour

Touche damour

Touche damour
