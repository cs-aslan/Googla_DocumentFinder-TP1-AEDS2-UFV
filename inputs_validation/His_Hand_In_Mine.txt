You may ask me how I know my Lord is real my Lord is real  
You may doubt the things I say and doubt the way I feel the way I feel  
But I know hes real today hell always be hell always be  
I can feel his hand in mine and thats enough for me  
  
I will never walk alone he holds my hand he holds my hand  
He will guide each step I take  
And if I fall I know hell understand  
Till the day he tells me why he loves me so he loves me so  
I can feel his hand in mine  
Thats all I need to know  
  
I will never walk alone he holds my hand he holds my hand  
He will guide each step I take  
And if I fall I know hell understand  
Till the day he tells me why he loves me so he loves me so  
I can feel his hand in mine  
Thats all I need to know  
  
I can feel his hand in mine  
Thats all I need to know
