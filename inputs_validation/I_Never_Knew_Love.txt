I asked you to come inside my heart  
And there you were  
I asked for a pure and gentle start  
And there you were  
I asked if this love could ever be  
The way that Ive dreamt of it you see  
I never knew love  
I asked you to open up my eyes  
And there you were  
I asked for the keys to paradise  
And there you were  
They say only ask and youll receive  
I never knew that applied to me  
I never knew love  
Life is good life is sweet  
Its the way that we perceive  
Cynics say we can dream  
Change your mind heal the world  
Its easy just believe  
I asked for a change in all my life  
And there you were  
Youre everything I had hoped to find  
Yes there you were  
I hope and I pray that you will find  
A peace and a joy as great as mine  
All about love  
I hope you find love
