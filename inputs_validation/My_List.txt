Let me wrap myself around you  
Youll show me how I see it  
And when you come back in from nowhere  
Do you ever think of me  
Your heart not able  
Let me show you how much I care  
I need those eyes to tide me over  
Ill take your picture when I go  
Gives me strength and gives me patience  
But Ill never let you know  
I got nothing on you babe  
But I always said Ill try  
Let me show you  
How much I care  
Sometimes it gets hard  
Dont you know  
  
Chorus x 3  
Dont give the ghost up  
Just clench your fist  
You should know by now  
You were on my list  
  
Your heart not able  
Your ways  theyre not able  
Let me show you  
How much I care  
Sometimes it gets hard  
And dont ya know  
  
Chorus x 3  
  
When you rock and roll with me  
Theres nowhere else Id rather be  
When you rock and roll with me  
Theres nowhere else Id rather be
