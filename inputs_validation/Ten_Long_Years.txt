My baby she insylts all my friends  
This lady with islands to defend  
My baby she rules our house with force  
She plagues me I wish I could divorce  
  
Playing football with my feelings  
Making mincemeat of my friends  
Divorce is far too good for you  
Its death that us must part Honey  
Oh for these ten long years to end  
  
My baby I never tried to wed  
Someone held a shotgun to my head  
And lately Ive little cause to smile  
Ever since she goosestepped down the aisle  
  
My baby she walked out in the end  
Basically shed shafted all her friends  
But major peace without her wont be found  
Till my sweethearts rotting underground
