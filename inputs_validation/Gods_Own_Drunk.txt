Well like to explain to you all before  
I aint no drinkin man  
I tried it once and it got me highly irregular  
And I swore Id never do it again  
I promised my brother inlaw that Id go up watch his still  
  
While he went in to town to vote  
It was right up on the mountain  
Where the map said it would be  
Friends let me tell you one thing  
Tho it wasnt no ordinary still  
It stood up on that mountainside  
Like a hugh golden opal  
  
Gods yeller moon shinin on the cool clear evenin  
Gods little lanterns twinklin on and off in the heavens  
Like I explaind to you once before I aint no drinkin man  
But temptation got the best of me  
And I took a slash  
That yella whiskey runnin down my throat  
Like honey dew vine water  
And I took another slash  
Took anothern an anothern an anothern  
For you knew Id downed one whole jug of that shit  
And commenced to gettin hot flashes  
  
Goose pimples was runnin up and down my body  
And a feelin came over me  
Like somethin Id never experienced before  
It was like like I was in love  
  
In love for the first time with anything that moved  
Animate inanimate it didnt matter  
Its like theres a great neon sign flashin on an off  
In my brain sayin Jimmy Buffett theres a great day a comin  
Cause I was drunk  
I wasnt knee crawlin slip slidin Reggie Youngin  
Commode huggin drunk  
I was Gods own drunk and a fearless man  
  
And thats when I first saw the bear  
He was a Kodiak lookin fella bout nineteen feet tall  
He rambled up over the hill  
Expectin me to do one of two things  
Flip or fly I didnt do either one  
It hung him up  
  
He started sniffin around my body tryin to smell fear  
But he aint gonna smell no fear cause  
Im Gods own drunk and a fearless man  
It hung him up  
  
He looked right in my eyes and my eyes  
Was a lot redder than his was  
It hung him up  
  
So I approached him I said Mr Bear I love  
Every hair on your twentyseven acre body  
I know you got a lot of friends over there  
On the other side of the hill  
  
Theres ole rare bear tall bear Freddy bear Kelly bear  
Really bear smelly the bear smokey the bear  
Pokey the bear  
  
I want you to go back over there tonight  
And tell them Im feelin right  
You tell them I love each and everyone of them  
Like a brother and a sister  
  
But if they give me any trouble tonight  
Im gonna run every God damn one of them off the hill  
He took two steps backwards and didnt know what to think  
Neither did I but bein charitable and cautious  
Well hell I approached him again  
  
I said Mr Bear You know in the eyes of the Lord  
Were both beasts when it comes right down to it  
So I want you to be my buddy Buddy bear  
So I took ole buddy bear by his island size paw  
And I led him over to the still  
Hes a sniffin around that thing cause  
Hes smellin somethin good  
I gave him one of them jugs of honey dew vine water  
He downed it up right  
  
Looked like one of them damn bears in the circus  
Sippin sasparilly in the moonlight  
I gave him anothern an anothern an anothern  
For I knew it he downed eight of them  
And commenced to doin the bear dance  
Two snips a snort a fly turn and a grunt  
It was so simple like the jitter bug  
It plum evaded me  
  
We worked ourselves into a tumultuous uproar  
And I was awful tired and went over to the hillside  
And I laid down and went to sleep  
Slept for four hours and dreampt me some tremulous dreams  
When I woke up there was Gods yeller moon  
Shinin on the clear cool evenin  
Gods little lanterns twinklin on and off  
In the heavens  
  
My buddy the bear was a missin  
Want to know something else friends and neighbors  
So was that still
