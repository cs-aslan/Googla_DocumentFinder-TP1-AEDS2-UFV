Hey grace oh night is you know a couple of hours a day for nothing  
If you can hope you can hold on to your heaven  
Remember it when you said once you tell  
cause what you dont know you dont know it gets you in trouble  
Sometimes you know you dont know  find your way  
But now watching over you now Ill get you over  
If you dont pretend you know what you dont know you dont know again  
Im gonna walk back in your arms  
If Im only invited back again
