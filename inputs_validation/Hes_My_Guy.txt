Hes my guy  
I dont care what he does  
Cause hes my guy  
I guess he always was  
He careless about me  
I dont think he tries  
But once in a while  
hell hug me and smile  
Then I can see me in his eyes  
  
Oh hes my guy  
I know hell always be  
And I will try  
To keep him loving me  
However he wants me  
Im his until I die  
For nobody knows better than I  
That hes my guy  
  
Oh hes my guy  
I know hell always be  
And I will try  
To keep him loving me  
However he wants me  
Im his until I die  
For nobody knows better than I  
That hes my guy
