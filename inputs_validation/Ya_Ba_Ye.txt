Ya bi na ya  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
You run  
My mothers always told me  
ya binti  
Dont forget  
min fain inTi  
Remember who you are  
Listen to the voice  
That plays in your head  
Make the right choice  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
ya bi na ya  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
You run  
My mother says my mother says  
ya ba ye ya ba ye  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
You run  
I had to see it my way  
Cause life is very short  
The more I try to learn  
The less I seem to know  
Oh  I cry in my bed  
Ye I miss my home  
The home I cant forget  
I hear my mothers voice  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
ya bi na ya  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
You cry  
My mother says my mother says  
ya ba ye ya ba ye  
Dont run away  
ya ba ye ya ba ye  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
ya bi na ya  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
You run  
My mother says my mother says  
ya ba ye ya ba ye  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
ya bi na ya  
Dont run away  
ya ba ye ya ba ye  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
You cry  
Dont run away  
ya ba ye ya ba ye  
Dont run away  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
You run
