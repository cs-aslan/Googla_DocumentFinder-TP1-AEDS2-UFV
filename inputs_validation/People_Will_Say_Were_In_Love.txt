Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours  
Why do the neighbors chatter all day behind their doors  
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue  
Here is the gist a practical list of donts for you  
  
Dont throw bouquets at me  
Dont please my folks too much  
Dont laugh at my jokes too much  
People will say were in love  
  
Dont sigh and gaze at me  
Your sighs are so like mine  
Your eyes mustnt glow like mine  
People will say were in love  
  
Dont start collecting things  
Give me my rose and my glove  
Sweetheart theyre suspecting things  
People will say were in love  
  
Dont praise my charm too much  
Dont look so vain with me  
Dont stand in the rain with me  
People will say were in love  
  
Dont take my arm too much  
Dont keep your hand in mine  
Your hand feels so grand in mine  
People will say were in love  
  
Dont dance all night with me  
Till the stars fade from above  
Theyll see its alright with me  
People will say were in love
