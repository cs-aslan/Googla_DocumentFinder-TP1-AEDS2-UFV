Last time I said I was in control  
I had 25 debts and we both know  
When you come back now  
Youll see my face  
I said 25 debts and we both pray  
  
While I move away  
Hard times dont come until tomorrow  
These eyes dont see  
Take your skin off when you listen to me  
Move away  
Hard times dont come until tomorrow  
These eyes in me  
Take your skin off when youre talkin to me  
Me  
  
Oh what a world that we both come in  
I said hold it to the rock and let it in  
Oh what a world that we are in  
I said hold it to the rock and were both in  
  
While I move away  
Hard times dont come until tomorrow  
These eyes dont see  
Take your skin off when you listen to me  
Move away  
Hard times dont come until tomorrow  
These eyes dont see  
Take your skin off when youre listenin to me  
  
Dont worry bout what might have been  
Just tell your woman that youre sorry  
And you jumped out of your skin  
Listen closely to your motto  
Dont worry bout what might have been  
Tell the jury that youre sorry  
And just jump out of your skin  
I wanna jump out of my skin  
I wanna jump out of my skin  
And watch the clouds  
  
Move away  
Im never gonna live it down  
Move away  
Move away  
Move move move move away  
Move away  
  
Move away  
Hard times dont come until tomorrow  
These eyes dont see  
Take your skin off when you listen to me  
Move away  
Hard times dont come until tomorrow  
Move away  
Move away  
Move away  
Move away
