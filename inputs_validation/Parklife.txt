Confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur  
Of what is known as  
Parklife  
And morning soup can be avoided  
If you take a route straight through what is known as  
Parklife  
  
Johns got brewers croop he gets intimidated  
By the dirty pigeons they love a bit of him  
Parklife  
Whos that gut lord marching  
You should cut down on your porklife mate get some exercise  
  
All the people  
So many people  
They all go hand in hand  
Hand in hand through their parklife  
Know what I mean  
  
I get up when I want except on Wednesdays  
When I get rudely awakened by the dustman  
Parklife  
I put my trousers on have a cup of tea  
And I think about leaving the house  
Parklife  
  
I feed the pigeons I sometimes feed the sparrows too  
It gives me a sense of enormous wellbeing  
Parklife  
And then Im happy for the rest of the day safe in the knowledge  
There will always be a bit of my heart devoted to it  
  
All the people  
So many people  
And they all go hand in hand  
Hand in hand through their Parklife  
  
Parklife  
Parklife  
Parklife  
Parklife  
  
Its got nothing to do with  
Vorsprung durch technique you know  
Parklife  
And its not about you joggers  
Who go round and round and round  
Parklife  
  
All the people  
So many people  
And they all go hand in hand  
Hand in hand through their Parklife  
  
All the people  
So many people  
And they all go hand in hand  
Hand in hand through their Parklife
