Let me love you come close to me  
Locked in my arms youll still be free  
  
Refrain  
Dont be frightened  
My half flyin blue bird  
Coz my love has no walls  
No walls no ceilings  
No walls no ceilings no floors  
Go on and fly high in the sky  
Ill never try to burn your wings  
  
All my love songs are just for you  
Sing them with me and when you do  
  
Refrain  
Dont be frightened  
My half flyin blue bird  
Coz my love has no walls  
No walls no ceilings  
No walls no ceilings no floors  
Go on and fly high in the sky  
Ill never try to burn your wings  
  
 Fly high in the sky  
  
Instrumental  
  
All my love songs are just for you  
Sing them with me and when you do  
  
Refrain  
Dont be frightened  
My half flyin blue bird  
Coz my love has no walls  
No walls no ceilings  
No walls no ceilings no floors
