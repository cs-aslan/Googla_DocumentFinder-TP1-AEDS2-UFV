Theres a place in the city they call the Archway  
Where we rented three rooms for a dollar a day  
and I worked semiskilled at the capstans for years  
And my wife was a good woman but the love disappeared  
Sons and Daughters Daughters and Sons  
When a marriage goes down theyre the loneliest ones  
Sons and Daughters Daughters and Sons  
How I hope they can cope with the damage Ive done  
I found me a band I went out on tour  
So the kids wouldnt know I was with them no more  
When they said Wheres me dad Shed say Hes a star  
Oh if only stars knew what fools they all are  
Sons and Daughters Daughters and Sons  
When a marriage goes down theyre the loneliest ones  
Sons and Daughters Daughters and Sons  
How I hope they can cope with the damage Ive done  
I got a new contract I got a new life  
No more capstans for me and Ive got a new wife  
Sometimes she gets angry says she wants a family  
Then that nightmare returns like a ghost haunting me  
Sons and Daughters Daughters and Sons  
When a marriage breaks up youre the loneliest ones  
Sons and Daughters Daughters and Sons  
How I hope you all cope with the damage we done
