Why arent you here Its almost 4 am  
I finished up all of your beer now Im startin on your gin  
I went through your diary flipped through your phone book  
Called all your friends I just wanna know where you been  
I just wanna know where you been  
I pulled back your sheets now Im crawlin in your bed  
Every drinks one more defeat and every footstep hurts my head  
I dont want excuses I dont wanna hear that you were out with your friends  
I just wanna know where you been I just wanna know where you been  
I hope you crash your mommas car  
I hope you pass out in some bar  
I hope you catch some kinda flu  
Lets say I wish the worst for you  
I hope youre happy with yourself  
I hope you found somebody else  
Cause I aint askin you again  
I just wanna know where you been  
I just wanna know where you been  
Why am I here Ive got better things to do  
I could hang out on the pier down by the Hudson sniffin glue  
I guess Im a looser but I like being miserable swimming in sin  
I just wanna know where you been I just wanna know where you been  
I hope you crash your mommas car  
I hope you pass out in some bar  
I hope you catch some kinda flu  
Lets say I wish the worst for you  
I hope youre happy with yourself  
I hope you found somebody else  
Cause I aint askin you again  
I just wanna know where you been  
I just wanna know where you been  
I just wanna know where you been  
I just wanna know where you been
