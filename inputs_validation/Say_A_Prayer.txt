Say a prayer for all the souls in bloom cut down  
Far too soon under the scarlet moon  
Under the scarlet moon  
Say a prayer  
  
So what are you weaving there marionette  
Keepin your balance by a single thread  
Keepin your heart strings tight and pure  
All you can muster and nothing more and nothing more  
Until youre sore and still youre sore when do you soar  
Sometimes justice is the line you walk or sign  
But justice is complex and a matter of time  
Sometimes its hanging in the balance or  
Dancing in the shadow like a silhouette  
So what are you weaving there marionnette  
So what are you weaving there marionnette  
Say a prayer for all the souls in bloom cut down  
Far too soon under the scarlet moon  
Say a prayer go on say a prayer  
  
Some people get a sadness so long  
They just go on thinking its a natural thing  
Some people throw their hands in the sky  
And they wonder why god dont reply  
Well its strange strange time all our friends  
Dropping like flies everything thats come to pass  
All the time we thought would last  
Well Ill just button my coat and cover my neck  
I got barely enough time to catch my breath  
All these pictures I cant forget  
It can fill your cup with regret  
It can fill your cup with regret  
Say a prayer for all the souls in bloom  
Say a prayersay a prayer
