These days its hard to make love last so hard to do it  
Seems these days it comes and goes so fast  
So easy to lose it  
  
Promise me now promise with you Ill find  
One love to stand the test of time  
  
Swear swear to your heart swear  
That youre never never gonna leave me  
Swear swear to your heart  
That youre never gonna go  
I I wanna hear  
That youre always always gonna love me  
Swear swear to your heart  
  
Weve got to make a solemn vow keep it forever  
Know whatever happens that somehow well keep it together  
  
Ill pledge my heart Ill pledge my soul to you  
Just take my hand and say that you  
  
Swear swear to your heart swear  
That youre never never gonna leave me  
Swear swear to your heart  
That youre never gonna go  
I I wanna hear  
That youre always always gonna love me  
Swear swear to your heart  
  
That youre gonna stand beside me  
Always be there  
If you really care  
Just stand here beside me and swear  
  
Swear  
Swear  
  
Ill pledge my heart Ill pledge my soul to you  
Just take my hand and say that you  
  
Swear swear to your heart swear  
That youre never never gonna leave me  
Swear swear to your heart  
That youre never gonna go  
I I wanna hear  
That youre always always gonna love me  
Swear swear to your heart
