Ill be down to get you in a taxi honey  
Better be ready bout half past eight  
I mean dont be late  
Be there when the band starts playin  
Remember when you get there honey  
Dance all over the floor  
Dance all over my shoes  
When the band plays the Jelly Roll blues  
Set em all alight  
  
At the darktown strutters ball  
Ill be down to get you in a push cart honey  
Better be ready bout half past eight  
I mean dont be late  
Be there when the band starts playin  
  
Member when you get there honey  
Shim sham wins them all  
Dance all over my shoes  
When the band plays the Jelly Rolls blues  
Set em all alight  
At the darktown strutters ball
