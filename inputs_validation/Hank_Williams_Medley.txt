I tried so hard my dear to show  
That youre my evry dream  
Yet youre afraid each thing I do  
Is but some evil scheme  
In anger unkind words are said  
That makes the teardrops start  
Why cant I free your doubtful mind  
And melt your cold cold heart  
  
Today I passed you on the street  
And my heart fell at your feet  
I cant help it  
If Im still in love with you  
Another love was by your side  
And he looked so satisfied  
I cant help it  
If Im still in love with you  
  
Change to key of g  
The news is out all over town  
That youve been seen out runnin round  
I know that I should go but then  
I just cant go you win again  
  
If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares  
There is one whose smiling face that god would see  
For shell walk along beside me up those golden stairs  
Oh theyll never never take her love from me  
  
Change to key of a bridge to d  
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel  
That should be ringing now for you and me  
At home alone I hang my head in sorrow  
Those wedding bells will never ring for me  
  
Change to key of e  
So take these chains from my heart and set me free  
Youve grown cold and no longer care for me  
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on  
Take these chains from my heart and set me free  
  
Change to key of f  
Your cheatin heart will make you weep  
Youll cry and cry and try to sleep  
But sleep wont come the whole night through  
Your cheatin heart will tell on yououou
