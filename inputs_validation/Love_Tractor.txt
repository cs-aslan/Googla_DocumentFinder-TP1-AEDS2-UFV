Im holding the key  
I need no license to ride  
Dad said that Im alright  
  
The engines still warm  
Shed been waiting for me in the barn  
Gonna make me feel  
Gonna make me feel alright  
  
Well Im bouncin in my seat  
I try to remember where all the levers are  
Ive got enough fuel this time  
Ive got enough fuel this time to remember  
  
The engines still warm  
Shes been waiting for me in the barn  
Gonna let me feel gonna help me feel  
  
Well Im bouncin in my seat  
I try to remember where all the levers are  
Ive got enough fuel this time  
Ive got enough fuel this time to remember  
  
Enter the Earth  
Were scratching our play on the growth of the moon  
Mom said that Im alright
