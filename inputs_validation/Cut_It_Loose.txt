Its July but its winter in your mind  
Youve been down but never quite this way before  
  
Its a crime to watch the needle take another soul  
Look around see the poison killing people by the score  
  
Youve got into something thats leading you nowhere cut it loose  
Yeah yeah cut it loose turn it out  
Getting deeper into something that leaves you with nothing cut it loose  
Yeah yeah cut it loose turn it out  
  
Every time you escape into the wilderness  
You will find its stolen just a little more of you  
  
You say youre fine but its only your imagination  
Such a shame cause youve only got yourself to blame  
  
Youve got into something thats leading you nowhere cut it loose  
Yeah yeah cut it loose turn it out  
Getting deeper into something that leaves you with nothing cut it loose  
Yeah yeah cut it loose turn it out  
  
Such a shame youve only got yourself to blame  
  
Youve got into something thats leading you nowhere cut it loose  
Yeah yeah cut it loose turn it out  
Getting deeper into something that leaves you with nothing cut it loose  
Yeah yeah cut it loose turn it out
