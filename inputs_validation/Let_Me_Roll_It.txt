You gave me something  
I understand  
You gave me loving in the palm of my hand  
  
I cant tell you how I feel  
My heart is like a wheel  
Let me roll it  
Let me roll it to you  
Let me roll it  
Let me toll it to you  
  
I want to tell you  
And nows the time  
I want to tell you that  
Youre going to be mine  
  
I cant tell you how I feel  
My heart is like a wheel  
Let me roll it  
Let me roll it to you  
Let me roll it  
Let me roll it to you
