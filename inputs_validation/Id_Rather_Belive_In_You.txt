Id rather belive in you  
Writers thom Mchugh bruce miller  
  
I should go out tonight  
And get on with my life  
Break these chains of solitude  
A little luck and a little help  
I might even find myself  
In the arms of someone new  
  
But once youve loved somebody  
It aint that easy to do  
Once youve somebody  
Like Ive loved you  
  
Look what youve gone and done  
Youve ruined it for anyone  
Who tries to steal this heart away  
I cant get you off my mind  
Ive told myself a million times  
A little time is all it takes  
  
But once youve loved somebody  
It aint that easy to do  
Once youve somebody  
Like Ive loved you  
  
I gave you everything that I had to give  
I dont know if I can go that far again  
  
But once youve loved somebody  
It aint that easy to do  
Once youve somebody  
Like Ive loved you  
  
Oh once youve loved somebody  
Oh like Ive loved you
