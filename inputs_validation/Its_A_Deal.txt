Wooh  
Shes my baby Ill tell you  
Just exactly what I used to do  
I will leave just to leave you alone  
Baby baby when I go home  
  
Well love you baby I dont think I will  
Say the words but the bells go still  
Its true baby that I want you to stay  
But if that remains you got to pay your will  
Pay your will yeah yeah yeah  
  
Well I made you cry hang your head  
Life here was just smart and vain  
With your guys baby and youve gotta see  
When youre alone you want to make a deal  
  
Well now love you baby I dont think I will  
Say the words but the bells go still  
Its true baby that I want you to stay  
But if that remains you got to pay your will  
Pay your will yeah wooh wooh  
  
I wouldnt hurt but you can feel  
Im leaving withdrawn you say its a deal  
You may see inside my head  
I love you baby but youre far away  
  
Well now love you baby I dont think I will  
Say the words but the bells go still  
Its true baby that I want you to stay  
But if that remains you got to pay your will  
Pay your will yeah yeah yeah  
  
Pay your will now yeah yeah  
Pay your will yeah  
Oh yeah woohh
