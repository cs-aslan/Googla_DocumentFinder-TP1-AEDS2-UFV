This is the last time I know Im bout to drive you crazy  
Last time but I gotta see my baby

Try to walk but I just cant leave her alone girl  
She keep callin me

I try to leave her alone but she keep callin me  
Callin me  
And I gotta go  
Damn here we go again I just came back girl dont make me go again  
She say you been in the streets you was with that hoe again  
Money wrapped in rubber bands what you sellin blow again  
How she got you holdin guns but you call that hoe your friend  
You aint posed to bring her home what do you show her in  
I was like show her in never that oh no  
Anybody in the streets know that thats a no no  
So know I would never ever  
Ever ever  
Baby Im a g yeah thats right the seventh letter  
See one thing about the streets I know where the heffer at  
And I bet she always be exactly where I left her at  
But you know we had a bond no ring no paper  
And I dont hear this shit when I bring home paper  
My ears to the streets what you gonna tell us  
You keep talkin down girl you sound like you jealous  
This is the last time I know Im bout to drive you crazy  
Last time but I gotta see my baby  
I know I swore that Id never break your heart no more  
Try to walk but I just cant leave her alone girl  
She keep callin me

I try to leave her alone but she keep callin me  
Callin me  
And I gotta go  
Hi honey Im home  
She looked at me and said its five somethin in the morn  
You smell like you been drinkin the vibe from me this strong  
I said baby thats cologne she said nigga thats patron  
If you wanna keep with them bad habits thats fine  
You think Im with it then you out your rabid ass mind  
Theyll say tricks are for kids most chicks woulda slid  
But who aint miss a visit through the six that you did  
Ill be damned if I do another six with some kids  
Who only see they daddy in them flicks on the fridge  
Them niggas that you think are inna mix with ya shit  
They the same reason Michael Vicks doin biz  
I say hold up I met you I was thuggin back then  
And you was ridin with me holdin on a Mack 10  
But that was back when you aint give a what  
Now you standin here tellin me to give her up  
This is the last time I know Im bout to drive you crazy  
Last time but I gotta see my baby  
I know I swore that Id never break your heart no more try to walk  
But I just cant leave her alone girl  
She keep callin me  
Callin me  
I try to leave her alone but she keep callin me  
Callin me  
And I gotta go  
Hold on baby please you cant leave now no John baby please  
We gonna get you to a hospital as quickly as possible  
Life is full of obstacles we gonna get you through this one  
You looked me in my eye when you told me you was done  
I played her for a fool but I guess I was the foolish one  
Member when she told me that she know how this dream ends  
Late night phone call from one of my close friends  
Tellin you that we are rushin to the er  
By this time tomorrow we was posed to be in dr  
Me blowin a cigar you sippin a tini  
I told her pack her bags and dont forget her bikini  
Then just like houdini it all disappeared  
The escape to paradise didnt end like this I swear  
Sorry baby girl I tried the best I could  
If I cant be in the streets I guess heavens just as good  
This is the last time I know Im bout to drive you crazy  
Last time but I gotta see my baby  
I know I swore that Id never break your heart no more try to walk  
But I just cant leave her alone girl  
She keep callin me  
Callin me  
I try to leave her alone but she keep callin me  
Callin me  
And I gotta go
