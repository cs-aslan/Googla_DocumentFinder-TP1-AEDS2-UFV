Its a cold and winters night and the rain is falling down  
Its so cold cold outside snow is laying all around  
There is blackness in my window and the silence is the only sound  
  
Well Im sitting and Im thinking though I like to watch TV  
It just fills my head with garbage that my eyes aint supposed to see  
Got the turned off TV blues now but Im lonely as you see  
  
Well Ive got a worried feeling all the pain and misery  
Well its happening in the world now even though I cannot see  
Though my body is now with you still my mind is running free  
  
Theres just nothing I can do now though I search from day to day  
But the truth is so hard to tell you and you know it anyway  
Its a cold and winters evening I wish my blues would go away
