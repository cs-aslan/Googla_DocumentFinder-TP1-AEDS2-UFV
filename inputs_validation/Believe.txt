In a favor of a good intention  
Never mind the destination  
  
future lay your sure destruction  
Back and down is not an option  
  
Thats what youve said  
You gotta believe in me i am everything  
Im the final step you take toward insanity  
You gotta believe in me i am everything  
Im the only one still after your reality  
You gotta believe in me  
You gotta believe in me  
  
You dug a hole in favor side  
Your perfect world was compromised  
  
You still dont know who what the hell you are  
Youre olny worried about the palace when youre good as god  
  
Thats what youve said  
You gotta believe in me i am everything  
Im the final step you take toward insanity  
You gotta believe in me i am everything  
Im the only one still after your reality  
You gotta believe in me  
You gotta believe in me  
  
See these suns of pacrocy  
Its feeding off your apathy  
About the surface all as well  
But dig a bed and go to hell  
Just put a bullet in my head  
Or all our deed been love for dead   
Just shut your mouth and close your eyes  
Realitys alive  
  
Thats what youve said  
You gotta believe in me i am everything  
Im the final step you take toward insanity  
You gotta believe in me i am everything  
Im the only one still after your reality  
You gotta believe in me  
You gotta believe in me
