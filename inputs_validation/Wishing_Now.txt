Just another day  
And I think Ill die before it ends  
Its just another day  
And I sure like to go see my baby again  
  
Time was when I did not know  
What they meant when they said a man was blue  
But now I know because of you  
What I know because of you  
  
Sweet darlin I am just wishin I could be with you again  
Right now right now  
Sweet darlin I am just wishin I could be with you again  
Somehow somehow  
Sweet darlin I am just wishin now  
  
Just another day  
There aint nothin going down  
Nothin going down I already know  
Cause I already called around  
  
I am worse when I did not know  
Just what they meant when they said a day went wrong  
But now I know its been too long  
Since I knew it had been too long  
  
Sweet darlin I am just wishin I could be with you again  
Right now right now  
Sweet darlin I am just wishin I could be with you again  
Somehow somehow  
Sweet darlin I am just wishin now
