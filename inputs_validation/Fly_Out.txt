We here  
I said we here  
The back of Tha Carter  
The back of Tha Carter two oh  
Yea this here is the end of Tha Carter Two people  
Hey Yea  
  
I got the game on ball and chain  
I threw the key in the drain  
Im like the key in the drought  
I spent a G on these frames though my vision is priceless  
Seeing through you niggas like a fucking psychic  
Hearing through the grapevine niggas wanna hate mine  
Say my name and die in the daytime  
You catch my drift man you better be Peyton  
Boy the heats on they make a peace bond  
Im in this bitch throwing up the seventeenth sign  
Straight frowns no daps strapped three times  
That Teceleven AK forty seven one Beretta ready for whatever  
Tell them pussy niggas come together  
Happy better nigga nigga super soaker wetter nigga  
Six feet under flowers you aint nothing but a petal nigga  
Im just a little nigga trying to be a civil nigga  
Thirty years old shit thatll be a giving nigga  
Quit it Wayne your Mom is listening  
But she aint really trippin cause the pots is pissed in  
Them niggas tripping until the shots whistling  
Hear them bullets sizzle like a cobra at attention  
I gotta bitch and quit calling women bitches  
As long as she dont worry bout the coke in the kitchen  
No preventing the grind I gotta get it  
Im admitted to the game true playa no quitting  
There you go shitting on a way a nigga thanking  
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin  
This is the future aint promised to no one  
I live everyday like this is the sure one  
Train in the tidal wave this is the ocean  
Stand in the heat til the mother fucking snow come  
And it feels so fucking good  
Throw my dope like a rope let them tug and pull  
No hope for the hopeless rats and roaches  
Running cross the porch in the attic theres a fortune  
Come and get it automatics in motion  
We banging for the bread nigga even the molded  
I got my loaf I got my toast  
Chaperon of the south I got my coast yea  
And until I die Im the the the the the best rapper alive
