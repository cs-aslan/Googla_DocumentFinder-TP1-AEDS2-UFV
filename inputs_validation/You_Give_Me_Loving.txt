You give me loving that I cant return  
You give me money that you know Ill burn  
Ill give you something that you cant give back  
Then Im moving right on down the track  
Youve given everything youve got to me  
But still you cannot really set me free  
My life is changing and Im on the run  
Ill see you later when Ive had some fun  
  
I keep running cause I know the score  
Youll never find me coming back for more  
Ill catch you later cause Im gonna split  
You give a lot I only need a bit  
You give me loving that I cant return  
You give me money that you know Ill burn  
You give me loving just for your own sake  
You only give it so that you can take  
  
You give me loving and its plain to see  
You want to give it to me all for free  
But I cant take it cause you need it back  
The art of giving is the one I lack  
You give me loving and you drive me mad  
You give me money and it makes me sad  
Cause I meed freedom more than I need gold  
And so Ill leave before I get too old
