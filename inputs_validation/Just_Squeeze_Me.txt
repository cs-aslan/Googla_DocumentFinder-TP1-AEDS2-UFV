Treat me sweet and gentle when you say Goodnight  
Just squeeze me but please dont tease me  
I get sentimental when you hold me tight  
Just squeeze me but please dont tease me  
  
Missing you since you went away  
Singin the blues away each day  
Counting the nights and waiting for you  
  
Im in the mood to let you know  
I never knew I loved you so  
Please say you love me too  
  
When I get this feeling Im in ecstasy  
So squeeze me but please dont tease me  
Yes squeeze me mama dont tease me no no  
Oh squeeze me mama please dont tease me  
  
When I get this feeling Im in ecstasy  
So squeeze me mama please dont tease me
