Life is a hustle every day struggle  
Pushing your way at the top  
Gotta keep it on track and never look back  
And no you dont dare stop  
  
Theres someone behind you keeping an eye on you  
Hoping you take a fall a lady shes liked to see me more  
But I cant slow down at all  
  
She says  
Wow I need some time alone  
I say no we gotta keep pushing on  
She said life is good love is better  
  
My daddy he always preached to me  
You gotta reach for the sky  
Make rain while the sun is shining  
Boy dont let it pass you by  
  
Money and power is in your hand  
You can do what you wanna be  
Oh my baby shes got a different philosophy  
  
She says  
Now I know my sweet lady must be heaven sent  
I just cover the meaning of what she meant  
Ive been working so hard for the good life but I headed all the while  
Ive found my hiding treasure baby right there in this smile  
  
I say  
Wow seems weve spent time alone  
  
I say  
Wow how our love has grown  
She was right all alone  
  
I say  
Life is good love is better
