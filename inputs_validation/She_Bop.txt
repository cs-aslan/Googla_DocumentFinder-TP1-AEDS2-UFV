Wehell I see them every night in tight blue jeans  
In the pages of a Blue Boy magazine  
Hey Ive been thinking of a new sensation  
Im picking up good vibration  
Ooh she bop she bop  
  
Do I want to go out with a lions roar

Hey they say that a stitch in time saves nine  
They say I better stop or Ill go blind  
Ooh she bop she bop
