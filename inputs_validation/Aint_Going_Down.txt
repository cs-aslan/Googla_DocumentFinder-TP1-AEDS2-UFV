It aint no big deal were all lucky to be alive  
I myself dont believe in luck or taking chances I will survive  
Every move I make every twist every turn  
You scandalize and humble me I may be slow but I will learn  
  
Cause I aint going down anymore  
Cause I aint going down anymore  
Cause I aint going down anymore  
Cause I aint going down anymore  
  
If I had my way I would probably just sit and stare  
Watch the TV or read a book Id have no reason to be aware  
But I aint got time I just could not live that way  
Ive got to step outside myself Ive still got something left to say  
  
Cause I aint going down anymore  
Cause I aint going down anymore  
Cause I aint going down anymore  
Cause I aint going down anymore  
  
Cause I aint going down anymore  
Cause I aint going down anymore  
Cause I aint going down anymore  
Cause I aint going down anymore  
  
Channeled in my groove part of another space and time  
Please allow me to introduce another good friend of mine  
Some call him fear some call him righteousness  
I myself aint clear and you cant force me to make a guess
