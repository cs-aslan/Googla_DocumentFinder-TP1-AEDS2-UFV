Just a little bit of you every day  
Will surely keep the doctor away  
Just a little bit of you every day  
Will surely keep the doctor away  
  
I told my mama how I feel about your power  
Your love can heal cant no doctors remedy  
Ever do what you do for me  
  
Just a little bit of you every day  
Will surely keep the doctor away  
Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love  
Baby its all I need its all I need  
  
Since the day Ive been loving you  
I cant catch a cold I cant catch the flu  
The sweet loving youve been giving me  
Has become my daily need  
  
Just a little o your love every day  
Its all I need thats all I need  
Just a little bit baby  
Thats all I need thats all I need  
  
So dont send no doctor to my door  
Cause Doctor John been here before  
Dont you send him just come yourself  
Bring your loving and nothing else  
  
Ooh just a just a  
Just a little bit of you every day  
Will surely keep the doctor away  
Just a little bit of you every day  
Will surely keep the doctor away
