The lightsre low I am too the crowd is high so are you  
Its gettin close to closin time and the breakup oh it breakup my mind  
You found me in this dimlit bar Im with you and were too far  
Now you say my kind of girl just cant fit in your kind of world  
Please dont leave me where you found me  
Oh dont leave me where you found me  
Keep your love wrapped warm around me  
Dont leave me where you found me  
  
I like to cook I like to sew Id love to watch while babies grow  
Id work my fingers to the bone if youll make me the maker of your home  
Please forget the life Ive led let me share more than your bed  
Ill make a vow to God above youll always be the keeper of my love  
Please dont leave me  
Please dont leave me where you found me
