Intro  
Fab 5X  
Can you be my BABY  
  
MS Ill never call another lover mine  
  
Verse 1 Fabolous  
And why would I and why should I  
When I seen a lady tonight with my good eye that I would try and make  
Mybabybaby  
I was up in the club putting my hood high  
When I saw you and I stood by  
Just lookin at your onion girl I could cry and I could lie  
I mean I could try and say you aint sweep me off my feet  
But only one thing could keep me off the street  
And thats if you be my BABY  
I can be why you always be fly  
And Im from BStuy just like BIG was thats how FAB does  
We can sip something til we both be buzzed  
In a Vdub and thats only because  
  
Chorus Mike Shorey  
Need someone to be my baby  
Kind of girl you find in the club rockin those baby Phat jeans  
Gonna find someone to be my baby  
I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby baby  
  
Verse 2 Fab  
After the baby talk the goo goo ga ga  
You like this that you do bla bla  
Couple good jokes a few brouhahas its time to do you mama  
First Ima put you on your back  
And make you scream out babyjust like I put you on the track  
  
Then Ima lay you on your side  
And slowly stroke you while you telling me the way you feel inside  
But my sex drive wont make me play you on the side  
You know you get the keys any day you wanna ride  
And my baby know how to start me up  
You got the kind of kiss thatll speed a heartbeat up  
And you got the kind of touch thatll gimme the chills  
I ask you cause I know you gonna gimme it real  
It wont be fake and dont we make a good couple  
And wont we make a goodbaby  
  
Chrous  
  
Bridge Mike Shorey  
Ooh if I seem just a bit taken pardon me  
But youre so amazing  
I just want us to do this exclusively  
Say youll be my baby  
  
Verse 3 Fab  
My babys the only one I bring to the villa  
That can get the bling and the scrilla  
Girl I know you smooth enough to spring a chinchilla  
And still take a sting of Tequila the way you swing is a thriller  
Im watchin that like the boxing match in the ring of Manila  
I wanna keep it comin like the singles of Thriller  
I mean if you still uhmy BABY  
  
Chorus
