Punk rockers hiphoppers  
Brit poppers show stoppers  
Beboppers hair droppers  
Are you ready to sing  
  
Right wing left wing  
I want something  
To see me through   
Bout what do you think  
  
We aint gonna be treated like trash  
We got one thing  
We are the Clash  
What  
We are the Clash  
Its like a patch  
You can strike that match  
  
With my guitar now  
 last dance  
I see them where they   
How they usually stay  
  
Beating on a drum  
Did they tell them take it in  
Got the   
Where the fat boy blew  
  
We aint gonna be treated like trash  
We got one thing  
We are the Clash  
Thats right  
We are the Clash  
Its like a patch  
You can strike that match  
  
Home fires burnin  
In motorcycle city  
The rockin gods will choose  
If Im worthy to live  
The first  engine  
 fortysix  
And theres no more   
To imitate respect  
  
We aint gonna be treated like trash  
We got one thing  
We are the Clash  
Dont take no shit  
We are the Clash  
Do ya hear me  
Its like a patch  
You can strike that match
