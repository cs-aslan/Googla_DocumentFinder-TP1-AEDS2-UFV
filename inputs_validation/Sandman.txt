Aint it foggy outside  
All the planes have been grounded  
Aint the fire inside  
Lets all go stand around it  
  
Funny Ive been there  
And youve been here  
We aint had no time to drink that beer  
  
Chorus  
Cause I understand  
Youve been running from the man  
That goes by the name of the Sandman  
He flies the sky  
Like an eagle in the eye of a hurricane thats abandoned  
  
Aint the years gone by fast  
I supposed you have missed them  
Oh I almost forgot to ask  
Did you hear of my enlistment  
  
Chorus
