Youre a being of the darkest descend  
You dont belong anywhere  
Youre always hungry but never content  
All of your sins you could never bear  
Now youre feeling good  
But youre really dead  
And youre wearing make up and perfume  
In the gallows you were hung  
But now I see you walk instead  
Razor eater  
Hell never ever die  
Razor eater  
Hell never ever die  
Well you kept your secrets  
And locked them up  
Then drained their blood  
As you read your books  
See the show and rink from your cup  
And then hang your darlings  
From the hooks  
Slice them up no one will ever know  
But still you smell that smell  
And now youre dead since long ago  
You better burn in hell  
Razor eater  
He will never die  
Razor eater  
He will never die  
Razor eater  
Razor eater  
Razor eater
