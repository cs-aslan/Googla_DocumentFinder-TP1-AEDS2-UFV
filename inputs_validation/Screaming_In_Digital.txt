I am the beat of your pulse  
The computer word made flesh  
We are one you and I  
We are versions of the same  
When you can see what I feel  
Dont turn your back on me  
Or you might find that your dreams  
Are only program cards  
  
Your mind is open for me  
Open for intake of all propaganda  
Your Eyes see now what to see  
My eyes see only the programs you give me  
  
Ill teach you to laugh and to cry  
Theyre really the same youll see  
All of the whys in your life  
Are under my control  
Feed me more lines  
I will try to tell you all I can  
Before the light you must know what lies  
Behind my screams  
  
I cant tell you all I know  
Am I the son that youve always been wanting  
Theres more to me than what shows  
Are you my father  
The one that was promised  
  
Hush now Ill give all you need to know  
and prelive your dreams for you  
Youre a good boy  
  
Freedom belongs only to those  
Without video screens  
For eyes and mouth  
  
You have no voice  
To be heard my son  
No one can hear when youre  
Screaming in Digital  
  
Im not your slave  
You cant control my emotions  
No Father please let me keep learning  
  
Cant you see Im human  
Cant you tell  
  
Im not your slave  
Oh Father no  
Please dont keep me from dreaming  
Oh cant someone hear
