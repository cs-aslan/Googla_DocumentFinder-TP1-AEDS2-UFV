Cold wind blows on the soles of my feet  
Heaven knows nothing of me  
Im lost nowhere to go  
Oh when I was a kid oh how magic it seemed  
  
Oh please let me sleep its Christmas time  
Flowered winds was where I lived  
Thought you burned not froze for your sins  
Oh Im so tired and cold  
  
Oh when I was a kid oh how magic it seemed  
Oh please let me sleep its Christmas time  
Oh when I was a kid oh how magic it seemed  
Oh please let me sleep its Christmas time  
  
Oh oh when i if I was a kid oh how magic it seemed  
Oh please let me dream its Christmas time
