Its a long way to nowhere  
And Im leaving very soon  
On the way we pass so close  
To the back side of the moon  
Hey join the traveler if you got nowhere to go  
Hang your head and take my hand  
Its the only road I know  
Oh Lonely is the word yeah yeah yeah  
Ive been higher than stardust  
Ive been seen upon the sun  
I used to count in millions then  
But now I only count in one  
Come on join the traveler  
If you got nowhere to go  
Hang your head and take my hand  
Its the only road I know  
Yeah lonely is the word  
Got to be the saddest song I ever heard  
Yeah lonely is the name  
Maybe lifes a losing game
