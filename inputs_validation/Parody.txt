Late night broadcast  
The TV looks at me with its blue eyes  
No matter how often I change the channel  
I cant escape that gaze  
No matter how many times I look in the fridge  
Its the same answer an answer Im used to hearing  
The timelimit is about up  
I need more time let me be  
Oh no this is a parody  
But to me its my life story  
Without waiting for me the clock  
Pretends not to know anything  
I know its a common story  
But to me its my life story  
Not being some copy of someone else  
Ill write the rest of it from now  
Facing the same way with everyone else  
Its the freeway  
Its just a coincidence  
When the road split it was sudden  
Hurry me to the seventh floor please  
The elevator is unusually small  
But no one else is here so I feel safe  
Set me free from thoughtfulness  
Oh no everythings a parody  
But to everyone its a true story  
Without putting any strength into it  
You pretend that you dont need anything  
I know a couple that looks just like us  
But they do nothing but argue  
Without putting much priority on it  
Ill read the rest of it from now  
Oh no this is probably a parody  
Im sure for someone its a fake story  
I cant wear any shoes but my own  
Thats alright since I can walk like that  
I know its a common story  
But to me its a real story  
Without waiting for the rest of it  
Ill go to see you from now
