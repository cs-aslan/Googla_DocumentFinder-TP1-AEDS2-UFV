Im totally abandoned to You  
Im lost inside the rivers of Your love  
Im swept into the power of Your presence  
Drawn toward the whisper of Your voice  
  
Verse 2  
I come to You in quiet adoration  
And fall before Your feet You are my King  
Im living for the beauty of Your Presence  
To behold the glory of Your face  
  
CHORUS  
Holy Worthy is the Lord  
Heaven declares Your Rightousness  
Oh God of All Creation  
I worship You  
  
Verse 2  
CHORUS  
  
Oh when You said seek Your face  
My heart said Your face I will seek 2x
