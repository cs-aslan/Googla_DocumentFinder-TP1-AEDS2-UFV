I come from California  
Where you say no one grows old  
And yall drive to fast  
But you say it so slow  
In that southern style baby  
That always drives me crazy  
And I start to laugh  
  
Cause I have never been to Memphis  
But if youre there  
I will pack my bag and go  
Cause I dont care if it never rains here  
The suns always shining  
I have never met a girl like you  
And Im tired of trying  
I have never been to Memphis  
  
Youre all crazy about Jesus  
Back where youre from  
You got baptized in rivers  
Where the deep waters run  
Thats alright by me  
Yeah I love that you believe in  
Something you cant touch  
Something you cant see  
  
Cause I have never been to Memphis  
But if youre there  
I will pack my bag and go  
Even though never been afraid of flying  
But I am afraid to fall  
Ive been painting by numbers youve been  
Just splashing them on the wall  
And I see the colors running  
It lets me know which way to go  
  
After all  
After all  
Yeah After all  
After all  
Ive got to get myself there oh yeah  
You know Ive got to get myself there  
  
Cause I have never been to Memphis  
But if youre there  
Im on my way  
Oh oh oh oh  
Im on my way  
Im on my way  
Oh oh oh oh  
Im on my way  
Yeah  
Im on my way  
Gotta get myself to you baby yeah  
  
I have never been to Memphis  
But if youre there  
I have never been to Memphis  
  
Youre all crazy about Jesus  
Back where youre from  
You get baptized in rivers  
Where the deep waters run
