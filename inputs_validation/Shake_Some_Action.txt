Shake Some Action  
I will find a way  
To get to you some day  
Oh but I babe  
Im so afraid Ill fall  
Yeah Now cant you hear me call  
Shake some actions what I need  
To let me bust out at full speed  
Im sure thats all you need  
To make it all right  
Its taken me so long  
To get where I belong  
Oh but oh please dont send me back that way yeah  
For I will make you pay refrain  
If you dont dig what I say  
Then I will go away  
And I wont come back this again  
No Cause I dont need a friend  
refrain  
guitar solo again
