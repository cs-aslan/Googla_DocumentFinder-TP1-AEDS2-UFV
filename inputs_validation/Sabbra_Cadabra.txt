Feel so good I feel so fine  
Love that little lady always on my mind  
Gives me lovin every night and day  
Never gonna leave her never goin away  
Someone to love me

When were making love its something out of this world  
Feels so good to know that shes all mine  
Going to love that woman til the end of time
