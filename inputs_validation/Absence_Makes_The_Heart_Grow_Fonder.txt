If you should leave me  
I know it would grieve me  
So honey please remember  
Absence makes the heart grow fonder  
  
For somebody else  
I love you dearly  
Im yours sincerely  
But honey please remember  
  
Absence makes the heart grow fonder  
For somebody else  
When the cats away the mice will play  
I dont say I will but still I may  
  
I may be blue away from you  
And then again I may be gay  
When I get fretful I get forgetful  
So honey please remember  
  
Absence makes the heart grow fonder  
For somebody else  
When the cats away the mice will play  
I dont say I will but still I may  
  
I may be blue away from you  
And then again I may be gay  
When I get fretful I get forgetful  
So honey please remember  
  
Absence makes the heart grow fonder  
For somebody else  
For somebody else
