You and I were so in love  
You were all I was thinkin of  
There was so much magic in your eyes  
Then one day you said we were through  
You said you found somebody new  
And then you turned and you walked right out the door  
Baby I told you his love wasnt true  
You didnt hear me so now I say these words to you  
  
Chorus  
Serves you right for sayin goodbye  
Now you say youre sorry  
Serves you right for sayin goodbye  
Baby  
Serves you right for sayin goodbye  
Now you see whos sorry now  
Oh ohoh  
  
I remember you standin there sayin to me you didnt care  
And I was begging baby please dont go  
Now youre crying telling me what went wrong  
Girl you stayed away too long  
Cant you see Ive got you off my mind  
change  
Thinkinbout the pain that you put me through  
I cant help youbecause it feels good telling you  
  
Chorus  
  
rap see mama what Im tryinto say  
To you is that Im you know I love ya  
But ya  yaa hurt me so bad I cant take it no more girl  
I just cant take it no hell no

Dont say it anymore dont talk  
No more Im tired of youre lyin  
Im tired of your cryin girl tell  
Me dont tell me

Thinkin bout the pain that you put me through  
I cant help youbecause it feels good telling you  
  
Chorus x2  
  
givin up on your love girl never  
Gonna believe you anymore  
cause all you wanna do is hurt me and treat me bad  
feels good telling you  
  
Serves you right for sayin goodbye  
Girl I just dont need you  
Serves you right for sayin goodbye  
All you do is use my love  
Serves you right for sayin goodbye  
Cant let you hurt me anymore  
Serves you right for sayin goodbye  
Dont say youre sorry baby  
Serves you right for sayin goodbye  
Cause your words dont mean a thing  
Serves you right for sayin goodbye  
Its you whos sorry now
