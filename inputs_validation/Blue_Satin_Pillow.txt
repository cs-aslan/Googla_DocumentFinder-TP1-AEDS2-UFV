Id like to take you home girl and make you mine  
Id get you all alone girl and take my time  
Think how you feel in your heart when you climb to the top of  
Of a big roller coaster ride  
  
Youre gettin high on desire worth waitin  
On the other side  
Id like to treat you nice girl and treat you mean  
Id get you on your own girl and fill your dreams  
  
Think how you feel in your heart when you get to the fall  
Of a big roller coaster ride  
Thats how it is and the way that it would be  
If you come with me  
  
Blue satin pillow  
Black satin silhou  
Ette on the window  
Shade of the night  
  
Soft light a glowin  
Sweet night a goin  
Out like the candles  
Flickerin light  
  
You know by now its your love that Im after  
And I don want no alibi  
Theres just no need to take no for an answer  
Yes is in your eyes  
  
Id like to take you home girl and make you mine  
Id get you all alone girl and take my time  
Id like to treat you nice girl and treat you mean
