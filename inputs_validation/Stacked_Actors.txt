Oh mirror mirror  
Youre coming in clear  
Im finally somewhere in between  
Im impressed  
What a beautiful chest  
I never meant to make a big scene  
  
Will you resign to the latest design  
You look so messy when you dress up in dreams  
One more for hire  
Or wonderful liar  
I think its time we all should come clean  
  
Stack dead actors  
Stacked to the rafters  
Line up the bastards  
All I want is the truth  
  
Hey hey now can you fake it  
Can you make it look like we want  
Hey hey now can you take it  
And we cry when they all die blond  
  
God bless what a sensitive mess  
Yeah but things arent always what they seem  
Your teary eyes  
Your famous disguise  
Never knowing who to believe  
  
See through  
Yeah but what do you do  
When youre just another aging drag queen  
  
Stack dead actors  
Stacked to the rafters  
Line up the bastards  
All I want is the truth  
  
Hey hey now can you fake it  
Can you make it look like we want  
Hey hey now can you take it  
And we cry when they all die blond
