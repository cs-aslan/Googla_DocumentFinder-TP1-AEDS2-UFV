All right  
I got somethin to say  
Yeah its better to burn out  
Yeah than fade away  
All right  
Ow gonna start a fire  
Cmon  
  
Rise up Gather round  
Rock this place to the ground  
Burn it up lets go for broke  
Watch the night go up in smoke  
Rock on Rock on  
Drive me crazier no serenade  
No fire brigade just Pyromania cmon  
  
What do you want What do you want  
I want rock n roll yes I do  
Long live rock n roll  
Oh lets go lets strike a light  
Were gonna blow like dynamite  
I dont care if it takes all night  
Gonna set this town alight  
  
What do you want What do you want  
I want rock n roll alright  
Long live rock n roll  
  
Chorus  
Rock of ages rock of ages  
Still rollin keep arollin  
Rock of ages rock of ages  
Still rollin rocknrollin  
We got the power got the glory  
Just say you need it and if you need it

I know for sure there aint no cure  
So feel it dont fight it go with the flow  
Gimme gimme gimme gimme one more for the road

Chorus

Down to the ground  
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh
