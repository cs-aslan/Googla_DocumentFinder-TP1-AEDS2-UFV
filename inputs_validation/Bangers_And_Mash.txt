You bit me bit me bit me oh  
You bit me bit me and now I want more  
Im standing in the hall  
Im kicking out the wall  
Its all been sent to the Conger Hill  
  
The bangers and the mash  
The negatives for cash  
Youre either in the club baby  
Or youre not  
  
Whatever turns you on  
Whatever gets you off  
Chief of police the vicechancellor  
Lord and lady blahblah  
The vicar and the judge  
Youre all dancing to my little red book  
  
Because you bit me bit me bit me oh  
Ive got the poison poison  
And now I want more  
  
If you are on the top  
Then it is a long drop  
The pyramid is power  
Were changin by the hour  
If you are on the top  
Then it is a long drop  
You stare into the dark  
The dark will stare back  
Back into your soul  
  
The chchcheque came through x7  
  
Im taking you down  
Im taking you down  
Im taking you down when I go down  
Im taking you down  
Im taking you down  
Im standing in the hall  
Im kicking out the wall  
Yeah because you bit me bit me bit me oh  
Bit me bit me bit me oh  
Ive got the poison x4
