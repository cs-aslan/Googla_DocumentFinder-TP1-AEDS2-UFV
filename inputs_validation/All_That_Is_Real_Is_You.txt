All the world over Ive searched for a dream  
Ive found out that life is not what it seems  
Ive seen all the wonders the world has to give  
But all that is real is you  
All of the silver and all of the gold  
Are worthless to me lifeless and cold  
Ive known all the treasure a man can possess  
But all that is real is you  
So bring me back home my love my love  
Oh how I need you  
Take me back home my love my love  
Oh how I love you  
Even the place where my heart used to fly  
The warm summer breeze the wild seabirds cry  
And all are illusions and all just a dream  
Cause all that is real is you  
So bring me back home my love my love  
Oh how I need you  
Take me back home my love my love  
Oh how I love you  
All the world over Ive searched for a dream  
Ive found out that life is not what it seems  
Ive seen all the wonders the world has to give  
But all that is real is you cause all that is real is you
