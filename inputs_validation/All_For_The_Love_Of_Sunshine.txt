The darkness of my world was all cleared away  
The flowers are blooming its a beautiful day  
Theres a girl with a heart as big as the sky  
Shes sunshine and I know why  
  
All for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
The Lord smiled down on this life of mine  
And sent me the love of sunshine  
  
Though sunshine can always make my days seem bright  
Sunshine can warm up a cold cold night  
I know my sunshine was sent from above  
An angel thats filled with love  
  
All for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
The Lord smiled down on this life of mine  
And sent me the love of sunshine  
  
Through winter the springtime the summer and fall  
The moonlight the starlight she outshines them all  
In a world filled with fear with pain and such harm  
My sunshine cant be so warm  
  
Now I live all for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
The Lord smiled down on this life of mine  
And sent me the love of sunshine  
  
All for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
The Lord smiled down on this life of mine  
And sent me the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine
