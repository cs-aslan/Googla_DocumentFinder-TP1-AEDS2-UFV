All the boys are wearing blue tonight  
Well thrive well dive how can we lose  
All the strangers walk like you tonight  
So tall we fall for every move  
  
Well laugh and talk  
Dont stop for breath  
In these our private lives  
We dance til dawn  
As they beat the drums  
For all our private lives  
  
Close your eyes and use the melody  
Who cares who stares under the light  
See the shadow tailing me again  
It shows it glows and it grabbed so bright
