Ooh no no no no no no  
  
I got twodozen roses and a card that says baby I cant wait to see you later  
We made dinner reservations and no rules listen child you just pick the
location  
Now were sitting at the table sipping the finest wine having a damn good time  
I know whats on your mind I want you  
You want me too stop fronting I know exactly what you would you want to do  
  
Chorus  
Do it to me I want to feel you touch my body baby body baby  
Do it to me I guarantee you wont regret it let me set it out like you aint
never had it  
Do it to me I want you to grab me talk to me tell me how you like it  
When you want it when you all up on it oh  
Do it to me Im gonna give it to you Im gonna make this a night to remember  
  
Watching you work the stick in the ride the motion how you move from 3rd to 5  
And imagine what its gonna be when we get inside  
And you put that ooh wee on me and you want me the same way ooh I cant wait  
Im tired of thinking about it speaking about it baby its time to be about
it turn off the lights take off your clothes jump in the bed and let it
flow  
Squeeze and holdin bitin scratchin spankin screamin pullin my hair when
you need me everything goes baby when you  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
So long I waited for this night to get inside you look in your eyes  
And tell you baby take me Im yours  
And if you feel anything like I feel  
By the end of the night Im certain youll be screamin for more  
I want to do anything and everything to your body till you break down cant
take no more  
From the bed to the floor to the top of the stairs you gon get it baby
please please  
Oh do it to me  
  
Chorus
