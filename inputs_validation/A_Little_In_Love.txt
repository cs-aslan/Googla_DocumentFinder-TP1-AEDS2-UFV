Its been so long  
You say youve had fun  
And youve been happy with the things youve done  
Now you feel strange and a little unreal  
Well I can understand the way you feel  
Youre just a little in love  
Just a little  
Youre just a little in love  
Just a little  
  
Well I can see whats happening to you  
You fell in love but its just not true  
And theres one thing you ought to know  
I need you so Im just a little in love  
Just a little  
Im just a little in love  
Just a little  
  
You know sometimes you look somewhere  
Youre not stone  
But theres no one there  
No one to turn to  
No one to see the way youre feeling  
Ajust like me  
Just a little in love  
Just a little  
Youre just a little in love  
Just a little  
  
You say youre willing to learn  
You need a friend  
A friend who will help you  
  
cause youre just a little in love  
Oh yeah a little in love  
You are a little in love  
With someone you just like to see  
Like me youre in love  
Oh yeah a little in love  
Youre in love
