I gotta get along cause its a long long ride now  
Ive been away too long I gotta get on home now  
Im getting far too old to know my dream of fortune  
But the time is flowing now I know what I must do  
  
I gotta go home I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind  
I gotta go home I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind  
  
I gotta get along cause its a long long ride now  
Ive been away too long I gotta get on home now  
Im getting far too old to know my dream of fortune  
The time is flowing now I know what I must do  
  
I gotta go home I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind  
I gotta go home I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind
