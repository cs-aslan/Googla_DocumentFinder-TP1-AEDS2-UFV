Back about eighteen and twentyfive I left Tennessee very much alive I never
wouldve made it through the Arkansas mud If I hadnt been riding on the
Tennessee Stud  
  
Had some trouble with my sweethearts Pa One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Spud And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud On a
Tennessee Stud The Tennessee Stud was long and lean The color of the sun and
his eyes were green He had the nerve and he had the blood There never was a
horse like Tennessee Stud  
  
Drifted on down into no mans land Across the river called the Rio Grande
Raced my horse with the Spaniards foe Til I got me a skin full of silver and
gold  
  
Me and the gambler we couldnt agree We got in a fight over Tennessee Pulled
our guns and he fell with a thud And I rode away on a Tennessee Stud  
  
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean The color of the sun and his eyes were
green He had the nerve and he had the blood There was never a horse like the
Tennessee Stud  
  
I rode right back across Arkansas I whipped her brother and I whipped her Pa I
found that girl with the golden hair She was riding on a Tennessee Mare  
  
Pretty little baby on the cabin floor Little horse colt playing round the door
I loved the girl with the golden hair And the Tennessee Stud loves the
Tennessee Mare  
  
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean The color of the sun and his eyes were
green He had the nerve and he had the blood There was never a horse like the
Tennessee Stud
