Another night with open eyes  
Too late to sleep too soon to rise  
Youre short of breath is it a heart attack  
Hot and feverish you face the fact  
  
Youre in love and it feels like shame  
Because shes gone and made a fool of you in public again  
Youre in love and it feels like pain  
Because you know theres too much truth in everything she claims  
  
So ask yourself now can you forgive her  
If she wants you to  
Ask yourself can you even deliver  
What she demands of you  
  
You drift into the strangest dreams  
Of youthful follies and changing teams  
Admit youre wrong oh no not yet  
Then you wake up and remember that you cant forget  
  
Shes made you some kind of laughing stock  
Because you dance to disco and you dont like rock  
Shed make fun of you and even in bed  
Said she was gonna go and get herself a real man instead  
  
So ask yourself now can you forgive her  
If she begs you to  
Ask yourself can you even deliver  
What she demands of you  
  
Or do you want revenge  
But thats childish so childish  
Thats childish so childish  
  
Remember when you were more easily led  
Behind the cricket pavilion and the bicycle shed  
Trembling as your dreams came true  
You looked right into those blue eyes and knew  
  
It was love and now you cant pretend  
Youve forgotten all the promises of that first friend  
Its bad enough she knows how you feel  
But shes not prepared to share you with the memory  
  
So ask yourself now can you forgive her  
If she begs you to  
Ask yourself can you even deliver  
What she demands of you  
Ask yourself now can you forgive her  
If she begs you to  
And ask yourself can you even deliver  
What she demands of you  
  
Or do you want revenge  
But thats childish so childish
