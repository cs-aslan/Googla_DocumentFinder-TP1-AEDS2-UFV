I kill myself in small amounts  
In each relationship its not about love  
Just another funeral  
And just another girl left in tears  
  
And Im waiting  
With the sound turned off Im waiting  
Like a glass balloon Im fading  
Into the void and then Im gone Im gone Im gone  
  
They said that hells not hot  
They said that hells not hot  
  
I gave my soul to someone else  
She must have known that it was already sold  
But it was never about her  
It was about the hurt  
  
So Im waiting  
With the sound turned off Im waiting  
Like a glass balloon Im fading  
Into the void and then Im gone Im gone Im gone  
  
I kill myself in small amounts  
In each relationship its not about love  
Just another funeral  
And just another girl left in tears  
  
Waiting  
With the sound turned off Im waiting  
Like a glass balloon Im fading  
Into the void and then Im gone Im gone Im gone  
  
Waiting  
Waiting  
Im fading  
Im gone Im gone Im gone  
  
They said that hells not hot  
They said that hells not hot  
They said that hells not hot  
They said that hells not hot
