Well an airplanes faster than a Cadillac  
And a whole lot smoother than a camels back  
But I dont care how you get to me  
Just get to me  
  
Parasail or first class mail  
Get on the back of a Nightingale  
Just get to me I dont care just get to me  
Prokeds mopeds take a limousine instead  
  
They aint cheap but theyre easy to find  
Get on the highway point yourself my way  
Take a roller coaster that comes in sideways  
Just get to me  yeah  
  
Go on hitch a ride on the back of a butterfly  
Theres no better way to fly  
To get to me  
I look around at what I got  
  
And without you it aint a lot  
But I got everything with you everything  
  
Maybe you could pollinate over the  
Golden Gate  
Take a left hand turn at the corner  
Of Haight  
  
And then a sharp right  
At the first street light  
And get yourself on a motor bike  
And if you think youll get stuck in a traffic jam  
  
Thats fine send yourself through a telephone line  
It doesnt matter how you get to me  
Just get to me  
  
Cause after every day  
The wind blows the night time my way  
And I imagine that you are  
Above me like a star  
  
And you keep on glowing  
And you keep on showing me the way  
Shine shine shine
