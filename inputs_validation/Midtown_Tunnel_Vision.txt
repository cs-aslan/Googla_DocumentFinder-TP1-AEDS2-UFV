Take good care its a tightrope ride  
Neon city is on the dreamers side  
Prime time losers going underground  
They take you up and they shake you down  
  
Cant see nowhere  
Dont know and I dont care  
Cause here comes another midtown tunnel vision  
  
Sidewalk cruiser in stiletto heels  
Frozen heart eyes of steel  
Wrap your body around my soul  
Electric love is gonna take its toll  
  
Cant see nowhere  
Dont know and I dont care  
That girl is the mother of my midtown tunnel vision  
  
Sunset skyline night turns to day  
Down on the street you could fade away  
No second chances in this here wasted life  
Itll cut you down like a switchblade knife  
  
Cant see nowhere  
Dont know and I just dont care  
Cause here comes another midtown tunnel vision
