Back the hell off  
Rock n roll Jesus with all my nails on  
All I need is a blunt and a bail bond  
And give these blind motherfuckers something to feel on  
Rollin like a motherfucker put your wheels on  
And lets roll down and heal till the heal gone  
I started on the block but that something to build on  
And how can I pray when I got nothing to kneel on  
  
Hey  
The ground is gone  
Dont look now but the ground is gone  
Im so high that the ground is gone  
And I dont even know which cloud Im on  
Dont look down but the ground is gone  
Dont look down cause the ground is gone  
Right now Im a million miles from home  
And Im so high that the ground is gone  
  
Walk on air  
show me to the edge and I walk off there  
We aint high enuff Ocontraire  
and sometimes life just dont compare  
Say my name baby pull my hair  
and Im a fuck you like a bull I swear  
I gotta lot of love that I could just share  
I gotta lot of drugs that I could just share  
I know I know where should I go  
a nice lil mirror and a little white girl  
Way at the top of the mountain bouncing  
May I be everything but grounded  
I dont ever wanna see the bottom the bottom  
I just wanna float float like Muhammad  
I dont ever wanna see the bottom the bottom  
I just wanna float

I know a girl named Crystal her last name Ball  
I look into her eyes and I can see it all  
I see it when she cry Im there when she call  
Cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall  
  
Kill em all die in the spirit of the war  
Thinkin would a mind be in spiritual for  
Huh shit cause aint no love

It aint no hurricane it aint no flood  
This some other shit we aint no of  
Make that money yeah make that money  
Then watch the goverment take that money  
But we gon raise hell motherfucker get well  
Laws get passed and economies fail  
Love hate emotion compulsion addiction fictionvirgins  
Dixons means mixing swinging switching swagging  
Sweets freaks faggots flame fashion planes crashing  
ground zero
