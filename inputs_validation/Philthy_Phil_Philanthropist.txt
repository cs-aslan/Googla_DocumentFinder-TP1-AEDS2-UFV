Theres something wrong with mass consumption  
Why do we want what we dont need  
Alcohol burn it clean asphalt methamphetamine  
Will make it seem alright its gonna make it seem alright now  
Living in the hunger underground  
  
Some people say I got a problem with authority so  
What if I do man it beats relinquishing control

Youve taken when you should of give away  
Philthy Phil you gave to us  
More than we cannot repay  
  
Theres something grand about being nothing  
Theres something lame about being grand  
Alcohol squirting gun dont want no holidays in the sun  
Thats me not being you thats just me not being you are  
Either a part of the solution or the problem  
  
Can there not be a middle ground for just the anybody  
Replace Superman with Joe Ordinary
