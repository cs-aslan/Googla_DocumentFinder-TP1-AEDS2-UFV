Have my love  
It fits you like a glove  
Join my dream tell me yes  
Bail out should there be a mess  
The pieces you dont need are mine  
  
Take my time  
Ill show you cloud nine  
Take my smile and my heart  
They were yours from the start  
The pieces to omit are mine  
  
Have my love  
Use it while it does you good  
Share my highs but the times  
That it hurts pay no mind  
The pieces you dont need are mine  
  
Ill see you there on cloud nine  
  
Take my hope  
Maybe even share a joke  
If theres good to be shown  
You may make it all your own  
And if you want to quit thats fine  
While youre out looking for cloud nine
