We always stick together  
Like were something made of glue  
And justify the passion  
Saying one is more than two  
  
But if you dont believe the words  
Theyre surely to come true  
Theres one thing thats so obvious  
But its something you wont do  
  
Because you stand above me  
But I know you dont  
You say you love me  
But I know you wont  
  
We always say were happy  
  
When you know its never true  
But I was just so frightened  
Of the things youd say and do  
  
But if you dont believe the words  
Theyre surely to come true  
Its starting to be so obvious  
That its something you wont do  
  
Because you stand above me  
But I know you dont  
You say you love me  
But I know you wont  
  
But if you dont believe the words  
Theyre surely to come true  
Theres one thing thats so obvious  
But its something you wont do  
  
Because you stand above me  
But I know you dont  
You say you love me  
But I know you wont
