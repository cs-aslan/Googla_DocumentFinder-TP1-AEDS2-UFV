Underneath the sky of red  
Is a storyteller sleeping alone  
He has no face and he has no name  
And his whereabouts are sort of unknown  
  
All he needs is his life in a suitcase  
It belongs to a friend of a friends  
And as we drink to ourselves  
Well amuse ourselves  
Underneath the sky  
Underneath the sky again  
Underneath the sky again  
  
So wish me away to an unknown place  
Am I living in a land with no name  
Ill be making a start with my brand new heart  
Stop me making sense once again  
  
All we need is our lives in a suitcase  
They belong to a friend of a friends  
And as we drink to ourselves  
Well amuse ourselves  
Underneath the sky  
Underneath the sky again  
Underneath the sky again  
  
All we need is our lives in a suitcase  
They belong to a friend of a friends  
And as we drink to ourselves  
Well amuse ourselves  
Underneath the sky  
Underneath the sky again  
Underneath the sky again  
Underneath the sky again  
Underneath the sky again  
Underneath the sky again  
Again again again again  
Underneath the sky again
