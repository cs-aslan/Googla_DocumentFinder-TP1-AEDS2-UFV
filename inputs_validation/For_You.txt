When I put my headphones on and hide amongst the crowds  
I feel like I mustve just disappeared  
that music that makes even the sound of my own footsteps fade away  
Until I forget you and our fighting I want to dance  
When I come back to a messy room  
I can see my own loneliness through your existence  
Though it would be better to become kinder for my sake and not someone elses  
I cant feel lonely all by myself thats why  
For you I want to give you the same loneliness so that you can become strong  
So that someday it can reach you thats why  
I sing this song for you  
Even on mornings when I dont want to get up  
I get up to see your face  
On sleepless nights  
I sing to myself the song you gave me  
Dont get me wrong  
I dont intend to ever rely on you for anything at all  
If theres a song I can sing for only me and not anyone else  
I dont wanna remember that kind of song  
Thats why for you if you misunderstand me I feel this heartbreak  
Eventhough I should be used to it eventhough I should be milder  
Thats why I sing this song for you  
I want to make you cry  
Let me hurt you and let me heal you  
When I want to fly you always give me a brighter sky  
You want to make me cry  
You taught me joy by sorrow  
When I want to shine you always give me a darker sky
