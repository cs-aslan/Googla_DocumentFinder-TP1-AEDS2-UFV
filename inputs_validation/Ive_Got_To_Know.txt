Id like to know baby  
How you feel about me  
Id like to know baby  
How you feel about me  
Ive got to know if you think you might leave me  
Baby wont you break it to me  
If youre planning to deceive me  
Woahoh to deceive me  
Id like to hear  
What you say when you talk about me  
Do your friends know something I dont  
Or just appears to be  
Everyone says on the surface things look fine  
Am I still the only one for you  
And is it true are you really mine  
Woahoh really mine  
If you go away I wont know what to do or what to say  
Baby I cant make it without you beside me every day  
Baby tell me baby show that this is not a fake  
Just try and show me that theres no mistake  
In staying with you  
Woahoh with you  
  
Id like to know baby  
How you feel about me  
Id like to know baby  
How you feel about me  
Ive got to know if you think you might leave me  
Baby wont you break it to me  
If youre planning to deceive me  
Woahoh to deceive me  
  
Id like to know Id like to know Id like to know
