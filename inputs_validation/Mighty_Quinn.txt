Dylan  
Come all without come all within  
Youll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn  
Come all without come all within  
Youll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn  
  
Everybodys building ships and boats  
Some are building monuments others jotting down notes  
Everybodys in despair every girl and boy  
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here  
Everybodys gonna jump for joy  
  
Chorus  
  
I like to go just like the rest I like my sugar sweet  
But jumping queues and making haste  
Just aint my cup of meat  
Everyones beneath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb  
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here  
All the pigeons gonna run to him  
  
Chorus  
  
Let me do what I want to do I cant decide em all  
Just tell me where to put em and Ill tell you who call  
Nobody can get no sleep theres someone on everyones toes  
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here  
Everybodys gonna want to doze  
  
Chorus
