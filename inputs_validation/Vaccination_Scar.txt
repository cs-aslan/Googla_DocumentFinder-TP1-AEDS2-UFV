So the chemistry set  
And Im not the saddest cheerleader  
To forget the American word  
For the gang in the head  
That dwindles til no members won  
The mysteries met  
The sky looks threatened  
Heading home in the dust  
Singing Life is Forgetting  
Good enough for the frivolous  
  
Theres one thing I remember is  
This tear on your bare shoulder  
This little silver boulder  
This slowly falling star  
Were rolling so what  
Never getting older where the moonshocked curtains part  
The start of enough  
A teardrop then a Vaccination scar  
  
Ill tell ya if Im involved that is  
Ill tell ya like it is  
Random like a bad cartoon like  
The Tacoma Narrows Bridge  
Like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge  
  
Swimming on a bit  
Stop youre treading water as the sun assimilated the words  
For lighthouse fire  
Burning down to embers end  
The mysteries met  
Sky just reddened  
Headin home under dusk  
Is life just forgettin another word for frivolous  
Little silver boulder silence from Mars  
For the heart of enough  
Or a teardrop then a Vaccination Scar  
  
Wherever you are  
Scar
