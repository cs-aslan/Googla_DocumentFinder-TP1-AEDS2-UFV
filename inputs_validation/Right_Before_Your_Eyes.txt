Everyday I sit beside you  
On the bus to Madison Avenue  
Working the big gray store  
With the revolving door  
You dont even know my name  
I guess that Im to blame  
Dont know the right things to say  
So I pretend away  
  
That Im Rudolph Valentino  
Pull up in a limosine  
Oh wont you come in out of the rain  
Things will never be the same  
And then just like Greta Garbo  
You staring like theres no tomorrow  
And you know what Im thinking of  
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you  
Do do do do do do do do do do do  
  
Tody Im done with games  
Gonna ask you for your name  
Say Ive been watching you  
I even know what you do  
Maybe today Ill tell you  
Ive found the nerve to sell you  
On a guy like me  
Wishes that he could be  
  
Your Rudolph Valentino  
Pull up in a limosine  
Oh wont you come in out of the rain  
Things will never be the same  
And then just like Greta Garbo  
Youre staring like theres no tomorrow  
And you know what Im thinking of  
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you  
Do do do  
  
Repeat chorus to end of song
