Dolly Parton  
I know this dress Im wearing doesnt hide the secret Ive tried concealing  
When he left he promised me hed be back by the time it was revealing  
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow oer the fields of
clover  
And time is running out for me I wish that he would hurry down from Dover  
Hes been gone so long when he left the snow was deep upon the ground  
And I have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown  
At any time a tiny face will show itself cause waitings almost over  
But I wont have a name to give it if he doesnt hurry down from Dover from
Dover from Dover  
My folks werent understanding when they found out they sent me from the home
place  
My daddy said if folks found out hed be ashamed to ever show his face  
My mamma said I was a fool she did not believe it when I told her  
Momma everythings gonna be all right cause soon he would be coming down
from Dover  
I found a place to stay out on a farm takin care of that old lady  
She never asked me nuthin so I never talked to her about my baby  
I sent a messgae to my mom with a name and address of Ms ol Grover  
And to make sure he got that information when he came down from Dover  
I loved him more than anything and I could not refuse him when he needed me  
He was the only one Id loved and I just cant believe that he was usin me  
He wouldnt leave me here like this I know it cant be so it cant be over  
He wouldnt make me go through this alone hell be coming down from Dover  
My body aches the time is here its lonely in this place where Im lying  
Our baby has been born but somethings wrong its too still I hear no
crying  
I guess in some strange way she knew shed never have a fathers arms to hold
her  
So dying was her way of tellin me he wasnt coming down from Dover from
Dover from Dover  
Down from Dover
