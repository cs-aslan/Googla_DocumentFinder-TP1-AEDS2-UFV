Come with me to a place no eyes have ever seen  
A million miles from here where no ones ever been  
Godgiven grace and a holy heaven face  
Im on the edge of something shattering  
Im coming through  
OK lets fly she says this carpets made for two  
This ugly little box no place for me and you  
Our carpet falls on a dewfresh dappled plain  
Take a look around theres something happening  
All the colors fade  
  
I dont want you now  
Bang bang bang gone  
Ooh I dont need you now  
The seeds are sown  
Ooh bang bang pretty pretty bang bang  
I dont think so no no  
I dont think so no no  
Bang bang
