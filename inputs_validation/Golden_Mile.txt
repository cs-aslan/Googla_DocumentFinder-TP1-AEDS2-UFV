Walkin along golden mile with a soldiers twirl  
I must be the luckiest soul in the whole wide world  
Oh foolish thing here I go again  
  
Theres no faith more innocent than blind faith and thats all Ive got  
So Im scaling the walls of my dreams ready or not  
Oh foolish thing here I go again  
  
Dont be afraid darling  
No need to be afraid darling  
You dont have to be afraid from now on  
Its just the way darling  
We get delayed darling  
But we wont be delayed from now on  
  
I know no power on earth nor up above  
That would alter the way things are you are my love  
Yes youre my pride and joy on the golden mile  
  
If only it could be captured  
how I feel for you  
And if I could just freeze it I feel Id never be untrue  
Oh foolish thing here I go  
Here I go again  
  
Dont be afraid darling  
No need to be afraid darling  
You dont have to be afraid from now on  
Its just the way darling  
We get delayed darling  
But we wont be delayed from now on  
  
I know no power on earth nor up above  
That would alter the way things are you are my love  
Youre my pride and joy my pride and joy  
Yes youre my pride and joy on the golden mile
