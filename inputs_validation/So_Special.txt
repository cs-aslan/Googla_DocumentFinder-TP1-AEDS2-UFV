Is it wrong for thinking that I can trust you  
Never holding all this shh against you  
But now Im strapped with my 45 special  
Im so special so special so special  
Nigga you softer than a homosexual  
And I am so extraterrestrial  
So you can keep my things  
Theres nothing you can bring  
And oyu can have my ring you can add it to your bling  
Cause Im ok and Im still a G  
Pray for my enemies my names still Nicki  
In time youll change but time dont freeze  
You better leave better fore you get wetter than Pisces
