Shadows falling in the noonday sun  
Blue feeling to the maximum  
Look what happens when you love someone  
And they dont love you  
  
The heartache  
The risk you run  
The chance you take  
When you love someone  
And the sorrow  
For the lonely one  
When the heartache comes  
  
Never thought Id be alone like this  
Guess I should have been a realist  
Thats the trouble with relationships  
They end too soon  
  
And the heartache  
The risk you run  
The chance you take  
When you love someone  
And the sorrow  
For the lonely one  
When the heartache comes  
And the darkness falls  
And the rain comes down  
In the midst of spring  
Theres a sadness in the heart of things  
  
And the heartache  
The risk you run  
The chance you take  
When you love someone  
And the sorrow  
For the lonely one  
When the heartache comes  
  
Shadows falling in the noonday sun  
Blue feeling to the maximum
