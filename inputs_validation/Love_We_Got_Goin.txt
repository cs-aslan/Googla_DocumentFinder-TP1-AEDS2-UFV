Weve spent a long time side by side  
Guess Ive loved your forever  
Sometimes we laughed sometimes we cried  
Still we made it together  
I dont know what Id do without you  
Girl you make me smile  
You know I cant stop thinkin about you  
Oh you drive me wild  
  
Chorus  
Baby our love is still comin on strong  
You give me strength that I needed so long  
I cant explain how I feel in my heart  
But the love we got goin will never fall apart  
  
Now here you are still in my arms  
After so many years have gone  
It seems we both were meant to be  
Now that all of the tears have gone  
And when its time to settle down  
And get ourselves a home  
Ill be beside you all the way  
Never again will you be alone  
  
Chorus
