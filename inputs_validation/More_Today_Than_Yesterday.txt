I dont remember what day it was  
I didnt notice what time it was  
All I know is that I fell in love with you  
And if all my dreams come true  
Ill be spending time with you  
  
Every days a new day in love with you  
With each day comes a new way of loving you  
Every time I kiss your lips my mind starts to wander  
And if all my dreams come true  
Ill be spending time with you  
  
Oh I love you more today than yesterday  
But not as much as tomorrow  
I love you more today than yesterday  
But darling not as much as tomorrow  
  
Tomorrows date means springtimes just a day away  
Cupid we dont need ya now be on your way  
I thank the lord for love like ours that grows ever stronger  
And I always will be true I know you feel the same way too  
  
Oh I love you more today than yesterday  
But not as much as tomorrow  
I love you more today than yesterday  
But only half as much as tomorrow  
  
Every days a new day every time I love ya  
Every ways a new way every time I love ya  
Every days a new day every time I love ya  
Every ways a new way every time I love ya
