Just drive Im sick of talkin  
We know where this is going  
Im done take me homehome  
I cant wait forever  
For you to get yourself together  
Id rather be alone  
  
Im so tired of pretending  
Just want a happy ending  
  
Chorus  
Wish I could put a spell on you  
Wish I could make you feel like I do  
Wouldnt that be sweet so magical  
Wish I could blink and wave a wand  
Get everything that I ever wanted  
And put a spell on you  
And make it all come true  
  
You taught me what I know  
Guys like you come and go  
But I know things can change  
  
See my heart it may be broken  
But that wont stop me hoping  
  
Chorus  
  
I just wanna know what we shouldve done  
Wanna figure out what we couldve become  
Cause I know in my heart Im not over you  
I just wanna go back and try it again  
Turn back the time this isnt the end of us  
This isnt the end of us  
This isnt the end of us  
  
Whoa  
  
Chorus x2
