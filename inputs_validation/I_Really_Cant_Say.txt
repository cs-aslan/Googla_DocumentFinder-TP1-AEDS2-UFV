Chorus  
I really cant say  
How I feel right now  
I would if I could  
But I dont know how  
Just give me some time  
And Ill come around  
Ill pick myself up  
Ill dust myself down  
  
Lets leave it at that  
I dont want to fight  
Dont say anything that you may regret  
In fact its the last thing I need tonight  
Your words in my head are hard to forget  
  
Chorus  
  
Lets leave it for now  
Lets call it a day  
We dont have to talk about this anymore  
That look on you face gave it all away  
Weve traveled these roads many times before  
  
Chorus  
  
Lets leave it alone  
Before its too late  
Give it a rest for a moment or two  
We can pick it back up at a later date  
If you feel thats what you have to do  
  
Chorus x4
