I know how it feels to be on your own  
In this cruel world where hearts are bound to turn to stone  
Where you are alone and tired of breathing  
Its all going wrong and you just cant stand the pain anymore  
Youre too numb to believe in anything  
  
Baby just dont close your heart  
Baby just dont close your heart  
Baby just dont close your heart  
Darling dont let me down  
  
I know how easy it is to let go  
Surrender to despair lurking at your door  
To lose your soul and all your feelings  
Strength all gone  
And so many things left unsaid and deeds undone  
Youve stopped caring  
Cause its all in vain  
  
Baby just dont close your heart  
Baby just dont close your heart  
Baby just dont close your heart  
Darling dont let me down  
  
Youre so alone and tired of breathing  
Its all gone wrong and you just cant stand the pain  
  
Baby just dont close your heart  
Baby just dont close your heart  
Baby just dont close your heart  
Darling dont let me down  
Dont let me down  
Dont let me down  
Just dont let me down
