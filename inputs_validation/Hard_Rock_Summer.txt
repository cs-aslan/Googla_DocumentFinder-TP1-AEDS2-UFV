Im a rock and roll vagabond  
Im a streetwise runaway  
Sixteen when I left home  
And I dont regret it a single day  
Im a sucker for a loud guitar  
Got one tatooed on my chest  
Its hot July  
My mouths too dry  
  
You know Ill be screamin  
Hard rock summer  
Hard rock summer  
  
  
  
Hard rock summer in the USA  
  
Hard rock summer in the USA  
  
Got a job  
It was so damn hard  
Just workin for the man  
All year long I saved my pay  
And I stashed it in a rusty can  
  
And blew my head  
Then he blew me out of town  
I parked my van at the LA sand  
California screamin  
Hard rock summer  
Hard rock summer  
  
Rock all night  
Gonna blow this town  
Til morning light  
Going round and round  
Hard rock summer in the USA
