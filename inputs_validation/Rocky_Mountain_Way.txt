Spent the last year  
Rocky mountain way  
Couldnt get much higher  
Out to pasture  
I think its safe to say  
Time to open fire  
And we dont need the ladies  
Crying cause the storys sad oh yeah  
cause the rocky mountain way  
Is better than the way we had  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Rocky mountain way oh  
  
Well hes tellin us this  
Hes tellin us that  
Changin it everyday  
Says it doesnt matter  
Bases are loaded and caseys at bat  
Playin it play by play  
Its time to change the batter  
  
And we dont need the ladies  
Crying cause the storys sad so sad  
Cause the rocky mountain way  
Is better than the way we had  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Rocky mountain way  
  
And we dont need the ladies  
Crying cause the storys sad so sad  
Cause the rocky mountain way  
Is better than the way we had  
Its better than the way we had  
Its better than the way we had  
So much better  
So much better  
Its so much better  
Its so much better  
  
Rocky mountain way
