Im never gonna cry again  
Im never gonna die again  
Ill shed some tears for you  
Ill shed more tears for you than the ocean the ocean  
I didnt wanna let you know  
I didnt wanna take your time  
I didnt wanna bring you down  
I didnt want to hang around you around you  
So were living in desperate times  
Oh such an unfortunate time  
I cant relate to you  
I just cant find a place to be near you to be near you  
Im never gonna cry again  
Im never gonna cry again  
Im never gonna cry again
