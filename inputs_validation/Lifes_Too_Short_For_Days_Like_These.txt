Needed a car looked around for a week  
For two dollars down I signed my name on the lease  
There was a knock on my door old man wants his keys  
All he said was something about bankruptcy  
  
Oh no here we go  
There aint no day thats different from the day you know that  
Lifes too short for days like these  
Try to close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
Its hard to keep running when youre down on your knees  
Lifes too short for days like these  
  
Minding my own business in a restaurant  
Trying to get some dinner but then guess what  
Some chick got there I slept with threw her drink in my face  
And then her ugly brother kicked my ass all over the place  
  
Oh no here we go  
Aint no day thats different from the day you know that  
Lifes too short for days like these  
Try to close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
Its hard to keep running when youre down on your knees  
Lifes too short for days like these  
Too short baby  
  
I met her last night at quarter to three  
I couldnt believe that she came home with me  
Woke up this morning scratching now I know when to leave  
They say you lay down with dogs you wake up with fleas  
  
You know that lifes too short for days like these  
Try to close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
Its hard to keep running when youre down on your knees  
Lifes too short for days  
Lifes too short for days like these  
Seems like lately baby its all trick or treat  
Id get up and dance if I could get on my feet  
  
Lifes too short for days  
Lifes too short for days  
Lifes too short for days like these  
  
Lifes too short for days like these  
Wish I could close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
Its hard to keep running when youre down on your knees  
Cause lifes too short  
You know that lifes too short for days like these  
They say lifes too short
