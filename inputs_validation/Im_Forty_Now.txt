There were barefoot dreams of catching outlaws  
There were school dreams of catching footballs  
There were young dreams of finding great romance  
There were armies and I took the chance  
There were avenues of glory and some deep despair  
That put subtle shapes of silver in my hair  
Well Im forty now and Im a man but I cant resist the urge to put dreams in
my plans  
So many hopeless dreams and I broke some vows  
Maybe life begins for me Im forty now  
There were summer nights and there were good days life was water and I made
waves  
Oh I was crazy then so I made some breaks maybe God can look the other way  
Either good outweighs the bad or we forget the bad  
Im thankful for a few friends that Ive had  
Cause Im forty now and Im a man  
Well Im forty now
