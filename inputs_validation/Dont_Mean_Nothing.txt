Welcome to the big time  
Youre bound to be a star  
And even if you dont go all the way  
I know that youll go far  
This race is for rats it can turn you upside down  
Aint no one you can count on in this sleazy little town Oh no  
  
Lots of promises in the dark  
But dont you open your heart  
  
Chorus  
Cause it dont mean nothin  
The words that they say  
Dont mean nothin  
These games that people play  
No it dont mean nothin  
No victim no crime  
It dont mean nothin  
Till you sign it on the dotted line  
  
The director smiles as you walk in the door  
He says I love your work babe but  
Youre just not what were looking for  
Its never what but who it is you know  
So easy to get stuck in all that California snow  
  
Take a good look around and youll find  
People tryin to mess with your mind  
  
Chorus  
  
Hollywood can be so lonely  
Make you the winner of a losing fight  
But the party is never over  
Cause stars are always shining  
Doesnt matter if its day or night  
  
The producer says let me change a line or two  
And a little bit of something can look awfully good to you  
And you want to scream but you gotta keep it all inside  
When youre trying to make a living  
There aint no such thing as pride no  
  
Lots of promises in the dark  
But dont you open your heart  
  
Chorus  
  
It dont mean nothing at all
