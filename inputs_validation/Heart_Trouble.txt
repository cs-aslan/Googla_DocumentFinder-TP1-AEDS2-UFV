The way you treat me baby  
Cheat and tell me lies  
I guess I shouldnt care at all  
But still I sympathize  
  
Cause youve got heart trouble comin on  
Yeah you got heart trouble comin on  
Well you think that you dont need me baby  
But youre gonna miss me when Im gone  
  
You say that love cant touch you  
You feel no pain at all  
You think that youre above it baby  
But I believe youll fall  
  
Cause youve got heart trouble comin on  
Yeah you got heart trouble comin on  
Well youll get down on your knees baby  
Beggin me to come back home  
  
You tell me youll find someone else  
But on ones gonna care  
Cause you have left a trail  
Of broken hearts everywhere  
  
Now youll got heart trouble comin on  
Yeah youll got heart trouble comin on  
Well youll know just how it feels baby  
When youre left here all alone
