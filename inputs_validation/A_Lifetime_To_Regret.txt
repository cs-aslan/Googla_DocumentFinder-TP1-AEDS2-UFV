Tonight Im all alone and broken hearted  
A love we knew I never shall forget  
And tell myself that lonely night we parted  
I got a lifetime to regret  
  
They tell me you are happy with another  
And I wonder if my memory lingers yet  
The things I said the night we said goodbye dear  
Oh I got a lifetime to regret  
  
If we could just erase the mistakes we made dear  
Im sure we could find happy moments yet  
But we cant change the past and Im afraid dear  
That I got a lifetime to regret  
  
I know down in my heart that Im forgivin  
Cause Im just like the fish caught in a net  
I know true love is what mad my life worth livin  
I got a lifetime to regret
