When we realize were only to die then were out of here  
Were just skirting on the surface  
We have only to click our fingers and we disappear  
Were just skirting on the surface  
  
Doll eyes trying to pull you through the ice  
Being drawn to the ledge  
When we realize that once were broken then nothing mends  
Were just skirting on the surface  
  
When we realize were only held in suspension  
Until someone comes along and shakes us  
And as the pattern lines cross their fingers like a web  
Will we die upon the surface  
  
Doll eyes trying to pull you through the ice  
Being drawn to the ledge  
When we realize that once were broken then nothing mends  
Were just skirting on the surface
