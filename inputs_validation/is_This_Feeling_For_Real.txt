I could never let you know what finally came over me  
I cant begin to describe how you made me feel  
I didnt believe it myself I thought I was dreamin  
Now were back together and Ill never let you go  
Ive been everywhere searchin for the one  
But no matter what I do I run into you  
Told myself so many times I just wont do  
But somethings tellin me it might be you  
I wanna know  
Chorus  
Is this feeling for real  
I wanna know you did to me baby  
I wanna know  
Is this fellin for real  
I wanna know what you did to me baby  
I can remember the time my heart was badly broken  
Can you tell by looking at me Ive been hurt before  
Now my heart is beating so fast my bodys trembling all over  
Now the world is shiny and new  
Were starting over again  
Ive been everywhere searchin for the one  
But no matter what I do I run into you  
Told myself so many times it just wont do  
But somethings telling me it might be you  
I wanna know  
Repeat Chorus twice  
Ive been everywhere searchin for the one  
But no matter what I do I run into you  
Told myself so many times it just wont do  
But somethings tellin me it might be you  
I wanna know  
Repeat Chorus to fade
