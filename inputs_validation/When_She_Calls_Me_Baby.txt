Shell call me honey when she needs a helpin hand  
She might say darlin if she needs someone who understands  
Shell call me sugar if shes feelin kind of sweet  
Shell say that Im crazy over my little jealousy  
  
But when she calls me baby I just reach for the light  
And Ill hold her like a lady thank God shes all mine  
With her arms around me I cant leave the world behind  
When she calls me baby well I know whats on her mind  
  
When this life has brought me to my knees  
Shes got a way of bring out the man in me  
  
When she calls me baby I just reach for the light  
And Ill hold her like a lady thank God shes all mine  
With her arms around me I cant leave the world behind  
When she calls me baby well I know whats on her mind  
  
Oh when she calls me baby well I know whats on her mind
