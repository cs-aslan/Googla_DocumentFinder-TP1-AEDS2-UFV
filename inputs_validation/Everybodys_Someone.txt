And every day begins the same  
Get up go out come back again  
Same old same old  
  
A thousand faces pass you by  
You never look into there eyes  
You feel so ordinary  
They feel so ordinary  
  
Hey everybodys someone  
No matter where you come from  
Theres light in every single star  
Youre more than who you think you are  
Hey everybodys someone  
And when its hard to hold on  
Remember you are not alone  
This house is everybodys home  
  
And every day we seem to chase  
The perfect smile the perfect face  
Same old same old  
  
For every one who gets to shine  
A million more are left behind  
They feel so ordinary  
You feel so ordinary  
  
Hey everybodys someone  
No matter where you come from  
Theres light in every single star  
Youre more than who you think you are  
Hey everybodys someone  
And when its hard to hold on  
Remember you are not alone  
This house is everybodys home  
  
From a king to a common man  
Were all part of a greater plan  
  
Theres light in every single star  
Youre more than who you think you are  
  
Hey everybodys someone  
And when its hard to hold on  
Remember you are not alone  
This house is everybodys home
