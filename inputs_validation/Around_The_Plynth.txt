Woken up on mornings such as this  
Thought exactly the same as Im thinking now  
Every night for a year Ive slept alone  
Cold damp room looks worse than me no no no  
  
Got a fear of death that creeps on every night  
I know I wont die soon but then again I might  
Water down the drain Im wasting away  
Doctors cant help the ghost of a man thats me no no no  
  
Water down the drain goes to the sea  
The pattern of my life keeps ahaunting me  
Moisture from the ocean fills the sky  
Come on down to the ground as the time goes by  
  
Slow down there  
  
I never found out the reason why  
My parents had to lie  
About the place that I was born  
Or from my hometown I was torn  
At the tender age of four  
I was livin by homemade law  
  
I never knew when it was to be laid  
My desires are never displayed  
I never knew what it was to be loved  
I never knew what it was to be laid  
I never knew what it was to win  
I never knew what it was to be loved  
No no no  
  
Get on up there  
  
I never knew what it was to be laid  
No no no no no no no
