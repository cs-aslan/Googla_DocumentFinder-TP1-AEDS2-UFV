Well its been building up inside of me  
For oh I dont know how long  
I dont know why but I keep thinking  
Somethings bound to go wrong  
She looks in my eyes  
And makes me realize when she says  
  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Everything will turn out all right  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
  
I guess I shouldve kept my mouth shut  
When I start to brag about my car  
But I cant back down now  
Because Ive pushed the other guys too far  
She makes me come alive  
And makes me wanna drive when she says  
  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Everything will turn out all right  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
  
She told me Baby when you race today  
Just take along my love with you  
And if you knew how much I love you baby  
Nothing could go wrong with you  
Oh what she does to me  
When she makes love to me and she says  
  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Everything will turn out all right  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
  
Dont worry baby  
Everything will turn out all right  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Everything will turn out all right  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
  
Dont worry baby  
Everything will turn out all right  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Everything will turn out all right  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby
