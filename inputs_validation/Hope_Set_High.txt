Ive got my hope set high  
Thats why I came tonight  
I need to see the truth  
I need to see the light  
  
Ive got my hope set high  
Thats why I came tonight  
I need to see the truth  
I need to see the light  
And I can do my best  
And pray to the Father  
But the one thing I oughta know by now  
  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
If theres anything good that happens in life  
Its from Jesus  
  
You know that when it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
If theres anything good that happens in life  
Its from Jesus  
  
Ive got my hope set high  
And like a star at night  
Out of the deepest dark  
It shines the purest light  
  
Ive got my hope set high  
Beyond the wrong and right  
I need to see the truth  
I need to see the light  
Cause I can do my best  
And pray to the Father  
But the one thing I ought to know by now  
  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
If theres anything good that happens in life  
Its from Jesus  
  
Oh and when it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
If theres anything good that happens in life  
Its from Jesus  
  
Oh
