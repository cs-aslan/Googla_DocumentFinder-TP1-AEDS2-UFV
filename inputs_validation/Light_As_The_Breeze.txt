She stands before you naked  
You can see it you can taste it  
And she comes to you light as the breeze  
Now you can drink it or you can nurse it  
It dont matter how you worship  
As long as youre  
Down on your knees  
So I knelt there at the delta  
At the alpha and the omega  
At the cradle of the river and the seas  
And like a blessing come from heaven  
For something like a second  
I was healed and my heart  
Was at ease  
  
O baby I waited  
So long for your kiss  
For something to happen  
Oh something like this  
  
And youre weak and youre harmless  
And youre sleeping in your harness  
And the wind going wild  
In the trees  
And it aint exactly prison  
But youll never be forgiven  
For whatever youve done  
With the keys  
  
O baby I waited  
  
Its dark now and its snowing  
O my love I must be going  
The river has started to freeze  
And Im sick of pretending  
Im broken from bending  
Ive lived too long on my knees  
  
Then she dances so graceful  
And your hearts hard and hateful  
And shes naked  
But thats just a tease  
And you turn in disgust  
From your hatred and from your love  
And comes to you  
Light as the breeze  
  
O baby I waited  
  
Theres blood on every bracelet  
You can see it you can taste it  
And its please baby  
Please baby please  
And she says drink deeply pilgrim  
But dont forget theres still a woman  
Beneath this  
Resplendent chemise  
  
So I knelt there at the delta  
At the alpha and the omega  
I knelt there like one who believes  
And the blessings come from heaven  
And for something like a second  
Im cured and my heart  
Is at ease
