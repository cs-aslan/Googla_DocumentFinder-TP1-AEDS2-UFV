If you really want me to Ill go  
Its not that I want to but Ill go  
If youve found somebody who could love you more than me  
If you really want me to Ill go  
  
I dont know just what youre tryin to do  
You told me that your love for me was true  
I dont understand my love please tell me what to do  
If you really want me to Ill go  
  
I need you more than you know  
Ask me to do anything but go  
I can hardly talk afraid Ill cry  
Just cant bring myself to say goodbye  
  
Dont tell me that its over  
I dont wanna know  
If you really want me to  
Ill go  
  
I need you more than you know  
Ask me to do anything but go  
I can hardly talk afraid Ill cry  
Just cant bring myself to say goodbye  
  
Dont tell me that its over  
I dont wanna know  
If you really want me to  
Ill go  
  
If you really want me to Ill go
