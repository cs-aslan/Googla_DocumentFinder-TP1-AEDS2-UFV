Everybodys happy  
Snow is falling down  
Prayers are being nicer  
Miracles all around  
  
From afar Ive loved you  
But never let it show  
And every year another  
December comes and goes  
Always watching  
Never reaching  
But this Christmas  
Im gonna risk it all  
This Christmas  
Im not afraid to fall  
  
So magical and nothing more  
Than words I never said  
You know its love you see me like  
You never seen me yeah  
Wrapped in red Oohoohoohooh  
  
Blue is where Ive been  
Green cant run to you  
Silver does remind me  
That mistletoes for two  
  
So I found a color  
That only tells the truth  
That paints a picture  
Of how I feel for you  
  
This Christmas  
Im gonna risk it all  
This Christmas  
Im not afraid to fall  
  
So magical and nothing more  
Than words I never said  
You know its love you see me like  
You never seen me yeah  
Wrapped in red Oohoohoohooh  
  
Ill never feel you  
If I dont tell you  
  
This Christmas  
Im gonna risk it all  
This Christmas  
Im not afraid to fall  
  
So magical and nothing more  
Than words I never said  
You know its love you see me like  
You never seen me yeah  
Wrapped in red Oohoohoohooh  
Wrapped in red Oohoohoohooh
