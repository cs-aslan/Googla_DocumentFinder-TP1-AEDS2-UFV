Dearest Esmeralda in another age  
Antiques would be modern we would be the rage  
Silk would be in fashion we would dress in lace  
Love would be the passion and the saving grace  
  
I slept one rainy night with you in Paris  
Made up for a thousand wasted years  
Dearest Esmeralda you are magic  
I close my eyes and you make love appear  
  
Dancing in the shimmer of a crystal chandelier  
Shadows singing so low only we could hear  
Moving to the glimmer shaking to the storm  
Outside it was raging but inside it was warm  
  
We said goodnight in the candlelight and thunder  
Now I wake and find youre never there  
Im becoming old enough to wonder  
Happy that Im still too young to care  
  
Masterpieces crumble empires tumble down  
Refugees and fantasies go underground  
Romance lasts forever love dont fade away  
They may take our future but they dont stop yesterday  
  
Cause somewhere in the cloudy skies of Paris  
we were part of some artists design  
Dearest Esmeralda you are magic  
In the gray around me how you shine  
  
Oh oh how you shine
