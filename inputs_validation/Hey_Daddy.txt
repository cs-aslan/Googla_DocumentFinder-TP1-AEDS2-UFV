Let me see let me see  
How my life has been taken  
Taken  
This demon haunts me  
Haunts me  
Theyre waiting help me  
Help me  
You fuck me up  
I cant get down  
You pick me up when I am down  
I can not live without them  
I do not live without them  
  
Hey daddy Daddy  
They are taking me away  
Biting  
Facing him my soul  
My soul  
Theyre eating  
Please help me  
  
You fuck me up  
I cant get down  
You pick me up when I am down  
I can not live without them  
I do not live without them  
  
They carry this thing inside of me  
Wants to get out  
All it does is scream and shout  
Im trying not to let them out  
They tell me to hurt myself  
They tell me to hurt myself  
They tell me to hurt myself  
But Im not going to listen  
  
You fuck me up  
I cant get down  
You pick me up when I am down  
I can not live without them  
I do not live without them  
  
You fuck me up  
I cant get down  
You pick me up when I am down  
I can not live without them  
I do not live without them  
  
Hey Daddy waiting
