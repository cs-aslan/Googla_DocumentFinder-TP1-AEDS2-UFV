Ah ha ah  
Gonna let you go my angel  
Though I could make you stay  
I could use my blind selfpity  
Throw it in your way  
But the times have turned between us  
And you know I dont believe  
That it makes one bit of difference  
If you stay or if you leave  
  
Why cant I be lonely  
Like that lonely rushing river  
Pushing down a mountain  
On its way to meet the sea  
  
Why cant I need somebody  
Like that river needs that ocean  
Why did you have to get so mixed up baby  
With a mixed up girl  
With a mixed up girl like me yeah  
  
Gonna make it short now angel  
Though I could make it long  
I could take through all the changes  
And show you where youre wrong  
  
But our dreams dont flow together  
And youll never never see the light  
So it really really doesnt matter  
Who is wrong or who is right  
Oh why cant I be lonely  
Like that lonely rushing river  
Its pushing down the mountain  
On its way to meet the sea  
  
Oh why cant I need somebody  
Like that river needs that ocean  
Why did you have to get so mixed up baby  
With a mixed up girl  
With a mixed up girl like me  
Mmm oh mmm oh
