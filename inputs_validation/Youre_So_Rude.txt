My mom she likes you she thinks your swell  
Got the makings of a dance hall girl  
Your low cut frock and your birds nest hair  
Stepping up heels and the way that you smell  
She says to take you back  
To see my folks again on Sunday  
  
Why it looks as though theres nobody in  
Theyve all went out to see my Auntie Renny  
Dont you worry you just come right in  
Im sure well pass the time til they come home  
Well let me take your coat  
Take off your shoes warm your toes try the sofa  
  
Its getting dark well miss the late night bus  
Its only eight but Im not taking any chances  
Whats that noise whyd they come back so soon  
Straighten your dress youre really looking a mess  
Ill wet my socks pretend we just got caught in the rain  
Oh youre so rude
