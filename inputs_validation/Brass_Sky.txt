I gotta bent up truck gotta fixitup  
So I set it on the backyard lawn  
Put the radio loud in the window  
I tuned it into rock  
Now Im patiently waitin on music  
But the dj rambled and sang  
And it was blowin in a brass sky  
But it wont rain  
  
A brighteyed woman on the hour  
Brings a glass of tea  
And I can tell shes as pretty as a flower  
When she comes to me  
She winds away the water  
From my eyes and soothes my brain  
And it was blowin in a brass sky  
But it wont rain  
  
And it wont rain for tryin  
And it wont rain for beans  
Theres fear in the sky  
A big storm is what it means  
  
Waitin out the weather  
By workin on the truck  
We get to hang out together  
Cant believe this luck  
  
Glass is fine by the hour  
But dont match with mine  
It got wrecked playin sailor in the shower  
Last Christmas time  
The songs written in another language  
But the weather forecast is plain  
It was blowin in a brass sky  
But it wont rain  
  
And it wont rain for tryin  
And it wont rain for beans  
Well its a bad day for flyin  
But they wont fly with me  
Starin at the boats and planes  
That are stayin on the ground  
Another wont leave its hidin  
Til the wind turns round  
  
A brighteyed woman in the kitchen  
Cooks up a kiss of death  
Boilin up mango crab and coconut  
And includin cinnamon bread  
But she drops the pan and says  
Paranoia is out and breeds like a runaway train  
And it was blowin in a brass sky  
But it wont rain  
  
And it wont rain for tryin  
And it wont rain for beans  
Well its a bad day for flyin  
They wont fly with me no  
Starin at the boats and planes  
Stayin on the ground  
Another wont leave its hidin  
Til the wind turns round
