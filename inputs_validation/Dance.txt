Dance  
If you will  
Dance  
On your capitol hill  
Dance  
If you can  
Dance  
Like a twentieth century man  
  
Take the people by the throat  
Give em a reason to give you a vote  
Take your audience up on stage  
Let them think youre a sage  
  
Dance  
If you want  
Dance  
Like youve got a house to haunt  
Dance  
Like a freak  
Dance  
Like you needed it all week  
  
Take your people by the hand  
Tell em youll get em to the promised land  
Take your woman in the heat of the night  
Make her think youre right  
Seemon  
  
Dance  
Like a chimpanzee  
Dance  
In the land of the free  
Dance  
Like a russian ballet  
Dance  
Like a funky situe  
  
Let em know that youre well read  
Quote the things that jesus said  
Lift your face and your whiskey neat  
To get you up on your feet  
Seemon
