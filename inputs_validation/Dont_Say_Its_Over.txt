They say that we could be in love  
They say that we could be  
They say well fall  
Like others will fall  
Dont tell me that its over  
You know youll break my heart  
Dont tell me that its over  
Youll see me fall apart  
Dont tell that its over  
Or else I well I might fall apart  
Now when we first met  
I was just a poor boy on the street  
And you looked at me and took me in  
Yeah and knocked me off my feet  
Now you dont really want to break things up  
The things weve been through boy theyre enough  
Dont tell me that its over  
Dont say that its over  
You know youll break my heart  
Dont tell me that its over  
Youll see me fall apart  
Dont tell that its over  
Or else I well I might fall apart  
They say that we could be in love  
They say that we could be
