Listen to me  
Ive got a warning for you  
Youve got to learn to take more care  
Cause if you swim in dirty water  
  
Be careful how you dry your hair  
In a room within a room  
In a hole within a hole  
Youve got to learn to share your secrets  
Or youll lose your soul  
  
Ive got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town another one night stand  
You know you broke the law  
  
Its so hard to hold back  
When the fire is in your eyes  
A silver dollar in my pocket  
I dont like surprises  
  
Ive got your souvenir  
Is that the price Ive got to pay  
It aint been that long  
Since the last charade  
  
Ive got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town another one night stand  
You know you broke the law  
  
I know youre guilty  
But Im carrying the blame  
I took out much more than I put in  
And I felt the pain  
In a dirty little room  
With nowhere left to hide  
You told the truth with your eyes  
But you lied inside  
  
Ive got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town another one night stand  
You know you broke the law
