Its 3 am Im drunk again  
My head is standing underneath my puke  
So make it stop Im getting off  
Make it stop Im getting off  
Sedatives and dizzy smells  
And spillin my guts out all day  
And make a piddle  
Make it stop Im getting off  
Make it stop Im getting off  
I slipped into a comma once again  
Wheres my organ donor  
Lend a hand  
So when you think youre all alone  
No ones left to come around  
Drop like flies and empathize  
And I know now that I will someday  
And I know that I will suffocate  
Suffocate suffocate suffocate  
One night stands and cheap regrets  
I take another drag off of my cigarette  
So stop Im getting off  
Make it stop Im getting off  
One last stop for onetrack mind ya  
Just gimme sheltergimme  
Gimme something  
Make it stop Im getting off  
Make it stop Im getting off  
I slipped into a comma once again  
Wheres my organ  
Dont know lend a hand  
So when you think youre all alone  
No ones help to come around  
Drop like flies and improvise  
And I know now that I will someday  
And I know that I will suffocate  
Suffocate suffocate suffocate  
So when you think youre all alone  
No ones help to come around  
Drop like flies and improvise  
And I know now that I will someday  
And I know that I will suffocate  
And I know now that I will someday  
And I know that I will suffocate  
Suffocate suffocate suffocate
