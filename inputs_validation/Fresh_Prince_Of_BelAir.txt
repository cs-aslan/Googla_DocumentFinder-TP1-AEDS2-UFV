Now this is a story all about how  
My life got flippedturned upside down  
And Id like to take a minute  
Just sit right there  
Ill tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air  
  
In west Philadelphia born and raised  
On the playground was where I spent most of my days  
Chillin out maxin relaxin all cool  
And all shootin some bball outside of the school  
When a couple of guys who were up to no good  
Started making trouble in my neighborhood  
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared  
She said Youre movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air  
  
I begged and pleaded with her day after day  
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way  
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket  
I put my Walkman on and said I might as well kick it  
  
First class yo this is bad  
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass  
Is this what the people of BelAir living like  
Hmmmmm this might be alright  
  
But wait I hear theyre prissy bourgeois all that  
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat  
I dont think so  
Ill see when I get there  
I hope theyre prepared for the prince of BelAir  
  
Well the plane landed and when I came out  
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out  
I aint trying to get arrested yet  
I just got here  
I sprang with the quickness like lightning disappeared  
  
I whistled for a cab and when it came near  
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror  
If anything I could say that this cab was rare  
But I thought Nah forget it  Yo holmes to Bel Air  
  
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8  
And I yelled to the cabbie Yo holmes smell ya later  
I looked at my kingdom  
I was finally there  
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
