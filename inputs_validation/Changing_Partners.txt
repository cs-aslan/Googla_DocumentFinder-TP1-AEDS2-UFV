We were dancing together to a dreamy melody  
When they called out Change partners  
And you waltzed away from me  
Now my arms feel so empty  
As I gaze around the floor  
And Ill keep on changing partners  
Till I hold you once more  
  
Though we danced for one moment  
And too soon we had to part  
In that wonderful moment  
Somethin happened to my heart  
So Ill keep changing partners  
Till youre in my arms again  
Oh my darlin  
I may never change partners again  
  
Though we danced for one moment  
And too soon we had to part  
In that wonderful moment  
Somethin happened to my heart  
So Ill keep changing partners  
Till youre in my arms again  
Oh my darlin  
I will never change partners again  
Oh my darlin  
I will never change partners again
