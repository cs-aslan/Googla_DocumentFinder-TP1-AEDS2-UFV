Verse 1  
Feeling Christmas all around  
And Im trying to play it cool  
But its hard to focus when I see him walking cross the room  
Let It Snow is blasting now  
But I wont get it in the mood  
Im avoiding every mistletoe until I know its true love  
That he thinks of  
So next Christmas Im not all alone boy  
  
Chorus  
Santa tell me if youre really there  
Dont make me fall in love again  
If he wont be here next year  
Santa tell me if he really cares  
Cause I can give it all away if he wont be here next year  
  
Verse 2  
Ive been down this road before  
Fell in love on Christmas night  
But I knew you say I woke up and you wasnt by my side  
Now I need someone to hold  
Be my fire in the cold  
But its hard to tell if this is just a fling or if its true love  
That he thinks of  
So next Christmas Im not all alone boy  
  
Chorus  
Santa tell me if youre really there  
Dont make me fall in love again  
If he wont be here next year

Cause I can give it all away if he wont be here next year  
  
Bridge  
Oh I wanna have him beside me like ooh  
On the 25th by the fireplace ooh  
But I dont want no broken heart  
This year Ive got to be smart

If he will be here
