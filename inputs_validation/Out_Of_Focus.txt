I knew what I wanted and I was fixed on it I was sure of it  
I couldve been wrong  
It seems like its never quite like I thought itd be the reality  
Am I where I belong  
  
Its not like they said it feels like most everythings out of focus  
In my mind Im trying to make some sense out of what I left behind  
The difference in who I am and the one want to be  
It seemed so much easier when there was something to believe  
  
A different perspective now and the world I see is in front of me  
And everythings wrong the grass was so much greener when it was next to me  
Now its under me am I where I belong  
The world it only seems to change from where you look much different  
Than the pictures that they took its nothing like they said it would be
