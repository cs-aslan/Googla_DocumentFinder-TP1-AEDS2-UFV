All that Im living for  
All that Im dying for  
All that I cant ignore alone at night  
  
I can feel the night beginning  
Separate me from the living  
Understanding me  
After all Ive seen  
Piecing every thought together  
Find the words to make me better  
If I only knew how to pull myself apart  
  
All that Im living for  
All that Im dying for  
All that I cant ignore alone at night  
All that Im wanted for  
Although I wanted more  
Lock the last open door my ghosts are gaining on me  
  
I believe that dreams are sacred  
Take my darkest fears and play them  
Like a lullaby  
Like a reason why  
Like a play of my obsessions  
Make me understand the lesson  
So Ill find myself  
So I wont be lost again  
  
All that Im living for  
All that Im dying for  
All that I cant ignore alone at night  
All that Im wanted for  
Although I wanted more  
Lock the last open door my ghosts are gaining on me  
  
Guess I thought Id have to change the world  
To make you see me  
To be the one  
I could have run forever  
But how for would I have come  
Without mourning your love  
  
All that Im living for  
All that Im dying for  
All that I cant ignore alone at night  
All that Im wanted for  
Although I wanted more  
Lock the last open door my ghosts are gaining on me  
  
Should it hurt to love you  
Should I feel like I do  
Should I lock the last open door my ghosts are gaining on me
