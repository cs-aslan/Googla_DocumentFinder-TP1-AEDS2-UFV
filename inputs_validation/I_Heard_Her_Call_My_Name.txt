Ever since I was on cripples Monday  
Ive got my eyeballs on my knees  
I rapped for hours with mad Mary Williams  
She said she never understood a word from me  
Because I know that she cares about me  
I heard her call my name  
  
And I know that shes long dead and gone  
Still it aint the same  
When I wake up in the morning mama  
I heard her call my name  
I know shes dead and long gone  
I heard her call my name  
And then I felt my mind split open  
  
I know that shes long dead and gone  
Still it aint the same  
When I wake up in the morning mama  
I heard her call my name  
I know shes dead and long gone  
Still I heard her call my name  
And then my mind split open
