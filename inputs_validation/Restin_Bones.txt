Came up on a worried man asked him if he had a light  
He reached on down dug in his shoe figured in his sock he might  
He asked if he could come and join at what we was partakin in  
I saysold soul if you got a match you also got yourself a friend  
  
The smoke drew hard but laid in good the neon gave us extra shine  
We passed around a flask of knockando and a half litre bottle of wine  
The worried man dropped down to his knees and let out with a somber groan  
He looked up to me and when I asked he saidIm just restin my bones  
  
I looked down at him and him up at me then a smile rose above his chin  
He grabbed me by the arm and pulled me down said listen to me now my friend  
When I was your age I did it all more than many men could do  
Now my possessions are the ones I wear on my back and this lighter I keep in
my shoe  
  
Thats why Im restin my bones  
  
Im restin my bones for the times I fell fell and hit myself on the ground  
Restin my bones for the loneliness of being the only genius around  
Im restin my bones for prosperity in hopes that itll do me some good  
Im restin bones from amphetamines see they turned teeth to balsa wood  
Im restin bones for johnny cash cause for me and mine hes wearin black  
Ill be restin my bones for Elvis I seen him last week at the track  
If Im restin bones and you come along just try and tippy toe on by  
cCause when Im restin bones I hope to sleep and maybe slip away and die
