When my dreamboat comes home  
And my dream no more will roam  
I will meet you and Ill greet you  
When my dreamboat comes home  
Moonlit waters will sing  
Cause that tender love youll bring  
We will be sweethearts yes forever  
When my dreamboat comes home  
When my dreamboat comes home  
And my dream no more will roam  
I will meet you and Ill greet you  
When my dreamboat comes home  
Moonlit waters will sing  
Cause that tender love youll bring  
We will be sweethearts yes forever  
When my dreamboat comes home
