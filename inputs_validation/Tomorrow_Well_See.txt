The streets are wet  
The lights have yet  
To shed their tawdry lustre on the scene  
My skirts too short  
My tights have run  
These new heels are killing me  
My second pack of cigarettes  
Its a slow night but theres time yet  
Here comes John from his other life  
He may be driving to his wife  
But hell slow down take a look  
Ive learned to read them just like books  
And its already half past ten  
But theyll be back again  
Headlights in the rainy street  
I check make sure its not the heat  
I wink I smile I wave my hand  
He stops and seems to understand  
The small transaction we must make  
I tell him that my heart will break  
If hes not a generous man  
I step into his van  
They say the first is the hardest trick  
And after that its just a matter of logic  
They have the money I have the time  
Being prettys my only crime  
You ask what future do I see  
I say its really up to me  
I dont need forgiving  
Im just making a living  
Dont judge me  
You could be me in another life  
In another set of circumstances  
Dont judge me  
One more night Ill just have to take my chances  
And tomorrow well see  
A friend of mine he wound up dead  
His dress was stained the colour red  
No next of kin no fixed abode  
Another victim on this road  
The police just carted him away  
But someone took his place next day  
He was home by thanksgiving  
But not with the living  
Dont judge me  
You could be me in another life  
In another set of circumstances  
Dont judge me  
One more night Ill just have to take my chances  
And no its just not in my plan  
For someone to care who I am  
Im walking the streets for money  
Its the business of love hey honey  
Cmon dont leave me lonely dont leave me sad  
Itll be the sweetest five minutes you ever had  
Dont judge me  
You could be me in another life  
In another set of circumstances  
Dont judge me  
One more night Ill just have to take my chances  
And tomorrow well see
