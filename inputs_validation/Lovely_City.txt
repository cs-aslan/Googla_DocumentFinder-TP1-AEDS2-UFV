Lovely city when do you laugh  
Stoney people what do you have  
  
Well you ride around on a bright shiny cloud  
And you think that youve found true happiness  
Theres no method in your mind  
And your tempers are kind  
Is it too much to ask to give it a rest  
  
Lovely city when do you laugh  
Stoney people what do you have  
  
Im a part of you you dont wanna be  
Im an unexpected visitor whos dropped in for tea  
But Im not so low you dont even know that Im here  
You cant even see  
  
Lovely city when do you laugh  
Stoney people what do you have
