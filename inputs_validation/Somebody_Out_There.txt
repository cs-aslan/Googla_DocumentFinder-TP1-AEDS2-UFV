Maybe Im imagining the things they say about me  
Maybe there is really nothing there at all  
Standing in the middle while the rumours fly around me  
Hiding from a shadow on an empty wall  
  
When my back is turned hes up to something else  
And I must not stop believing in myself  
Am I dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there says that hes you  
Somebody out there talks like you do  
He calls up your number  
And you cant get through somebody out there  
  
Wish that I could run away and leave it all behind me  
Wish I wasnt hurt by all the things they say  
If I didnt need to know the simple truth about me  
Wouldnt it be easier to walk away  
  
And I dont need more confusion in my life  
No more pain and disillusion in my life  
If Im dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there using your name  
Somebody out there you get the blame  
Theres doubt and suspicion  
Its hard to explain somebody out there  
  
And I dont need more confusion in my life  
No more pain and disillusion in my life  
If Im dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there stolen your base  
Somebody out there parked in your space  
Youve no reservation hes taken your place  
Somebody out there wasting your time  
Somebody out there using your dime  
Your friends think youre crazy  
Theyre way out of line  
Somebody out there says that hes you  
Somebody out there thinks like you do  
You stare at the mirror  
Youre looking into  
Somebody out there
