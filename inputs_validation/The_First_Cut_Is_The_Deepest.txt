I would have given you all of my heart  
But theres someone whos torn it apart  
And shes taking almost all that Ive got  
But if you want Ill try to love again  
Baby Ill try to love again but I know  
  
The first cut is the deepest baby I know  
The first cut is the deepest  
Cause when it comes to being lucky shes cursed  
When it comes to lovin me shes worst  
But when it comes to being loved shes first  
Thats how I know  
  
The first cut is the deepest baby I know  
The first cut is the deepest  
  
I still want you by my side  
Just to help me dry the tears that Ive cried  
Cause Im sure gonna give you a try  
And if you want Ill try to love again  
But baby Ill try to love again but I know  
  
The first cut is the deepest baby I know  
The first cut is the deepest  
  
Cause when it comes to being lucky shes cursed  
When it comes to lovin me shes worst  
But when it comes to being loved shes first  
Thats how I know  
  
The first cut is the deepest baby I know  
The first cut is the deepest
