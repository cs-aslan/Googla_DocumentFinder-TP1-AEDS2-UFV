When you see in see you dancing  
Own reflection was never bent  
Be a man can shaking bone bag  
One day up is another down  
I dont want to hurt you no not ever  
No not ever  
This is my street I stay here and sleep  
Youre outside on sunny days  
Nicotine flow stops a pain grow  
Stay a while so nearly there  
I dont want to hurt you no not ever  
No not ever  
This is my street I stay here and sleep  
Youre outside on sunny days  
Be a man can shaking bone bag  
One day up is another day  
I dont want to hurt you no not ever  
No not ever
