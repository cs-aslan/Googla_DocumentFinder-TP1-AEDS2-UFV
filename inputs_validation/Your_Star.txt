I cant see your star I cant see your star  
Though I patiently waited bedside for the death of today  
I cant see your star  
The mechanical lights of Lisbon frightened it away  
  
And Im alone now  
Me and all I stood for were wandering now  
All in parts and pieces swim lonely  
Find your own way out  
  
I cant see your star I cant see your star  
How can the darkness feel so wrong  
  
And Im alone now  
Me and all I stood for were wandering now  
All in parts and pieces swim lonely  
Find your own way out  
  
So far away  
Its growing colder without your love  
Why cant you feel me calling your name  
Cant break the silence its breaking me  
  
All my fears turn to rage  
  
And Im alone now  
Me and all I stood for were wandering now  
All in parts and pieces swim lonely  
Find your own way out now  
  
Hey and nothing worth fighting for  
Were wandering now  
All in parts and pieces swim lonely  
Find your own way out
