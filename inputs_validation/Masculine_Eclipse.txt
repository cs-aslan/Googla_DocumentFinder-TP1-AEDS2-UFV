That grand facade  
Will finally diminish  
When he breaks your heart  
From start to finish  
  
Sisters dream of isles in paradise  
That aint no use when the captains just capsized  
The smile that you now know was a guise  
Left his clever lips and stole the prize  
  
So women take a losers good advice  
Let your hem go floating out but use the anchor twice  
Dont feel ever sorry for the dicks  
Just grab the dice and hope you roll a six a six

So as nature gave out semen  
To the jealous and the sick  
Jesus gave out candies  
To the dim or partially lit  
  
And woman youre a lighthouse  
While the candle only drips  
Girl you are a shining star  
In masculine eclipse  
  
In masculine eclipse  
In masculine eclipse  
In masculine eclipse  
In masculine eclipse
