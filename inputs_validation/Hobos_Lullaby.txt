Go to sleep you weary hobo  
Let the towns drift slowly by  
Cant you hear the steel rail humming  
Thats a hobos lullaby  
Do not think about tomorrow  
Let tomorrow come and go  
Tonight youre in a nice warm boxcar  
Safe from all the wind and snow  
I know the police cause you trouble  
They cause trouble everywhere  
But when you die and go to heaven  
You wont find no policemen there  
I know your clothes are torn and ragged  
And your hair is turning grey  
Lift your head and smile at trouble  
Youll find happiness some day  
So go to sleep you weary hobo  
Let the towns drift slowly by  
Dont you feel the steel rail humming  
Thats a hobos lullaby
