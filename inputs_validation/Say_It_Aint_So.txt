Oh yeah  
Alright  
  
Somebodys Heine  
Is crowdin my icebox  
Somebodys cold one  
Is givin me chills  
Guess Ill just close my eyes  
  
Oh yeah  
Alright  
Feels good  
Inside  
  
Flip on the tele  
Wrestle with Jimmy  
Something is bubbling  
Behind my back  
The bottle is ready to blow  
  
Say it aint so  
Your drug is a heart breaker  
Say it aint so  
My love is a life taker  
  
I cant confront you  
I never could do  
That which might hurt you  
So try and be cool  
When I say  
This way is a water slide away from me  
That takes you further every day  
So be cool  
  
Say it aint so  
Your drug is a heart breaker  
Say it aint so  
My love is a life taker  
  
Dear Daddy  
I write you in spite of years of silence  
Youve cleaned up found Jesus things are good or so I hear  
This bottle of Stevens awakens ancient feelings  
Like father stepfather the son is drowning in the flood  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Say it aint so  
Your drug is a heart breaker  
Say it aint so  
My love is a life taker
