I feel like Im walking on a mine  
Im gonna leave it all behind  
I feel like Im gaining my soul  
While Im losing my mind  
  
And I feel like I understand  
And I feel like a grain of sand  
  
Im gonna walk through that door  
Im gonna see what its there for  
Cause all I ever want is your skin or your soul baby  
But you couldnt give me either one of those  
  
And I feel like I understand  
And I feel like a grain of sand  
And I feel like a grain of sand  
  
You use to hold me like a flower  
We used to talk for seven hours  
I see the bigger picture now  
  
And I feel like I understand  
And I feel like a grain of sand  
And I feel like a grain of sand
