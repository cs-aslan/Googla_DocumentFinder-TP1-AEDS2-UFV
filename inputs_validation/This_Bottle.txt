Dedication They told me George Jones was full of whiskey and he couldnt sing
anymore They said he was skinny and sickly looking and he was through I told
em he was one of my best friends and whiskey could never make Gorge Jones
quit singing George was on the wagon when we done this song but he sings like
he wishes he had a drink  
  
Last week he spent his whole pay check on whiskey  
  
I know friday night hell do it all again  
  
Oh hell drink till he falls down  
  
Then hell order one more round  
  
And then go home with that bottle in his hand  
  
And the only thing I can hold on to  
  
Is this bottle in my hand  
  
I know Ill never have to share it  
  
With any other man  
  
Im so glad you introduced us  
  
And Ill do the best I can  
  
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand  
  
She told george that changing diapers  
  
Could sure become A drag  
  
And to clean the house and cook for him  
  
Was not her kind of bag  
  
She said she needed someone  
  
Who would love and understand  
  
Then she left him with that bottle in his hand  
  
And the only thing I can hold on to  
  
Is this bottle in my hand  
  
I know Ill never have to share it  
  
With any other man  
  
Im so glad you introduced us  
  
And Ill do the best I can
