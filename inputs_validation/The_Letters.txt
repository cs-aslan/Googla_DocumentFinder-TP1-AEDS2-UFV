With quill and silver knife  
She carved a poison pen  
Wrote to her lovers wife  
Your husbands seed has fed my flesh  
  
As if a lepers face  
That tainted letter graced  
The wife with chokestone throat  
Ran to the day with tearblind eyes  
  
Impaled on nails of ice  
And raked with emerald fire  
The wife with soul of snow  
With steady hands begins to write  
  
Im still I need no life  
To serve on boys and men  
Whats mine was yours is dead  
I take my leave of mortal flesh
