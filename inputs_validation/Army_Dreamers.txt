Mammys hero  
  
Our little army boy  
Is coming home from BFPO  
Ive a bunch of purple flowers  
To decorate a mammys hero  
  
Mourning in the aerodrome  
The weather warmer he is colder  
Four men in uniform  
To carry home my little soldier  
  
What could he do  
Should have been a rock star  
But he didnt have the money for a guitar  
What could he do  
Should have been a politician  
But he never had a proper education  
What could he do  
Should have been a father  
But he never even made it to his twenties  
What a waste  
Army dreamers  
Ooh what a waste of  
Army dreamers  
  
Tears oer a tin box  
Oh Jesus Christ he wasnt to know  
Like a chicken with a fox  
He couldnt win the war with ego  
  
Give the kid the pick of pips  
And give him all your stripes and ribbons  
Now hes sitting in his hole  
He might as well have buttons and bows  
  
What could he do  
Should have been a rock star  
But he didnt have the money for a guitar  
What could he do  
Should have been a politician  
But he never had a proper education  
What could he do  
Should have been a father  
But he never even made it to his twenties  
What a waste  
Army dreamers  
Ooh what a waste of  
Army dreamers  
Ooh what a waste of all that  
Army dreamers  
Army dreamers  
Army dreamers oh
