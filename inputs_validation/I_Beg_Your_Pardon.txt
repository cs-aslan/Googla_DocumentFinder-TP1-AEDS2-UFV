Im just a scarecrow  
with out you  
baby please dont disappear  
I beg your pardon dear  
  
I gotta a bottle full of trumpet  
a hat box full of drum  
I beg your pardon dear  
  
I got upset  
I lost my head  
I didnt mean  
the things I said  
You are the landscape  
Of my dreams  
Darlin I beg your pardon  
  
Id give your Boardwalk  
And Park Place  
And all of my hotels  
I beg your pardon dear  
  
Please dont go back to St Louis  
Cant you tell that Im sincere  
I beg your pardon dear
