Weight of the worlds on my shoulders  
Like Ive never known before  
And the winter winds blowing colder  
And I just cant take anymore  
Feel Im running down a dead end street  
Trying to change my direction  
All my troubles weighing hard on me  
It brings me down down down  
  
The only sounds I wanna hear  
Is the music of the ocean  
And the rhythm of you breathing in my ear  
As we drift away  
And the only sight I wanna see  
Is the light of your emotion  
And the look of love from you to me  
As the night turns into day  
  
Noise in my head getting louder  
and its spinning me around  
somethings tugging at my sleeve now  
trying to tell me  
That Im to high off the ground  
I cant explain it to myself  
I fear Im gonna drown fear Im gonna drown  
Standing out here in the pouring rain  
Im going down down down  
  
The only sounds I wanna hear  
Is the music of the ocean  
And the rhythm of you breathing in my ear  
As we drift away  
And the only sight I wanna see  
Is the light of your emotion  
And the look of love from you to me  
As the night turns into day  
  
So whisper words so soft and low  
The words of love that heal  
And ease my soul  
  
The only sounds I wanna hear  
Is the music of the ocean  
And the rhythm of you breathing in my ear  
As we drift away  
And the only sight I wanna see  
Is the light of your emotion  
And the look of love from you to me  
As the night turns into day  
Only us drift away  
  
So far away  
Drifting away  
So far away  
Drifting away  
Drift away away away away away away
