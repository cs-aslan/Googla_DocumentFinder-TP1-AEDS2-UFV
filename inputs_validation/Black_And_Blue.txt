Slip n slide push it in  
Bitch sure got the rhythm  
Im holding back yeah I got control  
  
Hooked into her system  
Dont draw the line  
Honey I aint through with you  
  
The harder the better  
Lets do it til were black and blue  
Well you never know when love will come  
Gotta get it while you got it  
A little bit of everything even when it hurts  
  
Sure feels good  
Dont draw the line  
Honey I aint through with you  
The harder the better  
Lets do it til were black and blue  
  
Yo mama  
Black and blue  
Black and blue yo mama  
Black and blue  
Gotta gotta gotta get it right  
Black and blue  
  
Dont draw the line  
Honey I aint through with you  
The harder the better  
Well do it til were black and blue  
  
Dont draw the line  
Baby I aint through with you  
The harder the better  
Lets do it til were black and blue

Lets do it til were black and blue  
  
Do it til were black and blue  
The wetter the better  
Lets do it til were black and blue
