If I ever write the story of my life  
Dont be surprised if youre where it begins  
Girl Id have to dedicate every line on every page  
To the memories we made while you loved me  
  
I was born the day you kissed me  
And I died inside the night you left me  
But I lived oh how I lived  
I lived While you loved me  
  
Id start with chapter one love innocent and young  
As the morning sun on a new day  
Even though I know the end Well Id do it all again  
Cause I got a lifetime in while you loved me  
  
I was born the day you kissed me  
And I died inside the night you left me  
But I lived oh how I lived  
I lived While you loved me  
  
I was born the day you kissed me  
And I died inside the night you left me  
But I lived oh how I lived  
I lived While you loved me  
  
I was born the day you kissed me  
And I died inside the night you left me  
But I lived oh how I lived  
I lived While you loved me
