I know what you did  
I know  
So Ima let you taste her  
I aint washing my sins  
I aint washing my sins  
  
Now were lying about the nights  
Hiding it all behind the smiles  
Take a look at what you did  
You probably thought that youd break my heart  
You probably thought that youd make me cry  
But baby its okay  
I swear its okay  
  
Cause I know everything  
I know everything  
I know everything  
I know everything  
  
Now these tops dont twist like they did before  
Tried to keep you out  
And you are done  
But baby it dont hurt  
Oh like you thought it would  
The more of you the merrier  
  
Now were lying about the nights  
Hiding it all behind the smiles  
Take a look at what you did hey  
You probably thought that youd break my heart  
You probably thought that youd make me cry  
Baby its okay  
Its okay  
  
I know everything  
I know everything  
I know everything  
I know everything
