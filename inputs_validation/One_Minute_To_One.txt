One minute to one and you gotta go home  
And I didnt even kiss you while we were alone  
I was sittin there wishin I could hold you tight  
But I reckon I waited just a little too long  
To Kiss you tonight  
One minute to one how did it get so late  
Even though I didnt get to kiss you  
Its really been a wonderful date  
One minute to one and the movie was great  
But your mamas gonna worry cause its gettin so late  
I just wanted to tell you that I love you so  
But I reckon I waited just a little too long  
So Wed better go  
One minute to one how did it get so late  
Even though I didnt get to kiss you  
Its really been a wonderful date  
I want you to know now that I think youre nice  
But I reckon Ill wait till tomorrow night  
And Ill kiss you twice
