Im breaking this wall down  
Everybodys looking like they know what I want to say  
No way to go back now  
Another scar healing but theres more coming on the way  
I hear you screaming your lungs out  
You say you feel helpless but I tell you that I feel the same  
We are all coming unwound  
The burden is so heavy and we cant shoulder all the blame  
  
Were not the lost not the dead  
Not the dying decayed  
Were the ones  
Who are living with the mess that you made  
Never quit deal with it  
Yeah were sick of it  
Whoa whoa whoa  
Lets go  
  
Whoa Oh  
Are you listening  
Whoa Oh  
Can you hear me  
We dont need your problems we dont need apologies  
Whoa Oh  
Are you listening  
Whoa Oh  
Can you blame me  
There is such a fine line between friends and enemies  
  
Everybody says to let go  
I try and I try but I think Im just conditioned this way  
Ill take your word if you say so  
But I know that youre lying when you say things will be okay  
Sick and tired of the status quo  
All our worst intentions are starting to see the light of day  
We wont admit it but we all know  
Things dont change without casualties along the way  
  
Were not the lost not the dead  
Not the dying decayed  
Were the ones  
Who are living with the mess that you made  
Never quit deal with it  
Yeah were sick of it  
Whoa whoa whoa  
Lets go  
  
Whoa Oh  
Are you listening  
Whoa Oh  
Can you hear me  
We dont need your problems we dont need apologies  
Whoa Oh  
Are you listening  
Whoa Oh  
Can you blame me  
There is such a fine line between friends and enemies  
  
Farewell apathy whats up to arms  
Discord in hordes in the eye of the storm  
Obscene machines that have nurtured us  
Traitor raider dont press your luck  
Farewell apathy whats up to arms  
Discord in hordes in the eye of the storm  
This melancholy menace has infected us  
Invader hater this fucking sucks  
  
Whoa Oh  
Are you listening  
Whoa Oh  
Can you hear me  
We dont need your problems we dont need apologies  
Whoa Oh  
Are you listening  
Whoa Oh  
Can you blame me  
There is such a fine line between friends and enemies
