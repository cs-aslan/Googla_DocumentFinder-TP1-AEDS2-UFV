Will you pass me down the wine  
Its getting near that time  
What you got tomorrow  
Only pain and sorrow  
  
Will you dance for me tonight  
I promise I wont bite  
Lets go see the sun burst  
Wait til I go numb first  
  
And in the morning come to us  
And if the evening showers us  
Sing to us  
  
Will you break it down for me  
cause what will be will be  
I can hear the thunder  
Gonna stop the hunger  
  
And in the morning come to us  
And if the evening showers us  
Sing to us  
  
To all my sisters yeah youre looking pretty fine  
And to all my brothers I bet youre feeling kinda high  
And to all the mothers well come on now dont be shy  
And to all the fathers who are sick and fucking tired
