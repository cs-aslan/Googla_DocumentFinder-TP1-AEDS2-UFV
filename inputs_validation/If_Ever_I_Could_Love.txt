I used to cry out in the middle of the night  
Baby hold me tight  
But there was no one beside me when I opened my eyes  
Now I turn the corner of those days and nights  
Something inside me changed and I think I might  
Be starting over  
I dont wanna run  
Oh no cause you might be the one baby  
  
Chorus  
If ever I could love  
I think it could be with you  
If ever thought I found somebody so true  
I wonder if you feel  
The same way that I do  
If ever I could love  
I think it could be with you  
  
You know I cant read your mind love  
But it seems to me  
That your heart and mine tonight are  
Defying gravity  
Theres something so familiar  
And still so unknown  
The closer we get I swear it feels like coming home  
And Im ready to be brave  
Oh yea and you look at me say  
  
Chorus  
  
If ever I could love  
If ever I could love  
If ever I could love  
If ever I could be  
If ever I could love  
Oh yeah no way  
  
Chorus  
  
I was scared to love again  
Till the day that came  
When she walked out of my life  
I got hurt so bad  
I swear Id never let another inside this heart of mine  
But you touch my hand and every plan that I had  
Disappeared like a fallen star  
Theres a new beginning and Im moving to the rhythm  
Of a beating braver heart  
A braver heart  
If ever I could love oh oh  
If ever I could love yea yea
