Finally Friday Kenny Chesney  
  
I got a hundred dollars smoking in my bill fold  
I know I outta save it but its burning a hole  
Right through my pocket and into my skin  
Come Monday morning ill be broke again  
  
Cause Its finally Friday Im free again  
I got my motor running for a wild weekend  
Its finally Friday Im outta control  
Forget the workin blues and let the good times roll  
  
I got a little sugar baby down the road  
Shes sittin on ready and rockin on go  
Well dance up a storm and later on tonight  
Well be working on a doing all the wrong things right  
  
Cause Its finally Friday Im free again  
I got my motor running for a wild weekend  
Its finally Friday Im outta control  
Forget the workin blues and let the good times roll  
  
Monday ill be hurtin with my head in a vice  
Tuesday ill be wondering if ill ever survive  
Wednesday and a Thursday ill be slowly tuning in  
Friday ill be revin up my motor again  
  
Finally Friday Im free again  
I got my motor running for a wild weekend  
Its finally Friday Im outta control  
Forget the workin blues and let the good times roll  
  
Finally Friday I got my motor running for a wild weekend  
  
Its finally Friday  
Forget the workin blues and let the good times roll
