Those city lights drew you like a magnet  
You were attracted to his highfalootin crowd  
I begged you not to go but you still packed up  
Ive been expectin you  
Oh look whos back from town  
  
My old truck could not compare to his Mercedes  
Did it humble you when you rode back on that Greyhound  
You picked a plastic rose and left a field of daisies  
Ive been expectin you  
Oh look whos back from town  
  
Chorus x2  
What brings you back to this part of the country  
Well let me guess ol loverboy let you down  
Did he throw you away like his money  
Ive been expectin you  
Oh look whos back from town  
  
Ive been expectin you  
Oh look whos back from town
