Well my father is a farmer  
A damn good one at his trade  
And hes always loved my mama  
Though we laid her in the grave  
  
Ive been down Ive been down  
A hustler and a cheat  
Ill always love my father  
His kind heart cant be beat  
  
Id spit in your face if you laughed at me  
Dont you know dont you know  
I might be a dipper but I aint a thief  
Dont you know dont you know  
  
Oh yeah  
Come on  
  
Well my father is a farmer  
Used to smack me on the ass  
Used to dress me up in my Sunday best  
Get down get down to Sunday mass  
  
And Ive been down so down  
Dont you know dont you know  
Ill always love my father  
I love him so
