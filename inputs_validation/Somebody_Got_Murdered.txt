Someone lights a cigarette  
While riding in a car  
Some ol guy takes a swig  
And passes back the jar  
But where they were last night  
Noone can remember  
Somebody got murdered  
Goodbye for keeps forever  
  
Somebody got murdered  
Somebodys dead forever  
  
And youre minding your own business  
Carrying spare change  
You wouldnt cosh a barber  
Youre hungry all the same  
I been very tempted  
To grab it from the till  
I been very hungry  
But not enough to kill  
  
Somebody got murdered  
His name cannot be found  
A small stain on the pavement  
Theyll scrub it off the ground  
As the daily crown disperses  
Noone says that much  
Somebody got murdered  
And it left me with a touch  
  
Somebody got murdered  
Somebodys dead forever  
Sounds like murder  
Those shouts  
Are they drunk down below  
  
Its late and my watch stopped  
Some time ago  
Sounds like murder  
Those screams  
Are they drunk down below
