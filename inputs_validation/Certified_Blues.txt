I woke up this morning with these certified blues  
They sure been stalking me round  
So down tonight I couldnt tie my shoes  
They about to drop me in the ground  
  
If I could shake loose I would feel so fine  
Theres one thing for sure and its on my mind  
These certified blues are gonna take their time  
  
Ive been living here way down South  
A place that I want to stay  
Been working hard just to feed my mouth  
Just can keep them blues away  
  
Theres one thing for sure and its on my mind  
These certified blues are gonna take their time  
If I could shake loose I would feel so fine  
  
You say youre feeling bad and you dont know why  
Youre broke and your woman been lying  
And just one thing before Im fired  
The blues have just been certified  
  
If I could shake loose I would feel so fine  
Theres one thing for sure and its on my mind  
These certified blues are gonna take their time
