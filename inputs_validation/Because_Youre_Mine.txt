Because youre mine the brightest star I see looks down  
My love and envies me because youre mine  
Because youre mine because youre mine  
The breeze that hurries by becomes a melody  
And why because youre mine because youre mine  
I only know for as long as I may live  
Ill only live for the kiss that you alone may give me  
And when we kiss that isnt thunder dear  
Its only my poor heart you hear and its applause  
Because youre mine because youre mine  
  
Because youre mine the brightest star I see looks down  
My love and envies me because youre mine  
Because youre mine because youre mine  
The breeze that hurries by becomes a melody  
And why because youre mine because youre mine  
I only know for as long as I may live  
Ill only live for the kiss that you alone may give me  
And when we kiss that isnt thunder dear  
Its only my poor heart you hear and its applause
