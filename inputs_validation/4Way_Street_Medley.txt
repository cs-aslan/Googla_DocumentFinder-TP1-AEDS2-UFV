Hes a perfect stranger  
Like a cross of himself and a fox  
Hes a feeling arranger  
And a changer of the ways he talks  
  
Hes the unforseen danger  
The keeper of the key to the locks  
Know when you see him  
Nothing can free him  
  
Step aside open wide  
Its the loner  
  
If you see him in the subway  
Hell be down at the end of the car  
Watching you move  
Until he knows he knows who you are  
When you get off at your station alone  
Hell know that you are  
  
Know when you see him  
Nothing can free him  
Step aside open wide  
  
I wanna live with a cinnamon girl  
I could be happy  
The rest of my life  
With a cinnamon girl  
  
A dreamer of pictures  
I run in the night  
You see us together  
Chasing the moonlight  
My cinnamon girl  
  
Ten silver saxes  
A bass with a bow  
The drummer relaxes  
And waits between shows  
For his cinnamon girl  
  
A dreamer of pictures  
I run in the night  
You see us together  
Chasing the moonlight  
My cinnamon girl  
  
Be on my side  
Ill be on your side baby  
There is no reason for you to hide  
Its so hard for me  
Staying here all alone  
When you could be taking me  
For a ride  
  
Yeah she could drag me  
Over the rainbow  
Send me away  
Down by the river  
I shot my baby  
Down by the river  
Dead  
  
You take my hand  
Ill take your hand  
Together we may get away  
This much madness is  
Too much sorrow  
Its impossible to make it today  
  
Yeah she could drag me  
Over the rainbow  
Send me away  
Down by the river  
I shot my baby  
Down by the river  
Dead  
  
Be on my side  
Ill be on your side baby  
There is no reason for you to hide  
Its so hard for me  
Staying here all alone  
When you could be taking me  
For a ride
