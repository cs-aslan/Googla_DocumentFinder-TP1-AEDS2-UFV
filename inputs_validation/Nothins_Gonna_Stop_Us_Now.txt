He was lost uncertain  
Only she could see  
He was waiting for the night to end  
And with just one kiss  
Brought him back into the light again  
He said nothins gonna stop us now  
He said baby nothings gonna stop us now  
  
But tonight shes waiting  
For a strangers touch at the dark end of a street  
And the whispered words from the sidewalk  
They sound so sweet  
He says nothins gonna stop us now  
She said baby nothins gonna stop us now  
  
Look out now cause shell break your heart again  
No one sees what the years have failed to mend yeh  
Standin there beneath the street lights  
Telling secrets in the darkest night  
Heavens just a stolen kiss away  
  
And her look it lingers  
On a restless night when youre back on the street again  
With his empty dreams theres another broken heart to mend  
He says nothings gonna stop us now  
They said baby nothings gonna stop us now  
Im telling you baby nothins gonna stop us now  
They said baby nothin gonna stop us now  
  
And tonight shes waiting  
On
