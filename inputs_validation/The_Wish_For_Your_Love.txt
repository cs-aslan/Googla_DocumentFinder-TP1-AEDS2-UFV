Come and whisper to me of a time  
When you felt like this  
With a unimaginable kiss thats made especially for me  
You cant avoid it  
Im telling you to look  
If I carressed you  
You would melt away in my hands  
  
Chours  
Dream with me  
Come and let me feel it  
The pasion that was born in me  
With the fire of your love  
Just one more night  
I wantto be next to you and fly  
Be your vice and a little more  
The wish for your love  
I want to provoke you slowly now that I have you here  
What noboy else is suppose to give  
Thats what Im giving you  
You cant avoid it  
Im telling you to look  
If I carressed you  
Youd melt away in my hands  
  
Chours  
Here you have me Im all yours  
What youve been looking for in me Im giving to you
