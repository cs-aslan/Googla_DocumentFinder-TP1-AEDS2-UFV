Feel so washed up today  
Havent really got much to say  
  
Blood on the pillow of my bed  
Explains the pain thats in my head  
  
Sometimes I dont know which way to go  
Sometimes I cant tell but its just as well  
cause Im walking on a high wire  
High wire  
  
Oh wont someone let me in  
Im stinking and Im full of gin  
No need to close the door so fast  
Im very fragile not built to last  
  
Sometimes I dont know which way to go  
Sometimes I cant tell  
But its just as well  
cause Im walking on a high wire  
Diving through the ring of fire  
High wire  
  
Have to pull it together  
Were in for some stormy weather  
Have to pull it together  
Were in for some nasty weather  
High wire high wire  
  
It really isnt too much fun  
Sitting round waiting for the night to come  
Its almost time to put on my suit of cool  
I may be an idiot but indeed I am no fool  
  
Sometimes I dont know which way to go  
Someties I cant tell but its just as well  
Cause Im walking on a high wire
