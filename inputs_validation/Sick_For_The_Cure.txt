There used to be a time when I thought I had the answers  
Answers to the questions that nobody knew  
Used to be a time when I had some time  
But when I had the time I didnt know what to do  
Wasted all those years never gettin any younger  
Times kept a changin but I still got the hunger  
Only trouble is the walls are closing in  
Sometimes I want to give it all away  
I just wanna be free  
Free like the wind  
And if the wind fills my sails  
Then Im never comin back again  
Maybe Ill head down south to New Orleans  
Wouldnt have no taxes cause I wouldnt have no means  
Lookin for a Genie that could fill my dreams  
But dreams become reality and real aint what it seems to be  
I just wanna be free  
Free like the wind  
And if the wind fills my sails  
Then Im never comin back again  
I just wanna be free  
Free like the wind  
And if the wind fills my sails  
Then Im never comin back again  
Sick for the cure on this roller coaster ride  
It can take you real low and it can get you real high  
Just passin time  
But time aint on our side  
Ah guitar  
I just wanna be free  
Free like the wind  
And if the wind fills my sails  
Then Im never comin back again  
I just wanna be free  
Free like the wind  
And if the wind fills my sails  
Then Im never comin back again  
I just wanna be free  
Free like the wind  
And if the wind fills my sails  
Then Im never comin back again alright
