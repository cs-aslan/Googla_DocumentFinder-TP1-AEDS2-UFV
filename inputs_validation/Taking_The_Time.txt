I was standing on the mountain top staring at the sun  
I was trying to act the heros part not fooling anyone  
I was living for the moment but the moment never came  
Taking notes and stealing quotes trying to make a name  
My times been taken with taking my time  
By making my mind up to make up my mind  
I was living in the country I was trying not to freeze  
I was working on the cabbage plants chopping down the trees  
I was learning how to cook the goose and how to milk the cow  
Taking out the dog for walks teaching him how to bow  
My times been taken with taking my time  
Im making my mind up to make up my mind
