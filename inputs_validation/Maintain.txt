ZRo  
Ima maintain all about fortune not the fame  
Feddy cold cash and a diamond ring its all about feddy when I  
Rap sing  
Im sick of this struggling all damn day  
Never see the sun cause skies stay gray  
This for the little kids that cant go play  
Cause everybody outside playing with an AK  
Come around my niggas you bust you fuck around get lost  
Better not set trip fuck around get tossed  
I be a fool with that break them off  
Lay it down little daddy straight take them off  
Yeah Im living a sin when against the grain  
You dont know ZRo you dont know my pain  
Tears be coming on down like rain  
Its a full time job trying to maintain  
Want to stay right but right be broke a nigga cant eat with  
Dreams and hopes  
Steady be thinking of sell some dope or trying to get paid from  
Songs I wrote  
In it to win it dont plan to lose got to be a real nigga fill  
My shoes  
Got to pay the rent got to pay the light bill  
Got to pay the depend deposit and pay dues  
Me and that HAWK got to deal with stress when it come my way  
  
But one of these days gone be out there  
Its a bitch took a ball ball and parlay  
Until we make it we mash together  
Ooint seven by the nine we blast together  
South sive for live SUC for life nigga we get cash forever  
  
Chorus  2x  
Maintaining hustling struggling but I got to survive  
Keep maintaining its a burden up on my conscience just staying  
Alive  
  
Hawk  
Im a real hustler stacking funds riding around with a loaded  
Gun  
  
Some of my niggas thats on the run with all that weed up in  
Your lungs  
Get your paper get your dough buy it off the show room floor  
Go about this process slow and feel the pain of my nigga ZRo  
Over money I lose sleep sell work fuck sheep  
Spit heat on beats to make my ends meet  
Press hard on tablet sheets everything else is obsolete  
Victim of these ghetto streets you dont work you dont eat  
I strive to gain fame struggle to maintain  
Stay away from no names and flip bricks of cocaine  
This rap thangs been good to me feeds my family  
Forever keep my sanity and do this shit for PAT  
Must keep a leather head for all my partners lets make em  
Spread  
Me and my niggas we break bread until the whole familys fed  
You heard what I said in this over bull  
All that I say I speak the truth  
  
Chorus  2x  
  
ZRo  
Looking at this little light of mine never did glimmer never  
Did shine  
Cause I resort to a life of crime and I know Im wrong but I  
Got to get mine  
Got to feed my mouth and five more I grind every day but I stay  
Broke  
Responsibility baby taking a load off my little day  
Steady be working her fingers to the bone aching and tired when  
She come home  
Bout to pull a stunt last of the month  
Aint no more work just riding on chrome  
No rocks in my pocket the on my neck  
One slip and Im tripping one growing up thick  
Give me a couple of zeros on a check  
I might sweat but never gone let up  
  
Chorus  6x
