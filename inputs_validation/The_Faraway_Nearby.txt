Out in the faraway nearby  
Can your hear my call  
Out in the faraway nearby  
Im breaking down the walls  
Till youre here to stay  
Out from the faraway  
  
Hot looks cold words  
Dont know what it is you heard  
But I didnt mean it  
If I said something wrong  
Short nights long dreams  
Something happens in between  
Then a weird feeling  
Like youre here but still youre gone  
Oo heart beats  
Like a knock on the door  
But it sounds so faraway  
  
In the faraway nearby  
Can your hear me call  
Out in the faraway nearby  
Im breaking down the walls  
Till youre here to stay  
Out from the faraway  
  
Big whisper small scream  
But its not like what it seems  
Locked up in the open  
Dont know which way to go  
Deserts oceans  
Leaving footprints in the sand  
Hoping that youll see them  
And wishing youd follow  
And walk with me hand in hand yaha  
And talk with me you got a plan ahha  
And hold me and hold me  
Dont stopin the faraway nearby  
Can you here me call
