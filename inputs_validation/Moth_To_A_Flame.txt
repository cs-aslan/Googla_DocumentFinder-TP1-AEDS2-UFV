Here again drawn like a moth to a flame  
An invisible force pulling me close to you  
I cant break free  
Theres some kind of hold over me  
Like a magnet you attract me like steel  
Im a kamikaze pilot its a oneway flight  
Getting to you is getting to me  
Must be lack of oxygen  
Im a do or die fanatic no rationale  
Cause anyone else could tell  
You dont stand a snowballs chance in hell  
Moth to a flame  
A fatal attraction  
Im flying too close to the sun  
Sooner or later youre gonna get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A lethal reaction  
Im loving you under the gun  
Its just a matter of time before I get  
Over my head in your quicksand bed  
The more I struggle the more Im sucked in  
Here again drawn like a moth to a flame  
An invisible force pulling me close to you  
Im a kamikaze pilot its a oneway flight  
Getting to you is getting to me  
Must be lack of oxygen  
Im a do or die fanatic no rationale  
Cause anyone else could tell  
You dont stand a snowballs chance in hell  
Moth to a flame  
A fatal attraction  
Im flying too close to the sun  
Sooner or later youre gonna get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A lethal reaction  
Im loving you under the gun  
Its just a matter of time before I get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A fatal attraction  
Im flying too close to the sun  
Sooner or later youre gonna get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A lethal reaction  
Im loving you under the gun  
Its just a matter of time  
Moth to a flame  
Missing you in action  
Im flying too close to the sun  
Sooner or later youre gonna get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A lethal reaction  
Im loving you under the gun  
Its just a matter of time
