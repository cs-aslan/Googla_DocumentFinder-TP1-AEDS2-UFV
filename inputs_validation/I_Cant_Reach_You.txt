Im a million ages past you  
A million years behind you too  
A thousand miles up in the air  
A trillion times Ive seen you there  
  
Your hair is golden mine is grey  
You walk on grass it turns to hay  
You blood is blue and mine is red  
My body strains but the nerves are dead  
  
I cant reach you  
Ive strained my eyes  
I cant reach you  
Ive split my sides  
I cant reach  
Tryin to get on you  
See feel or hear from you  
  
The distances grow greater now  
You drink champagne and past me plow  
You fly your plane right over my head  
Youre still alive and Im nearly dead  
  
I cant reach you  
With arms outstretched  
I cant reach you  
I crane my neck  
I cant reach  
Tryin to get on you  
See feel or hear from you  
  
Once I caught a glimpse  
Of your unguarded untouched heart  
Our fingertips touched and then  
My mind tore us apart  
  
I cant reach you  
With arms outstretched  
I cant reach you  
I crane my neck  
I cant reach  
Tryin to get on you  
See feel or hear from you  
  
I cant reach you  
With arms outstretched  
I cant reach you  
I crane my neck  
I cant reach  
Tryin to get on you  
See feel or hear from you
