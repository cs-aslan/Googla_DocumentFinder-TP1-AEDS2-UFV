Infatuation shes a fatal attraction  
Hang around screw up my mind  
I hope Ive seen her for the very last time  
  
Dangers of drinking but I dont want to die  
Got to leave this cycle behind  
I hope Ive seen her for the very last time  
  
And I cant wait til tomorrow  
I cant wait another day  
I cant wait til tomorrow  
Tomorrow she goes away  ay hay  
  
Over my shoulder I keep looking back  
I feel a presence following me  
So I know Ill never be free  
  
And I cant wait til tomorrow  
I cant wait another day  
I cant wait til tomorrow  
Tomorrow she goes away  ay hay  
  
Over my shoulder I keep looking back  
I feel a presence following me  
So I know Ill never be free  
  
And I cant wait til tomorrow  
I cant wait another day  
I cant wait til tomorrow  
Tomorrow she goes away  ay hay
