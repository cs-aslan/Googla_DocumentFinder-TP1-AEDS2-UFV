I cant stop singing  
I cant see the end  
Just a new beginning  
As long as I keep on trying  
Ill survive just fine  
Free to take my time  
  
Ridin the moon in the midnight sky  
I can see through  
The man who lies with eyes  
And the real thing thats wrong is  
He has no song to lean on  
So Ill take my time  
Just to give you my rhyme  
To try to be sure and open the door  
Cause theres much more to life  
Than a day and a night to dream on  
  
Now I aint confessin  
To same kind of blessin  
Im trying to say  
Why Im happy today  
Im not preachin teachin  
Makin some speech in dedication  
Cause its no good me sayin  
Where the blame should be layin  
For with that kind of reason  
It comes out the same  
With an ear to the ground  
Each day I found inspiration
