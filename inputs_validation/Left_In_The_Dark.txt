You dont need to sneak in the door just come on in to the room  
Ive been lying in our bed in the dark all alone  
Ive been waiting Ive been waiting for you  
Theres been no reason to move its been as still as a tomb  
I needed you oh so badly tonight but I guess you had better things to do  
  
I should have know that it was coming to this  
But I must have been blind  
I bet you still got a trace of his love in your eyes  
And you still got his eyes on your mind  
You swore youd be with me at 7 oclock  
Now its a quarter to 3  
Well whatever you got and whoever it was  
I guess you couldnt get it from me  
Whatever you got and whoever it was  
I guess you couldnt get it from me  
  
I know that you love me theres no need to talk  
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof  
And there are no lies on your body so take off your dress  
I just want to get at the truth  
I know that you love me theres no need to talk  
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof  
And there are no lies on your body so take off your dress  
I just want to get at the truth  
And there are so many things that I just got to know  
You tell me who You tell me where You tell me when  
But dont tell me now I dont need any answers tonight  
I just need some love so turn out the lights  
And Ill be left in the dark again  
Left in the dark again  
I just need some love so turn out the lights  
And Ill be left in the dark again  
Left in the dark again  
I just need some love so turn out the lights  
And Ill be left in the dark again  
Left in the dark again  
  
I should have know that it was coming to this  
But I must have been blind  
I bet you still got a trace of his love in your eyes  
And you still got his eyes on your mind  
You swore youd be with me at 7 oclock  
Now its a quarter to 3  
Well whatever you got and whoever it was  
I guess you couldnt get it from me  
I guess you couldnt get it from me  
  
But down in my soul  down in my soul I know  
I know that you love me theres no need to talk  
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof  
And there are no lies on your body so take off your dress  
I just want to get at the truth  
And there are so many things that I just got to know  
You tell me who You tell me where You tell me when  
But dont tell me now I dont need any answers tonight  
I just need some love so turn out the lights  
And Ill be left in the dark again  
I just need some love so turn out the lights  
And Ill be left in the dark again  
I just need some love so turn out the lights  
And Ill be left in the dark again  
I just need some love so turn out the lights  
And Ill be left in the dark again  
I just need some love so turn out the lights  
And Ill be left in the dark again  
I just need some love so turn out the lights  
And Ill be left in the dark again  
Left in the dark again
