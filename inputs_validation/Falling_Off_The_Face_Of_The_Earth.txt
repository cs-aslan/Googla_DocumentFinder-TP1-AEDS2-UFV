I just want to thank you  
For all of the things youve done  
Im thinking about you  
I just want to send my love  
I send my best to you  
Thats my message of love  
For all the things you did  
I can never thank you enough  
  
Feel like Im falling  
Falling off the face of the earth  
Falling off the face of the earth  
Falling  
Feel like Im falling  
Falling off the face of the earth  
Falling off the face of the earth  
  
Oh  
  
I just want to tell you  
You sure mean a lot to me  
It may sound simple  
But you are the world to me  
Its such a precious thing  
That time we shared together  
I must apologize  
For the troubled times  
  
Feel like Im falling  
Falling off the face of the earth  
Falling  
Feel like Im falling  
Falling off the face of the earth  
Falling off the face of the earth  
  
Oh  
  
Feel like Im falling  
Falling off the face of the earth  
Falling off the face of the earth  
Falling  
Falling off the face of the earth  
  
Falling  
Feel like Im falling  
Falling off the face of the earth  
Falling  
Feel like Im falling  
Falling off the face of the earth  
Falling
