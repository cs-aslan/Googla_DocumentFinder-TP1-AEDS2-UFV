Im calling out tonight  
I wanna feel his might  
And I wont be quiet  
  
Cause Ive seen the truth  
Wanna fight for you  
And we just cant buy it  
  
This is your life  
Are you gonna stand by  
And take  
  
One last look at Eden  
Just stop believing and walk away  
This could be our moment  
Time that we own it  
I wanna hear you say  
Come with me  
  
Are you still not there  
The ones who really care  
Whos open minded  
  
This is your life  
Are you gonna stand by  
And take  
  
One last look at Eden  
Just stop believing  
And walk away  
  
This could be our moment  
Time that we own it  
I wanna hear you say  
Come with me  
  
One last look at Eden  
Just stop believing  
And walk away  
  
This could be our moment  
Time that we own it  
I wanna hear you say  
To night  
Come with me
