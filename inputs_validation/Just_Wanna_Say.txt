Never have I seen the righteous forsaken  
  
Even what you told me  
You would always hold me  
Safe in the palm of your hand  
  
Even though I go through the valley of the shadow

Always

Never have I seen the righteous forsaken  
  
Even what you told me  
You would always hold me  
Safe in the palm of your hand  
  
Even though I go through the valley of the shadow  
Im not forgotten  
Never let a day go and I never let a day go by  
My my  
Gonna shout it from the mountain
