I said a hey you guys look whos awaitin outside Well she got style you can
see it in her feline eyes When she starts movin you sure can tell When she
starts shakin shes raisin hell I said a hey you guys look whos awaitin
outside Do you remember how she left that floor last Saturday night When the
cat broke loose well she darn near started the figh Well she may be flashin
like a neon sign But you cant touch her cause shes mine all mine I said a
hey you guys look whos awaitin outside And then the cat crept in and crept
out again The cat crept in and crept out again So I open the door for that
highheeled paw I said the cat crept in ooh and crept out again I said the
cat crept in and we crept out again I said a hey you guys look whos awaitin
outside    Hey you guys you can hear that alley cat cry Well she aint
superstitious but shes hangin on life No 9 Well you may not know it but she
hides in the light And she may not know it but this cat can bite I said a hey
you guys look whos awaitin outside And then the cat crept in and crept out
again    I said a hey you guys look whos awaitin outside    Hey you
guys look whos waiting outside She got style you can see it in her feline
eyes Well she may be flashin like a neon sign But you cant touch her cause
shes mine all mine I said a hey you guys look whos awaitin outside And
then the cat crept in and crept out again
