Driving in my car  
Theres nothing on the air  
Play a song thatll ease my pain  
DJs telling me  
That this is whatll be  
Help me Im depressed again  
  
My best friend disappeared  
With the girl I had for years  
My lifes going down the drain  
The skies are crying  
Everybodys lying  
Oh God Im depressed again  
  
Give me wings Ill fly away  
Magnificent and free  
Far away from the madding crowd  
Theres gotta be a place for me  
  
The boss is on my back  
I know Im gonna crack  
Looks like Im paranoid again  
Cant do nothing right  
See only black and white  
Oh God Im depressed again  
  
Give me wings Ill fly away  
Magnificent and free  
Far away from the madding crowd  
Theres gotta be a place for me  
  
How can I plan ahead  
With this hanging round my neck  
Looks like Im coming down again  
Thought about it well  
Analyzed myself  
Yeah Im depressed again  
  
Give me wings Ill fly away  
Magnificent and free  
Far away from the madding crowd  
Theres gotta be a place for me  
Im down Im coming down again  
Im down looks like Im coming down again  
Im down Im down  
Looks like Im coming down again  
Im down Im down  
Looks like Im pissed off again
