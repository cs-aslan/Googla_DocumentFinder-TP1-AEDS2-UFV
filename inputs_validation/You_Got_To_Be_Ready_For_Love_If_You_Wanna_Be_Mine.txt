You got to be ready  
You got to be ready yeah  
  
This woman dont like no nonsense  
I like lovin every day  
And I dont like to find no evidence no  
To prove youre giving my love away  
What more can I say  
  
Except you got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine ready baby  
You got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready  
  
This woman dont do no hand pickin  
And I dont think one look is a felony  
And I dont appreciate no rubber neckin no  
Bout a man when hes with me  
Out in the street  
  
Except you got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine be ready baby  
I said you got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready  
  
Ready for love  
Ready for love  
Got to be ready for love  
  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready  
You got to be ready yeah  
  
You got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine  
You got to be ready for love  
If you wanna be mine be ready baby  
  
Cant be a cold lover  
Just like my old lover  
If you wanna be mine  
You got to get ready  
You got to stay ready  
If you wanna be mine be ready baby
