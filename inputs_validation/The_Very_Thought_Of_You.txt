The very thought of you  
And I forget to do  
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do  
Im living in a kind of daydream  
Im happy as a king  
And foolish though it may seem  
To me thats everything  
The mere idea of you  
The longing here for you  
Youll never know how slow the moments go  
Till Im near to you  
I see your face in every flower  
Your eyes in stars above  
Its just the thought of you  
The very thought of you  
My love
