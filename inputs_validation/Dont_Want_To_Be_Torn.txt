Maybe its the things I say  
Maybe I should think before I speak  
But I thought that I knew enough  
To know myself and do whats right for me  
  
And these walls Im building now  
You used to bring em down  
And these tears Im cyin out  
You used to wipe away  
  
I thought you said it was easy  
Listening to your heart  
I thought you said Id be okay  
So why am I breakin apart  
  
Dont wanna be tornx5  
  
Dont make me have to choose between  
What I want and what you think I need  
Cause Ill always be your little girl  
But even little girls have got to dream  
  
Now it all feels like a fight  
You were always on my side  
And the lonely I feel now  
You used to make it go way  
  
I thought you said it was easy  
Listening to your heart  
I thought you said Id be okay  
So why am I breakin apart  
  
Dont wanna be torn x5  
  
Why is all this so confusing  
Complicated and consuming  
Why does all this make me angry  
I wanna go back to being happy  
  
The tears Im cryin now  
You used to wipe away  
And these walls Im building now  
You used to bring em down  
  
I thought you said it was easy hold for 10 seconds  
Listening to your heart listening to your heart  
I thought you said Id be okay  
So why am I breaking apart  
  
Dont wanna be torn x10
