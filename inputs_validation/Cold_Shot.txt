Once was a sweet thang baby held our love in our hands  
Now I reach to kiss your lips the touch dont mean a thing  
And thats a cold shot baby yeah thats a drag  
A cold shot baby I let our love go bad  
  
Remember the way that you loved me do anything I say  
Now I see you out somewhere you wont give me the time of day  
And thats a cold shot darlin yeah thats a drag  
Thats a cold shot baby we let our love go bad  
  
I really meant I was sorry for ever causin you pain  
You showed your appreciation by walkin out anyway  
And thats a cold shot baby yeah thats a drag  
Thats a cold shot baby we let our love go bad  
  
Dont let our true love run cold baby
