Weve got nothing to lose  
Weve got no reason to hide  
Weve got the answer inside of us  
Its time we took the disguises off  
Well see Your glory revealed  
And see Your Name lifted high  
There is nobody else for us  
Jesus You are the only One  
  
Youre alive and we are free  
You are everything  
Everything we need  
  
Theres not a minute to waste  
Not a second to lose  
Theres a city that waits for us  
Its time we took all the lamp shades off  
Well see Your glory revealed  
And see Your Name lifted high  
There is nobody else for us  
Jesus You are the only One  
  
Love has spoken and we believe  
You are everything  
Everything we need  
  
Nothing compares to You  
Nothing could ever separate us now  
Your love is ours  
Nothing compares to You  
Nothing could ever separate us  
From this love  
  
Tag  
Nothing can separate us  
Nothing can come between us  
Nothing can separate us now
