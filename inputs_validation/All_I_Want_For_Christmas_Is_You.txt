I dont want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
I dont care about presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas is you  
  
I dont want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
I dont care about presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
I dont need to hang my stocking  
There upon the fireplace  
Santa Claus wont make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas day  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas is you  
  
I wont ask for much this Christmas  
I wont even wish for snow  
Im just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
I wont make a list and send it  
To the North Pole for Saint Nick  
I wont even stay awake to  
Hear those magic reindeer click  
Cause I just want you here tonight  
Holding on to me so tight  
What more can I do  
All I want for Christmas is you  
  
All the lights are shining  
Brightly everywhere  
And the sound of  
Laughter fills the air  
And everyone is singing  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa wont you bring me the one I really need  
Wont you please bring my baby to me  
  
I dont want a lot for Christmas  
This is all Im asking for  
I just want to see my baby  
Standing right outside my door  
I just want him for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
Baby all I want for Christmas is  
You  
You  
You  
Yeah you  
You
