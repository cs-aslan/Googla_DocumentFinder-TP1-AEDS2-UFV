I guess I was foolish to understand  
That fact that Im leaving my life and starting all over again  
  
One day sittin back looking at old memories  
Thinkin bout those little things that you told me  
But what if I wasnt jokin  
Theyre all lookin at those who are provokin  
Little things that worry me are about to end  
Just like you and me being friends  
If I knew that this was gonna happen  
Then I would of just said  
  
Chorus  
The words foolish and Leave me alone  
Dont go together thats what you said to me on the phone  
But I dont think so those are what I am  
Sweet dreams little one is what he said  
Youre only foolish that didnt go to my head  
As little as you are you want left alone  
Confusing as a dog that hates bones  
Most girls love attention but I dont  
  
Think of me as a distraction  
Stoppping your work stopping your attraction  
Little as I know  
Im a girl who likes who no one would ever of dream of me thinking  
Little as I dont know  
Whatever caused me to stop the moment  
The moment when I wished say I love you  
But my dreams go away  
  
Chorus  
The words foolish and Leave me alone  
Dont go together thats what you said to me on the phone  
But I dont think so those are what I am  
Sweet dreams little one is what he said  
Youre only foolish that didnt go to my head  
As little as you are you want left alone  
Confusing as a dog that hates bones  
Most girls love attention but I dont  
  
Were newlyweds thirteen years later  
Im dressed in a gown laying down  
My dream didnt fade
