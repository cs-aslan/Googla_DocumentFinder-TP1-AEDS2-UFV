Sell me candy like its summer when its melting in my hands  
I know youre around like the ice cream man  
I can hear you calling whisper something in my ear  
You seem like sugar tell me what I wanna hear  
Im weak by your touch and when its melting on my lips  
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips  
Youre selling me your fantasy that I want to explore  
Sounds so good its got me rockin through the core  
  
Bridge  
Talk to me  
Take in my dreams  
All I need  
Is you beside me  
Its destiny  
Just let it be  
If words can speak  
Baby tell it to me  
  
Chorus  
Sell me candy  
Sell me love  
Sell me hope  
Sell me doves  
Whats the charge  
Whats the cost  
Im the daddy  
You the boss  
  
Be a professional boy you make a sale  
I try to resist but every time I fail  
The one temptation that I gotta enjoy  
Youre runnin through my gun when youre knockin at my door  
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet  
But the shawty that youre rockin is nothing like me  
Youre selling me a fantasy that I want to explore  
Sounds so good its got me rockin through the core you know  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
I wanna play more than you know  
So dont you leave and dont you go  
I want it all until time falls  
His arms I want to roam  
I want to love give him my trust  
I want to live for both of us  
I want to breathe you lay on your shoulder  
I want to warm you when nights get colder  
I want love love love  
I want love love love  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus
