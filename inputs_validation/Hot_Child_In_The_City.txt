Danger in the shape of somethin  
Wild  
Stranger dressed in black shes a  
Hungry child  
No one knows who she is or what  
Her name is  
I dont know where she came from  
Or what her game is  
  
Hot child in the city  
Hot child in the city  
Runnin wild and lookin pretty  
Hot child in the city  
  
So young to be loose and on her  
Own  
Young boys they all want to take  
Her home  
She goes downtown the boys all  
Stop and stare  
When she goes downtown she walks  
Like she just dont care care  
  
Hot child in the city  
Hot child in the city  
Runnin wild and lookin pretty  
Yeah  
Hot child in the city  
  
Come on down to my place baby  
Well talk about love  
Come on down to my place woman  
Well make love  
  
Hot child in the city  
Hot child in the city  
Shes kinda dangerous  
Hot child in the city  
Young child  
Runnin wild and lookin pretty  
Young child runnin wild  
Hot child in the city
