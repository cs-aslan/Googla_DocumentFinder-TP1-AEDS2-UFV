Let me introduce you to the gang  
Johnny plays the sitar hes an existentialist  
Once he had a name now he plays our game  
You wont feel so good now that youve joined the gang  
  
Molly is the model in the ads  
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip  
Someone switched her on then her beam went wrong  
Cause she cant switch off now that shes joined the gang  
  
Arthur is a singer with a band  
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage  
Look at Arthur rave all the kids are paid  
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang  
  
You wont be alone weve all got beery grins  
Its a big illusion but at least youre in  
At least youre in  
  
This clubs called The Webb its this months pick  
Next month we shall find a place where prices arent so stiff  
15 bob a coke fraid thats past a joke  
This is how to spend now that youve joined the gang  
  
This is what to do now that youre here  
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast  
Psychedelic stars throwing down cigars  
Theyre picking up the joints now that theyve joined the gang
