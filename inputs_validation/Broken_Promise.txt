Oh I dont know why people lie  
And I dont know why people die  
Every time I see you you shout at me  
Cause of all the things in the world that I cant see  
But what I think goes on in this world  
For a mother and a father and a boy and a girl  
Is that the more you earn the less you learn  
Theres a fire in life where we will burn  
  
And I never could believe it  
And I never could be true  
For the things that mean so much to me  
Dont mean that much to you  
And I never could believe  
The way you told me I was wrong  
If Im right and you are sinful  
Then for Gods sake I was wrong  
  
Oh I dont know how I think this way  
And yet you sit there looking at me all day  
Theres more to you than I can see  
Theres a shadow of another hanging over me  
But what I think goes on in this world  
For a mother and a father and a boy and a girl  
Is that the more you earn the less you learn  
Theres a fire in life where we will burn  
  
And I never could believe it  
And I never could be true  
For the things that mean so much to me  
Dont mean that much to you  
And I never could believe  
The way you told me I was wrong  
If Im right and if youre sinful  
Then for Gods sake I was wrong  
  
Oh Id tear you out of heaven  
And Id tear you out of hell  
And Id see your life in ruins  
Because mine lies there as well  
And Id cry out in my loneliness  
While you sleep in your peace  
But youll never see my face again  
While I need words like these
