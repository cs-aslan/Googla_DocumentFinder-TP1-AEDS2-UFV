Spent time feelin inferior standing in front of my mirror  
Combed my hair in a thousand ways but I came out lookin just the same  
Daddy said son you better see the world  
I wouldnt blame you if you wanted to leave  
But remember one thing dont lose your head to a woman thatll spend your
bread  
So I got out  
  
Paris was a place you could hide away if you felt you didnt fit in  
French police wouldnt give me no peace they claimed I was a nasty person  
Down along the left bank minding my own  
Was knocked down by a human stampede  
Got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot when all I wanted was a cup of tea  
I was accused  
  
I moved on  
Down in rome I wasnt getting enough  
Of the things that keep a young man alive  
My body stunk but I kept my funk at a time when I was right out of luck  
Getting desperate indeed I was looking like a tourist attraction  
Oh my dear I better get out of here for the vatican dont give no sanction  
I wasnt ready for that no no  
  
I moved right out east yeah  
On the peking ferry I was feeling merry sailing on my way back here  
I fell in love with a slanteyed lady by the light of an eastern moon  
Shanghai lil never used the pill she claimed that it just aint natural  
She took me up on deck and bit my neck  
Oh people I was glad I found her  
Oh yeah I was glad I found here  
  
I firmly believed that I didnt need anyone but me  
I sincerely thought I was so complete  
Look how wrong you can be  
The women Ive known I wouldnt let tie my shoe  
They wouldnt give you the time of day  
But the slanteyed lady knocked me off my feet  
God I was glad I found her  
  
And if they had the words I could tell to you  
To help you on your way down the road  
I couldnt quote you no dickens shelley or keats  
Cause its all been said before  
Make the best out of the bad just laugh it off  
You didnt have to come here anyway so remember
