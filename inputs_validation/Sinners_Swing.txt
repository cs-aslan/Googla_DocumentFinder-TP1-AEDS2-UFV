All right you sinners swing  
Danger in the rear view mirror  
Theres trouble in the wind  
Badness bringing up the rear  
The menaces loose again  
She looks so fuckin good  
So sexy and so frail  
Something got the bite on me  
Im goin straight to hell  
And now were wasting time  
Same old pickup lines  
And you keep trying  
Dont waste time  
Come back to your senses baby  
We can come to terms  
I can almost taste it  
It burns  
Youd be sitting pretty  
But you try to take the Fifth  
Wearin out my welcome  
Guess I better say my prayers  
And now were wasting time  
Same old pickup lines  
And you keep trying  
Dont waste time  
Get get get get get out and push  
Get get get get get out and push  
Get get get get get out and push  
Get get get get get out and push  
Get get get get get out and push  
Get get get get get out and push  
Get get get get get out and push  
Get get get get get out and push  
Soon youll see my silhouette  
Darkenin your door  
I can almost taste it  
I want more  
No ones above suspicion  
No ones got it wired  
Ill eat with my fingers  
Want my iron in that fire  
And now were wasting time  
Same old pickup lines  
And you keep trying  
Dont waste time  
Get get get get get out and push  
Get get get get get out and push  
Get get get get get out and push  
Get get get get get out and push
