Ready or not  
Youre gonna get a taste of love  
Just like you want it to  
Your wish is gonna come to you  
  
So if youve got a change of heart  
Stop that before you start  
None of this holding back  
I thought you knew that  
  
You cant be doin that now  
Stop it right away  
You cant be doin that now  
Cause I need a little kindness  
A little a little tenderness  
A little love somehow  
  
Other loves youve had  
Are just a thing of the past  
All a part of yesterday  
Forever and far away  
  
But never will I disappear  
My love is gonna stay right here  
So none of this pulling back  
I thought you knew that  
  
Whats it about my love my love  
Whats on your mind now baby love  
Answer my call Im callin  
Dont stop now that Ive fallen  
  
Dont let a good thing get away  
Weve got forever and a day  
To make the whole thing better  
Thats why Im gonna leave you never
