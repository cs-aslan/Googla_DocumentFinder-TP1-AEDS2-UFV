Twenty seconds and counting  
T minus fifteen seconds guidance is okay  
  
When I look back upon my life  
Its always with a sense of shame  
Ive always been the one to blame  
For everything I long to do  
No matter when or where or who  
Has one thing in common too  
  
Its a its a its a its a sin  
Its a sin  
Everything Ive ever done  
Everything I ever do  
Every place Ive ever been  
Everywhere Im going to  
Its a sin  
  
At school they taught me how to be  
So pure in thought and word and deed  
They didnt quite succeed  
For everything I long to do  
No matter when or where or who  
Has one thing in common too  
  
Its a its a its a its a sin  
Its a sin  
Everything Ive ever done  
Everything I ever do  
Every place Ive ever been  
Everywhere Im going to  
Its a sin  
  
Father forgive me I tried not to do it  
Turned over a new leaf then tore right through it  
Whatever you taught me I didnt believe it  
Father you fought me cause I didnt care  
And I still dont understand  
  
So I look back upon my life  
Forever with a sense of shame  
Ive always been the one to blame  
For everything I long to do  
No matter when or where or who  
Has one thing in common too  
  
Its a its a its a its a sin  
Its a sin  
Everything Ive ever done  
Everything I ever do  
Every place Ive ever been  
Everywhere Im going to  its a sin  
Its a its a its a its a sin  
Its a its a its a its a sin  
  
Confiteor Deo omnipotenti vobis fratres quia peccavi nimis cogitatione  
verbo opere et omissione mea culpa mea culpa mea maxima culpa  
  
translation I confess to almighty god  
and to you my brothers  
that I have sinned exceedingly  
in thought word act and omission  
through my fault through my fault  
through my most grievous fault
