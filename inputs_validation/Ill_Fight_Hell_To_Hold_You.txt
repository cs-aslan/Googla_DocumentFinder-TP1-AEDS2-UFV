In a world of doubt and danger you see it everywhere  
Your friends turn into strangers does anybody care  
But when all hope is lost Im gonna be there whatever the cost  
When you feel lost  
Someone to hold you with all of their might  
Through the darkness night Ill be there  
  
Ill fight hell to hold you no river too deep or mountain high  
Ill fight hell to hold you by my side  
Im gonna fight hell to hold you till time stands still and worlds collide  
Ill fight hell to hold you by my side  
  
Ooh the jealous and the lonely they try to keep us apart  
But let em come between us thats when the trouble starts  
Cause theres one thing I know Ill be beside you wherever you go  
You can be sure  
Someone to carry you into the light swear with all my might Ill be there  
  
Ill fight hell to hold you no river too deep or mountain high  
Ill fight hell to hold you by my side  
Im gonna fight hell to hold you till time stands still and worlds collide  
Ill fight hell to hold you by my side  ooh by my side  
  
Cause theres one thing I know Ill be beside you wherever you go  
You can be sure  
Someone to carry you into the light swear with all my might Ill be there  
  
Ill fight hell to hold you no river too deep or mountain high  
Ill fight hell to hold you by my side  
Im gonna fight hell to hold you till time stands still and worlds collide  
Ill fight hell to hold you by my side
