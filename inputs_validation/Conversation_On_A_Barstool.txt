Im tired so tired I can hardly stand  
I cant breathe in the air in this city tonight  
Its taken everything I had to give  
And now I just want to get out of here  
But I wont be sorry if you wont be  
And I dont want your pity or your sympathy  
But for fortyfive dollars I can make it  
You wait and see  
He came from Miami to start out again  
To leave him was easy I did it all the time  
He said that he loved me and he wanted a child  
If he opened his mouth he was telling you lies  
But I wont be sorry if you wont be  
And I dont want your pity or your sympathy  
But for thirtyfive dollars I can make it  
You wait and see  
I was an actress a girl in the Chorus  
On Broadway I danced for a Kennedy  
They know me in London and they know me in Paris  
Im only talkin cause you looked like you needed a friend  
But I wont be sorry if you wont be  
And I dont want your pity or your sympathy  
But for twentyfive dollars Im halfway  
To Miami
