Verse 1  
I like em brown yellow Peurto Rican or Asian  
Who have the weekend occasion  
Sneak in the Days Inn  
Im never tweaking of haze an frequently blazing  
Now if they aint on ya face it aint the cheeks that I stay in  
Cant deny it used to take weeks and persuasion  
Now I just be looking down at these freaks in amazement  
With a girl The first thing I peep a notice  
Is how full her lips is and deep her throat is  
So you aint gotta be perfect  
Ill buy you whatever you want But your heads gotta be worth it  
Still what I mean is  
Your brains gotta send chills through my penis  
Till I feel like a genius  
Look at it from a players position  
I got a scholarship I get smart without paying tuition  
My classes be like two three hours  
Thats why Im the smartest young guy since Doogie Howser  
  
Chorus  
Still what I mean is  
I really just want to get smart until I feel like a genius  
And all that I ask is  
That you help me get good grades in all of my classes  
Still what I mean is  
I really just want to get smart until I feel like a genius  
And all that I ask is  
That you help me get good grades Ma in all of my classes  
  
Verse 2  
These bitches they done got real bad  
Cause now I pull out Leaving em looking like model for a got milk ad  
Im a teachers pet  
And even if you good at math ma  
Youll have trouble counting each baguette  
All it takes would hood tutors and some good Buddha  
And promise to buy them some of them Razor foot scooters  
They dont care where the cops is  
Outta the blue they stop biz  
Teacher started giving me a pop quiz  
I stay 10 minutes in night clubs  
Pocket full of green Duke on it invented the night bulb  
I might pass on a female And call up a substitute just for night  
Class in the CL  
Ya man dont know why his chicks knees be scared  
Cant tell her from giving my dick CPR  
If ya lift up and say ya jaws hurting before squrting  
Its for certain  
You are the weakest link Goodbye  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
You know my girls in North and South Caddy  
They all for mouth waxing  
And the whores in Texas Oral sexes  
I head to Cali Take more blows to the head than Ali  
And the Philly mommys suck the kid outta Willie Bonnie  
And the way females so Southern Hospitality in ATL  
Dont even know them hoes  
In South Beach they let me jimmy dip in they mouthpiece  
Forget about Vegas The head is outrageous  
The broads in Seattle will make ya knees rattle  
Fa shizzle da snizzle get smizzle down in VA  
Them hoes in Detroit will suck the whole revolt  
My dick dont get to die down when Im in ChiTown  
My bitches in beMore Blow til they knees sore  
Good damn there face I aint screwed down in St Lou  
New York It aint got no pipe instructions  
They just suck outta you like liposuction  
  
Chorus
