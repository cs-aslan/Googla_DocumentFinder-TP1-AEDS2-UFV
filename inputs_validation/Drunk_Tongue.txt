I dont give a damn  
Ill kill anyone in my way  
  
Homicide city shit  
Homicide city shit  
Yeah yeah homicide yo  
You see the neck lit fist glisten chain drippin lane shiftin  
Riding dirty dirty got that thang know I stay grippin  
Facin life with it or without it bitch its same difference  
Lames drippin if its day or night Ima bang with it  
Situations sickenin niggas broke and they cant fix it  
Dough is all I know so if you slip it then I cant miss it  
Aint mention Sin and broke niggas in the same sentence  
Got the game twisted mayne listen say pimpin  
What you pushin Product pumpin like a piston hardly gettin by  
Or probably gettin high off what you pitchin while we sittin fly  
Tryin to keep it simplified movin like we Semper Fi  
My niggas is born to ride yall niggas get sent to die  
All you do is mention I general exemplify  
Sin City been gritty ten city enterprise  
About to make it twentyfive utilize my witty mind  
And improvise my goal to reach the alltime city high  
You dont want the semi flyin nine at your Hemi fine  
All you gotta do is send me mine you got plenty time  
Mad cause my ones up and scared cause my guns bust  
Gods mind is divine Ill shine on you dumb fucks  
Sin never dumbstruck dramn on the dump pumps  
Hit any man in the face theyre like sanitation dump trucks  
Dodge magnum chunks up big enough to slug thugs out  
The bubble butts hop off the cots to play double dutch  
Glock in a double clutch you dont want no trouble trust  
Rug cutter youre jugular promise you your bloodll gush  
Dead smack in front of us get clapped dead you front on us  
Your back ledge you rats feds cant front like you one of us  
Stack bread like Wonder from the winter til the summer come  
Upgrade to made thats when the Benzs and the Humers come  
I aint want no Humer stunt ask how I stack well like Maxwell  
Nigga tryin do a little somen somen
