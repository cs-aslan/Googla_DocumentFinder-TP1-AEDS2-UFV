Evry face that I see is all wrapped up in frowns  
And unfortunately it kind of gets me down  
Laugh  
Cause the music is funny  
Yeah the bass sounds offbeat  
Aint that neat  
Laugh  
When you lose all your money  
Or you cant find your shoes  
To cover your feet  
  
Its not so hard to see exactly what Im after  
Sometimes a tear should fall but I require giggles and chuckles  
Laugh  
When youre keepin a secret  
And it seems to be known  
By the rest of the world  
Laugh  
When you go to a party  
And you cant tell the boys  
From the girls  
  
Every face that I see is all wrapped up in frowns  
And unfortunately it kind of gets me down  
Laugh  
At the things that are wrong  
If you thinks its this song  
Then laugh  
Then laugh  
Then laugh  
  
Repeat to fade
