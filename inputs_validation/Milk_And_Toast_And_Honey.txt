Milk and toast and honey make it sunny  
On a rainy Saturday hehehey  
Milk and toast some coffee take the stuffiness  
Out of days you hate you really hate  
Slow morning news pass me by I try  
Not to analyze but didnt he blow my  
Mind this time  
Didnt he blow my mind  
  
here he comes  
To bring a little lovin honey  
To take away the hurt  
Inside is everything that matters to me  
Is everything I want in life  
  
Milk and  
Toast and honey  
  
To bring a little lovin honey  
To take away the pain inside is everything  
That matters to me  
Is everything  
I want from life  
here he comes  
Oh lay  
A little lovin baby  
To feel youre gettin  
Close to me is everything that matters to me  
Is everything I want to be  
  
Aint it funny how things sometimes look so  
Clear and feel so near  
The dreams I dream  
My favorite wishful thinkin  
Oh hes  
Bookmarked everywhere everywhere  
True  
Love might fall from the sky  
You never know  
What to find but didnt he blow my mind this time  
Didnt he blow my mind  
  
here he comes
