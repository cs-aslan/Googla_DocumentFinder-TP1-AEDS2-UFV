By Steve and Carol Ide  
Lets not sit here talk about it baby  
Its got to start in your heart or else itll pass on by  
Its what pleases you when your love seems new  
That puts the light back in your eyes  
You got what it takes and I know it make it through  
CHORUS  
Youve got to give it all that you got  
Honey thats the thing to do  
Youve got to give it your best shot  
Even when the worlds closing in on you  
Its not an easy life were livin  
But in the end if its love youre givin  
Dont be afraid dont give it up  
Give it all you got  
Theres people around who are standin right by your side  
Walkin hand in hand they could follow you up to the sky  
But if you leave em alone theyll be on their own  
And then therell be reason to try  
Whats the use payin dues when you got no reason why  
CHORUS  
What do you do when theres so much in you  
You cant feel the road that youre on  
Say what needs to be said get it all out your head  
And youre back on the road before long  
CHORUS
