Im losing things  
Thats what oldfashioned love brings  
Lost the key to the house  
The feeling in my mouth  
Im losing things  
  
Im forgetting things  
Thats what oldfashioned love brings  
Forgot the number of the street  
The shoes on your feet  
Im forgetting things  
  
Cause Ive a limited capacity in my brain  
When my brain is filled with you  
  
Like theyve impaired the ability  
I had to know just what was true  
And its a real Greek Tragedy I know  
But so much of me dont care  
Ive forgotten every name in my life  
But I still remember her  
  
Well Ive lost belief  
But Ive found if you turn that stone  
theres love underneath  
And when I had belief  
I spent all my time  
Cleaning the grime from my holy teeth  
  
Im losing things  
Im losing things  
And its a real Greek Tragedy I know  
But so much of me dont care  
Ive forgotten every name in my life  
But I still remember her  
  
Yes Im losing things  
Yes yes yes Im losing things  
And its a real Greek Tragedy I know  
But so much of me dont care  
Ive forgotten every name in my life  
But I still remember her  
Thats why Im losing things  
Im losing things
