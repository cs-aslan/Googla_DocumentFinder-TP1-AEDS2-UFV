Time changer of seasons time will see another flower growing  
Climb over the mountains there youll find warm winds blowing  
Somewhere in the world there is peace of mind  
Somewhere in the world thats what I must find  
Somewhere in the world theres a place for me in this world  
I cannot believe it everywhere I see lonely faces  
Why have we no answers just some more empty places  
Somewhere in the world there is peace of mind  
Somewhere in the world thats what I must find  
Somewhere in the world theres a place for me in this world  
Time changer of seasons time will see another flower growing  
Climb over the mountains there youll find warm winds blowing  
Somewhere in the world there is peace of mind  
Somewhere in the world thats what I must find  
Somewhere in the world theres a place for me in this world  
Somewhere in the world there is peace of mind  
Somewhere in the world thats what I must find
