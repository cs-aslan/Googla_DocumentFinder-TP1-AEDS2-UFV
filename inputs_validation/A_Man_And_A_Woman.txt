Little sister dont you worry about a thing today  
Take the heat from the sun  
Little sister  
I know that everything is not ok  
But youre like honey on my tongue  
  
True love never can be rent  
But only true love can keep beauty innocent  
  
I could never take a chance  
Of losing love to find romance  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
No I could never take a chance  
Cause I could never understand  
The mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
You can run from love  
And if its really love it will find you  
Catch you by the heel  
But you cant be numb for love  
The only pain is to feel nothing at all  
How can I hurt when Im holding you  
  
I could never take a chance  
Of losing love to find romance  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
And youre the one theres noone else  
You make me want to lose myself  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
Brown eyed girl across the street  
On rue Saint Divine  
I thought this is the one for me  
But she was already mine  
You were already mine  
  
Little sister  
Ive been sleeping in the street again  
Like a stray dog  
Little sister  
Ive been trying to feel complete again  
But youre gone and so is God  
  
The soul needs beauty for a soul mate  
When the soul wantsthe soul waits   
  
No I could never take a chance  
Of losing love to find romance  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
For love and sex and faith and fear  
And all the things that keep us here  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
How can I hurt when Im holding you
