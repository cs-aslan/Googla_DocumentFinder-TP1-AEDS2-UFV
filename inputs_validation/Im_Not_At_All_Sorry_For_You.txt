Dont come to me with tears in your  
Eyes just because he couldnt be true  
And expecting me to sympathize  
Im not at all sorry for you  
You know I realize all that you been through  
Because you treated me just  
The way hes treating you  
Its too late now to stop worryin  
You Im not at all sorry for you  
  
Do you remember the tears that  
I cried on the light you said he were true  
Like the tears that you now try  
To hide Im not at all sorry for you  
You know I realize
