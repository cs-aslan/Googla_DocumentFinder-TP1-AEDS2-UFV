Standing in the rain with his head hung low  
Couldnt get a ticket it was a sold out show  
Heard the roar of the crowd he could picture the scene  
Put his ear to the wall then like a distant scream  
He heard one guitar just blew him away  
He saw stars in his eyes and the very next day  
  
Bought a beat up six string in a secondhand store  
Didnt know how to play it but he knew for sure  
That one guitar felt good in his hands didnt take long to understand  
Just one guitar slung way down low  
Was a one way ticket only one way to go  
So he started rockin aint never gonna stop  
Gotta keep on rockin someday gonna make it to the top  
  
And be a juke box hero got stars in his eyes hes a juke box hero  
He took one guitar juke box hero stars in his eyes  
Juke box hero stars in his eyes hell come alive tonight  
  
In a town without a name in a heavy downpour  
Thought he passed his own shadow by the backstage door  
Like a trip through the past to that day in the rain  
And that one guitar made his whole life change  
Now he needs to keep on rockin he just cant stop  
Gotta keep on rockin that boy has got to stay on top  
  
And be a juke box hero got stars in his eyes  
Hes a juke box hero got stars in his eyes  
Yeah juke box hero stars in his eyes  
With that one guitar stars in his eyes  
Hell come alive come alive tonight woah  
  
Yeah hes gotta keep on rockin just cant stop  
Gotta keep on rockin that boy has got to stay on top  
  
And be a juke box hero got stars in his eyes  
Hes a juke box hero got stars in his eyes  
Just one guitar juke box hero aah aah aah got stars in his eyes  
Hes just a juke box hero aah aah aah  
Juke box stars hero stars stars juke box hero stars stars  
Hes got stars in his eyes stars in his eyes
