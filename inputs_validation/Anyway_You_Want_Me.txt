Ill be as strong as a mountain  
Or weak as a willow tree  
Anyway you want me  
Well thats how I will be  
  
Ill be as tame as a baby  
Or wild as the raging sea  
Anyway you want me  
Well thats how I will be  
  
In your hands my heart is clay  
To take and hold as you may  
Im what you make me youve only to take me  
And in your arms I will stay  
  
Ill be a fool or a wise man  
My darling you hold the key  
Yes anyway you want me  
Well thats how I will be  
I will be
