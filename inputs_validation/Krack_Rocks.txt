Who are you who are you  
Well Im the punk with the pump in the back of my pack  
How you step rock  
I step in stride  
  
I step across stage with my nuts in my hand  
The punks want to front cause I got my own band  
Goddamn Im the man with the helly buzz  
And my shit dont stink like elis does  
  
Im a pleasure girls man from what I heard  
Nah man I kicked that bitch to the curb  
I dont really need to be tied down  
Im a ramblin man and Im platinum bound  
  
Me too rolled my crew Im not too new  
16 is what I blew  
I bet that set you straight that illegal action  
Fuck that I still roll with a 40 in my lap  
  
Back in 2nd grade I carried a lunch box  
Turned 21 started smokin crack pots  
Snortin that D by the dime  
Wish I could slow down Im ahead of my time  
  
Im the Krack Im the Krack  
Krack Krack Krack  
Im the Krack bitch my last dimes what Im bettin  
Im up in the casino with a flash like stetson  
  
Girls all stare they gauck they sneer  
So I grab me a bitch and I slapped her in the rear  
My livingroom is the place Im hangin out  
Uptight pussys is the shit Im bangin out  
  
Im sick of livin in these perplex times  
Thats why I kick these motherfuckin sex rhymes  
  
Im headin down south  
Im headin down south  
Im headin down headin down  
  
Hip hip hip hip diggin exactly where you go  
Im headin down south on a dusty path  
I got a cool ass buzz and an empty flask  
Ass on the wagon and they think Im all soft  
  
But I dont givea fuck Im trippin my balls off  
Up in the crack house tunin them rocks off  
Hoes come around an we be knockin the box top  
Knocked out knocked up and all that shit  
  
Hot wax sweaty spot lickin spit from your clit  
Everything that gets old  
It gets over rated  
Old to me just means out dated  
  
Im the Kid Rock fuck all that 60s shit  
Take Woodstock and shove it up your mommas clit  
Oh shit and there it is  
I get a lot of pussy cause Im in show biz  
  
Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house  
I wished for a kiss and your mom popped out  
Put her hands on her flop and started eyein me  
So I smacked the ole bitch with my flyin D  
  
Thats when I said man I gotta get a grip  
Looked at the TV realized I was trippin  
  
It aint no party like a Detroit party  
Cause a Detroit party dont stop  
I said It aint no party like a Detroit party  
Cause a Detroit party dont stop  
  
It aint no party like a Detroit party  
Cause a Detroit party dont stop  
I said It aint no party like a Detroit party  
Cause a Detroit party dont stop
