Hey pretty baby are you ready for me  
Its your good rockin daddy down from Tennessee  
Well Im just outta Austin bound for San Antone  
With the radio blastin and the bird dog on  
Theres a speed trap up ahead South of town  
But no local yokels gonna shut me down  
Cause me and the boys got this rig unwound  
And weve come a thousand miles from the guitar town  
  
Nothin ever happened round my home town  
And I aint the kind to just hang around  
But I heard someone callin my name one day  
And I followed that voice down the lost highway  
Everybody told me you cant get far  
Now Im smokin into Texas with the hammer down  
And a rockin little combo from the guitar town  
  
Hey pretty baby dont you know it aint my fault  
Love to hear the steel belts hummin on the asphalt  
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop  
Stumble in the restaurant wonderin why I dont stop  
Well I gotta keep rockin while I still can  
Got a twopack habit and a motel tan  
When my boots hit the boards its a brand new hand  
Put my back to the risers and make my stand  
Hey pretty baby wont you hold me tight  
Im loadin up and rollin out of here tonight  
One of these days Im gonna settle down  
And Ill take you back with me to the guitar town
