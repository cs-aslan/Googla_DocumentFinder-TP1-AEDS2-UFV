Sunny boy  
Now let me tell you how much good  
Youve done me boy  
Cause when Im feelin low  
You give me plenty joy  
Into each lives some rain must fall  
But with you here theres no rain at all  
  
Sunny boy  
He looks good in everything from silk to corduroy  
Or Incomprehensible  
To see him Id walk from Idaho to Illinois  
Or anywhere  
Do anything to be with him  
My sunshine when the world is dim  
  
Its sunny boy sunny boy  
My pride and joy sunny boy  
  
Sunny boy  
You made my life so sweet  
Its just like honey boy  
And I love you so much till it aint funny boy  
My cloudy days have been declouded  
Since youre here so keep on shinin  
  
Sunny boy sunny boy  
My pride and joy hey sunny boy  
My honey boy  
Now only your sweet lovin can give me joy  
Im tryin to tell the world  
That youre my sunny boy
