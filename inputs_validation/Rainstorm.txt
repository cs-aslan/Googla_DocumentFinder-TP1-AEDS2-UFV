Im amazed at the way you do  
You do the things that they want you to  
Cant you see theres a turning tide  
Its going to turn into a landslide  
The ground will fall from your feet  
You got to do before you feel the heat  
Its heads I win tails you lose   
Theres no escaping any way you chose  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Somethings blowing up in the air  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Theres a rainstorm coming beware  
Oh its a tragedy it had to come to this  
Theres no way out so dont you try to resist  
The thunder cloud hanging overhead  
Its going to break and cause a landslide
