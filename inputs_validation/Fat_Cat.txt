Another song of woe  
Woe sounds like this  
You say nothings changed where were you when my world  
Was spinning into masquerade  
You claim its just a question of mathematics  
I shut the door on your amateur dramatics  
Then you think too much  
And you talk too much vicariously  
Yeah you think too much  
And you talk too much  
Every word is substance free  
Youre the dirt on my collar  
Youre the hole in my favourite shoe  
Youre the last dying breath of love  
Youre the weight that I need to lose  
And you hurt yourself  
You say Im deranged Ill admit to being strange  
But I just cant stop loving you  
If the light in your eyes  
Addiction came as a surprise  
Didnt think Id be so into you  
Then you think too much  
And you talk too much so carelessly  
Yeah you think too much  
And you talk too much  
Every word is substance free  
Youre the dirt on my collar  
Youre the hole in my favourite shoe  
Youre the last dying breath of love  
Youre the weight that I need to lose  
Youre the dirt on my collar  
Youre the hole in my favourite shoe  
Youre the last last dying breath of love  
Youre the weight that I need to lose  
Youre the dirt on my collar  
Youre the hole in my favourite shoe  
Youre the last dying breath of love  
Youre the weight that I need to lose
