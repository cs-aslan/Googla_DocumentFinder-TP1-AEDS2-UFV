Im singing Broadway and I love it  
Im singing Broadway and Im proud  
You can keep your Springsteen  
Shove your Chaka  
I really dont care for that kind of kaka  
Ethel Liza Chita thats my crowd my crowd  
  
Yessah Im singing Broadway and its heaven  
Cause Heaven is a song from a Broadway show  
Ah just give me a part thats got laughter and tears  
And Ill beat it like Yul Brenner for the next thousand years  
Ah Broadway Broadway Broadway Brrrrrravo  
  
Ahhh who needs a girl whos got flourescent hair  
Or an ugly boy singing off key  
Give me a broad whos got tits out to there  
Belching it out to the balcony  
  
AhhhAHHHHHHHH  
Yes sir Im singing Broadway and its heaven  
Ill be singing Broadway yes til I die  
Just tell me what could be better  
Than shaking your buns  
In front of a chorus  
Of thirtyfive nuns  
Ill climb every mountain  
And ford every river I see  
A Lady and her muszack  
Hathats hame Yeah
