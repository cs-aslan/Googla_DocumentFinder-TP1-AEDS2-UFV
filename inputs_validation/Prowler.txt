Walking through the city looking oh so pretty  
Ive just got to find my way  
See the ladies flashing All there legs and lashes  
Ive just got to find my way  
  
Well you see me crawling through the bushes with it open wide  
What you seeing girl  
Cant you believe that feeling cant you believe it  
Cant you believe your eyes  
Its the real thing girl  
  
Got me feeling myself and reeling around  
Got me talking but feel like walking around  
Got me feeling myself and reeling a  
Got me talking but nothings with me  
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
