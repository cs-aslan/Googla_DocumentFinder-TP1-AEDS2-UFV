Youll never be  
A better kind  
If you dont leave  
The world behind  
  
Waste my days  
Waste my days  
Drown aways  
Drown aways  
  
Chorus  
Its just the thought of you  
In love with someone else  
It breaks my heart to see  
You hangin from your shelf  
  
Youll never do  
The things you want  
If you dont move  
And get a job  
  
Waste my days  
Waste my days  
Drown aways  
Drown aways  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh girl when Im in love with you  
Keep fishin if you feel its true  
Theres nothing much that we can do  
To save you from yourself  
  
Waste my days  
Waste my days  
Drown aways  
Drown aways  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh girl when Im in love with you  
Keep fishin if you feel its true  
Theres nothing much that we can do  
To save you from yourself  
  
Youll never be  
A better kind  
Youll never be  
A better kind  
  
Whoa ohh  
Whoa ohh x 7  
  
Waste my days  
Waste my days x 7
