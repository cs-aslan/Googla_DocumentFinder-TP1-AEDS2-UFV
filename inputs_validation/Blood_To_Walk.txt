Sitting in the cellar watching all the others  
  
It was only yesterday needles in my skin  
They turned my last remains into this puppet thing  
  
Blood to walk blood to see  
Blood to walk again and blood to be  
  
I can see but I cannot move at all  
Yet I have feelings I know its very strange  
  
Blood to walk blood to see  
Blood to walk again and blood to be  
  
Im on my shelfeternal eyes they never sleep  
I take a lookand in the dark I see victoria  
  
Solo andy  
  
There is no mistake that is my beloved  
Sitting on her shelf alone and so dead  
  
Solo mike  
  
Theres a light outside the door  
Mommy and daddy are back for more lets play  
  
Hello my childrenin blood I will teach you  
  
They take Victoria down from her shelf  
They sit her on the floor and me in front of her  
  
Blood to walk blood to see  
Blood to walk again and blood to be  
  
There are strings attached to our heads  
There are strings in arms and legs  
The puppet masters hands  
Oh they keep us straight  
  
Pressing the needle in I feel the sting its emerencia  
Injecting blood into the both of usits hot  
  
I think I see her move  
Theres a tingle in our skin  
I cant believethat she can she again  
  
There is no mistake that is my beloved  
I have missed you so oh no  
Its like a horror show without a word we know  
As we communicate with our eyes deep inside  
We wonder why  
  
Why our minds are now in our eyes  
We can move without any strings  
  
Theyre alivethats enough for today put them away
