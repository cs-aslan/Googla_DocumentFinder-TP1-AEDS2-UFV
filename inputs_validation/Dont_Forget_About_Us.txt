Dont forget about us  
Dont baby dont baby dont let it go  
No baby no baby no baby no  
Dont baby dont baby dont let it go  
My baby boy  
  
Just let it die  
With no goodbyes  
Details dont matter  
We both paid the price  
Tears in my eyes  
You know sometimes  
Itd be like that baby  
  
Now every time I see you  
I pretend Im fine  
When I wanna reach out to you  
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride  
Baby I must confess  
We were bigger than anything  
Remember us at our best  
And dont forget about  
  
Chorus  
Late nights playin in the dark  
And wakin up inside my arms  
Boy youll always be in my heart and  
I can see it in your eyes  
You still want it  
So dont forget about us  
Im just speaking from experience  
Nothing can compare to your first true love  
So I hope this will remind you  
When its for real its forever  
So dont forget about us  
  
Oh they say  
That youre in a new relationship  
But we both know  
Nothing comes close to  
What we had it perseveres  
That we both cant forget it  
How good we used to get it  
  
Theres only one me and you  
And how we used to shine  
No matter what you go through  
We are one thats a fact  
That you cant deny  
So baby we just cant let  
The fire pass us by  
Forever wed both regret  
So dont forget about  
  
Chorus  
  
And if shes got your head all messed up now  
Thats the trickery  
Shell wanna have like you know how this lovin used to be  
I bet she cant do like me  
Shell never be MC  
  
Baby dont you dont you forget about us  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Dont baby dont baby dont let it go  
No baby no baby no baby no  
Dont baby dont baby dont let it go  
  
When its for real its forever  
So dont forget about us
