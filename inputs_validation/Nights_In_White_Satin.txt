Nights in white satin  
Never reaching the end  
Letters Ive written  
Never meaning to send  
Beauty Ive always missed  
With these eyes before  
Just what the truth is  
I cant say any more  
Cause I love you  
Yes I love you  
Oh how I love you  
  
Gazing at people some hand in hand  
Just what Im going through they cant understand  
Some try to tell me thoughts they cannot defend  
Just what you want to be you will be in the end  
  
And I love you  
Yes I love you  
Oh how I love you  
Oh how I love you  
  
Nights in white satin  
Never reaching the end  
Letters Ive written  
Never meaning to send  
Beauty Ive always missed  
With these eyes before  
Just what the truth is  
I cant say any more  
  
Cause I love you  
Yes I love you  
Oh how I love you  
Oh how I love you  
Cause I love you  
Yes I love you  
Oh how I love you  
Oh how I love you
