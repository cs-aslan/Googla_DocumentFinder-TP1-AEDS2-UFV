Well Ive been walkin  
Down a one way dirty street  
Tryin to find the answers  
And Ive been hopin  
For a chance to meet  
The rat that spread the cancer  
  
And the lies theyve been spinnin  
And the smiles theyve been grinnin  
There has sure been some sinnin  
But nobodys winnin  
When the walls start to crumblin  
You feel like youre stumblin  
And nobody wants you when youre down  
  
They took the boy from the city  
But they cant take the city from  
the boys lookin pretty  
Now hes lookin like a pity  
Cut the flesh down to the bone  
But you cant get  
You cant get blood from a stone  
You cant get blood from a stone  
  
Well Im a rollin  
But my trains gone off the tracks  
and my wheels are spinnin  
And Im a walkin  
Down a one way dirty street  
But my hearts not sinkin  
  
From the love theyve been buyin  
And the blues theyve been cryin  
Now the time keeps a flyin  
But nobodys tryin  
Cause the love of the money  
Didnt turn out so sunny  
When the wells dry  
No one comes around  
  
They took the boy from the city  
But they cant take the city from the  
Boys lookin pretty  
Now hes lookin like a pity  
Cut the flesh down to the bone  
But you cant get  
You cant get from a stone  
  
You can try  
But I still got the fight in my eyes  
Suck it dry  
Cause Ive had about enough of your lies  
  
They took the boy from the city  
But they cant take the city form the  
Boys lookin pretty  
Now hes lookin like a pity  
Cut the flesh down to the bone  
But you cant get blood from a stone  
  
They took the boy form the city  
But they cant take the city from the  
Boys lookin pretty  
Now hes looking like a pity  
Cut the flesh down to the bone  
But you cant get  
You cant get blood from a stone
