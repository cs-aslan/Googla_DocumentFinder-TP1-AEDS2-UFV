Five long days and Im tired of working  
Im going to see my boss today  
In fifteen minutes Ill be on the train  
Cause I just got my pay  
Now I could take and sock away my dough  
And make me six percent a year  
But its not much fun to wait around for that  
When I can spend it while its here  
Ah  
Lets get dressed up  
And see a movie  
I like spending my money  
And I like having a good time  
Good times sure make me happy  
And Im so happy  
Cause I just got my pay  
Monday morning Im up and at it  
Those last two days were good for my soul  
Its time to do my working thing  
Im late so I got to roll  
My take home comes to bout ninetyfive  
And my boss is giving me some praise  
If it werent for me the place would fall apart  
I think Ill hit him up for a raise  
Hit Im up get a rais  
Ah  
Lets get undressed  
And climb in bed too  
I like spending my money  
And I like having a good time  
Good times sure make me happy  
And Im so happy  
Cause I just got my pay
