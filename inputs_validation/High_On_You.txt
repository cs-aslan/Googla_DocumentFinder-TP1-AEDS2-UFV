I like your wooden door baby  
I never want to leave baby  
If I could rule the night baby  
Id turn it into white  
There wouldnt   
  
Chorus  
Im getting high on you  
Im getting high on you  
Im getting high on you  
High on you  
  
I like your rugged cross baby  
I dont pray in churches baby  
I got nowhere to worship baby  
Because it isnt him  
I dont need a  man  
  
Chorus  
  
Terrorist in my heart  
Tearin it all apart  
Terrorist in my heart  
Tearin it all apart  
  
I love the way you feel baby  
The mornin startin drunk baby  
Drinking of your soul baby  
And everything I know  
Digs the way your body glows  
  
Chorus  
  
Im getting high on you  
Im getting high on you  
Im getting high on you  
Im getting high  
  
Corrupting in the air  
I really need you  
You got two play rides  
I really love them  
My were getting high  
Are we getting high
