Me and my buddies were going to get drunk  
Were going to go out on the town  
Well be checking it out slipping it in  
And stepping out of line  
You know everybody likes to get a little crazy  
In their own particular way  
But my buddies and I we go over the top  
And were going over again today  
  
Well be having a good time  
Passing the byline  
Having a good time  
You know its a rock and roll pastime  
  
It might be typical topical or maybe tropical  
That doesnt mean anything  
If youre political practical  
Then its improbable that you do anything  
But me and my buddies we like to go crazy  
We like to go over the hill  
Hey woman will you be there Because my buddies and I will  
  
Having a good time  
Passing the byline  
Well be having a good time  
Its a rock and roll pastime  
  
Hey snowy play a bit for me  
That was snowy white  
And he likes err it in the night  
The next to play  
I must say is Scott Gorham  
And away  
  
Well be having a good time  
Passing the byline  
Having a good time  
Its a rock and roll pastime  
  
Lets play that one more time  
Hit me with that drum Brian  
Hit me as hard as you can  
Oh yes thats they way I like it  
Do it again do it again lets do it again  
  
Having a good time  
Oh yes I like this  
Having a good time  
Typical topical who cares  
Having a good time  
Political practical impossible  
Having a good time  
  
Dont ask me why Jack  
Having a good time  
Ho ho ho ho ho  
Having a good time  
Having a wild time  
Having a good time  
Im slipping on the inside  
Having a good time  
Thats fine having a good time  
Having a good time  
Drinking Beaujolais  
No that doesnt rhyme  
Having a good time  
Im talking from the top of my head  
Having a good time  
To the bottom of your soul
