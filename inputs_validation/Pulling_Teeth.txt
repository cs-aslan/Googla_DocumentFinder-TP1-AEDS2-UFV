Im all busted up  
Broken bones and nasty cuts  
Accidents will happen  
But this time I cant get up  
She comes to check on me  
Making sure Im on my knees  
After all shes the one  
Who put me in this state  
  
Is she ultra violent  
Is she disturbed  
I better tell her that I love her  
Before she does it all over again  
Oh God shes killing me  
  
For now I lie around  
Hell thats all I can really do  
She takes good care of me  
Just keep saying my love is true  
  
Is she ultra violent  
Is she disturbed  
I better tell her that I love her  
Before she does it all over again  
Oh God shes killing me  
  
Looking out my window for someone thats passing by  
No one knows Im locked in here  
All I do is cry  
  
For now I lie around  
Hell thats all I can really do  
She takes good care of me  
Just keep saying my love is true
