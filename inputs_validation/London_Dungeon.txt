They called us walking corpses  
Unholy living dead  
They had to lock us up  
Put us in their British hell  
  
Make sure your face is clean now  
Cant have no dirty dead  
All the corpses here are clean boy  
All the Yanks in British hell  
  
I dont want to be here in your London Dungeon  
I dont want to be here in your British hell  
Aint no mystery why Im in misery in Hell  
Heres hoping youre swell
