Now listen up you know ya come home from working that nine to five and  
Lay yourself down on burgundy couch you know it never really was  
Burgundy It was red and you painted with the goddamn sprinkler and  
Now you have bits and pieces of burgundy stuck to your but every time  
You get off of it You never tell your family you never tell your  
Family because you know ol Junior hes got no brains and what can  
You do What can you do And old Junior you know got a little crazy  
With that PBJ that one day   
  
Chorus  
Grab yourself a can of pork soda  
Youll be feeling just fine  
Aint nothin quite like sittin round the house  
Swillin down them Cans of swine  
  
Ha ha ha Yes Dads an idiot alright  
  
Well alright Im really starting to worry about you You had to have  
That twocar garage with the large driveway so you could park that  
Goddamn boat in it If it wasnt for the boat blah blah blah  
  
Chorus  
  
I like Kansas wine  
  
Well maybe its something simpler like your team lost or your  
Girlfriend used to be a guy you know I dont know I mean blah blah blah
