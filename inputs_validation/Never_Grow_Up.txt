Your little hands wrapped around my finger  
And its so quiet in the world tonight  
Your little eyelids flutter cause youre dreaming  
So I tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlight  
  
To you everythings funny  
You got nothing to regret  
Id give all I have honey  
If you could stay like that  
  
Oh darling dont you ever grow up dont you ever grow up  
Just stay this little  
Oh darling dont you ever grow up dont you ever grow up  
It could stay this simple  
I wont let nobody hurt you  
Wont let no one break your heart  
No one will desert you  
Just try to never grow up  
Never grow up  
  
Youre in the car on the way to the movies  
And youre mortified your moms dropping you off  
At fourteen theres just so much you cant do  
And you cant wait to move out  
Someday and call your own shots  
  
But dont make her drop you off around the block  
Remember that shes getting older too  
And dont lose the way that you dance around in your pjs getting ready for
school  
  
Oh darling dont you ever grow up dont you ever grow up  
Just stay this little  
Oh darling dont you ever grow up dont you ever grow up  
It could stay this simple  
And no ones ever burned you  
Nothings ever left you scarred  
And even though you want to  
Just try to never grow up  
  
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room  
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home  
Remember the footsteps remember the words said  
And all your little brothers favorite songs  
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone  
  
So here I am in my new apartment  
In a big city they just dropped me off  
Its so much colder than I thought it would be  
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on  
  
Wish Id never grown up  
I wish Id never grown up  
Oh I dont wanna grow up  
Wish Id never grown up  
Could still be little  
Oh I dont wanna grow up  
Wish Id never grown up  
It could still be simple  
  
Oh darling dont you ever grow up dont you ever grow up  
Just stay this little  
Oh darling dont you ever grow up dont you ever grow up  
It could stay this simple  
I wont let nobody hurt you  
Wont let no one break your heart  
And even though you want to  
Please try to never grow up  
Dont you ever grow up  
Just never grow up
