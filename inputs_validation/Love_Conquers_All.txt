Confusing though it may be  
Its the one thing that we all need most

Together eventually  
Theres only one road for us all  
  
Releasing our fear of the unknown  
Believing in what could be  
Now its time for each of us to answer the call  
  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all

Sometimes its running out on you  
No matter how hard you try  
You cant avoid the fall  
Only love conquers all

Now its time for each of us  
To answer the call
