Im living in my smokeless zone  
My house is not a happy home  
I got to do something for I kick the bucket  
Im living in this smokeless zone  
  
I clean my dusty window sills  
Everything I grow it kills  
I dont want to stay in this street any longer  
Living in this smokeless zone  
  
Englands green once so pleasant land  
Living on a time bomb yeah  
The whole damn place is going to turn to sand  
Bah bah  
  
I cough upon my wheezy chest  
My penicillin does its best  
Theres only one cure for an unhealthy body  
Get out of this smokeless zone
