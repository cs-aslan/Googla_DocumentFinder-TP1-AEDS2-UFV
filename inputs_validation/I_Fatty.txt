Only 12 years old and already so alone  
Left abandoned on a train  
Youve got a lot to earn but youll never learn  
Powders cant get rid of all your pain  
  
Chased by Keystone cops through LAs endless backdrops  
You became loved by the world  
But the biggest star is gonna leave the biggest scar  
On that pregnant tarnished girl  
  
Fatty Fatty  
The world can turn pineapple upside down cake  
Fatty Fatty  
After so many pratfalls this is your prattest  
Fatty Fatty  
Your friends will turn on you in a split second  
Fatty Fatty  
Theres no place for the fattest man hide out
