A cry in the night Im still hearing  
No my love is gone I must be dreaming  
Lost in the mist of passions strange  
Wiping the tears I recall the pain  
Of love and laughter joy now slain  
When your world turns cold wont you call my name  
  
Come on  
Cry out in the dark  
Ill be by your side to give you warmth  
And light and shield you from the night  
Hold on hold on well fan the flames of love  
Together again just you and I  
  
I watched the faces in the fire  
No emotion was ever there  
If this is truth then whos the liar  
Your eyes are blind they dont love you  
Youre just an amusement thought of with disdain  
But Im still waiting wont you call my name  
  
You say your heart is open to loves  
Call and you cant refuse its refrain  
But you dont hear the real sirens song  
Echoing its refrain my love still remains so
