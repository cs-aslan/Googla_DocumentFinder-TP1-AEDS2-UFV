Youre up state up late and city fed  
Im a california label  
From the top of my head  
Forever ah  
See a lot of open sky  
When the sun goes down  
Theres a hot lot of loving when you come  
Around to free me ah  
  
In a boat to sail boat to sail away ah  
All those letters mailed from a  
Boat to sail away ah  
We are riding in a boat to sail  
  
Bare foot coconut and supermild  
Jamaica take a look  
At your own child  
Forget not  
Brian wilson songs are never left behind  
Dont you worry baby youre a friend of mine  
For so long  
  
From a boat to sail boat to sail away ah  
All those letters mailed from a  
Boat to sail away ah  
We are riding in a boat to sail  
We are riding in a boat to sail
