Please dont feel too bad because Im leaving  
Im coming home again to you  
And when I go away I know youre grieving  
Although you know that Ill be true  
  
Im wondering what to do to make you know youre mine  
Ill take you in my arms and then all will be fine  
And when Im away from you you know Ill miss you  
I want to feel your tender touch  
  
And when Im feeling blue I want to kiss you  
I stay away from you too much  
Im wondering what to do to make you know youre mine  
Ill take you in my arms and then all will be fine  
  
And when Im away from you you know Ill miss you  
I want to feel your tender touch  
And when Im feeling blue I want to kiss you  
I stay away from you too much  
  
Whoa whoa yeah too much  
Yeah yeah yeah too much  
Whoa whoa whoa too much
