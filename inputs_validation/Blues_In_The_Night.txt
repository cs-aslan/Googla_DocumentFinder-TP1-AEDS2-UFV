My mama done tol me when I was in pigtails  
My mama done tol me  Hon a mans gonna sweet talk  
And give ya the big eye but when the sweet talkins done  
A man is a twoface A worrisome thing wholl leave ya to sing the blues in
the night  
  
Now the rains afallin hear the trains acallin Whooee  
My mama done tol me Hear dat lonesome whistle blowin cross the trestle  
Whooee  
My mama done tol me Awhooeeahwhooee ol clicketyclacks aechoin back  
The blues in the night  
  
The evenin breezell start the trees to cryin  
And the moonll hide its light  
When you get the blues in the night  
  
Take my word the mockingbirdll sing the saddest kind of song  
He knows things are wrong and hes right  
  
From Natchez to Mobile from Memphis to St Joe wherever the four winds blow  
I been in some big towns an heard me some big talk but there is one thing I
know  
A man is a twoface a worrisome thing wholl leave ya to sing the blues in
the night  
  
My mama was right theres blues in the night
