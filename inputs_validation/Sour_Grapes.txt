I dont care if the sun dont shine  
But it better or people will wonder  
And I couldnt care less if it never stopped rainin  
Cept the kids are afraid of the thunder  
Chorus  
Say sour grapes  
You can laugh and stare  
Say sour grapes  
But I dont care  
I couldnt care less if I didnt have a friend  
Cept people would say I was crazy  
And I wouldnt work cause I dont need money  
But the same folks would say I was lazy  
Chorus  
I couldnt care less if she never come back  
I was gonna leave her anyway  
And all the good times that we shared  
Dont mean a thing to day  
Chorus
