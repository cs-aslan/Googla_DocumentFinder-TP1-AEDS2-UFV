Cryin on the corner waitin in the rain  
I swear Ill never ever wait again  
You gave me your word but words for you are lies  
  
Darlin in my wildest dreams I never thought Id go  
But its time to let you know oh  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna harden my heart  
Im gonna swallow my tears  
Im gonna turn and leave you here  
  
All of my life Ive been waitin in the rain  
Ive been waiting for a feeling that never ever came  
It feels so close but always disappears  
  
Darlin in your wildest dreams you never had a clue  
But its time you got the news  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gonna harden my heart  
Im gonna swallow my tears  
Im gonna harden my heart  
Im gonna swallow my tears  
Harden my heart harden my heart  
swallow my tears  
Im gonna harden my heart
