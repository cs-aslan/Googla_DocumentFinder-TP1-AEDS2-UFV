Oooooooo Yeahhhhhh  
And while your out gang bangin  
Tring to catch a murder case  
Your hoes on my couch gettin fucked in the face  
  
Bumpin to the base of some old school rap jam  
This aint tennis but yo Ill use my backhand  
On any grown man that tries to check rock  
I want to head bang I gotta hip hop  
  
Cause Im gonna stick with what got me paid  
Lickin that coochie with the high top fade  
Im self made like Henry Ford  
Im on this mic but it feels like I been here before  
  
I want more than the next man  
Respect plus to cash big checks  
And mack on hoes like Ruddy Ray  
Cause the reach around just sounds so gay  
  
I dont even swing that way  
I told you hoes before Im the K  
I to the D are O see Kn rhymes sayin guitar playin  
Turntable spinnin at a basement jam  
  
No fame no money but you wouldnt understand  
What its like to be so real  
You got the beats and the rhymes but you aint got no feel  
I dont need the fancy music to make mine  
  
Just the beat and the funky ass base line  
Drop a couple cuts on the track  
A tracks to the mother fuckin wack  
So while your making record that dont recoup  
Im in the house gettin paid like Snoop  
  
Kid Rock an I got all the hoes sayin  
Fuck me baby Kid Rock come fuck me baby  
Fuck me baby fuck me baby all night long  
Fuck me baby Kid Rock come fuck me baby  
Fuck me baby fuck me till the break of dawn  
  
I want my khakis washed starched and creased  
I want an order of fries with a side of grease  
I wish for peace throughout this land  
I want the whole fuckin world in my hands  
  
I want a band like the US Funk Mob  
See I can rap I dont hafta lay sod just to make ends meet  
October 31st yellin TrickorTreat  
Boy arent you a little old to be trickin  
  
You see my mask and bag bitch I aint bullshittin  
Hittin homeruns like Rusty Staub  
Im kinda anal cause I aint no fuckin slob  
Im the cradle thats able to rock any format  
  
But still Im labeled and treated like a doormat  
Wheres the whores at  
Westside hoes like cars so I ride em for a test drive  
Im like a pringle I wont go soft  
  
I got a new jingle Im about to go off  
Hey ho check it out I really like to turn you out  
And if you be good to me  
Ill yoodle in your valley  
  
Kid Rock aint nothing nice  
Got the salt and pork boomin with the beans and rice  
Got a head full of lice cause Im such a scum  
Got a pocket full of money but Im dressed like a bum  
  
Got a business mind so if I loose the funk  
Ill still be in the house gettin paid like trump  
Kid Rock and I got all the hoes sayin  
Fuck me baby Kid Rock come fuck me baby  
  
Fuck me baby fuck me baby all night long  
Fuck me baby Kid Rock come fuck me baby  
Fuck me baby fuck me til the break of dawn  
Come on come on come on

Fuck me baby come on come on somebody  
Fuck me baby oh yeah  
Love me baby oh yeah  
  
Come on yeah all night long
