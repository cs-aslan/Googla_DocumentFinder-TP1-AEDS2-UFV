Without a doubt girl youre ahead of your time  
Lets go out on the town  
Give it a piece of your mind  
Youve been going round and round in your head  
So dont think twice  
Youll end up worse than youve been  
  
Cause I know that youve been thinkin bout it  
And I know they think youre out of your mind  
All of this time  
I know that youve been waiting for this  
  
So come on shout it out so everybody can hear  
Theres no need to rhyme it the message is clear  
You know I cant ignore  
So I dont know what youre waiting for  
But youre trying hard not to show it  
  
Cause I know that youve been thinkin bout it  
Well I know they think youre out of your mind  
All of this time  
I know that youve been waiting for this  
Come on come on  
I know that youve been waiting for this  
  
Cant figure out how we made it this far  
If you dont mind me sayin  
Theres no sense in waiting so  
Shout it out shout it out  
Shout it out shout it out  
You cant deny it you cant deny it  
  
Cause I know that youve been thinkin bout it  
And I know they think youre out of your mind  
All of this time  
I know that youve been waiting so  
You cant deny  
I know that youve been waiting for this  
I know that youve been waiting for this
