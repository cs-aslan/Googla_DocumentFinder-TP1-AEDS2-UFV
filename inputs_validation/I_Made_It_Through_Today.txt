As I turn out the light and bow my head to pray  
The answered prayer Im thankful for  
Is I made it through today  
  
Well her leavin took its toll on me  
And it took a lot of faith  
To find the strength to carry on  
But I made it through today  
  
Oh I was guilty of takin her heart for granted  
Lettin love slip through my hands  
Til I was emptyhanded  
And now I know how much I have and I aint gonna lose it  
Cause Ive been given a second chance  
And I intend to use it  
  
Im not tryin to change the world  
Im just tryin to find my way  
And I still stumble now and then  
But I made it through today  
  
Whoa I was guilty of takin this life for granted  
Lettin time slip through my hands  
Til I was emptyhanded  
Now I know how much I have and I aint gonna lose it  
Cause Ive been given a second chance  
And I intend to use it  
  
As I turn out the light and bow my head to pray  
The answered prayer Im thankful for  
Is I made it through today  
Mmmmmm I made it through today  
Mmmmmm I made it through today  
Mmhmm mmhmm
