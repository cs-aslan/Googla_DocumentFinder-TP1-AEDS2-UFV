Its been a long long while  
I know Ive caused you pain  
Living without you its not quite the same  
Can we start over again  
  
I played around to long  
Running from end to end  
Took you for granted Ive been such a fool  
Cant we start over again  
  
All through my life of seasons  
No matter how far I long  
Always theres something missing inside  
Yearning to come back home  
  
You are the one I return to  
Love only love leads the way  
Give us this chance to start over again  
Darling Im coming home to stay  
  
You are the one I return to  
Love only love leads the way  
Give us this chance to start over again  
Darling Im coming home to stay
