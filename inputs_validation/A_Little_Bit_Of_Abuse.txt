One on the nose one on the chin  
You bruise so easy so why stay with him  
He uses you just like a human punching bag  
But you dont complain youre too scared to speak  
Anyway it only really hurts you when you laugh  
And when you eat  
But you cant break the pattern week after week  
The bruises show  
But he must be special otherwise youd just get up and go  
Youll never let us know  
Exactly how you feel  
Whats the use the cynics say its no excuse  
You keep running back just to get a little bit of abuse  
You say its okay  
But I say that its not right  
You wind him up but youre living in fear  
You keep going back but it ends in tears oh  
  
Thats quite a cut on the side of your head  
Is it from his fist or did you really fall out of bed  
Oh so uncouth  
Excuse me is this your tooth  
Why do you stay no one knows  
Do you really love him or are you too scared to go  
Youre always nervous and on the edge of tears  
You cry alone  
But you never tell us what its like when you get back home  
No one will ever know  
Because you never show  
Whats the use  
Everyone says youve got no excuse  
You keep running back just to get a little bit of abuse  
You say its okay  
But I say that its not right  
Oh its your secret its your life who am I to criticize  
It takes two sides to know its true  
And maybe hell stay in love with you  
No one will ever know  
Because you never show
