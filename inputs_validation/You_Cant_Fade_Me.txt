Now the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder  
Whats the date and time it dont matter  
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort  
To make a long story short  
Ran into this girl named Carla  
Knew her from the back seat of my homies Impala  
She said whats up yeah whats the deal  
Check the hairdo of course it aint real  
Then I looked down she was fat in the front  
I asked how long well about seven months  
Oh how time flies when youre having fun  
She said yeah but the damage is done  
Where you been on a little vacation  
Oh by the way congratulations  
Whos the lucky man I dont have a clue  
Then she said the lucky man is you  
I dropped my brew  
And everything looked fuzzy  
Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy  
She said yeah remember that date  
I thought back and tried to calculate  
Then I said damn are you sure its mine  
Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times  
She said that day no I wasnt whoring  
Your ass is mine thats when the sweat started pouring  
Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court  
Paying a gang on child support  
Then I thought deep about giving up the money  
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy  
Naw cause then Id really get faded  
Thats murder one cause it was premeditated  
So what Im a do  
I dont have a clue  
How many months left damn only two  
Im gettin faded  
  
No cigar G  
Ay yo homey man Im getting faded  
  
Its crazy cause before I could sleep with her  
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her  
See the booty and the front was all in place  
But the girl had the pitbull face  
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid  
Oh lord god forbid  
My homies see me at the motel  
Cause those fools would love to just go tell  
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep  
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept  
And hold your big fat butt steady  
Cause yo hoe I got the paper bag ready  
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey  
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque  
I dropped her off man and Im knowing  
That Im a hate myself in the morning  
I got drunk to help me forget  
Yo another day another hit shit  
Im gettin faded  
  
Ay yo you know what time it is  
  
Nine months later shes ready to drop the load  
And everybody in the hood already knows  
Its supposed to be mine so they laughing at me  
You know Ice Cube cant be having that G  
Im thinking to myself why did I bang her  
Now Im in the closet looking for the hanger  
JD and Jinx and TBone wont let up they wont shut up  
Im gettin fed up bitch  
Cause I know youre tryin to break me  
But if I find out your tryin to fake me  
Im a buff that duff for a hoot  
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two  
That night she went into labor  
And the shit is getting kinda major  
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver  
Looking like my nextdoor neighbor  
She said it was mine that was her best guess  
But lets check the results of the blood test  
I started smiling yeah cause it read negative  
Damn why did I let her live  
After that I shouldve got the gat  
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap  
But no I just told the hoe who laid me  
Excuse me bitch its a switch  
You cant fade me  
  
Naw baby not this way  
Yo you aint playing Ice Cube out like no booger  
I dont fall for the okeydoke  
And before I fall for the okeydoke  
I let the pistol smoke  
Now sing it  
Yeah baby you cant fade me  
Naw unfadable baby
