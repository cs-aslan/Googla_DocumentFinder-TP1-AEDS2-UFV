I see that face that look in your eyes  
Its so hard to hide that look in your eyes  
Youve been kicked down so many times  
Yeah youve tasted the dirt  
And you know what its like  
  
Fill up your cup  
Fill it up to the top  
Take a sip spit it out  
And fill it back up  
Cause you said half full  
Is never enough  
All alone and youve had enough  
  
Dont let me be dont let me be  
All by myself thats not how I felt  
Do I deserve to be one of the lonely  
Hold my hand stand by me  
All by myself thats not how I felt  
No one deserves to be one of the lonely  
Hold my hand stand by me  
  
Ive got that face that look in my eye  
Its impossible to hide  
That look in my eyes  
Ive been kicked down so many times  
Yeah Ive tasted the dirt  
I know what its like  
  
Fill up my cup  
Fill it up to the top  
Take a sip spit it out  
And fill it back up  
Cause I said half full  
Is never though  
All alone and Ive have enough  
  
Dont let me be dont let me be  
All by myself thats not how I felt  
Do I deserve to be one of the lonely  
Hold my hand stand by me  
All by myself thats not how I felt  
No one deserves to be one of the lonely  
Hold my hand stand by me  
  
How many times will we forgive  
What we just cant forget  
Time after time and still  
We let it happen again  
How many times do we  
Deserve exactly what we get  
I never wanted no I never want to be  
  
All by myself  
Thats not how I felt  
Do I deserve to be one of the lonely  
Hold my hand stand by me  
All by myself  
Thats not how I felt  
No one deserves to be one of the lonely  
Hold me hand stand by me
