Well youre just seventeen and all you want to do is disappear  
You know what I mean theres a lot of space between your ears  
The way that you touch dont feel no nothing  
Hey hey hey hey it was the DNA  
Hey hey hey hey that made me this way  
Do you know do you know do you know just how I feel  
Do you know do you know do you know just how I feel  
  
Sheer heart attack Sheer heart attack  
Real cardiac

Turn on the TV let it drip right down in your eyes  
Hey hey hey hey it was the DNA  
Hey hey hey hey that made me this way  
Do you know do you know do you know just how I feel
