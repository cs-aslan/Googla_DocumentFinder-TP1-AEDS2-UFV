Look what youre doing Im losing my mind  
My heads in a ruin leaving me behind  
It hurts to believe you could treat me so cruel  
Pick me up put me down make me look like a fool  
  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
  
Look what youre doing Im losing this time  
I thought you were true and I see I was blind  
It hurts to believe you could treat me so cruel  
Pick me up put me down make me look like a fool  
  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
  
It doesnt matter what you do or say  
I know goodbye is coming any day  
It doesnt matter what you do or say  
I know goodbye is coming any day  
It doesnt matter what you do or say  
I know goodbye is coming any day
