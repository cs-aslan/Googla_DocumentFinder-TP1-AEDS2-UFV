Ivy Rose Ivy Rose Im in love with you  
Cling to me cling to me like a vine  
Ill be yours when tonight is a memory  
Ill be yours and youll always be mine  
  
As the years disappear in the twilight of time  
With a sigh we will fondly recall  
All the plans that we made how we kissed unafraid  
In the shade of the old ivy wall  
  
Ivy Rose Ivy Rose Im in love with you  
Cling to me cling to me like a vine  
Ill be yours when tonight is a memory  
Ill be yours and youll always be mine  
  
Hand in hand as we stand neath the old campus moon  
Make believe that tomorrow is here  
Picture me close to you in a dream house for two  
Where the ivy grows greener each year  
  
Ivy Rose Ivy Rose Im in love with you  
Cling to me cling to me like a vine  
Ill be yours when tonight is a memory  
Ill be yours and youll always be mine
