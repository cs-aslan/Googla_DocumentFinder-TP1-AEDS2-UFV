Away Away  
  
I just cant wait to fall asleep  
I cant wait for night each day  
Cause when the lights are low  
No matter where you go  
Youre only forty winks  
Away Away  
  
No matter how far you may be  
Believe me darling when I say  
The oceans in between  
I cross them on a dream  
Cause youre just forty winks  
Away Away  
  
Theres a land of enchantment  
Just beyond my pillowcase  
And I go there cause I know there  
Ill be in your sweet embrace  
  
So till you come back home again  
Until youre in my arms to stay  
Its kinda nice to know  
I turn the lights down low  
And youre just forty winks  
Away Away  
Fade out  
Away Away
