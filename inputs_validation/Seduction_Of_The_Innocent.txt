He always wears his bible belt  
The collar under his head  
Its like a noose around his neck  
His sandaled feet dont touch the ground  
Ears dont hear a sound  
Seduction Of The Innocent  
  
Everybody thinks theres always a reason  
Need a reason to cry  
You kiss the hand of the man for all seasons  
And dont know why  
  
Say it friend if you had to do it all over again  
Would you know the trickery that hes prayin  
  
The padre looks well fed  
Remember what the good book said  
Vultures circle overhead  
Whatever gets you through the night  
Friends sing to clear your mind  
Seduction Of The Innocent  
  
Everybody thinks theres always a reason  
Need a reason to cry  
You kiss the hand of a man for all seasons  
And dont know why  
  
Say it friend if you had to do it all over again  
Would you know the trickery that hes prayin  
  
Everybody thinks theres always a reason  
Need a reason to cry  
You kiss the hand of the man for all seasons  
And dont know why  
  
Say it friend if you had to do it all over again  
Would you know the trickery that hes prayin
