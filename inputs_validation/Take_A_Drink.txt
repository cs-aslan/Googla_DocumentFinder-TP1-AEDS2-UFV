I never want to be part of the herd  
I guess I was in case you havent heard  
Maybe you can tell that I cant stand  
The way I want to be the included  
I always want to be a mystery  
I always knew that two and two made three  
I wish away the time Im living in  
I never wanna see the smile again  
  
Chorus  
Its not for sure  
And Im feeling  
Like its not for sure  
Come on and take a drink with me  
Whoa whoa I dont think you can cope with it  
I dont think you can handle it  
Whoa whoa Forgive my own forgetfulness  
And take a drink with me  
  
I wanted to be two but more than one  
I only thought that I could be so dumb  
Crush my heart with your new heels  
Id beg for you but I dont kneel  
I understand that you were living there  
It never bothered me that I dont care  
I wonder if Ill act on my impulse  
I wonder if Ill leave if you say go  
  
Chorus  
  
Whoa would you take a drink with me  
If its all you can take  
Itll be okay  
If its all I can take  
Then just put me away  
  
Chorus  
  
Whoa whoa I dont think you can cope with it  
So take a drink with me  
  
I never want to be part of the herd  
I guess I was in case you havent heard  
I wanna spend some time to make you see  
So why not come and take a drink with me
