Were on the road  
We move from place to place  
And oftentimes when Im about to call it home  
Wed have to move along  
Life is a constant change  
  
The friends we know we meet along the way  
Too soon the times we share form part of yesterday  
Cause lifes a constant change  
And nothing stays the same oh no  
  
Clouds that move across the skies  
Are changing form before our very eyes  
  
Why couldnt we keep time from movin on  
Hold on to all the years before this moments gone  
Why must we live the days at such a frightening pace  
  
Were all like clouds that move across the skies  
And changing form before our very eyes  
  
Have we outgrown our Peter Pans and wings  
Weve simply grown too old for tales of knights and kings  
Cause lifes a constant change  
And nothing stays the same oh no
