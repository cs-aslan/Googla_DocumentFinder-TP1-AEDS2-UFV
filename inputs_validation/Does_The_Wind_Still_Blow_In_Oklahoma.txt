feat Ronnie Dunn  
  
Reba  
Las a fast horse daddy  
Everybody rides  
Im sorry I havent called home lately  
Out here time flies  
I met a boy a few weeks back  
He plays in a band  
Hes a whole lot like you daddy youre gonna like him  
Hes a good man  
At times lonley sneaks up on me  
But Im getting by  
Yeah I know what youve always told me  
Cow girls dont cry  
  
Chorus  
But does the wind still blow in oklahoma  
Out here the hollywood stars sure shine bright  
Its such a long way from home here in California  
Missin you and that blue wide open sky  
  
Ronnie  
Out here its all freeway fast cars  
Cold concrete  
You wont believe all the crazy people  
Bally girls sun sets free  
I met a girl youre gonna like her mama  
She has your hair  
Red as the telecross sunset  
Seems like an angel I swear  
I cant say I dont get lonsome  
But Im alright  
Cow boys kinda go with homesick  
Like blue moons and whipperwill nights  
  
Chorus
