Oh when you walk by every night  
Talking sweet and looking fine  
I get kinda hectic inside  
Mmm baby Im so into you  
Darling if you only knew  
All the things that flow through my mind  
  
But its just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
When I close my eyes  
You come and you take me  
Its so deep in my daydreams  
But its just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
  
Images of rapture  
Creep into me slowly  
As youre going to my head  
And my heart beats faster  
When you take me over  
Time and time and time again  
  
But its just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
When I close my eyes  
You come and you take me  
Its so deep in my daydreams  
But its just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
  
But its just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
When I close my eyes  
You come and you take me  
Its so deep in my daydreams  
But its just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
  
Im in heaven  
With my boyfriend  
My laughing boyfriend  
Theres no beginning  
And there is no end  
Feels like Im dreaming  
But Im not sleeping  
  
But its just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
When I close my eyes  
You come and you take me  
Its so deep in my daydreams  
But its just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
  
But its just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
When I close my eyes  
You come and you take me  
Its so deep in my daydreams  
But its just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
  
Sweet sweet fantasy baby  
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
