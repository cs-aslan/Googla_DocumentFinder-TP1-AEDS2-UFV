Chorus  
Im just a passenger  
on this old freight train  
I ride the boxcar  
through the night  
I doesnt matter  
where I might get off  
I doesnt matter where I lie  
  
Ive been to cities  
Ive been to countries  
Ive left a lover in many towns  
I dont care if  
I ever get back to  
Where Id already been around  
  
Im like an eagle  
I like to fly high  
Im like a snake  
I like to lay low  
Im like a black man  
Im like a white man  
Maybe a red man I dont know  
  
Chorus
