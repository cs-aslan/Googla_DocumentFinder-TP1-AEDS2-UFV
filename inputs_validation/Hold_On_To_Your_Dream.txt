In life we have our pains and sorrows  
Face mountains we think we cant climb  
Nothing can theres always tomorrow  
You feel like giving up you say youre out of luck  
But then you hear a voice in your mind  
Telling you to  
Hold on to your dream  
Cause theyre always worth having  
Hold on to your dream  
Like a father to his son  
Dont let anyone ever steal your joy from you  
Hold on to your dream  
till the day that life is said and done  
This world is filled peaks and valleys  
With rivers we think we cant cross  
To busy keeping sorrows telling  
You say youre at youre in  
You say you never win  
But then a light comes on in your mind  
Till you  
Hold on to your dream  
Cause theyre always worth having  
Hold on to your dream  
Like a father to his son  
Dont let anyone ever steal your joy from you  
Hold on to your dream  
Until the day that life is said and done  
If you wanna hold on to something  
You better hold on to your dreams  
If you want to hold on to something  
Youve gotta hold to your love  
To your love  
So if they try to burst your bubble  
Its cons they havent done em all  
And when you feel you are in trouble  
Hold your head up high and feel your heart inside  
And know that you are never alone  
Just as long as you  
Hold on to your dream  
Cause theyre always worth having  
Hold on to your dream  
Like a father to his son  
Dont let anyone ever steal your joy from you  
Hold on to your dream  
till the day that life is said and done  
Hold on to your dream  
Cause theyre always worth having  
Hold on to your dream  
Like a mother to her child  
Dont let anyone ever steal your dreams from you  
Hold on to your dream  
And do your best to always wear a smile  
Hold on to your dream
