Did the best I could to make you mine  
If you ever felt anything for me  
Well you never gave a sign  
Thought time would make you change  
Make you want me but baby I never had a chance  
Now I know that theres just some things  
Just not meant to be  
No use makin you care about me  
No way that Im gonna win  
Oh darlin I might as well be chasin the wind  
Oh Im just chasin the wind  
Open up my heart let you inside  
If love was what you were lookin for  
Well I guess it wasnt mine  
So I guess I better go its over and done  
But you know Im not really sad at all  
Cause you cant really say its over  
When it never had begun  
No use makin you care about me  
No way that Im gonna win  
Oh darlin I might as well be chasin the wind  
Oh Im just chasin the wind  
Cant reach the sea if you cant get past the sand  
Cant touch the sky if you cant reach up your hand  
Cant give if you give nothin back  
No use makin you care about me  
No way that Im gonna win  
Oh darlin I might as well be chasin the wind  
No use makin you care about me  
Makin you care about me  
No way that Im gonna win  
Oh darlin I might as well be chasin the wind  
Oh Im just chasin the wind  
Oh Im just chasin the wind
