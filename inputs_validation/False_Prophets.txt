We see them everyday  
Movin up and down  
Holding their bibles in their hands yeah  
Going to church every Sunday  
Telling people theyre Christians yeah  
Ye man we read in the Bible  
And over stand  
Its telling us of all the false prophets  
When the Messiahs  
Gonna come down here  
Them a gonna say these words  
Jesus I want to be like you  
  
Chorus  
False prophets lies and elution

Lamping da creation yeah  
I and I no like da Babylon style  
I and I no like da Babylon style  
Cause dem a go around lampin Jah creation  
Dem a go around telling dem lies  
Jesus I want to be like you  
  
Chorus
