Ive been tryin to tell you  
Ive been puttin it off puttin it off cant wait any longer  
Youve been good to me and that only makes it harder to say what I gotta say  
  
You gotta know I didnt plan it it was the last thing on my mind  
How can you love two people at the same time Ooh ooh  
Now I dont wanna lose you but I cant give him up  
  
I know its unconventional radical but practical  
Why cant the three of us live together  
Its a culture shock but its the only hope weve got  
So tell me why cant the three of us live together  
  
If I could go back and undo it  
If I had a time machine Id make it unhappen like a bad dream  
Honey you gotta know I didnt plan it it was the last thing on my mind  
How can you love two people at the same time Ooh ooh  
Now I dont wanna lose you but I cant give him up  
  
I know its unconventional radical but practical  
Why cant the three of us live together  
Its a culture shock but its the only hope weve got  
So tell me why cant the three of us live together  
  
Youre not takin this too well its out of the question I can tell  
Its not gonna work is it  
  
Oh I know its unconventional its radical but practical  
I dont wanna lose you no but Im not gonna give him up no  
Its a culture shock but its the only hope weve got  
Tell me why cant the three of us live together  
  
I know its unconventional radical but practical  
Why cant the three of us live together  
Its a culture shock but its the only hope weve got  
So tell me why cant the three of us live together
