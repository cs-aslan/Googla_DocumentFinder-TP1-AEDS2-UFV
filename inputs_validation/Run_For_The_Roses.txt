Born in the valley  
And raised in the trees  
Of western Kentucky  
On wobbly knees  
With mama beside you  
To help you along  
Youll soon be growing up strong  
  
All the long lazy mornings  
In pastures of green  
The sun on your withers  
The wind in your mane  
Could never prepare you  
For what lies ahead  
The run for the roses so red  
  
And its run for the roses  
As fast as you can  
You fate is delivered  
Your moments at hand  
Its the chance of a lifetime  
In a lifetime of chance  
And its high time you joined  
In the dance  
Its high time you joined  
In the dance  
  
From sire to sire  
Its born in the blood  
The fire of a mare  
And the strength of a stud  
Its breeding and its training  
And its something unknown  
That drives you  
And carries you home  
  
And its run for the roses  
As fast as you can  
Your fate is delivered  
Your moments at hand  
Its the chance of a lifetime  
In a lifetime of chance  
And its high time you joined  
In the dance
