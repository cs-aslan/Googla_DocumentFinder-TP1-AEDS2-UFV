I was walking thru the forest  
One cold and dreary morn  
My heart sick with jealousy  
And memories I need no more  
No I could never kill a man  
But I would do him harm  
Knowing that youre there  
Lying in his arms  
My flesh was ripped and torn  
By the bramble and the thorn  
I was lost but wellprepared  
To offer up my soul  
Because the greater misery  
Is to live with what I know  
The moon concealed by Aprils storm  
No bearing I could find  
Until I fell into a clearing  
And a road I recognized  
I was far  
Far from my home  
Further from her smile  
Not sure if I would return  
Or just lay down and die  
As I stood in Phaedras Meadow  
Well the dawn did break the sky  
And from the highest up in heaven  
The Weaving Star fell into my eyes
