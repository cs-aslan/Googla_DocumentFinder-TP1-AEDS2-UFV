The horizon breaks where a figure stands  
Close your eyes and pray its a vision of Gods command  
  
Hes evil and mysterious  
People fear his name  
Hes not here for deliverance no  
Hes the Lawmaker  
  
He never speaks but his task were told  
To seek out souls of the sinners hell trade for gold  
  
Hes evil and mysterious  
People fear his name  
Hes not here for deliverance no  
Hes the Lawmaker  
  
Silver mountains wont save you from hell  
The prince of darkness inside you will dwell  
Oh your weakness your past  
The Lawmaker comes  
  
Hes evil and mysterious  
People fear his name  
Hes not here for deliverance no  
Hes the Lawmaker  
Hes the Lawmaker
