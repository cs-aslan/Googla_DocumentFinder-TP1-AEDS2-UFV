When you see your face in the mirror  
Does it seem the end is gettin nearer  
All your life you spent as a wheeler  
Now the hole you dug its gettin deeper  
Youre talkin words  
But they dont make the rhyme  
Youll lose it all  
Cause you cant draw the line  
You got nothin  
Nothin for nothin  
Youre hurtin over time  
Nothin for nothin  
And we dont need your time  
Nothin for nothin  
Pushin shovin got no time  
Nothin for nothin  
When you see the day gettin darker  
You can run to your lies run to your cover  
When you feel the heat from a lover  
You hit the highway lookin for another  
You made the grade  
You left the hills behind  
You take the cake and eat it  
Youre so blind  
You got nothin  
Nothin for nothin  
Youre hurtin over time  
Nothin for nothin  
And we dont need your time  
Nothin for nothin  
Pushin shovin got no time  
Nothin for nothin  
Nothin for nothin  
Youre hurtin over time  
Nothin for nothin  
And we dont need your time  
Nothin for nothin  
Pushin shovin got no time  
Nothin for nothin  
Nothin for nothin  
Youre hurtin over time  
Nothin for nothin  
And we dont need your time  
Nothin for nothin  
Pushin shovin got no time  
Nothin for nothin  
Nothin for nothin  
Youre hurtin over time  
Nothin for nothin  
And we dont need your time  
Nothin for nothin  
Pushin shovin got no time  
Hey youre hurtin over time
