I awoke on impact  
Under surveillance from the camera eye  
Searching high and low  
The criminal mind found at the scene of the crime  
Handcuffed and blind I didnt do it  
She said she loved me  
I guess I never knew  
But do we ever ever really know  
She said shed meet me on the other side  
But I knew right then Id never find her  
  
I dont believe in love  
I never have I never will  
I dont believe in love  
Its never worth the pain that you feel  
  
No more nightmares Ive seen them all  
From the day I was born  
Theyve haunted my every move  
Every open hands there to push and shove  
No time for love it doesnt matter  
She made a difference  
I guess she had a way  
Of making every night seem bright as day  
Now I walk in shadows never see the light  
She must have lied cause she never said goodbye  
  
I dont believe in love  
I never have I never will  
I dont believe in love  
Ill just pretend she never was real  
I dont believe in love  
I need to forget her face I see it still  
I dont believe in love  
Its never worth the pain that you feel  
  
No chance for contact  
Theres no raison detre  
My only hope is one day Ill forget  
The pain of knowing what can never be  
With or without love its all the same to me  
  
I dont believe in love  
I never have I never will  
I dont believe in love  
Ill just pretend she never was real  
I dont believe in love  
I never have I never will  
I dont believe in love  
Its never worth the pain that you feel
