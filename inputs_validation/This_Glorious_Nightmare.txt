Divine intoxication spills out the bores  
A self diluting fix that craves all the more  
Destructive seasoned vetfull glass of sting  
A bittersweet triumph that weighs in each day  
  
Obsessionmy falsest friend  
Moderationa fantasy that I cant win  
Devastationa hardship loss  
Demandingthe pain of wasted years  
  
Chorus  
Lift me up  
Tear me down  
Will I last through this glorious nightmare  
  
Collapse all that sacredprey on the weak  
Slow painful suicide that steals from each man  
Hells fire soon returns to rape the well  
Prolific doom machine that hears our words  
  
Im fighting the will to live  
With countless persuasions  
Im fighting the will to live  
The endless temptations  
Its lifeless grip  
That haunts us all  
  
Pulling from every direction  
Its lifeless grip graps hold  
Yearning is now my dissension  
Its lifeless grip graps hold  
  
Chorus
