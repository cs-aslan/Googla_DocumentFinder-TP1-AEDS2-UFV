Now when I leave this town  
Wont be  back no more  
Yes when I leave this town mama  
Wont be back no more  
Ive got the blues so bad  
Standing round my door  
Yes I got the blues so bad  
Why wont you let me be  
I have the blues so bad mama  
Why wont you let me be  
Now when I go to chicago  
Blues dont you follow me  
Break  
Im asking mama mama  
Please dont cry no tears  
Yes I say mama mama  
Please dont cry no tears  
Because Ill always love you  
Through all my days and years
