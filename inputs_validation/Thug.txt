You look like who you say you are  
So scoot over let me drive your car  
Roll down the glass and give me some wind  
lock all the doors Im on the loose again alright  
  
I havent sat behind a wheel like this  
since that job in 1956  
Cant wait till I can do it again  
cant keep my nose clean livin in sin alright  
  
I had a friend down in Alcatraz  
he had the money and machine guns stashed  
We busted out June 21  
we gonna rob steal totin our guns alright
