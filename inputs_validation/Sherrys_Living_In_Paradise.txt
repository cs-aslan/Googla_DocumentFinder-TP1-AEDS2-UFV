Slinging drinks at a bar down by the beach  
And you know she came here from LA  
Southern California could not hold her dreams  
Shes happy now it seems

Chasing something or running from something  
Had a lot of lovers that were good for nothing  
And shes thought about leaving once or twice  
But shes still in the sun and this laidback life

Sherrys living in paradise  
Somehow the salty air it soothes her soul  
Says it makes her whole  
She gets hit on by the tourists  
But she brushes it off cause shes heard every line  
She just takes it in stride
