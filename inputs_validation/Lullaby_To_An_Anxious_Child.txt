Hush child  
Let your mommy sleep into the night until we rise  
Hush child  
Let me soothe the shining tears that gather in your eyes  
  
Hush child  
I wont leave Ill stay with you to cross this Bridge of Sighs  
Hush child  
I can help the look of accusation in your eyes  
In your eyes  
  
The world is broken and now  
All in sorrow  
Wise men hang their heads  
  
Hush child  
Let your mommy sleep into the night until we rise  
Hush child  
All the strength Ill need to find Ill find inside your eyes  
In your eyes
