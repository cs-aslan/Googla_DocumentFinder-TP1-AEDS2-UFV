Some say were the land of misfit toys  
An insane mix of girls and boys  
Nothing really changes like a stretch of sand time forgot  
  
Thats just livin thats just livin  
Thats just livin life on a rock yea  
  
Well you dont lose your lover you just lose your turn  
Drivin on the left side gotta be learned  
Happy hours from 3 to 6 but it never really stops  
  
Thats just livin thats just livin  
Thats just livin life on a rock yea  
  
We got Rasta religions and parrots and pigeons  
Mango and salt on a stick  
Life is a lime and from time to time  
I gotta go get my fix yea  
  
We roll with the flow friends come and go  
Usually by the edge of the dock  
  
Thats just livin thats just livin  
Thats just livin life on a rock yea  
Oh I love livin I love livin  
I love livin life on a rock yea  
  
Life on a rock  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
I love livin  
Life on a rock
