This could be our last good night together  
We may never pass this way again  
Just let me enjoy it til its over or forever  
Please dont tell me how the story ends  
  
See the way our shadows come together  
Softer than your fingers on my skin  
Someday these may be all we remember of each other  
Please dont tell me how the story ends  
  
Nevers just the echo of forever  
Lonesome as a love that might have been  
Let me go on lovin and believin til its over  
Please dont tell me how the story ends
