Hoochie Woman  
Hoochie Woman  
Hoochie Woman  
Hoochie Woman  
  
I wasnt thinking  
My head was in the book  
His hands were on her everywhere  
I saw his face I dropped my coffee  
Hes cheating on me with a Hoochie Woman  
  
Ooo hoo hoo you can  
Keep your Hoochie  
Ooo hoo hoo  
And the bank accounts  
Cause boy I bring home the Bacon  
I said boys I bring home the Bacon now  
  
I went to work and the office girls  
Were all burning their poetry  
It wasnt good  
But in the neighborhood  
Now theyre all just a  
Hoochie Woman  
  
He called me up  
And said she has needs  
I said youll find em  
On Barneys fourth floor  
He said I need a loan  
I said thats not a problem  
You better keep this from you  
Hoochie Woman
