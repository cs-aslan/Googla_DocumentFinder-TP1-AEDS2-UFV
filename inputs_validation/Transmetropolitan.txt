In the rosy parks of England  
Well sit and have a drink  
Of VP wine and cider til we can hardly think  
And well go where the spirits take us  
To heaven or to hell  
And kick up bloody murder in the town we love so well  
  
Going transmetropolitan  
From the dear old streets of Kings Cross  
To the doors of the ICA  
Going transmetropolitan  
Well drink the rats piss kick the shite  
And Im not going home tonight  
  
From Brixtons lovely boulevards  
To Hammersmiths sightly shores  
Well scare the Camden Palace poofs  
And worry all the whores  
Theres leechers up in Whitehall  
And queers in the GLC  
And when weve done those bastards in  
Well storm the BBC  
  
Going transmetropolitan  
From Surrey Docks to Somers Town  
With a KMRIA  
Going transmetropolitan  
Well drink the rats piss kick the shite  
And Im not going home tonight  
  
From a 5 pound bet in William Hills  
To a Soho sexshop dream  
From a fried egg in Valtaros  
To a Tottenham Court Road ice cream  
Well spew and lurch get nicked and fixed  
On the way well kill and maim  
When you havent got a penny boys  
Its all the bloody same  
  
Going transmetropolitan  
From Pentonville Road on a sunset eve  
To the beauty thats Mill Lane  
Going transmetropolitan  
Well drink the rats piss kick the shite  
And Im not going home tonight  
  
This town has done us dirty  
This town has bled us dry  
Weve been here for a long time  
And well be here til we die  
So well finish off the leavings  
Of blood and glue and beer  
And burn this bloody city down  
In the summer of the year  
  
Going transmetropolitan  
From Arlington House with a 2 bob bit  
To the Scottish shores today  
Going transmetropolitan  
Well drink the rats piss kick the shite  
And Im not going home tonight
