Getting my facts from a Benneton ad  
Im lookin through African eyes  
Lit by the glare of an LA fire  
Ive got a face not just my race Bang Bang Ive got you babe  
  
Sun comes up and the man goes down  
And the woman comes again  
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear  
Then we jump through hoops were divisable now just disappear  
  
We reach out over race and hold each others hands  
Then die in the flames singing we shall overcome  
Whoa Whats going on  
Therell be some blood no doubt about it  
But well come through dont doubt it  
I look into your eyes and I know you wont kill me  
You wont kill me  
You wont kill me  
But I look into your eyes  
And I wonder sometimes  
  
Oh Lord just let him see me  
Lord Lord just let him hear me  
Let him call me brother  
Let him put his arms around me  
Let him put his hands together  
  
Reach over race and hold each others hands  
Walk through the night thinking we are the world  
Woa Whats going on  
Therell be some blood no doubt about it  
But well come through dont doubt it  
  
I look into your eyes and I know you wont kill me  
You wont kill me  
You wont kill me  
But I wonder why  
Yes and I wonder why sometimes  
  
Theyll show us how to break the rules  
But never how to make the rules  
Reduce us down to witless punks  
Facist cries both black and white whos got the blood whos got the gun  
  
Putting on the black tie cranking out the white noise
