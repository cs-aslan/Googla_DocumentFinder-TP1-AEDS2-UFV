Deny  
Youre such a liar  
You wont know the truth if it hits you in the eye  
Deny  
Youre such a liar  
Youre selling your nono all the time  
  
An you said we were going out  
To the 100 club  
Then you said it aint my scene  
But then you turned up alone  
Then you turned up alone  
  
Then you said youd given it up  
Gone an kicked it in the head  
You said you aint had none for weeks  
But baby I seen your arms  
Baby I seen your arms  
  
Do you think Im a raving idiot  
Just got off the boat  
Step in line sign this form  you aint got a hope  
Baby aint got a hope  you aint got a hope  
  
What a liar  deny  
What a liar
