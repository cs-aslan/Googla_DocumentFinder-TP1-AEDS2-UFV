Oh oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh  
Oh ohoh oh whoa ohoh ohoh oh  
Ohoh oh a ohoh oh  
  
I used to rule the world  
Seas would rise when I gave the word  
Now in the morning I sleep alone  
Sweep the streets that I used to own  
  
Oh oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh  
Oh ohoh oh ohoh oh ohoh oh  
Ohoh oh a oh oh oh  
  
I used to roll the dice  
Feel the fear in my enemys eyes  
Listen as the crowd would sing  
Now the old king is dead Long live the king  
One minute I held the key  
Next the walls were closed on me  
And I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my Chris and Ill be your Gwyneth  
My missionaries hiding in foreign trenches  
  
For some reason I cant explain  
Once you go there was never  
Never an hhhhhonest word  
And that was when I ruled the world  
  
Oh oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh  
Oh ohoh oh ohoh oh ohoh oh  
Ohoh oh a ohoh oh  
  
It was the wicked and a wild wind  
Blew down the doors to let me in  
Shattered windows and the sound of drums  
People couldnt believe what Ive become  
  
Revolutionaries wait  
For my blonde head on a silver plate  
Just a Gaga on a lonely string  
Oh who would ever want to be queen  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my Chris and Ill be your Gwyneth  
My missionaries hiding in foreign trenches  
  
For some reason that I cant explain  
I know Yves Saint Laraunt no he wont call my name  
Never an hhhhhonest word  
But that was when I ruled the world  
  
Now Im doing my very best not to mess up all the words but  
A strong apology to Coldplay but I think otherwise its a good job  
  
Oh oh ohoh oh oh ohoh oh  
Oh ohoh oh oh ohoh ohoh oh  
Oh ohoh oh  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my Chris and Ill be your Gwyneth  
The Fame wont change us if we dont let it  
  
For some reason I cant explain  
I know Saint Mary wont call my name  
Never an hhonest word  
But that was when I ruled the world ruled the world  
Ruyouuuled the world  
Viva La Vida
