She reminds me of the one in school  
When I was cuttin  
She was dressed in white  
And I couldnt take my eyes off her  
But thats not what I took off that night  
  
Shell never cover up what we did with her dress no  
She said kiss me  
Itll heal  
But it wont forget  
Kiss me  
Itll heal  
But it wont forget  
  
And I dont mind you keepin me  
On pins and needles  
If I could stick to you  
And you stick me too  
  
Dont break  
Dont break my heart  
And I wont break your heartshaped glasses  
Little girl little girl  
You should close your eyes  
That blue is getting me high  
  
Dont break  
Dont break my heart  
And I wont break your heartshaped glasses  
Little girl little girl  
You should close your eyes  
That blue is getting me high  
And making me low  
That blue is getting me high  
And making me low  
  
She reminds me of a one I knew  
That cut up the negatives of my life  
I couldnt take my hands off her  
She wouldnt let me be anywhere but inside  
  
And I dont mind you keepin me  
On pins and needles  
If I could stick to you  
And you stick me too  
  
Just dont break  
Dont break my heart  
And I wont break your heartshaped glasses  
Little girl little girl  
You should close your eyes  
That blue is getting me high  
  
Dont break  
Dont break my heart  
And I wont break your heartshaped glasses  
Little girl little girl  
You should close your eyes  
That blue is getting me high  
And making me low  
  
Shell never cover up what we did with her dress no  
She said kiss me  
Itll heal  
But it wont forget  
Kiss me  
Itll heal  
But it wont forget  
  
I dont mind you keepin me  
On pins and needles  
If I could stick to you  
And you stick me too  
  
Dont break  
Dont break my heart  
And I wont break your heartshaped glasses  
Little girl little girl  
You should close your eyes  
That blue is getting me high  
  
Dont break  
Dont break my heart  
And I wont break your heartshaped glasses  
Little girl little girl  
You should close your eyes  
That blue is getting me high  
And making me low
