Im giving up on tv its not making sense  
Gotta trust ourselves its the last line of defence  
Spinning into space running out of time  
Gathering together all the useful things we find  
Chorus  
So dont say okay and be halfhearted  
Im afraid that this feeling goes on  
Sacrifice the world face a killing sun  
You gotta get it all together itll bring us all undone  
Were running up hills that we already climbed  
Over the top and falling down the other side  
Chorus  
The ghosts are at the window theyre again tonight  
Looking in on us so we have got to get it right  
Weve walking on their bones everywhere we go  
Spirits in the wind and the memories in the stones  
Chorus  
How we gonna get the healing done
