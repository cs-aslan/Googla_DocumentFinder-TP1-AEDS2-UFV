No more sadness  
I wanna be the one to make you happy  
I wanna be the one to give you hope  
But in these days of conscious living  
Weve got to take it slow  
You cant be sure of who youve met  
You just dont know what you might get  
Cause in these crazy times were living  
Love can turn into regret  
  
But you could be the one to change my point of view  
Its all up to you  
  
Give you love without the pain  
Show you light beyond the rain  
Gonna make you happy  
Gonna make you happy now  
Therell be days when things go wrong  
Ill be there to make you strong  
Gonna make you happy  
Gonna make you happy  
  
I wanna find a place where dreams can happen  
I wanna find a love wholl take me there  
And in your eyes I see a vision  
That makes me want to care  
And if two people both agree  
That only love can set them free  
Then together let us make a world  
Of which others only dream  
  
And you can be the one to make it all come true  
So what you gonna do  
  
Ill give you love without the pain  
Show you light beyond the rain  
Gonna make you happy  
Gonna make you happy now
