In the bosom of europa  
Little liza was caressed  
By the music of the angels  
Playing underneath her dress  
She saw the great caruso  
And thats when she fell in love  
Shed think of him as elvis  
If she knew who elvis was  
  
Spinning round and round  
You can hear her moan  
Shes all by herself  
But shes not alone  
  
Wonderful things happen to me  
Whenever I sing that white mans melody  
Wonderful wave  wash over me  
Whenever I sing that white mans melody  
  
By the shores of the gitchee goomee  
She was floating on her bed  
She was deaming of al jolson  
And what she thought he said  
  
He was looking in the mirror  
He was putting on the paint  
Said the hardest thing about this job  
Is being what you aint  
  
Just an old white man  
In a strange new world  
Can you come out tonight  
Little buffalo girl  
  
Wonderful things happen to me  
Whenever I sing that white mans melody  
Wonderful wave  wash over me  
Whenever I sing that white mans melody  
  
From the loins of the liberace  
Sprang a million little tunes  
And they whirled around eliza  
Like so many little moons  
Every jewel held a secret  
Every flourish held a clue  
As he held her in a rapture  
Singing Ill be seeing you  
  
Wonderful things happen to me  
Whenever I sing that white mans melody  
Wonderful wave  wash over me  
Whenever I sing that white mans melody
