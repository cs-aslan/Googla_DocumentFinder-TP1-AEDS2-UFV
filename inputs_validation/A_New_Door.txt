I can see that look in your eyes  
Youre in need of something you cant find  
Youre tired of holding on to the pain  
You havent got the strength to hold the reigns  
You are out of lane  
  
Chorus  
I know you cant take it  
I know you cant take it anymore  
I know you cant fake it  
I know you cant fake it anymore  
Now its time for you to open a new door  
  
You fool yourself when you live a lie  
You spend all of your time getting high  
But drunken nights wont bury your fears  
All the drinks you had just turned to tears  
For too many years  
  
Chorus  
  
When you think that nobody cares  
Close your eyes and know that God is there  
And if you reach out Hell do the same  
Just ask for what you need in Jesus name  
Dont be ashamed  
  
Chorus  
  
Now its time for you to open a new door
