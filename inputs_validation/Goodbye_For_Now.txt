Stephen Sondheim  
  
Yes I know goodbye for now  
How long A year a day  
Yes I love you yes youre with me  
Here now next to me and worlds away  
See I free you and Ill see you when I see you  
Fine ok  
Goodbye for now again  
Goodbye until whenever then  
Were free thats what we said wed be  
At leave to come an go you as well as I  
Somehow each hello makes it worth goodbye  
For now
