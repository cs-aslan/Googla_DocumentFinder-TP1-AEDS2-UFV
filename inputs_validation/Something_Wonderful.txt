This is a man who thinks with his heart  
His heart is not always wise  
This is a man who stumbles and falls  
But this is a man who tries  
  
This is a man youll forgive and forgive  
And help protect as long as you live  
He will not always say  
What you would have him say  
But now and then hell do  
Something  
Wonderful  
  
He has a thousand dreams  
That wont come true  
You know that he believes in them  
And thats enough for you  
  
Youll always go along  
Defend him when hes wrong  
And tell him when hes strong  
He is  
Wonderful  
Hell always  
Needs your love  
And so hell get your love  
A man who needs your love  
Can be  
Wonderful  
  
Shell always go along  
Defend him when hes wrong  
And tell him when hes strong  
He is wonderful  
Hell always need her love  
And so hell get her love  
A man who needs your love  
Can be wonderful
