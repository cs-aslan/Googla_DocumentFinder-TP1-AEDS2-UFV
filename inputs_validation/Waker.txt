My name is the Waker  
And Im bringin you the morning sun  
Ive pushed the old man up forever  
Still I feel Ive just begun  
  
Ive just begun  
  
My name is treetop  
And Im higher than youll ever be  
Im married to my roots here  
Still I feel like I am free  
  
Feelin Im free  
  
My name is blue sky  
And Im bluer than all of you  
Ive watched you run around forever  
Always searching for something new  
  
Theres nothing new  
Feelin Im free  
Ive just begun  
Im always young  
Loves always new
