When the day is over  
I like to ease my mind  
By jucin up my system  
With the beat of a heavy kind  
I smack a bottle open  
I crank the hifi high  
Im ina seventh heaven  
Ooh I can touch the sky  
  
Im in love so in love  
And I cant stop talking bout my rock forever  
  
Its got the movin to me  
just that I cant explain  
Its like a brilliant sunshine  
After standing in the pouring rain  
My skin begins to tingle  
Ooh right on down my back  
Its really got me fevered  
Pounding my senses flat  
  
Im in love so in love  
And I cant stop talking bout my rock forever  
  
Rock rock rock forever I love my  
Rock rock rock forever my fever  
Rock rock rock forever always gonna  
Rock rock rock forever  
I cant stop talkin about rock  
Now get it right boys  
  
So when you get those blue days  
Heres just what to do  
Switch into this lifeline  
And feel it rushing through  
Before you know it blue days  
Are better left behind  
By juicin up your system  
With this beat of a heavy kind  
  
Im in love so in love  
And I cant stop talking bout my rock forever  
Rock forever  
Im gonna rock forever
