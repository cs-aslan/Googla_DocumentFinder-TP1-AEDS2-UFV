Mean mistreater you make me cry  
You lay around and watch me die  
Mean mistreater cant you see Im real  
Are you satisfied with the way you feel  
  
Ive tried hard to live without you in so many ways  
I just cant help myself from thinking of you for the rest of my days  
Heartache is at my door step wont leave me alone  
I just cant get used to it now that Im on my own  
  
I know all about you your childhood days  
Your mom and dad your pretty face  
Mean mistreater if you need me  
Im needin you to set me free  
  
Mmm
