In the jungle I run tonight  
Find no peace to logical life  
No confusion just wrong or right oh yeah  
  
Faces numbers I recognize  
You dont fool me with cynical lies  
No problems no compromise oh yeah  
  
Only solutions  
Dont pull me down I just want to hear  
Only solutions  
Oh it wont be long it wont take too long  
  
Modern times drive me insane  
Explanations I cant explain  
Leaves me standing in the rain oh yeah  
  
Solving mysteries with nothing to lose  
Magic leaves you without any clues  
Theres only so much one man can do oh yeah  
  
Only solutions  
Dont pull me down I just want to hear  
Only solutions  
Oh it wont be long it wont take too long  
Only solutions  
Dont pull me down I just want to hear  
Now that the sun is shining  
Clear vision clear vision  
  
In the jungle I run tonight  
Find no peace to logical life  
No confusion just wrong or right oh yeah  
  
Faces numbers I recognize  
You dont fool me with cynical lies  
No problems no compromise oh yeah  
  
Only solutions  
Its my point of view  
Only solutions  
Oh clear vision  
Only solutions  
No second thoughts  
Only solutions  
No no no contradictions  
  
People reason  
People reason  
No escape
