Crossed a plain that left behind dark days  
Filled a void that I thought could not be replaced  
Now gone it seems so out or reach  
  
I have lived I have felt  
Its what we need  
Gone  
What have I done  
Found what Ive been looking for  
One time I believe my eyes This time  
  
This time my instincts controlled me  
No need to search on for any more  
I feel as one with myself I look no more  
  
Now a lifetime decision  
What will the future hold  
This time they lied  
  
I felt you slip away  
A feeling under my skin  
I tried again and again  
I did not save you this time  
  
Holding on to something that I once believed in  
Will time show me if this was really meant to be  
  
Show me what this really means to you  
Fall even though I showed you everything that I stand for  
I hate everything without you  
Life falls and crumblers in my hand  
Faith is dead  
Its something I cant stand  
Dreams hope gone  
Just a one time thing  
Far away are the days that we once shared  
  
I never thought I could change  
I would be walking a dead day  
You believed in me and knew I could change  
Came in my life and became my best friend  
Now I have been forced away  
Unwillingly out on my own  
I never wanted to lose this much  
You broke a trust that was our own  
I feel shattered by the sun  
Now Im shattered by the sun
