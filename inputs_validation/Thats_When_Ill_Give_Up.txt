No heartbeat is always steady  
Angels have halos already  
Please dont think youre proving  
Yourself all the time  
I dont need you to be perfect  
I know the wait will be worth it  
You and me baby were only just  
Learning to shine  
  
You should know  
This my love  
How far Ill go  
Heres when Ill give up  
  
Chorus  
When the sun is coming up at midnight  
When the clocks have all run out of time  
When the snow falls in june  
Thats when Ill give up on loving you  
When the earth is finished spinning around  
When its raining up instead of down  
When a dreamcant come true  
When the rivers all run out of blue  
Thats when Ill give up on loving you  
  
Youll never run out of chances  
I dont need you to have all the answers  
Love isnt something that has to be  
Put to the test  
  
Love like this  
Cant be undone  
Im telling you  
If the day should come  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
As youre walking through the world  
You gotta know  
Ill be with you everywhere you go  
You can spread your wings or run  
Back to my arms  
I will always hold you in my heart baby  
  
Youll always be  
A part of me  
Baby cant you see  
  
Repeat Chorus
