Back to love the minds  
Cries below  
Cries above  
You must pick a side  
Will you choose fear  
Will you choose love  
  
Chorus  
What does it look like  
This orbital ball  
From the fringes of the milky way  
What does it feel like  
This orbital ball  
On the fringes of the milky way  
Raining flavor  
Ive seen flavor flavor love  
  
Whos god then is god  
They all want jurisdiction  
In the book of Eris  
Whos god spread fear  
Spread love  
  
Chorus  
  
Try not to breath when seen  
  
What does it look like  
This orbital ball  
From the fringes of the milky way  
What does it feel like  
This orbital ball  
On the fringes of the milky way  
Raining flavor  
Ive seen flavor  
  
Spread that flavor  
Flavor  
Flavor  
Flavor
