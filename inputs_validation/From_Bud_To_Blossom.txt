To know you  
And sooth your pain with high  
And not even try  
Through feelings and senses  
We stand as one  
And we dont even try  
Stand up push them  
Stand up feel me  
Dont stand alone  
For your time here now  
Is the time you wanted when  
Things seemed so wrong  
So wont you stand up  
And let your standard feelings  
Dissolve away with time  
Allow the clouds to shift  
And your heart to blossom  
Every things gonna be just fine  
Wont you stand up  
And let your standard feelings  
Dissolve away with time  
For your time hear now  
Is the time you wanted  
Let the good things dance inside  
Your head  
To want it and need it  
When taken by  
Complete surprise
