Two room house on an acre lot it aint much but its all theyve got  
Boy sometimes it sure seems a lot to keep up on her own  
A pile of bills and a load of clothes wipin tears from a two year old  
And makin sure suppers on before he makes it home  
In her mind she hears him say Im gonna make it better someday  
  
He will she knows  
Hes gonna build their dreams a little further down the road  
Her faith it shows even if the whole world says he wont  
He will she knows  
  
He spends all day under a hood makin Chevrolets run like they should  
He dont like it much but the pay is good and thats enough to make him stay  
Hes workin lots of overtime cause hes got a little plan in mind  
For a hill off highway 109 that he drives by everyday  
Sometimes moneys hard to save but if anyone can find a way  
  
He will she knows  
Hes gonna build their dreams a little further down the road  
Her faith it shows even if the whole world says he wont  
He will she knows  
  
Every night he holds her close and she believes  
If anyone can make it more than just a dream  
  
He will she knows  
Hes gonna build their dreams a little further down the road  
Her faith it shows even if the whole world says he wont  
He will she knows
