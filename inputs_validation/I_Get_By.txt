Government man keep calling my house  
Talking bout I owe harassing my spouse  
Gotta park my truck on another block  
Cause the subprime loan got my ass in hock  
  
Gotta couple good friends with helping hands  
I need a brand new job with a health care plan  
They closed the plant they stole my job  
And told me crime dont pay unless you ask the mob  
  
So I smoke a little grass drink a little wine  
Watch a little tube try to kill a little time  
And every single day I fall a little more behind  
But Im paying it no mind itll all be fine  
  
I get by got it good got it good  
I barely get by got it good got it good  
I barely get by  
I laugh not to cry  
I stay a little high  
I aint gonna lie  
I barely get by  
I laugh not to cry  
I stay a little high  
I aint gonna lie got it good  
  
Party people in the place to be  
Put your hands in the sky if you barely getting by  
Its on and on till the brake of dawn  
Got to keep the rent paid and the power on  
  
Yes yes yall and it never stops  
I dont trust the government I dont trust no cops  
We dip and we dive and we socialize  
We struggle and we strive just to stay alive  
  
I get by got it good got it good  
I barely get by got it good got it good  
  
When I finally get home I cant relax  
Cause Ive been over worked and Ive been over taxed  
My bank accounts empty all my cards are maxed  
And I aint looking for no pity Im just stating the facts  
  
I voted for some change and its kinda strange  
Now its all I got in my pocket  
I bought a few LEDs now Im growing some trees  
And its a sweet fucking hustle dont knock it  
  
I told yall before I would break the law  
To put some food in my baby girls belly  
Cause the senator man took a bribe in hand  
And went and shipped my job to New Delhi  
  
I get by got it good got it good  
I barely get by got it good got it good  
I barely get by  
I laugh not to cry  
I stay a little high  
I aint gonna lie  
I barely get by  
I laugh not to cry  
I stay a little high  
I aint gonna lie got it good  
  
Party people in the place to be  
Put your hands in the sky if you barely getting by  
Its on and on till the brake of dawn  
Got to keep the rent paid and the power on  
Yes yes yall and it never stops  
I dont trust the government  
I dont trust no cops  
I dip and I dive and I socialize  
I struggle and I strive just to stay alive  
  
I get by got it good got it good  
I barely get by got it good got it good  
I barely get by  
I laugh not to cry  
I stay a little high  
I aint gonna lie  
I barely get by  
I laugh not to cry  
I stay a little high  
I aint gonna lie got it good
