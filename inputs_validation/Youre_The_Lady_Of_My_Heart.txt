You are my teacher I come to school  
I love you baby  
Sometimes Im right and then a fool  
Oh be my lady  
Its not a game I play with you  
Darling I know cause I know the golden rule  
  
Do what you want be what you are  
Youre the lady of my heart  
Oh come oh come to me  
  
I was lonely  
I was so lonely  
I never break apart  
The loving feeling  
My sense is reeling  
Youre the lady of my heart  
  
Sometimes we win sometimes we lose  
I love you baby  
Sometimes we sin I always choose  
Youre my lady  
Always forgive what I have said  
Darling I know  
Well hold together come what made
