I write to claim a lost identity of me  
And I leave a message for you all  
Written here the fear that are my destiny you see  
Come behold madness you never saw  
No love for killer babies  
My blood is written on your walls  
Oh its time I leave you now  
Mama look what you made me  
Oh no you never heard me call  
Oh I know youll hear me now now  
Cause Im gone to meet my maker  
Cause Im locomotive man  
One killer babys come to call  
Cause Im gonna meet my maker  
I am your loco man  
Im coming down to take you all  
I feel the rage that brings  
The fame of that I need  
Ive now a face forever more  
Living with the fears  
That hear those fantasies in me  
Come an see sadness you never saw  
No love for killer babies  
My pain is written on your walls  
Oh its time I leave you now  
Mama look what you made me  
Your locomotive killer calls  
Oh I know you hear me now  
Cause Im gone to meet my maker  
Cause Im locomotive man  
One killer babys come to call  
Cause Im gonna meet my maker  
I am your loco man  
Im coming down to take you all  
Dont wait for me  
Dont hate for me  
Dont ask of what went wrong  
Dont pray for me or wonder why  
Youve known this all along  
Ive sinned for you  
I envy you  
Your pain Ill never know  
I wanted love you gave me none  
Ive come to take you home  
Cause Im gone to meet my maker  
Cause Im locomotive man  
One killer babys come to call  
Cause Im gonna meet my maker  
I am your loco man  
Im coming down to take you all  
Cause Im gone to meet my maker  
Cause Im locomotive man  
One killer babys come to call  
Cause Im gonna meet my maker  
I am your loco man  
Im coming down to take you all  
Oh god Im coming  
Read my words Im coming  
I got a gun Im coming  
You wont hear me coming
