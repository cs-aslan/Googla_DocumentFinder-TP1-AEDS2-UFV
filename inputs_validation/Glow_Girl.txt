Separates and lingerie seven pairs of shoes  
Lots of Woolworths makeup a pair of Black Watch trews  
Your outoftune piano sentimental photographs  
A million little memories a million little laughs  
  
The wing of the airplane has just caught on fire  
I say without reservation we aint getting no higher  
  
All you wanted from me all I had to give  
Nothing matters youll see when in paradise you live  
The plane is diving faster were getting near the ground  
Nobody is screaming no one makes a sound  
  
Its a girl Mrs Walker its a girl Repeat x4
