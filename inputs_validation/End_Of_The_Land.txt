When too many demands have destroyed all my plans  
Going down to end of the land  
If I have to drive all night just to feel all right  
Going down to the end of the land  
  
When it gets out of hand and I fail to agree  
Just whats in it for me  
Going down to the sea  
  
Then Ive got to run towards the setting sun  
Going down to the end of the land  
  
When it gets out of hand and I beg to disagree  
Just whats in it for me  
Get back down to the sea  
  
And then Ive got to run to the setting sun  
Going down to the end of the land  
If Ive got to drive all night till the morning light  
Im going down to the end of the land  
  
Ba da da da da ba da da da da da  
Going down going down going down to the end of the land  
Ba da da da da ba da da da da  
Going down to the end of the land
