Shes out of her mind  
like the wind in the storm  
Oh like the ocean in the dawn  
as it disappears with the riptide  
  
Shes out of her mind  
shes pulled away by the moon  
Shes ripped from her sleep  
as the cold luna sweep gains control  
  
Ooohhh what you gonna do with your emotions  
Ah ones you barely recognize  
In your sleep I heard your screaming ooohhh  
This is not voluntary This is not voluntary  
If this is life Id rather die  
  
In the riptide in the riptide  
  
Shes out of her mind riptide  
like a muscle that swells  
You know when you trip  
whether youre well or sick your body aches  
  
Shes out with the tide  
gone to a prisoners dance  
Where a monkeys her date  
eating limbs off a plate with a spoon  
  
Ooohhh what you gonna do with your emotions  
said the seagull to the loon  
What you gonna do with your emotions  
  
She said Please wake me up  
She said Dont touch me now  
She said I wish I was dead  
  
With the riptide  
  
Shes out of her mind  
riptide you always win  
It happens over and over again  
riptide  
  
Shes out of her mind  
like a hurricanes rain  
She does not stand a chance  
at this luna dance riptide  
  
I was thinking of Van Goghs last painting  
the wheatfields and the crows  
Is that perhaps what youve been feeling  
When you see the ground  
as you fall from the shy  
As the floors disappears from beneath your feet riptide  
  
Shes going out of her mind  
out with the tide  
out of her mind  
riptide  
  
Shes going out of her mind  
with the riptide  
Shes going out of her mind  
ah riptide
