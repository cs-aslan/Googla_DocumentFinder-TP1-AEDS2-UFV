Well I flew in on a plane yesterday  
Nose pressed to the glass I watched us come into the bay  
And then I asked myself why I left this place  
Seeking solace in a change but now its changed my face  
And I know  
Theyll say  
Theres something to be said for trying out new things  
But I know  
Ill say  
Something Ive been missing here along the way  
Oh yeah  
  
But theres just something bout coming home to California  
Yeah theres something bout coming home  
  
And its so hot outside that I could fry an egg  
But Im eating Taco Bell and gettin high instead  
My eyes spread wide I smoke a cigarette  
Watch the sun roll by with nothing in my head  
And I know  
Theyll say  
Something to be said for curiosity  
And I know  
Ill say  
Ill save my west coast dreaming for some other day  
Oh yeah  
  
Because theres something bout coming home to California  
Yeah theres something bout coming home to California  
I said theres something bout coming home to California  
Oh theres something bout coming home  
Yeah  
  
I said I said  
Theres something in the way you move  
Something in the Daily News  
And theres something in the air I breathe  
Something in the things I see  
And theres something in these orange walls  
The Northern California falls  
Theres something in the clothes she wears  
And something in the way she stares at you  
  
Oh and Im so far away from home and I need it  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Because theres something bout coming home to California  
Yeah theres something bout coming home to California  
Oh theres something bout coming home to California  
Theres something bout going home
