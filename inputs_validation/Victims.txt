The victims we know so well  
They shine in your eyes  
When they kiss and tell  
Strange places we never see  
But youre always there  
Like a ghost in my dream  
And I keep on telling you  
Please dont do the things you do  
When you do those things  
Pull my puppet strings  
I have the strangest void for you  
  
We love and we never tell  
What places our hearts in the wishing well  
Love leads us into the stream  
And its sink or swim  
Like its always been  
And I keep on loving you  
Its the only thing to do  
When the angel sings  
There are greater things  
Can I give them all to you  
  
Pull the strings of emotion  
Take a ride into unknown pleasure  
Feel like a child on a dark night  
Wishing there was some kind of heaven  
I could be warm with you smiling  
Hold out your hand for a while  
The victims we know them so well  
  
The victims we know so well  
They shine in your eyes when they kiss and tell  
Strange places we never see  
But youre always there like a ghost in my dream  
And I keep on telling you  
Please dont do the things you do  
When you do those things pull my puppet strings  
I have the strangest void for you  
  
Show my heart some devotion  
Push aside those that whisper never  
Feel like a child on a dark night  
Wishing there were some kind of heaven  
I could be warm with you smiling  
Hold out your hand for a while  
The victims we know them so well so well
