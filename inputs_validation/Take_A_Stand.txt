I see you hide  
Do you have pride  
Afraid to share whats inside  
Youve been walked right by  
A real nice guy  
Overlooked and shoved aside  
Cant hear your voice back in the crowd  
Move up fornt and shout out loud   
Take a stand   
Take a stand say what you feel  
Be who you want but be for real  
Voice your opinion  
Dont just sit still  
Speak your mind at your free will  
Take a stand   
Stand your ground  
Dont let the world push you around  
Take a stand   
Stand your ground  
Dont let the world push you around
