Oh I took a wrong turn it was the right turn  
My turn to have me a ball  
Boys at the shop told me just where to stop  
If I wanted to play for it all  
I didnt know Id find her on daytime TV  
My whole world lies waiting behind door number three  
  
I chose my apparel wore a beer barrel  
And they rolled me to the very first row  
I held a big sign that said Kiss me Im a baker  
and Monty I sure need the dough  
Then I grabbed that sucker by the throat  
Until he called on me  
Cause my whole world lies waiting behind door number three  
  
And I dont want what Jays got on his table  
Or the box Carol Merrill points to on the floor  
No Ill hold out just as long as I am able  
Until I can unlock that lucky door  
Well shes no big deal to most folks  
But shes everything to me  
Cause my whole world lies waiting behind door number three  
  
Oh Monty Monty Monty I am walking down your hall  
God be I lost my seat but Im not a man to crawl  
No I didnt get rich you son of a bitch  
Ill be back just wait and see  
Cause my whole world lies waiting behind door number three  
Yes my whole world lies waiting behind door number three
