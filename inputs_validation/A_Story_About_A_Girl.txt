Are you waking up slowly  
Nothing but lonely  
Are you waking up  
Holding holding your breath  
Are you looking for something  
I promise you one thing  
I promise Ill always always  
Be there  
  
Baby girl stand up and fight  
This is not some paradise

Are you waking up slowly  
Nothing but lonely  
Are you waking up  
Holding holding your breath  
Are you looking for something  
I promise you one thing  
I promise Ill always always  
Be there  
  
With all my faith  
And all my heart  
And all those simple things you are  
  
I know  
Its stuck inside your head  
Youre alone  
You better get used to it  
And I know  
The feeling has to end  
Youre strong  
It sucks you in again  
And youre lost  
You cant make any sense  
This world  
It tears you limb from limb  
And hold on  
Youre nothing but the best

Nothing but lonely  
Are you waking up  
Holding holding your breath  
Are you looking for something  
I promise you one thing

And all my heart  
And all those simple things you are  
  
With all my faith  
And all my heart  
And all those simple things you are
