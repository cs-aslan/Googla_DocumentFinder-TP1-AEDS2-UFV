Ive dragged my feet  
Across the seat  
And jumped out the passenger side  
The only thing worth looking for  
Is what you find inside  
But that had not yet appeared  
Lost invisible here  
Tel Aviv and Agadir  
Taroudant or Olomouc  
Before I learned to see  
The vanishing point appear  
  
I looked for you and everywhere  
I looked for you and everywhere  
  
There is a calm I havent come to yet  
I spent half my life figuring what comes next  
I telescoped in  
Ill finally win  
Ill finally win the prize  
That now my eyes see  
A comics perfect timing squeezed  
Im headfirst fighting everything  
The crushing force of memory  
Erasing all Ive been  
The vanishing point appears  
  
I looked for you and everywhere  
I looked for you and everywhere  
Tell me why youre here  
I came to disappear  
  
Look at this face  
Can you believe it  
Am I living in a beautiful vacuum  
Because I cant see it  
The vanishing point appears  
  
I looked for you and everywhere  
I looked for you and everywhere  
Tell me why youre here  
I came to disappear  
Tell me why youre here  
I came to disappear  
I came to disappear
