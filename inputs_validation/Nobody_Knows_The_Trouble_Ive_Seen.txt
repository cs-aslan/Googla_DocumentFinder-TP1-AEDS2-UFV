Nobody knows the trouble Ive seen  
Nobody knows but Jesus  
Nobody knows the trouble Ive seen  
Glory Hallelujah  
  
Sometimes Im up  
And sometimes Im down  
Yes Lord you know sometimes Im almost to the ground  
Oh yes Lord still  
  
Nobody knows the trouble Ive seen  
Nobody knows but Jesus  
Nobody knows the trouble Ive seen  
Glory Hallelujah  
  
If you get there before I do  
Oh yes Lord dont forget to  
Tell all my friends Im coming too  
Oh yes Lord still  
  
Nobody knows the trouble Ive seen  
Nobody knows but Jesus  
Nobody knows the trouble Ive seen  
Glory Hallelujah  
  
Although you see me  
Goin on so oh yes  
I have my trials here below  
Oh yes Lord
