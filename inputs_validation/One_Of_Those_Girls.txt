La la la la la la la  
  
I know your kind of girl  
You only care about one thing  
Who youve seen or where youve been  
Whos got money  
  
I see that look in your eyes  
It tells a million lies  
But deep inside I know why  
Youre talking to him  
  
I know what youre all about  
I really hope he figures it out  
  
Chorus  
Shes one of those girls  
Theyre nothing but trouble  
Just one look and now youre seeing double  
Before you know it shell be gone  
Off to the next one  
Shes so good that you wont see it comin  
Shell take you for a ride and youll be left with nothing  
Youll be broke and shell be gone  
Off to the next one  
  
Oh oh oh  
Off to the next one  
Oh oh yeah yeah oh oh  
  
Shes gonna be the end of you  
At least thats what they say  
Its been a while  
Youre in denial  
And now its too late  
The way she looks makes you hide  
All the warning signs  
Cause her blond hair her blue eyes  
Makes you wanna die  
  
I know what shes all about  
I really hope you figure it out  
  
Chorus  
  
You know its a game you know its a game  
She keeps playing around with your head  
Playing around with your head  
Shes so insane so insane  
Shes the one to blame shes the one to blame  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh oh oh  
Off to the next one  
Oh oh yeah yeah  
Off to the next one
