Ive been down so many roads before  
Ive seen it all and Ive seen a whole lot more  
I never had a feeling like this  
I never lost my heart with one kiss  
I feel it in my heart feel it in my soul  
Girl you got me now got to let you know I wanna  
  
Shout it to the world  
Sing it to the mountains  
Cause I cant stop loving you  
Take it to the street  
Tell the world about it  
Ive found a love so deep  
Shout it to the world  
Nothings going to stop us now  
I cant stop loving you  
  
Couldnt believe the magic in your eyes  
One look at you and I was hypnotised  
Dont know how all my dreams came true  
I only know that heaven sent you  
I feel it in my heart  
I feel it in my soul  
Girl you knock me out I just wanna lose control  
Ive gotta  
  
Shout it to the world  
Sing it to the mountains  
Cause I cant stop loving you  
Take it to the street  
Tell the World about it  
Ive found a love so deep  
Shout it to the World  
Nothings going to stop us now  
I cant stop loving you  
  
Its so mysterious I feel delirious Im touching the sky  
This thing youre giving me your spirits lifting me  
Im feeling so high  
Cant stop this feeling now my heart is spinning round  
Im losing control  
Its like a miracles Its unbelievable  
Im ready to go  
  
Shout it to the World  
Sing it to the mountains  
Cause I cant stop loving you  
Take it to the street  
Tell the World about it  
Ive found a love so deep  
Shout it to the World  
Nothings going to stop us now  
I cant stop loving you
