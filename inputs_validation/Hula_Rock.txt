Hawaiis callin  
When I hear the rhythm of the hula rock hula rock  
  
In the South Pacific where the trade winds blow  
They thought that the hula was a little bit slow  
So they stepped it up with a go go go  
And thats where they got that rock and roll  
  
In the South Pacific now theyre gettin with it  
On the beach at Waikaki  
And its a lula when they try the hula  
With a rockin rollin beat  
  
Take me back where the trade winds blow  
To the land of the hula where they never get old  
And the gooney birds dance with a go go go  
And the natives join in with a rock and roll  
  
With me its a riddle how they break in the middle  
And yet stay on the beat  
But I want to sway with em when I hear the rhythm  
Of the rockin hula beat  
  
Rockin and arollin in Waikaki  
Rockin and arollin in Waikaki  
Rockin and arollin in Waikaki  
Rockin and arollin in Waikaki  
Dont stop just let her rock
