Snows falling down as you step out of your car  
Presents in your arms and youve traveled far  
Someone opens the door with a smile on their face  
And you know youve come to the right place  
Family nestled by the fire  
Christmas hopes to inspire  
Loved ones by your side  
You know youll kiss your babies goodnight  
At Christmas Christmas  
No matter who you are  
How far youve come  
This is where you belong  
At Christmas  
Memories round the Christmas tree  
Are the sweetest ones that remain with me  
Its a comfort deep inside  
Though you cant stop the race of time  
To know that Christmas will always be  
Family nestled by the fire  
A Christmas hope will be inspired  
Loved ones by your side  
You know youll kiss your baby goodnight  
At Christmas Christmas  
No matter who you are or how far youve come  
At Christmas  
Cant you feel it changin  
Sense the anticipation  
You can tell were almost there  
Precious time were takin  
Memories were makin  
Theres Christmas in the air  
Now this is what Christmas means to me  
Being together with your family  
And the wise men who have followed that star  
To where our baby Jesus lay  
Family nestled all around  
Baby Jesus asleep so sound  
And His star shined so bright  
On that very first holy night  
At Christmas Christmas  
No matter who you are or how far youve come  
this is where you belong  
At Christmas Christmas
