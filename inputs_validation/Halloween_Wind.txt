The wind is gonna be scary  
Scary this Halloween  
Itll sound just like a thousand ghosts and goblins  
When they scream  
  
You can hear it howling  
Shrieking in the sky  
Itll make your mamma hide her head  
And make your daddy cry  
  
And it starts down low  
Gets a little higher  
Gets a little higher  
Gets really high  
Goes back low  
Gets a little bit higher  
Gets a little higher  
Gets really high  
  
The wind will make you nervous  
  
And it starts down low  
Gets a little higher  
Gets a little higher  
Gets really high  
Goes back low  
Gets a little bit higher  
Gets a little higher  
Gets really high  
  
The wind is gonna be chilly  
  
And it starts down low  
Gets a little higher  
Gets a little higher  
Gets really high  
Goes back low  
Gets a little bit higher  
Gets a little higher  
Gets really high  
  
The wind is gonna be scary
