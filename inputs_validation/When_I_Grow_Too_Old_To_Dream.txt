When I grow too old to dream to g  
  
We have been gay going our way  
Life has been beautiful we have been young  
After youve gone life will go on  
Like an old song that weve sung  
Chorus  
When I grow too old to dream  
Ill have you to remember  
When I grow too old to dream  
Your love will live in my heart  
So kiss me my sweet and so let us part  
And when I grow too old to dream  
That kiss will live in my heart  
  
After youve gone life will go on  
Time will be tenderly melting our tears  
Yet will I find you inmy mind  
Beckoning over the years  
  
repeat chorus
