When Im out walking I strut my stuff yeah Im so strung out  
Im high as a kite I just might stop to check you out  
Let me go on like I blister in the sun  
Let me go on big hands I know your the one  
Body and beats I stain my sheets I dont even know why  
My girlfriend shes at the end she is starting to cry  
Let me go on like I blister in the sun  
Let me go on big hands I know your the one
