We play these parlour games  
We play at make believe  
When we get to the part where I say that Im going to leave  
Everybody loves a happy ending but we dont even try  
We go straight past pretending  
To the part where everybody loves to cry  
  
Chorus  
Indoor fireworks  
Can still burn your fingers  
Indoor fireworks  
We swore we were safe as houses  
Theyre not so spectacular  
They dont burn up in the sky  
But they can dazzle or delight  
Or bring a tear  
When the smoke gets in your eyes  
  
You were the spice of life  
The gin in my vermouth  
And though the sparks would fly  
I thought our love was fireproof  
Sometimes wed fight in public darling  
With very little cause  
But different kinds of sparks would fly  
When we got on our own behind closed doors  
  
Chorus  
  
Its time to tell the truth  
These things have to be faced  
My fuse is burning out  
And all that powders gone to waste  
Dont think for a moment dear that well ever be through  
Ill build a bonfire of my dreams  
And burn a broken effigy of me and you  
  
Chorus
