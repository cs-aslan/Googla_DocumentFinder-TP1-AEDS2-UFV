Theres no need to hide anything  
Baby just know what you bring  
Will always be enough  
All of those things that you do  
Are the reasons that I fell for you  
And why I believe in us  
  
Chorus  
Baby shoot straight from your heart  
Youll never miss your mark  
Baby always shoot straight from your heart  
Let truth be the path that you choose  
There aint no way we can lose  
Baby always shoot straight from your heart  
  
Were gonna make some mistakes  
Cause baby I sure aint no saint  
I swear Im in for the long haul  
It doesnt matter how far  
I love you just how you are  
I will answer when you call  
  
Chorus
