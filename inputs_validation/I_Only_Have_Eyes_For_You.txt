Are the stars out tonight  
I dont know if its cloudy or bright  
Cause I only have eyes for you dear  
  
The moon may be high  
But I cant see a thing in the sky  
Cause I only have eyes for you  
  
I dont know if were in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue  
You are here so am I  
  
Maybe millions of people go by  
But they all disappear from view  
And I only have eyes for you  
  
Yeah are the stars out tonight  
I dont know if its cloudy or bright  
Cause I only have eyes for you dear  
  
Babe the moon may be high  
But I cant see a thing in the sky  
Cause I only have eyes for you  
  
Oh baby I dont know if were in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue  
You are here so am I  
  
Maybe a million people go by  
But they all disappear from view  
Yes mama I only have eyes for you
