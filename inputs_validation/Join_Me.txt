Baby join me in death  
Baby join me in death  
Baby join me in death  
  
We are so young  
Our lives have just begun  
But already were considering  
Escape from this world  
  
And weve waited for so long  
For this moment to come  
Were so anxious to be together  
Together in death  
  
Wont you die tonight for love  
Baby join me in death  
Wont you die  
Baby join me in death  
Wont you die tonight for love  
Baby join me in death  
  
This world is a cruel place  
And were here only to lose  
So before life tears us apart let  
Death bless me with you  
  
Wont you die tonight for love  
Baby join me in death  
Wont you die  
Baby join me in death  
Wont you die tonight for love  
Baby join me in death  
  
This life aint worth living  
This life aint worth living  
This life aint worth living  
This life aint worth living  
  
Wont you die tonight for love  
Baby join me in death  
Wont you die  
Baby join me in death  
Wont you die tonight for love  
Baby join me in death  
  
Baby join me in death
