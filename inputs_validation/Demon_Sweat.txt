The sky dripped in a demon sweat the night she left  
Wrapped up in a blanket and Im feelin wet  
They said she flew from the goals in her life  
Then she wet like blood from a knife  
Im here and its all so clear now  
  
The wind flows and its blowing cold and Im still here  
Gripping onto whats not around  
Now its all so clear to me now  
Now I know sometimes I try a bit too hard  
And I cant let go of you  
Booboopdeedoo  
Boobooboopdeedoo  
Boopdeedoo
