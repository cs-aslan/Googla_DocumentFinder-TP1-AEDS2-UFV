Ive got war on my mind blood on my hands  
And love on my head  
So open your hands open your mouth  
Let it be said  
You know Ive got it made in my mind  
Dont waste my time its not going to change  
So say what you want spit it out loud  
  
And Ill pay no attention  
  
Theyre gonna tell you where to walk  
When to smile and just what to say  
They say have your own flu  
Make your own mind  
And dont make waves  
But if you got a handful of change  
Dont throw it away its gonna come  
So say what you want suck all my  
Suck on my brain
