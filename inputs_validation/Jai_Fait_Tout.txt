Jai fait tout jai fait tout  
Ce que jai pu  
Jai fait tout jai fait tout  
Ce que jai pu  
I have seen some trouble  
Been around the say  
Rode the streetcar of desire and I paid  
And if you want a witness  
I will testify  
To what I saw through a wandering eye  
Cause nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
I heard all about it  
You dont need an alibi  
There was no medicine I did not try  
You lost your Mona Lisa  
Got burned by Jezebel  
You can always draw water from my well  
Cause nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
Jai fait tout jai fait tout jai fait tout  
I will give everything I am to you  
Jai fait tout jai fait tout  
You know its true  
Jai fait tout jai fait tout jai fait tout  
You can go and leave me  
But youll come back for more  
I know where all your old secrets are stored  
My history is written  
My heart is still pure  
You crave redemption and I got the cure  
Cause nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do
