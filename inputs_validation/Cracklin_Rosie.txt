Yea Cracklin Rosie get on board  
Were gonna ride til there aint no more to go  
Takin it slow Lord dont you know  
Happily a time when the poor mans let be  
  
Hitchin on a twilight train  
Aint nothin here that I care to take along  
Maybe a song to sing when Im long  
Dont mean to say please said old man Im happy too  
  
Oh I love my Rosie child you got the way to make me happy  
You and me we go in style  
Cracklin Rose youre a storebought woman  
You make me sing like a guitar hummin  
  
Hang on to me girl our song keeps runnin on  
Play it now Play it now Play it now my lady  
Cracklin Rosie make me smile  
God itll last for an hour well thats alright  
  
We got all night to set the world right  
Find us a dream and dont ask no questions Yea  
  
Chorus  
Bah bah bah bah bah  
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah  
Bah bah bah bah  
Bah bah bah bah bah  
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah BAH
