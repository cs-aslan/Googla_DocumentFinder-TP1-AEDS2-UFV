I moved out to Langley recently  
With a plain and simple dream  
Wanna infiltrate some thirdworld place  
And topple their regime  
  
Those men in black with their matching suitcases  
Where everythings on a needtoknow basis  
Agents got that swagger  
Everyone so cloak and dagger  
  
Im feelin nervous but Im really kinda wishing  
For an undercover mission  
  
Thats when the red alert came on the radio  
And I put my earpiece on  
Got my dark sunglasses on  
And I had my weapon drawn  
  
So I get my handcuffs  
My cyanide pills  
My classified dossier  
  
Tappin the phones like yeah  
Shreddin the files like yeah  
And then I rised all the enemy spies  
Ive got to neutralize today  
  
Yeeeaaahhh its a party in the CIA  
Yeeeaaahhh its a party in the CIA  
  
Ive done a couple of crazy things  
That have almost gotten me dismissed  
Like terminate some head of state  
Who wasnt even on my list  
  
Burn that microfilm buddy will you  
Id tell you why but then Id have to kill you  
You need a quickie confession  
Well start a water boarding session  
  
No hurry on the south American dictator  
Ill assassinate him later  
Thats when he walked right in my laser sights  
And my silencer was on and my silencer was on  
And another targets gone  
  
Yeah weve got our black ops all over the world  
From Kazakhstan to Bombay  
Payin the bribes like yeah  
Pluggin the leaks like yeah  
Interrogating the scum of the earth  
Well break them by the break of day  
  
Yeeeaaahhh its a party in the CIA  
Yeeeaaahhh its a party in the CIA  
  
Need a country to stabilize stabilize  
Look no further were your guys were your guys  
Weve got snazzy suits and ties suits and ties  
And a better dental plan than the FBIs  
  
Better put your hands up and get in the van  
Or else youll get blown away  
Stagin a coup like yeah  
Brainwashin moles like yeah  
We only torture the folks we dont like  
Youre probably going to be OK  
  
Yeeeaaahhh its a party in the CIA  
Yeeeaaahhh its a party in the CIA
