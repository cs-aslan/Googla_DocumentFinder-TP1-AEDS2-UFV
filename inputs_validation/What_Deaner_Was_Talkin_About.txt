The wash is out its hanging up  
And all I have is nothing  
Nothing to do nothing to say  
I think I must be dreaming  
  
The sun comes up and Im all washed out  
Is this what Deaner was talkin about  
I dont think I will ever return again my friend  
  
If I was king Id wear a ring  
And never hurt my people  
Id stay alert and dress to kill  
I might even slip you something  
  
The sun comes up and Im all washed out  
Is this what Deaner was talkin about  
I dont think I will ever return again my friend  
  
The sun comes up and Im all washed out  
Is this what Deaner was talkin about  
I dont think I will ever return again my friend  
I do not think I will ever return again my friend 2x
