When I was a hitchhiker on the road  
I had to count on you  
But you needed me to ease the load  
And for conversation too  
Or judge you just pass on through  
  
You didnt see me in Toronto  
When I first tried out some hash  
Smoked through a pen and Id do it again  
But I didnt have the cash  
I didnt have the cash  
  
Then I tried amphetamines  
And my head was in a glass  
Taped underneath the speedometer wires  
Of my 48 Buicks dash  
But I knew that wouldnt last  
  
Then came California  
When I first saw open water  
In the land of opportunity  
I knew I was getting hotter  
I knew I was getting hotter  
  
But the neon lights  
And the endless nights  
Fame took me by surprise  
The doctor gave me Valium  
But I still couldnt close my eyes  
I still couldnt close my eyes  
  
Then came paranoia  
And it ran away with me  
I would not sign my autograph  
Or appear on TV  
Or see or be seen  
  
Living in the country  
Looked good to me  
Smoking grass while the summer passed  
In the real organic sea  
Where everything was green  
  
Then we had a kid and we split apart  
I was living on the road  
And a little cocaine went a long long way  
To ease that different load  
And my head did explode  
My head did explode  
  
I thought I was an Aztec  
Or a runner in Peru  
I could build such beautiful buildings  
To house the chosen few  
Like an Inca from Peru  
  
How many years have come and gone  
Like friends and enemies  
I tried leave my past behind  
But its catching up with me  
Its catching up with me  
  
I dont know how Im standin here  
Livin in my life  
Im thankful for my children  
And my faithful wife
