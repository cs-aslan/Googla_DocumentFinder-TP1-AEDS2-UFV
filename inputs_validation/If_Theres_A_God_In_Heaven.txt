Lyrics by bernie taupin  
Available on the album blue moves  
  
  
Torn from their families  
Mothers go hungry  
To feed their children  
But children go hungry  
Theres so many big men  
Theyre out making millions  
When povertys profits  
Just blame the children  
  
If theres a god in heaven  
Whats he waiting for  
If he cant hear the children  
Then he must see the war  
But it seems to me  
That he leads his lambs  
To the slaughter house  
And not the promised land  
  
  
Dying for causes  
They dont understand  
Weve been taking their futures  
Right out of their hands  
They need the handouts  
To hold back the tears  
Theres so many crying  
But so few that hear  
  
  
If theres a god in heaven  
Well whats he waiting for  
  
  
If theres a god in heaven  
Whats he waiting for
