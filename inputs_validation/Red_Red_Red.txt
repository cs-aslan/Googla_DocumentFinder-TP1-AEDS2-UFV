I dont understand about complementary colors  
And what they say  
Side by side they both get white  
Together they both get gray  
  
But hes been pretty much yellow  
And Ive been cryin blue  
But all I can see is  
Red red red red red now  
What am I to do  
  
I dont understand about  
Diamonds and why men buy them  
Whats so impressive about a diamond  
Except the mining  
  
And its dangerous work  
Trying to get to you too  
And I think if I didnt have to  
Kill kill kill kill kill kill myself doing it  
Maybe I wouldnt listen so much to you  
  
Ive been watching all the time  
And I still cant find the track  
And I want to know is it okay  
Is it just fine  
Was it my fault  
Is it my lack  
  
I dont understand about  
The weather outside  
The harbinger to the words  
That somebody lied  
  
Theres solace a bit for submitting  
To the fitfully cryptically true  
Whats happened has happened  
Whats coming is already on its way  
With a role for me to play  
  
I dont understand  
Ill never understand  
But Im trying to understand  
Theres nothing else I can do
