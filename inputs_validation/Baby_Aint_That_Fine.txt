Im gonna be your baby  
And Im gonna be your guy  
Were gonna cook some lovin  
Its gonna sizzle and fry  
Baby aint that fine  
Baby aint that fine  
  
Im gonna give you lovin  
And Ill say take your time  
Well be rockin and swingin  
Higher than a Georgia pine  
Baby aint that fine  
Baby aint that fine  
  
I get a little bitty tingle  
Up and down my spine  
My head gets dizzy  
Every time you say youre mine  
  
The birds are gonna be singin  
The bells are gonna chime  
Were gonna love each other  
And the sun is gonna shine  
Baby aint that fine  
Baby aint that fine  
  
I get a little bitty tingle  
Up and down my spine  
My head gets dizzy  
Every time you say youre mine  
  
The birds are gonna be singin  
The bells are gonna chime  
Were gonna love each other  
And the sun is gonna shine  
Baby aint that fine  
Baby aint that fine  
  
Baby aint that fine  
Baby aint that fine
