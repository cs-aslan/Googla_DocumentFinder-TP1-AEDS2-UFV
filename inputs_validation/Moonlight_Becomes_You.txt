Moonlight becomes you it goes with your hair  
You certainly know the right thing to wear  
Moonlight becomes you Im thrilled at the sight  
And I could get so romantic tonight  
  
Youre all dressed up to go dreaming  
Now dont tell me Im wrong  
And what a night to go dreaming  
Mind if I tag along  
  
If I say I love you  
I want you to know  
Its not just because theres moonlight  
Although moonlight becomes you so  
  
Youre all dressed up to go dreaming  
Now dont tell me Im wrong  
And what a night to go dreaming  
Mind if I tag along  
  
If I say I love you  
I want you to know  
Its not just because theres moonlight  
Although moonlight becomes you so
