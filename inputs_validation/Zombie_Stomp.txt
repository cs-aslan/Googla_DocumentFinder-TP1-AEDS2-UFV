I dont need no doctor  
But I need something to kill the pain  
Dont know what Im after  
But the pressure driving me insane  
Searching for a different ride  
Had a funny feeling I cant hide  
Hey hey do the zombie stomp  
Why cant they just let me be  
Alone without the misery  
Hey hey do the zombie zombie stomp  
Flirting with disaster  
Morning after killing me again  
Hiding from the laughter  
And the demons dancing round my brain  
Always dancing on thin ice  
I guess Ill have to pay the price  
Hey hey do the zombie stomp  
Thinking how it could have been  
If I had never let them in  
Hey hey do the zombie zombie stomp  
Take me to the doctor  
cause I feel it coming on again  
Dont know where Im going  
cause I guess I dont know where Ive been  
Looking for a different ride  
Always dancing on thin ice  
Hey hey do the zombie stomp  
Thinking how it could have been  
If I had never let them in  
Hey hey do the zombie zombie stomp
