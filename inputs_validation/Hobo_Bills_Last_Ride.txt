Riding on an Eastbound freight train speeding through the night  
Hobo Bill a railroad bum was fighting for his life  
The sadness of his eyes revealed the torture of his soul  
He raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the cold  
  
Hohoo Booo Billie  
  
No warm lights flickered around him no blankets there to fold  
Nothing but the howling wind and the driving rain so cold  
When he heard a whistle blowing in a dreamy kind of way  
The hobo seemed contented for he smiled there where he lay  
  
Hohoo Booo Billie  
  
Outside the rain was fallin on that lonesome boxcar door  
But the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor  
As the train sped through the darkness and the raging storm outside  
No one knew that Hobo Bill was taking his last ride  
  
It was early in the mornin when they raised the hobos head  
The smile still lingered on his face but Hobo Bill was dead  
There was no mothers longin to soothe his weary soul  
For he was just a railroad bum who died out in the cold
