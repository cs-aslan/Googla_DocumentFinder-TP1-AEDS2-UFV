Who dyou think youre kidding  
You walk out on my life  
Now youre back again  
And you think that nothings changed  
Denying superstitions defying traditions  
It seems like weve been through this before  
Now its gonna be like starting all over again  
Oh baby dont you know  
Its gonna be like starting all over again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you again  
You know I love to feel you  
Reach the depth of my heart  
Deep inside of me  
The way it used to do  
Ive had so many lovers  
Noone could ever tame me  
They all seem to rub me the wrong way  
They always get my back up  
Noone seems to do the things that you do for me  
And now that youre back in my life again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you again
