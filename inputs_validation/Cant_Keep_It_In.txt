Oh I cant keep it in cant keep it in  
Ive gotta let it out  
  
Ive got to show the world worlds got to see  
See all the love love thats in me I said  
Why walk alone Why worry when its warm over here  
You got so much to say say what you mean  
Mean what youre thinkin and think anything  
Oh why why must you waste youre life away  
  
Youve got to live for today then let it go oh  
Lover I want to spend this time with you  
Theres nothing I wouldnt do if you let me know  
And I cant keep it in I cant hide it and  
I cant lock it away  
  
Im up for your love love heats my blood  
Blood spins my head and my head falls in love  
No I cant keep it in I cant keep it in  
Ive gotta let it out  
  
Ive got to show the world worlds got to know  
Know of the love love that lies low  
So why cant you say if you know then why cant you say  
Youve got too much deceit and deceit kills the light  
Light needs has to shine  
I said shine light shine light  
Love that no way to live you life  
  
You allow too much to go by and that wont do no  
Lover I want to have you here by my side  
Now dont you run dont you hide  
while Im with you now I cant keep it in  
I cant keep it in I gotta let it out  
  
Ive gotta show the world worldss got to see see all the love  
love thats in me I said why walk alone  
Why worry when its warm over here  
You got so much to say say what you mean  
Mean what youre thinkin and thing anything why not  
Now why why why not
