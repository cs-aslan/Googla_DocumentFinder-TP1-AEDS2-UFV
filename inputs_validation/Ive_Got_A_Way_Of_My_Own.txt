Everything round them is spinning and turning  
But they cant understand  
People around me just never stop learning  
About the things that Ive planned  
  
Chorus  
Ive got a way way of my own  
Just look around them they better start thinking  
People will lend a hand  
They better watch it or else theyll start sinking  
With their heads in the sand  
  
Ive got a way way of my own  
Come back when youve time for the world  
You must think theyd dont need anyone no no  
Come back when youve time for the world  
They might find what theyre looking for  
They might find what theyre looking for  
  
I cant believe that the reason theyre giving  
Will entice me to go  
Why they deny me the right to start living  
Ill just never know  
  
Ive got a way way of my own  
  
Chorus
