They say I need some rogaine to put in my hair  
Work it out at the gym to fit my underwear  
Oakley makes the shades to transform a tool  
Youd hate for the kids to think that youve lost your cool  
  
Chorus  
Ima do the things that I wanna do  
I aint got a thing to prove to you  
Ill eat my candy with the pork and beans  
Excuse my manners if I make a scene  
I aint gonna wear the clothes that you like  
Im fine and dandy with the me inside  
One look in the mirror and Im tickled pink  
I dont give a hoot about what you think  
  
Everyone likes to dance to a happy song  
With a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along  
Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the charts  
Maybe if I work with him I can perfect the art  
  
Chorus  
  
No I dont care  
I dont care  
I dont care  
I dont care  
I dont care  
I dont care  
  
Chorus
