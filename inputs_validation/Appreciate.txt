Lift up your head  
And remember what your life is  
Dont have to give it all away  
When youre left for dead  
In the middle of a crisis  
You must appreciate the day  
  
Theres something there  
But youre frightened to invite it  
Beware of pushing it away  
Show that you care  
And be certain you dont fight it  
You must appreciate the day  
  
She says you dont give back what you take  
She got evidence you dont appreciate her love  
She says its all a show and nogo  
You drop everything give back  
Reciprocate her love
