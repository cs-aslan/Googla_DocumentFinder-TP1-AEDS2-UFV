Ive searched through each moment of each passing hour  
But your memory grows stronger I find  
Oh they tell me in time Ill forget you  
But somehow I cant find the time  
  
They tell me in time Ill find another  
An happiness again will be mine  
Oh they tell me in time Ill forget you  
But somehow I cant find the time  
  
Somethin each moment reminds me of you  
You always end up on my mind  
Oh they tell me in time Ill forget you  
But somehow I cant find the time  
  
Somethin each moment reminds me of you  
You always end up on my mind  
Oh they tell me in time Ill forget you  
But somehow I cant find the time
