While in that gay tropic isle  
I first saw that maiden smile  
Though I had failed in the past  
I said this is true love at last  
But then she whispered to me  
That our love never could be  
  
Chorus  
Destiny oh when will I see the day  
Hopelessly Ive wandered so long this way  
This could never be she said pleadingly  
Dont ever love me Im just fancyfree  
This could never be she said pleadingly  
Dont ever love me  
  
My love was motion and grace  
The moonlight soft on her face  
I held her close in my arms  
My heart was quick to her charms  
But then I saw in her glance  
It was just an evenings romance  
  
Chorus  
  
This could never be she said pleadingly  
Dont ever love me
