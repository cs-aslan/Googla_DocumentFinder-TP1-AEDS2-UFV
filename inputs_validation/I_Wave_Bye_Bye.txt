Just outside the harbour  
All the ships is asleep  
Baby one cool watch me  
Walks the lonely beach  
And way out on the water  
The ship is under sail  
baby where the star light  
and the dreamer in her trill  
  
Ill wave bye bye  
I pray God speak  
I wish you lovely weather  
More luck than you and me  
Youll only sail in circles  
So theres no need to cry  
Oh I see you again one day  
And then Ill wave bye bye  
  
The sailing ship reminds me of a certain girl  
Who left a certain dreamer to sail into her world  
Our very friendly postcard from very far away  
But they just remind me of a certain day  
  
When Ill wave bye bye  
I pray God speak  
I wish you lovely weather  
More luck than you and me  
We only sail in circles  
So theres no need to cry  
Oh I see you again one day  
And then Ill wave bye bye  
Bye bye
