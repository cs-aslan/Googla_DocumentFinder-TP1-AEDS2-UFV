Father comes home cause his moneys run out   
Seems a little loose tonight he starts to shout  
  
Dinners not on the table seems mothers not able  
Shes staring at the TV  
  
You can smell it on his breath feel it in his touch  
He never meant to hit her hard but hes like that when hes had too much  
  
Its just another story bout going too far  
Its just another story bout going too far  
  
Well the kids at school shes getting good grades  
But the peer pressures starting now  too bad she had it made  
  
Seems theres always someone trying to push you to do something  
You know aint the way they told you to  
Its hard to see  
The things you taught her how to be  
Its like you told her nothing selective memory  
  
Come on try it its just a smoke aint gonna kill you so she takes a toke   
Fade to grey  
  
Its just another story bout going too far  
Its just another story bout going too far  
  
Well the guys at work seemed okay  
Theyd buy you a drink get you laid whats wrong with that  
  
Whyd they have more money than you expensive cars expensive clothes  
Dyou ever think of what they do  
  
At night theyre out shakin people down  
When theyre walking together seems they own the town  
  
But hey whos gonna talk you are their alibi  
Dont turn around dont ask questions just walk  
  
Its just another story bout going too far  
Its just another story bout going too far
