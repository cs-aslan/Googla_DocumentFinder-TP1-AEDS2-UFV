I I wanna save you  
Wanna save your heart tonight  
Hell only break ya  
Leave you torn apart oh  
  
Its a quarter to three cant sleep at all  
Youre so overrated  
If you told me to jump Id take the fall  
And he wouldnt take it  
  
All that you wants under your nose yeah  
You should open your eyes but they stay closed closed  
  
Chorus  
I I wanna save you  
Wanna save your heart tonight  
Hell only break ya  
Leave you torn apart oh  
I cant be no superman  
But for you Ill be super human  
I I wanna save ya save ya save ya tonight  
  
Oh now youre at home  
And he dont call  
Cause he dont adore ya  
To him you are just another doll  
And I tried to warn ya  
  
What you want what you need  
Has been right here yeah  
I can see that youre holding back those tears tears  
  
Chorus  
  
Up up and away  
Ill take you with me  
Up up and away  
Ill take you with me  
  
Chorus  
  
I wanna save ya save ya save ya tonight  
I wanna save ya save ya save ya tonight
