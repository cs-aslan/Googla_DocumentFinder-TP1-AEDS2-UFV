I didnt mean to end his life I know it wasnt right  
I cant even sleep at night cant get it off my mind  
I need to get out of sight fore I end up behind bars

Turned into a real sticky situation  
Me just thinking on the time that Im facing  
Makes me wanna cry

And I took his heart when

But its too late to turn back now  
Dont know what I was thinking
