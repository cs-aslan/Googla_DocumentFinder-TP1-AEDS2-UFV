You came into my life  
Without a single thing  
I gave into your ways  
Which left me with nothing  
Ive given empty smiles  
Ive dealt with all your games  
I wish youd bet right now  
I had to let you win  
Wont you get the fuck out of my face now  
Wont you get the fuck out of my face now  
In the sea of life youre just a minnow  
Live your life insecure  
Feel the pain of your needles  
As they shit into my mind  
I scream without a sound  
How could you take away  
Everything that I was  
Made me a fuckin slave  
Your face that I despise  
Your heart inside thats gray  
I came today to say  
Youre fucked in every way  
  
Wont you get the fuck out of my face now  
Wont you get the fuck out of my face now  
  
In the sea of life youre just a minnow  
Live your life insecure  
Feel the pain of your needles  
As they shit into my mind  
You stole my life  
Without a sigh  
You sucked me dry  
  
Wont you get the fuck out of my face now  
Wont you get the fuck out of my face now  
Wont you get the fuck out of my face now  
Wont you get the fuck out of my face now  
Wont you get the fuck out of my face now  
Wont you get the fuck out of my face now  
Wont you get the fuck out of my face now  
Wont you get the fuck out of my face now  
  
In the sea of life youre just a minnow  
Live your life insecure  
Feel the pain of your needles  
As they shit into my mind  
You stole my life  
Without a sigh  
You sucked me dry
