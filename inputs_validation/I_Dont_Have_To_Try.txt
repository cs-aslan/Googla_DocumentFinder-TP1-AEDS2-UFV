Im the one Im the one who knows the dance  
Im the one Im the one whos got the prance  
Im the one Im the one who wears the pants  
I wear the pants  
  
Im the one who tells you what to do  
Youre the one youre the one if I let you  
Im the one Im the one who wears the pants  
I wear the pants  
  
Hey you follow me or take the lead  
Cant you see  
Dont you question me  
You just do what I say  
  
Bridge  
I dont care what youre sayin  
I dont care what youre thinkin  
I dont care about anything  
Get ready motherfucker cause Im happening  
I dont care what youre sayin  
I dont care what youre thinkin  
I dont care about anything  
Get ready motherfucker cause Im on the scene  
  
Chorus  
I dont have to try  
To make you realize  
Anything I wanna do anything Im gonna do  
Anything I wanna do I do  
And I dont have to try  
  
Dont you disagree  
Cause you know its all about me  
Be at my beck and call  
Im a knowitall  
And its all your fault  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus x2
