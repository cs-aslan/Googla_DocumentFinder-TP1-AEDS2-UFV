Whatsoever Ive feared has come to life  
Whatsoever Ive fought off became my life  
Just when everyday seemed to greet me with a smile  
Sunspots have faded and now Im doing time  
Cause I fell on black days  
  
Whomsoever Ive cured Ive sickened now  
Whomsoever Ive cradled Ive put you down  
Im a search light soul  
They say but I cant see it in the night  
Im only faking when I get it right  
Cause I fell on black days  
How would I know that this could be my fate  
  
So what you wanted to see good has made you blind  
And what you wanted to be yours has made it mine  
So dont you lock up something that you wanted to see fly  
Hands are for shaking  
Not tying no not tying  
  
I sure dont mind a change  
But I fell on black days  
How would I know that this could be my fate
