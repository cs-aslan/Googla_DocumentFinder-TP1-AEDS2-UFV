Say say say what you want but dont play games with my affection  
Take take take what you need but dont leave me with no direction  
All alone I sit home by the phone waiting for you baby baby  
Through the years how can you stand to hear my pleading for you dear  
You know Im crying ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Yeah  
  
Now go go go where you want but dont leave me here forever  
You you you stay away so long girl I see you never  
What can I do girl to get through to you  
Cause I love you baby baby  
Standing here baptized in all my tears baby through the years  
You know Im crying ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
You never ever worry and you never shed a tear  
Youre saying that my love aint real  
Just look at my face these tears aint drying  
  
You you you can never say that Im not the one who really loves you  
I pray pray pray every day that youll see things girl like I do  
What can I do girl to get through to you  
Cause I love you love you baby baby  
Standing here baptized in all my tears baby through the years  
You know Im crying ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Say say say  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Ooh ooh ooh say say say  
Ooh ooh ooh say say say  
Ooh ooh ooh say say say  
Ooh ooh ooh say say say  
Ooh ooh ooh say say say
