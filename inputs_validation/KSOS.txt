Come gather round me boys and lend an ear  
Ive got some things I think you all should hear  
Its time to shift into another gear  
Ive reached my final destination bought a radio station  
And shes fifty thousand watts pure and clear  
KSOS help is on the way twentyfour hours of every day  
A voice in the wilderness and were here to stay KSOS  
 guitar  banjo   
KSOS help is on the way  
KSOS help is on the way
