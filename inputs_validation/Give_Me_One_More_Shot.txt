Life aint all that easy I can testify to that  
Its been up and down and round and round to get to where Im at  
If you could see how Im living in this old car I drive  
Well youd probably wonder and even ponder why I even want to stay alive  
  
So give me one more shot Ill give it all Ive got  
Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise I pray  
Give me one more chance Ill learn to dance the dance  
Well Im satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
  
Well I could complain about taxes or the weather were having today  
Go on and on about things that are wrong from New York to LA  
Well thats just not my nature to sit around feeling sad  
Were only here for awhile so why not smile hey living aint all that bad  
  
So give me one more shot Ill give it all Ive got  
Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise I pray  
Give me one more chance Ill learn to dance the dance  
Well Im satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
  
When I look around theres lots of folks worse off than me  
So I just thank the good Lord and ask him please  
  
So give me one more shot Ill give it all Ive got  
Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise I pray  
Give me one more chance Ill learn to dance the dance  
Well Im satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
  
Well Im satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
Give me one more shot Ill give it all Ive got  
Give me one more day  
Show me the way and give me one more day  
Give me one more shot
