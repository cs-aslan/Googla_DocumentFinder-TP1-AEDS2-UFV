Im headed down a highway got a suitcase by my side  
Blue skies hangin over my head I got five hundred miles to ride  
Im goin down to Memphis town to play a late night show  
I hope the people are ready there cause the boys are all ready to go  
  
Chorus  
Well Im a whiskey rockaroller  
Thats what I am  
Women whiskey and miles of travelin  
Is all I understand  
  
I was born a travelin man and my feets do burn the ground  
I dont care for fancy music if your shoes cant shuffle around  
I got a hundred women or more and theres no place I call home  
The only time Im satisfied is when Im on the road  
  
Chorus  
Sometimes I wonder where will we go  
  
Lord dont take my whiskey rock and roll  
Take me down to Memphis town bus driver get me there  
I got me a queenie she got long brown curly hair  
She likes to drink old grandad and her shoes do shuffle around  
And every time I see that gal  
Lord she wants to take me down  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes I wonder where will we go  
Lord dont take my whiskey rock and roll
