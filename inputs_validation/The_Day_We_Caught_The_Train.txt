I never saw it as the start  
Its more a change of heart  
Rapping on the windows whistling down the chimney pot  
Blowing off the dust in the room where I forgot  
I laid my plansin solid rock  
  
Stepping through the door like a troubadour  
Whiling just an hour away  
Looking at the trees on the roadside  
Feeling its a holiday  
You and I should ride the coast  
And wind up in our favourite coats just miles away  
Roll a number write another song  
Like Jimmy heard the day he caught the train  
  
Oh oh la la  
Oh oh la la  
Oh oh la la  
Oh oh la la  
  
He sipped another rum and coke  
And told a dirty joke  
Walking like Groucho sucking on a number ten  
Rolling on the floor with the cigarette burns walked in  
Ill miss the crush and Im home again  
  
Stepping through the door with the night in store  
Whiling just an hour away  
Step into the sky in the star bright  
Feeling its a brighter day  
You and I should ride the coast  
And wind up in our favourite coats just miles away  
Roll a number write another song  
Like Jimmy heard the day he caught the train  
  
Oh oh la la  
Oh oh la la  
Oh oh la la  
Oh oh la la  
  
You and I should ride the tracks  
And find ourselves just wading through tomorrow  
You and I when were coming down  
Were only getting back  
And you know I feel no sorrow  
  
Oh oh la la  
Oh oh la la  
Oh oh la la  
Oh oh la la  
  
When you find that things are getting wild  
Dont you want days like these  
When you find that things are getting wild  
Dont you want days like these  
When you find that things are getting wild  
Dont you need days like these  
When you find that things are getting wild  
Dont you want days like these  
  
Oh oh la la  
Oh oh la la
