So in love sad as could be  
Cause a pretty face got the best of me  
Suddenly you came into my life  
And gave it meaning and pure delight  
Now good looks Ive learned to do without  
Cause now I know its love that really counts  
I know beautys only skin deep  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Beautys only skin deep  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Now you speak your words warm and sincere  
And let me know that your love is here  
A pretty face you many not possess  
But what I like about you is your tenderness  
A pretty face may be some guys taste  
But Ill take lovin in its place  
Cause I know beautys only skin deep  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Beautys only skin deep  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Now friends ask what do I see in you  
But it goes deeper than the eye can view  
You have a pleasing personality  
And thats an ever lovin rare quality  
Now show me a girl a girl thats fine  
And Ill choose the one with true lovin evry time  
Cause I know beautys only skin deep  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Beautys only skin deep  
Yeah yeah yeah  
So if youre lookin for a lover  
Oh yeah dont judge a book by its cover  
Oh yeah She may be fine on the outside  
Oh yeah but so untrue on the inside
