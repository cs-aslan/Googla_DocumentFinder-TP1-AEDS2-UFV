Gonna do something you might know  
But dont worry it gets better at the chorus  
  
I guess now its time for me to throw up  
I feel its time  
Got a picture of you beside me  
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup  
Wash it off  
Got a fist of pure emotion  
Got a head of shattered dreams  
Gotta leave it gotta leave it all behind me now  
  
Chorus  
whatever I said whatever I did I didnt mean it  
I just want you back for good  
Whenever Im wrong just tell me the song and Ill sing it  
Youll be right and understood  
  
Unaware but underlined I figured out the story  
It wasnt good  
And in the corner of a mind I celebrated glory  
But it wasnt to be  
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free  
Cant you find a little room inside for me  
  
Chorus  
  
And well be together this time is forever  
So complete in our love  
We will never be uncovered again  
  
Mosh  
  
Chorus
