Angel eyes angel eyes  
The ways of the world are feeble  
Dont give up on simple people  
Angle eyes stun those nights  
The blues you can live without  
Its not what you songs about  
Angel eyes angel eyes  
Tell me what would were doin  
Without the light from angel eyes  
  
You can move the hearts of men  
Just with a phrase youre turning  
Since hearts ever have been yearning  
Bear with us bear so alone  
Thin lines youve been living on  
Are so close to the danger zone  
Angel eyes angel eyes  
Tell me what would were doin  
Without the light from angel eyes
