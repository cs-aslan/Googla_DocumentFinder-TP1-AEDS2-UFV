I make a date for golf  
You can bet you life it rains  
I try to give a party  
And the guy upstairs complains  
I guess Ill go through life  
Just catchin colds and missin trains  
Evrything happens to me  
  
I never miss a thing  
Ive had measles and the mumps  
And evry time I play my ace  
My partner always trumps  
I guess Im just a fool  
Who never looks before he jumps  
Evrything happens to me  
  
At first my heart thot  
You could break this jinx for me  
That love would turn the trick  
To end my despair  
But now I just cant fool  
This head that thinks for me  
Ive mortgaged all my castles in the air  
  
Ive telegraphed and called  
I sent air mail special too  
You answer was goodbye  
And there was even postage due  
I fell in love just once  
And then it had to be with you  
Evrything happens to me
