Im the face baby is that clear  
Im the face baby is that clear  
Im the face if you want it  
Im the face if you want it dear  
All the others are third class tickets by me baby is that clear  
  
Im the big wheel baby wont you roll with me  
Im the big wheel baby wont you roll with me  
So many cats down the scene honey

Wear ivy league jackets white buckskin shoes  
I wear ivy league jackets white buckskin shoes  
So many tickets down the scene honey  
Theyre like to blow a fuse  
  
Im the face baby is that clear  
Im the face baby is that clear  
Im the face if you want it  
Im the face if you want it dear  
All the others are third class tickets by me baby is that clear
