Fabolous  
If you aint up on things  
Fabolous is the name street fam is the game  
Screamin 718 while them hammers bang  
Like bludda ludda lacca bludda ludda lacca  
Kick game like I know a little bit of socca  
Spic dames ass and a little bit of knockas  
Give them nick names and a little bit of vodka  
Then Im game change A very freaky girl  
You know who got the gold like the kid from The Last Dragon  
You know who got the low on the spokes and the ass saggin  
You know who got the gold thatll have your ass gaggin  
You know who got the boat thatll have the task naggin  
But I fuck bitches and get money  
My truck switches like  
You got to duck bitches when you get twenties  
And plug switches that make you sit funny  
Im a rider  
  
Chorus Snoop Dogg Fabolous  
If you aint up on things  
Dont come close to me  
Unless you ride like you supposed to be

Unless you gangsta like you supposed to be  
  
Fabolous  
cmon you know its gs up COs down  
If I freeze up its kilos now  
Pick trees up its 34 pounds  
Fill the bees up til these bros drown  
I snatch a few gs up and flea those towns  
Bustas freeze up when my v slow down  
I ease up with these 4 pounds  
Squeeze up to 34 rounds  
I pick these up its G code now  
Yall better call the Ds up before I reload now  
Im The Boss something like Springsteen  
I got something that bring green  
That look something like string beans  
I make sure the hustlers keep something to sling the fiends  
White yellow and a little something that bling green  
We going to blast if we going I been doing  
this since Jabbar was hooking off the glass in the forum ghetto  
Your grandparents has to assume  
Cause the face look like a magnifying glass on the poem oh boy

Its the kid with the D O double G  
After blowing 34 dubs of trees  
My eyes are below double gs  
After sipping pino bubbly skeeo rubbing me  
Well probably go below publicly  
Im a coast to coast G I keep the toast to mostly  
For those who pose to closely backup  
Keep a piece in the vest thats how we ride  
From the north to the south to the east to the west
