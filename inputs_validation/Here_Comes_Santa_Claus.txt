Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane  
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins  
Bells are ringing children singing all is merry and bright  
So hang your stockings and say your prayers cause Santa Claus comes tonight  
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane  
Hes got a bag thats filled with toys for boys and girls again  
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle what a beautiful sight  
Jump in bed and cover up your head cause Santa Claus comes tonight  
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane  
He doesnt care if youre a rich or poor boy for he loves you just the same  
Santa knows that were Gods children that makes everything right  
Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer cause Santa Claus comes tonight  
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane  
Hell come around when the chimes ring out its Christmas morn again  
Peace on earth will come to all if we just follow the light  
Lets give thanks to the Lord above cause Santa Claus comes tonight
