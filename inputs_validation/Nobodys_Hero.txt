I knew he was different in his sexuality  
I went to his parties as a straight minority  
It never seemed a threat to my masculinity  
He only introduced me to a wider reality  
  
As the years went by we drifted apart  
When I heard that he was gone  
I felt a shadow cross my heart  
But hes nobodys  
  
Hero  saves a drowning child  
Cures a wasting disease  
Hero  lands the crippled airplane  
Solves great mysteries  
  
Hero  not the handsome actor  
Who plays a heros role  
Hero  not the glamor girl  
Whod love to sell her soul  
If anybodys buying  
Nobodys hero  
  
I didnt know the girl but I knew her family  
All their lives were shattered  
In a nightmare of brutality  
They try to carry on try to bear the agony  
Try to hold some faith  
In the goodness of humanity  
  
As the years went by we drifted apart  
When I heard that she was gone  
I felt a shadow cross my heart  
But shes nobodys  
  
Hero  the voice of reason  
Against the howling mob  
Hero  the pride of purpose  
In the unrewarding job  
  
Hero  not the champion player  
Who plays the perfect game  
Not the glamor boy  
Who loves to sell his name  
Everybodys buying  
Nobodys hero  
  
As the years went by we drifted apart  
When I heard that you were gone  
I felt a shadow cross my heart  
  
Hero
