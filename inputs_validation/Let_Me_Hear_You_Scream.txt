Let me hear you scream  
  
Im black and bruised beat up but still I take the blows  
Cause all I need is blood and sweat and skin and bones  
Ill take this rage rattle your cage nobody said its easy  
Its do or die only the strong survive get ready for the last stand  
Get ready Im your hangman  
  
Let me hear you scream like you want it  
Let me hear you yell like you mean it  
If you gotta go down  
Go loud  
Go strong  
Go proud  
Go on  
Go hard or go home  
Let me hear you let me hear you  
Let me hear you let me hear you  
Let me hear you scream  
  
Ill pull you up and push you right back in your place  
Ill take you down and wipe that smile right off your face  
Ill watch you break youre mine to take dont blink you just might miss
it  
Its all or nothing nowhere left to run are you ready for the last fight  
Get ready with the war cry  
  
Let me hear you scream like you want it  
Let me hear you yell like you mean it  
If you gotta go down  
Go loud  
Go strong  
Go proud  
Go on  
Go hard or go home  
Let me hear you let me hear you  
Let me hear you let me hear you  
Let me hear you scream  
  
Let me hear you scream like you want it  
Let me hear you yell like you mean it  
If you gotta go down  
Go loud  
Go strong  
Go proud  
Go on  
Go hard or go home  
  
Let me hear you scream like you want it  
Let me hear you yell like you mean it  
If you gotta go down  
Go loud  
Go strong  
Go proud  
Go on  
Go hard or go home  
Let me hear you let me hear you  
Let me hear you let me hear you  
Let me hear you scream
