Amber cascades all over today  
Then we walk on a crooked catwalk  
Only to be delayed  
Bubbles of blue burst into two  
Eaten up by the incoming tide  
Of the new  
  
Then we call to the man who walks on the water  
We talk of a plan to stop all the slaughter in view  
Its in view  
  
Granite charades are played in the rain

Till we fall through a sand castle window  
To avoid the pain  
Summer canoe paddles up to you  
cause its time for another beer run  
Or something thats equally true  
  
Then we call to the man who walks on the water  
We talk of a plan to stop all the slaughter in view  
  
Then we call to the man who walks on the water  
We talk of a plan to stop all the slaughter in view  
Its in view
