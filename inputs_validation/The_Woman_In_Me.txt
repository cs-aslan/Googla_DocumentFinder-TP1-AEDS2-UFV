Dancin close feelin restless  
Its a slow sultry night  
Itll take a lifetime til sunrise  
If you wont stay with me tonight  
Feel your breath caress my shoulder  
As your heart reads my mind  
You dont have to tell me anything  
I can see everything in your eyes  
Its so easy with you  
I dont need an excuse to be the woman in me  
Its so hard to believe that Im feeling so free to be the woman in me  
Baby theres so much no man has ever touched of the woman in me  
I might be trembling  
But Im not scared  
Just my desire breaking free  
Ive never had a chance like this before  
To unlock all the doors to the woman in me  
Its so easy with you  
I dont need an excuse to be the woman in me  
Its so hard to believe that Im feeling so free  
To be the woman in me  
Like the dark side of the full moon  
Ive never shown what Ive showing to you  
Its so easy with you  
I dont need an excuse  
To be the woman in me  
Its so hard to believe that Im feeling so free to be the woman in me  
Its so easy with you  
I dont need an excuse to be the woman in me  
Its so hard to believe that Im feeling so free to be the woman in  
Me
