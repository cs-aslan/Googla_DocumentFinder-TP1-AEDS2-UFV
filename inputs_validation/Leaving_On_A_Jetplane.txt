All my bags are packed  
Im ready to go  
Im standing here outside your door  
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye  
  
But the dawn is breaking its early morn  
The taxi s waiting hes blowing his horn  
Already Im so lonesome I could die  
  
Chorus  
So kiss me and smile for me  
Tell me that youll wait for me  
Hold me like youll never let me go  
Im leaving on a jetplane  
Dont know when Ill be back again  
Oh babe Id hate to go  
Id hate to go  
  
There re so many times Ive let you down  
So many times Ive played around  
But now you know that they dont mean a thing  
  
Every place I go Ill think of you  
Every song I sing Ill sing for you  
When I come back Ill wear your weddingring  
  
So kiss me and smile for me  
Tell me that youll wait for me  
Hold me like youll never let me go  
  
Im leaving on a jetplane  
Dont know when Ill be back again  
Oh babe I hate to go  
I hate to go  
  
Now the time has come to leave you  
One more time let me kiss you  
Close your eyes and Ill be on my way  
  
Dream about the days to come  
When I wont have to leave alone  
About the times when I dont have to say  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Im leaving on a jetplane Im leaving on a jetplane  
Im leaving on a jetplane I leaving on a jetplanefade
