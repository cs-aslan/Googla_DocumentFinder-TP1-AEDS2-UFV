I cant say I aint been around  
That I aint done my time  
Seems like this big old world  
Has been one big shoe to shine  
  
But I never ever took a dime  
For what comes naturally  
And if I never knew the truth  
Well shed be fine with me  
  
One night she stayed over here  
And left her little black book behind  
Well that little black book aint little no more  
And it wasnt too hard too find  
  
Chorus  
Shed leave me in this lonely room  
The thought just made me sick  
Its funny how the pieces fit  
My baby gets around a bit  
Yeah my baby gets around a bit  
  
Her pager would ring its a funny thing  
Shed have to go right away  
She always had a wad of cash  
Much more than her job could pay  
  
Id ask her where shes going to  
And this is what shed say  
i gotta meet someone for an interview  
Hes only in town today  
  
Always a little bit overdressed  
Much more than I thought hed be  
High heel shoes and day glow dress  
Aint seem strange to me  
  
Shed leave me in this lonely room  
While some stud got his sex  
Just then the thought occurred to me  
My baby gets around a bit  
My baby gets around a bit  
Oooh my baby gets around a bit  
  
Solo  
  
Took her to the local bar  
Where I like to hang  
Every guy that passed her by  
They all seemed to know her name  
  
They all called her by a different name  
And one of them winked at me  
Some guy named stan said youre the man  
I heard you get it for free  
  
Shed leave me in this lonely room  
And the thought hit me like a brick  
Its funny how the pieces fit  
My baby gets around a bit  
Ooooh my baby gets around a bit  
Ooooh my baby gets around a bit  
My baby gets around a bit  
  
My baby gets around  
My baby
