Take all your overgrown infants away somewhere  
And build them a home a little place of their own  
The Fletcher Memorial  
Home for Incurable Tyrants and Kings  
  
And they can appear to themselves every day  
On closed circuit TV  
To make sure theyre still real  
Its the only connection they feel  
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome Reagan and Haig  
Mr Begin and friend Mrs Thatcher and Paisly  
Hello Maggie  
Mr Brezhnev and party  
Whos the bald chap  
The ghost of McCarthy  
The memories of Nixon  
Goodbye  
And now adding color a group of anonymous latin  
American Meat packing glitterati  
  
Did they expect us to treat them with any respect  
They can polish their medals and sharpen their  
Smiles and amuse themselves playing games for awhile  
Boom boom bang bang lie down youre dead  
  
Safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye  
With their favorite toys  
Theyll be good girls and boys  
In the Fletcher Memorial Home for colonial  
Wasters of life and limb  
  
Is everyone in  
Are you having a nice time  
Now the final solution can be applied
