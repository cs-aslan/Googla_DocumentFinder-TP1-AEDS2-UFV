What a day you had today  
It took your smile away  
I think we ought to get away  
Lets run away  
  
Take me out under the sky  
Counting diamonds all through the night  
And the moon in the morning light  
Out under the sky  
  
And it can happen any day  
Everything goes astray  
But the starts do us ok  
Lets run away  
  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah out under the sky  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah out under the sky  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah out under the sky  
Out under the sky  
  
Its all right let it go  
Shake the world off you shoulders  
You have the perfect alibi  
Just because the world is wide  
Out under the sky  
  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah out under the sky  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah out under the sky  
Out under the sky  
  
When all is said and done  
Darlin we are the only ones  
Theres only you and I  
Out under the sky  
Out under the sky  
Out under the sky
