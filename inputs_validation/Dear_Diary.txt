Dear diary what a day its been  
Dear diary its been just like a dream  
Woke up too late Wasnt where I should have been  
For goodness sake whats happening to me  
Write lightly yours truly dear diary  
  
It was cold outside my door  
So many people by the score  
Rushing around as senselessly  
They dont notice theres people like me  
Write lightly yours truly dear diary  
  
They dont know what theyre playing  
Theyve got no way of knowing what the game is  
Still they carry on doing what they can  
Outside me yours truly dear diary  
  
Its over Will tomorrow be the same  
I know that theyre really not to blame  
If they werent so blind then surely theyd see  
Theres a much better way for them to be  
Inside me yours truly dear diary  
  
Somebody exploded an Hbomb today  
But it wasnt anyone I knew
