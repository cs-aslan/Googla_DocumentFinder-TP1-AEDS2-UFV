Dont talk about her she does the best she can  
Dont talk about her Dont talk about her  
Shes just lost her man  
Shes lonely just try and understand  
  
And if you cant say something nice  
Dont say anything at all  
Dont you know that shes had a bad bad fall  
And if you cant say something nice  
Dont say anything at all  
  
Dont talk about her because she feels that way  
Dont talk about her dont talk about her  
She dont feel so good today  
Shes crying because her baby walked away  
  
And if you cant say something nice  
Dont say anything at all  
Dont you know that shes had a bad bad fall  
And if you cant say something nice  
Dont say anything at all
