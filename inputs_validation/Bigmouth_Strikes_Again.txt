Sweetness sweetness I was only joking  
When I said Id like to smash every tooth  
In your head  
  
Ohsweetness sweetness I was only joking  
When I said by rights you should be  
Bludgeoned in your bed  
  
And now I know how Joan of Arc felt  
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt  
As the flames rose to her roman nose  
And her Walkman started to melt  
Oh  
  
Bigmouth labigmouth la  
Bigmouth strikes again  
And Ive got no right to take my place  
With the Human race  
  
Oh bigmouth la  bigmouth la  
Bigmouth strikes again  
And Ive got no right to take my place  
With the Human race  
  
And now I know how Joan of Arc felt  
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt  
As the flames rose to her roman nose  
And her hearing aid started to melt  
  
Bigmouth labigmouth la  
Bigmouth strikes again  
And Ive got no right to take my place  
With the Human race  
Oh  
  
Bigmouth ohbigmouth la  
Bigmouth strikes again  
And Ive got no right to take my place  
With the Human race  
Oh  
  
Bigmouth ohbigmouth la  
Bigmouth strikes again  
And Ive got no right to take my place  
With the Human race  
Oh  
  
Bigmouth ohbigmouth la  
Bigmouth strikes again  
And Ive got no right to take my place  
With the Human race
