I walked this road  
So very long ago  
To show the way  
So you would know  
I walked the road  
With holes in my hands in feet  
To make the way  
Come follow me  
  
Chorus  
No you are not alone  
You will be free indeed  
The journey begins and ends  
With me  
One million miles  
It starts with a step or two  
What are you waiting for  
Im waiting for you  
  
You run the race  
Thinking youve almost won  
Then you may find  
Youve only begun  
  
Youre on the road  
Thinking youre far from here  
And suddenly find  
Youre very near  
  
Chorus
