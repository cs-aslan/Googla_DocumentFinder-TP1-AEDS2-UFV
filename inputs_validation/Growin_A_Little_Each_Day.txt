Well music sweet music  
Lord is gonna be played mmhmm  
And the sound of Billys banjo  
Is like honey on your day  
When they promenade down through the square  
Theyll hear you say  
Im comin your way  
And Im only just a growin  
A little each day  
The sun of the delta  
Beams across your face oh yeah  
And good old Granddads stories  
Seem to set your pace  
All the men youve known in this town  
Dont seem to have it  
And they bring you down  
Well remember youre just growin  
A little each day  
  
So throw out your arms and take in the sky  
Take down your hair and watch the birds fly  
Dont be afraid to show how you feel  
Dont sit and hide dont you know that youre real  
You can have it if you want it  
Change yourself and play  
Cause youre only only just growin  
A little each day  
  
So woman sweet woman  
Why you feel that way  
dont you know youre only growin  
Just a little each day  
When the good Lord placed you on this earth  
His good words to heed  
Its all that you need  
And youre only just growin  
A little each day  
  
Oh youre only just growin  
A little each day  
Oh sweet woman youre only just growin  
A little each day
