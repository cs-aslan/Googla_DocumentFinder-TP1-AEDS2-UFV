We carried all the colors  
From the portrait of our summer  
We never felt the answers  
Weighing down our shoulders  
  
Time goes fast when you wander  
And nothing lasts forever  
But I still feel the power  
Of you and me together  
And light that surrounds you  
  
I know Im the lucky one  
Though Im always the last to believe  
I know Im the lucky one  
Cause Im here and youre with me  
  
So tell me are you willing  
To try this thing called living  
Cause theres so many edges hidden  
Its so hard to be forgiving  
  
But Ill try once if you ask me  
And once again everlasting  
For all my days Ill love you  
And all the stars you run through  
See the light surround you

I know Im the lucky one  
Though Im always the last to believe  
I know Im the lucky one  
Cause Im here and youre with me  
  
When the wrongs and the rights allve been pushed aside  
Youre my favorite color  
Youre the black to the white and the warmth inside  
Youre the sun Im under  
  
I volunteer to watch you  
Through the dreams that haunt you  
I promise to wake you  
Before the fear takes you  
  
May the light surround you  
May the light surround you  
May the light surround you  
  
I know Im the lucky one  
Though it took so long to see  
I know Im the lucky one  
Cause Im here and youre with me  
  
May the light surround you
