From northerton to northern california  
Folk dont really change  
And theres always the rain  
From southport beach to Sunday in the hamptons  
Well I never could complain  
And theres always the rain  
The fool you are in manchester  
The fool you are in maine  
The lies you tell in liverpool  
Will follow you to spain  
Its the fool you are  
From lambeth walk to london ontario  
Wed likelove to run away  
When it looks like rain  
From sunset strip to waterloo underground  
The stars are just the same  
And it looks like rain  
The fool you are in manchester  
The fool you are in maine  
The lies you tell in liverpool  
Will follow you to spain  
Its the fool you are  
Its the fool you are  
Yes it is  
From the sunshine state to shaftesbury avenue  
Folk dont really change  
And theres always the rain  
And the night before in northern california  
Is dawning on the thames and it looks like rain  
The fool you are in manchester  
The fool you are in maine  
The lies you tell in liverpool  
Will follow you to spain  
And the morning after leicester square  
Is hungover in rome  
And never again in newcastle  
Is one more for the road  
Its the fool you are  
Its the fool you are  
Yes it is  
Its the fool you are  
Its the fool thats what you are  
Its the fool you are
