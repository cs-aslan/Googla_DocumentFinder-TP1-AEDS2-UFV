Hes a rebel and a runner  
Hes a signal turning green  
Hes a restless young romantic  
Wants to run the big machine  
  
Hes got a problem with his poisons  
But you know hell find a cure  
Hes cleaning up the systems  
To keep his nature pure  
  
Learning to match the beat of the old world man  
Learning to catch the heat of the third world man  
  
Hes got to make his own mistakes  
And learn to mend the mess he makes  
Hes old enough to know whats right  
And young enough not to choose it  
Hes noble enough to win the world  
But weak enough to lose it  
  
Hes a new world man  
  
Hes a radio receiver  
Tuned to factories and farms  
Hes a writer and ranger and a young boy bearing arms  
Hes got a problem with his powers  
His weapons on patrol  
Hes got to walk a fine line  
And keep his self control  
  
Trying to save the day for the old world man  
Trying to pave the way for the third world man  
  
Hes not concerned with yesterday  
He knows constant change is here today  
Hes noble enough to know whats right  
But weak enough not to choose it  
Hes wise enough to win the world  
But fool enough to lose it  
  
Hes a new world man  
  
Learning to match the beat of the old world man  
Hes learning to catch the heat of the third world man  
  
Hes a new world man Repeat x 3
