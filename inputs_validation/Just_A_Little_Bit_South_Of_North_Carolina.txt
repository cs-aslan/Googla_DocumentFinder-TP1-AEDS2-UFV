Just a little bit south of North Carolina  
Thats where I long to be  
In a little brown shack in South Carolina  
Someone waits for me  
In each letter she says that the weather is fine and the folks are feeling
great  
That the garden looks grand and the red rose vine is clinging to the gate  
Just a little bit south of North Carolina  
Thats where my thoughts all stray  
To the one I love best in South Carolina  
Im going back some day  
I can hardly wait to see the face of the one I like  
Just a little bit south of North Carolina  
Ill find paradise  
Just a little bit south of North Carolina  
Thats where my thoughts all stray  
To the one I love best in South Carolina  
Im going back some day  
I can hardly wait to see the face of the one I like  
Just a little bit south of North Carolina  
Ill find paradise
