I know a guy  
Thats got a lot to lose  
Hes a pretty nice guy  
But hes kind of confused  
Hes got muscles in his head  
That aint never been used  
Thinks he own half of this town  
  
Starts drinking heavy  
Gets a big red nose  
Beats his old lady  
With a rubber hose  
Then he takes her out to dinner  
And buys her new clothes  
Thats the way that the world goes round  
  
Thats the way that the world goes round  
Youre up one day  
And the next youre down  
Its half an inch of water  
And you think youre gonna drown  
Thats the way that the world goes round  
  
I was sitting in the bathtub  
Counting my toes  
When the radiator broke  
Water all froze  
I got stuck in the ice  
Without my clothes  
Naked as the eyes of a clown  
  
I was crying ice cubes  
Hoping Id croak  
When the sun come through the window  
The ice all broke  
I stood up and laughed  
Thought it was a joke  
Thats the way that the world goes round
