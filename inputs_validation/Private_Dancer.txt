All the men come in these places  
And the men are all the same  
You dont look at their faces  
And you dont ask their names  
You dont think of them as human  
You dont think of them at all  
You keep your mind on the money  
Keeping your eyes on the wall  
  
Im your private dancer a dancer for money  
Ill do what you want me to do  
Im your private dancer a dancer for money  
And any old music will do  
  
I want to make a million dollars  
I want to live out by the sea  
Have a husband and some children  
Yeah I guess I want a family  
All the men come in these places  
And the men are all the same  
You dont look at their faces  
And you dont ask their names  
  
Im your private dancer a dancer for money  
Ill do what you want me to do  
Im your private dancer a dancer for money  
And any old music will do  
  
Deutch marks or dollars  
American Express will do nicely thank you  
Let me loosen up your collar  
Tell me do you want to see me do the shimmy again  
  
Im your private dancer a dancer for money  
Ill do what you want me to do  
Im your private dancer a dancer for money  
And any old music will do
