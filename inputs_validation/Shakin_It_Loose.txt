She looked at me with fire in her eyes  
Looks cant kill but she certainly tries  
and she tried as she might  
But Im gonna be all right  
Shakin it loose tonight  
She said honey Forget me quick  
Another fool another Hollywood trick  
Movin on a red light  
But Im gonna be all right  
Shakin it loose tonight  
  
I got to go theres someone on the phone  
Knock on my door but theres nobody home  
I turned out the light  
And Im gonna be all right  
Shakin it loose tonight  
  
Shake shake shakin it loose tonight  
Shake shake shakin it loose tonight  
Im gonna make it  
Shakin it loose tonight
