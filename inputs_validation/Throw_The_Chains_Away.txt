Ill be your builder skilled at the tasks you ask  
Ill be you sinner baby allowing my soul to be sold  
But Im drawing the line there woman  
I aint takin no more abuse  
Ill be puttin my foot down and then  
Throw the chains away  
  
Locked in your prison much too late for escape  
Your walls are closin in lets tie the knot while were hot  
  
Bells are ringing but my ears wont hear  
And youre comin for me with the chains and the key
