Im not lookin for trouble Im takin one in the chin  
I dont know where Im goin or where to begin  
Alone in this room thinkin of you nd what couldve been  
  
The trouble that Ive seen  
The trouble got to me  
And theres no signs of life in here at all  
The sound of quiet is defining  
Ill wait for you to call  
And theres no sings of life in here at all  
All the trouble that Ive seen  
The trouble wont get the best of me  
  
Ah la la la la la  
Ah la la la la la  
Ah la la la la la la  
  
Im sending you out a signal  
Over land over sea  
From the top of the great lakes down the Mississippi  
Alone in the room thinkin of you and those possibilities  
  
The trouble that Ive seen  
This trouble got to me  
And theres no signs of life in here at all  
The sound of quiet is defining  
Ill wait for you to call  
And theres no signs of life in here at all  
All the trouble that Ive seen  
The trouble  
Ah the trouble that Ive seen  
The trouble wont get the best of me  
  
Theres no signs of life in here at all  
The sound of quiet is defining  
Ill wait for you to call  
Theres no signs of life in here at all  
Ah the trouble that Ive seen  
The trouble  
Ah the trouble that Ive seen  
And trouble wont get the best of me
