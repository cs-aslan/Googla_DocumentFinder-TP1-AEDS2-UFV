Im awalkin the dog and Im never blue  
Im awalkin that dog I not thinkin bout you  
I dont need no one to tie me down  
Cause Im walkin that dog and apaintin the town  
  
Such an easy life I never knew  
Well I cant believe that its really true  
Well Im a carefree gal thats seen the light  
And Im awalkin that dog all the day and all night  
  
Well Im full of pep I just cant grow old  
I got a onetrack mind so Ive been told  
But Im fancy free I dont worry no how  
Cause Im walkin that dog all the law will allow  
  
Such an easy life I never knew  
Until the day that I left you  
Well Im a carefree gal thats seen the light  
And Im walkin that dog all the day and all night
