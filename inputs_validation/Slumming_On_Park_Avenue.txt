Put on your slumming clothes and get your car  
Lets go sightseeing where the hightoned people are  
Come on theres lots of fun in store for you  
See how the other half lives on park avenue  
  
Lets go slumming take me slumming  
Lets go slumming on park avenue  
  
Let us hide behind a pair of fancy glasses  
And make faces when a member of the classes passes  
  
Lets go smelling where theyre dwelling  
Sniffing evrything the way they do  
  
Let us go to it they do it  
Why cant we do it too  
Lets go slumming nose thumbing on park avenue  
  
  
2nd chorus  
Lets go slumming take me slumming  
Lets go slumming on park avenue  
  
Where the social hearts for broadway lights are throbbing  
And they spend their nights in smart cafes hobknobbing snobbing  
  
Come lets eye them pass right by them  
Looking down our noses as they do  
  
Let us go to it they do it  
Why cant we do it too  
Lets go slumming crumb bumming on park avenue
