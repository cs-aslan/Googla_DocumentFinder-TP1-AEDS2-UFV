I love to hear those good old songs they sing unto the Lord  
I love to play my old guitar with them and I wanna choir  
Im looking forward to the day when Ill reach glory land  
Ill have a harp with golden strings to play with the angel band  
Im gonna trade my old guitar for a harp with golden strings  
Im gonna play like David did unto my Lord in pain  
Well gather round the great white throne and make the heavens ring  
Im gonna trade my old guitar for a harp with golden strings  
 acguitar   
I hear songs of every time that gives my heart a trill  
Songs of love and happiness and songs about the hills  
But of all the songs Ive ever heard theres none that can compare  
To the songs Ill hear the angels sing when I get over there  
Im gonna trade my old guitar  
Im gonna trade my old guitar for a harp with golden strings
