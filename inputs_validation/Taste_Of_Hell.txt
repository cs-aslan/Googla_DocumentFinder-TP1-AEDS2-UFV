With you its always lies lies lies  
I know that you have lied to me so dont even try to play now  
You said you didnt do those type of things but you went and did them anyway  
Now there is nothing you can say to me  
There is nothing you can do now  
The awful truth is that you broke my heart  
And now Im going to break yours too  
You get what you pay for  
You gotta own what you sell  
I know I will forgive you when I give you  
Just a taste of hell  
A little flavor of the pain that you gave me  
A little taste of hell  
All that trouble you have put me through it will come back to you because  
I know you fucked around on me  
I kind of caught you in the act  
You made a choice to take us to this place and now there is no going back  
I dont want to be vindictive now  
I dont want to make you sad  
But you broke the rules of this game that we play  
Now its my turn to be bad  
You know they say you get what you pay for  
You gotta own what you sell  
I think Im going to like it when I give you  
Just a taste of hell  
A little flavor of the pain that you gave me  
A little taste of hell  
All the trouble you have put me through  
It will come back to you  
With the taste of hell  
A little flavor of the pain that you gave me  
A little taste of hell  
Now all that trouble you have put me through  
It will come back to you  
There is nothing you can say to me  
There is nothing you can do  
You had to go and get some on the side  
Now Im going to go and get some too  
You get what you pay for  
You gotta own what you sell  
I am going to look like Satan when I give you  
Just a taste of hell  
A little flavor of the pain that you gave me  
A little taste of hell  
Now all the trouble you have put me through  
It will come back to you  
With the taste of hell  
A little flavor of the pain that you gave me  
A little taste of hell  
Now all the trouble you have put me through  
It will come back to you
