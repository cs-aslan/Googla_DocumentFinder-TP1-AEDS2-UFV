Were walking in the air  
Were floating in the moonlit sky  
The people far below are sleeping as we fly  
  
Im holding very tight  
Im riding in the midnight blue  
Im finding I can fly so high above with you  
  
Far across the wold  
The villages go by like trees  
The rivers and the hills  
The forests and the streams  
  
Children gaze open mouth  
Taken by surprise  
Nobody down below believes their eyes  
  
Were surfing in the air  
Were swimming in the frozen sky  
Were drifting over icy  
Mountains floating by  
  
Suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep  
Arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep  
  
Were walking in the air  
Were floating in the midnight sky  
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly
