You take my hand and smile at me  
But I can tell youd rather be  
Alone or with somebody else you know  
And when your eyes are looking to mine  
That old time love light doesnt shine  
But let me try again dont make me go  
  
I want you dont make me go my heart would break  
Id miss you so  
Treatin love for sympathy is all to me  
Whats this lovesick heart to do when it cries for only you  
Hold me close I love you so dont make me go  
  
Im sorry that I never knew the way to show my love for you  
I took too much for granted all the time  
Two hearts in love must give and take  
When one heart feels the other breaks  
Dont make me go I wanna show this love of mine  
  
I want you dont make me go
