Shes lookin for a way out of this hole  
Shes out on her own with hungry mouths to feed  
The precious little she scratches on the dole  
Is barely enough to cover all their needs  
  
It hurts to see her once strong frame  
Broken down by the constant blows of rejection  
And now in place of the sweetest smile  
She wears a frown of worry and dejection  
  
Oh its a cold cold world  
that turns its back on you  
When youre cryin out for a little love  
A little love and understandin  
  
People at the top looking down  
They dont wanna know whose at the back of the line  
People at the top looking down  
Cant relate to our troubled minds  
  
People at the top looking down  
People at the top  
  
Shes all caught up in these inner city blues  
Out of control shes losin her mind  
Her storys told but its second hand news  
To a world without care theyve heard it all before  
  
Tryin to do the best she can  
But shes losin faith in all that she believes in  
The light is fading and hope is dissipatin  
They say that they listen Lord knows that they dont hear  
  
Oh its a cold cold world that turns its back on you  
When youre cryin out for a little love  
A little love and understandin
