Can I pray for your return  
The bird I am looking for is not in me  
It is you  
Its so clear you missed it  
What we saw in you  
Green like flame  
someone felt something pure  
And told it all to you  
That was why you killed yourself  
To prove it wasnt true  
say hello to Corys mom  
Say hello to Freddys mom  
Say hello to Ryans mom  
were all and have been  
On your side  
What is worse for you to bear  
its obscene  
Why you missed  
What they saw in you  
Grey like flame  
can I pray for your return
