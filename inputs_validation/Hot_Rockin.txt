Ive done my share of workin out  
I wanna go some place where I can scream and shout  
Show me the lights where I can find  
The only thing I need to give me peace of mind  
  
I wanna go I wanna go I wanna go hot rockin  
  
Where is the spark that kicks the air  
Where is the energy that charges everywhere  
I see the crowd I hear the roar  
I feel my body to leave the ground and soar  
  
I wanna go I wanna go I wanna go hot rockin  
  
Im goin out in search of the bright lights  
Somehow I feel that tonight is the right night  
Im almost there Ive got the vibration  
Its coming strong from this generation  
My blood is hot from now on Im set free  
My pulse is hot so dont try to stop me  
Cause this is it and Im hot rockin  
  
Dont let it stop dont let it end  
Please let it carry on and on and on again  
I get so high Knocked off my feet yeah  
This is the only way I want I want I want  
  
I wanna go I wanna go I wanna go hot rockin  
  
Its all I want its all I crave  
I just want to go hot rockin
