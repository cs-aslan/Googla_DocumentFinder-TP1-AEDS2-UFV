Hold my hand while you cut me down  
It had only just begun but now its over now  
And youre in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold  
Im between the middle watching hastiness unfold  
In my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night  
The night  
Fell off your mind  
  
Im tired of trying  
Your teasing aint enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I dont get nothing back  
And for what and for what and for what  
When I dont get nothing back  
Oy Im tired  
  
Whered you go when you stayed behind  
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find  
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile  
I get closer you obviously prefer her  
  
Im tired of trying  
Your teasing aint enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I dont get nothing back  
And for what and for what and for what  
When I dont get nothing back  
Boy Im tired of trying  
Your teasing aint enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I dont get nothing back  
And for what and for what and for what  
When I dont get nothing back  
Oy Im tired  
  
I should have known  
  
Never mind said your open arms  
I couldnt help believe they tricked me back into them even though  
  
Im tired of trying  
Your teasing aint enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I dont get nothing back  
And for what and for what and for what  
When I dont get nothing back  
Boy Im tired of trying  
Your teasing aint enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I dont get nothing back  
And for what and for what and for what  
When I dont get nothing back  
Oy Im tired
