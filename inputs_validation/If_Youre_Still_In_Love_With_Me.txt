First you say youre in love with me and that it lasts eternally  
Then I find that you change your mind but one and one will not make three  
Well Im glad to say the distance is one thing I never mind  
But every thought of leaving is the last thing on my mind  
  
So if youre still in love with me then why wont you just set me free  
Cause if Im not in love with you then theres no chance to see this through  
Again  
  
Everything that Ive promised you  
I tried and tried to make it all come true  
But if I break your heart again well this time itll never mend  
When I beg for freedom you only chain me down  
With everyday that passes now the answer cant be found  
  
So if youre still in love with me then why wont you just set me free  
Cause if Im not in love with you then theres no chance to see this through  
Again  
  
All across the nation  
People in frustration  
Theres those who need someone to stay  
And those whove got to run away  
  
So if youre still in love with me then why wont you just set me free  
Cause if Im not in love with you then theres no chance to see this through  
Again  
  
So if youre still in love with me then why wont you just set me free  
Cause if Im not in love with you then theres no chance to see this through  
Again
