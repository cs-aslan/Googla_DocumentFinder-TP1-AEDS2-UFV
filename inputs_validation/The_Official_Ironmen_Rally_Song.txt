Bitter fish in crude oil sea  
You dont have to bother me  
You just have to join in on this song  
  
Crawling people on your knees  
Dont take this so seriously  
You just have to hum it all day long  
  
To dine alone  
To build a private zone  
Or trigger a synapse  
And free us from our traps  
  
You wont see me turn my back  
With my head against my stack  
Spitting teeth and breaking open skin  
  
Official ironmen you are free  
Champions officially  
But you wont catch me on an open chin  
  
To dine alone  
To build a private zone  
Or trigger a synapse  
And free us from our traps  
  
Save your knockout punches for the freaks  
Happy little babies with red cheeks  
You will rock them gently out of sync  
  
Confirmations through the wire  
Spitting gas into the fire  
Am I also worthy of a drink  
  
To dine alone  
To build a private zone  
Or trigger a synapse  
And free us from our traps
