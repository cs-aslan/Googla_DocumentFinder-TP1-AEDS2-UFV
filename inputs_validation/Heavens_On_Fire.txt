You think your soul is nice  
Youve lived in paradise  
So now you take the stand  
You want to hold your masters hand  
You think your soul is free  
Look up and youll see me  
The pearly gates ablaze  
The angels bear the zombies gaze  
Heavens on fire  
And there aint nothing you can do  
Heavens on fire  
And when you die youll go there too  
The angels life their death  
No there aint nothing left  
The clowns of God despise  
But torment renders no disguise  
The skies a blazing tomb  
Plenty sorrow plenty doom  
They hattle living sin  
The souls of God cant hate to win  
If God is so almighty  
They why is he enslaved  
In heavens hell by satan  
The universe his slave  
Satan rides the skies  
Look up youll see his eyes  
Disguised as endless stars  
To keep an eye on endless wars  
Do you believe in God  
Hes chained up like a dog  
And every hour he screams  
Satan rules supreme
