I am a small and lonely grape  
Clutching to the vine  
Waiting for the day when Ill become my Saviors wine  
Oh wouldnt French cuisine just yearn it  
Ive eternity to ferment  
But knowing me Id end up ripple  
In a cellar of cheblis  
Are you a small and lonely grape  
Clutching to the vine  
Waiting for the day when youll become your Saviors wine  
Dont give up hope ye heavy laden  
You dont want to be a raisin  
Theres a grape grape joy in Jesus  
In the vineyard of The Lord
