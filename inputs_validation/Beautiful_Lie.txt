Everytime the bluebird sings  
My heart takes wings to the sky  
The bluebird greyside fly  
To my place in your eyes  
Cause after all I did all I could  
And you did your best just the same  
Nobody won we both lost no ones to blame  
But Ill fly away to you if only pretending  
Well be like bluebird do the beautiful lie  
The beautiful lie the beautiful lie  
Everytime the bluebird sings  
My heart takes wings to the sky  
The bluebird greyside fly  
To my place in your eyes  
Cause after all I did all I could  
And you did your best just the same  
Nobody won we both lost no ones to blame  
But Ill find my way to you if Im only pretending  
And well be like bluebirds live the beautiful lie  
Well be like bluebirds live the beautiful lie
