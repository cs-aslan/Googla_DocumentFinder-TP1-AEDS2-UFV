Im always running behind the time  
Just like this train  
Shaking into town  
With the brakes complaining  
  
I used to count lovers like railroad cars  
I counted them on my side  
Lately I dont count on nothing  
I just let things slide  
  
The station masters shuffling cards  
Boxcars are banging in the yards  
Jealous IovinIl make you crazy  
If you cant find your goodness  
Cause you lost your heart  
  
I went looking for a cause  
Or a strong cat without claws  
Or any reason to resume  
And I found this empty seat  
In this crowded waiting room  
Everybody waiting  
Old man sleeping on his bags  
Women with that teased up kind of hair  
Kids with the jitters in their legs  
And those wide wide open stares  
And the kids got cokes and chocolate bars  
Theres a thin man smoking a fat cigar  
Jealous lovinlI make you crazy  
If you cant find your goodness  
Cause youve lost your heart  
  
What are you going to do now  
Youve got no one  
To give your love too  
  
Well Ive got this berth and this roll down blind  
Ive got this fold up sink  
And these rocks and these cactus going by  
And a bottle of German wine to drink  
Settle down into the clickety cIack  
With the clouds and the stars to read  
Dreaming of the pleasure Im going to have  
Watching your hairline recede  
My vain darling  
Watching your hair and clouds and stars  
Im rocking away in a sleeping car  
This jealous lovins bound to make me  
Crazy  
I cant find my goodness  
I lost my heart  
Oh sour grapes  
Because I lost my heart
