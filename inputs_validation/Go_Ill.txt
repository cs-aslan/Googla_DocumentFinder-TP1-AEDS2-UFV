Verse 1  
Get on upi walk the beat and walk it with clarity  
I want to make sure alls hearin me  
Ducks whos bummin I found your hide away  
Im livin large yall so by the way  
Who rocked the crowd and rocks it loud  
On the strengths yall Im takin bows now  
Kickin up lyrics that others want to rock to  
Rock like me yall this you cant do  
The v the a the n the i the lla yall

Chorus  
Go ill go ill get on up go ill go ill get on up  
Go ill go ill get on up go ill go ill get on up  
Verse 2  
Hold on girl let your feet move free  
cause you move to the groove of vanilla iseee  
You come here to rock and let the white boy rap  
If you a ho get off my lap  
cause ice stands for bein so cold  
Thats a nickname I got for bein so bold  
Jerome stands for mpa  
My personal assistant every day  
Im not an mc who come here to play  
Yo boy Im serious Im goin all the way  
Rhymes are clean theres no need to be ill  
And when Im on the mic I let em all spill  
Chorus  
Verse 3  
I rock the mic like Im a fanatic  
When I see one I got to have it  
Ill whip up a sound thatll burst your eardrum  
What you gonna do dont you play dumb  
Busy like kizzy groovin like rubin  
Dont care what you do just keep movin  
Shakin your limbs until they wear thin  
I make your butt shake just watch the boy grin  
Simple like simon with ice rhymin  
Some mcs fakin it but Im the diamond  
Im the rhyme doctor always on call  
You watch your fries boy or Im gonna take yours  
Chorus  
Verse 4  
Start skeezin and move that hip girl  
Get in the mood and dont you quit  
Smooth as slime king rhyme  
Rock it boy cause its a craime  
Ill make you scream like youre in between  
When Im on the mic yes Im the king  
cause Im hungry as a dog ill eat up  
My rhymes are runnin dont interrupt  
cause Im a throne overtaker not an mc faker  
I like my coffee but I cant stand sanka  
Chorus
