If Im hot for you and youre hot for me  
What you got for me is no shock to me  
Cant believe that youre my property  
The sound of you clappin on top of me  
The feeling of hitting the lottery  
Or passing go twice in monopoly  
But they dont compare to what you got for me  
The taste of the puddin is so chocolaty  
Im so conceited so obscene  
And still got my sneakers and my chain all leanin  
And when I hit it right it start gleamin  
Mean faces for what was the reason  
Chop it a little bit  
Its hard to read you like Im illiterate  
But Im ready for the graduation  
Yeah go ahead and repeat that rotation  
  
Chorus  
Give me all you got baby 2nite  
Nows the perfect time  
Come blow my mind  
Its cold out here please let me come inside  
Oh so warm at night  
You blow my mind hey  
  
You can go ahead and talk greasy  
Tell me that you never had it this deeply  
Im a whisper slick you respond sweetly  
Extra freaky I trick and you treat me  
Ill give you take but dont hesitate  
When you feel it go and throw it right back  
Just let me hold ya by ya shoulders  
Then you can take it like that  
I knew you was a champ girl got your leg  
On the dresser kickin the lamp girl  
Run the shower lets go in the bathroom girl  
Cause the temperature is hotter than high noon girl  
Crack that door let the steam flow  
Aint nobody here but me and you let it go  
You never it this good you already know  
Give me all you got girl really though  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre the sexiest woman Ive ever known  
My mind is blown  
Youre simple beautiful how you do it to me  
Youre showin me things id never do  
Whole nother side of you  
Just keep what you do it feels like oh we  
  
You can go ahead and hit a wild climax  
Aint no way Im bout to let you relax let me see if  
You can hold me on ya back  
Let me see ya body wine to the track  
Chop it a little bit  
Hard to read you it feels like Im illiterate  
But Im ready for the graduation  
Yeah go ahead and repeat that rotation
