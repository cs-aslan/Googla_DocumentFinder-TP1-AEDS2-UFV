I wrote a letter to man sealed my envelope with hope and a stamp  
Give me a minute and Ill be on my way  
Cause I got something for yall today  
Well I was walking yesterday I gave you a smile and then you turned  
I said nothing cause thats all that I could say  
I said nothing cause thats all that I could say  
Give it back to me  
Let me go let me go let me go home  
Well I was thinking yesterday about what I would do and maybe what I would
say  
If I had that minute if I had it back today  
Cause I got something for yall today  
Give it back to me  
Let me go let me go when can I go when can I go home  
You find yourself by alone  
Wondering what to do so you pick up the phone  
But she doesnt say a thing and she isnt even home  
But thats okay because youre on your own  
Let me go let me go when can I go home
