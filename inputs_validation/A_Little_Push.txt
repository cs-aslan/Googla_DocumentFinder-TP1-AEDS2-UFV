Funny how you never know  
Where your heart is gonna go  
Suddenly youre being pulled  
Into a rising undertow  
What started as a little rain  
Grows into a hurricane  
Ridin on a wave desire flowin  
Crashin through your veins  
What you want I know  
What you need  
I think you need a little push in my direction  
If youre gonna fall in love  
All you needs a little nudge  
And I will catch you when you fall  
I think its only fair to bring to your attention  
Youre about to fall in love  
Yes youre gonna fall in love  
Youre opening a different door  
Curious to know the score  
So afraid that once inside  
You wont be leaving anymore  
And while your hesitation burns  
Youre gonna be surprised to learn  
How easy itll be to get you to  
The point of no return  
What you want I know  
What you need  
I think you need a little push in my direction  
If youre gonna fall in love  
All you needs a little nudge  
And I will catch you when you fall  
I think its only fair to bring to your attention  
Youre about to fall in love  
Yes youre gonna fall in love  
You fear love thats real love  
Expecting ideal love  
Its hard to conceal love oh  
Deny what you feel love you feel love  
I think you need a little push in my direction  
If youre gonna fall in love  
All you needs a little nudge  
And I will catch you when you fall  
I think its only fair to bring to your attention  
Youre about to fall in love  
Yes youre gonna fall in love
