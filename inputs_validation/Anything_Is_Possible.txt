Stay please stay with me tonight  
And all the stars up in my Heaven  
Theyre shinin bright  
Oh anything is possible  
I know it if you stay  
Oh I will catch you if you fall  
Oh baby baby  
I know it hurts but it hurts me more and more  
I hear your heartbeat baby louder than before  
And when I cry I cry for you  
Cause I know you are the only  
And when I die I die for you  
Cause I know your heart is lonely  
Oh anything is possible  
I know it if you stay  
I will catch you if you fall  
Oh baby baby  
Oh anything is possible  
I know it from my heart  
I will try oh if you call  
Dont leave me girl dont leave me here tonight  
Oh Im so lonely  
Dont leave me girl and all the feelings right  
Oh youre the only  
I know it hurts you  
You are walking out my dreams  
Youve set my heart on fire  
And now youre gone it seems  
My dying heart it cries for you  
Cause I know you are my only  
Dont break apart cant let you go  
Cause I know my heart is lonely  
Oh anything is possible  
I know it if you stay  
I will catch you if you fall  
Oh baby baby  
Oh anything is possible  
I know it from my heart  
I will try oh if you call  
Dont leave me girl dont leave me here tonight  
Oh Im so lonely  
Dont leave me girl and all the feelings right  
Oh youre the only  
Dont leave me girl dont leave me here tonight  
Oh Im so lonely
