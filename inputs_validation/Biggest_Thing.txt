Up through all the streets you go  
But little girl dont find her name  
And were all gone down roads to homes  
Where everybody finds their game  
  
Just behind the street she goes  
Where shell be found behind her wheel  
Cause its the only place she knows  
That makes her know just how she feels  
  
Cause youre the biggest thing  
That I see  
Youve got me where you want me  
You hunt me down you haunt me  
And beg me to believe  
  
All too fast to where she goes  
But wholl be first to find her name  
And holding on in Hollywood  
But holding on dont make the grade  
  
Just about when its all right  
Theres you and I  well find our way  
But its holidays not Hollywood  
And holidays dont suit my game  
  
Cause youre the biggest thing  
That I see  
Youve got me where you want me  
You hunt me down and haunt me  
And beg me to believe  
  
Hollow days and hollow nights  
But everyone they find their way  
It hightlights you when things aint right  
And makes you want to find your place  
  
Cause youre the biggest thing  
That I see  
Youve got me where you want me  
You hunt me down you haunt me  
And beg me to believe  
  
Cause youre the biggest thing  
That I see  
Youve got me where you want me  
You hunt me downyou haunt me  
And beg me to believe
