Im so undemanding  
Cause they so love is blind  
Ive lived this life pretending  
I can bear this hurt deep inside  
The truth is that Im longing  
For love thats so divine  
Ive searched this whole world wishing  
Shell be there time after time  
  
Someone put your hand out  
Im begging for your love  
Cause all I do is hand out  
A heart that needs your love  
  
Ive lived my life the lonely  
A soul that cries of shame  
And handicapped emotions  
Save me now from what still remains  
Ill be your story hero  
Ill serenade in rhyme  
Im just needing that someone  
Save me now am I the one  
  
Someone put your hand out  
Im begging for your love  
Cause all I do is hand out  
A heart that needs your love  
Someone put your hand out  
Im begging for your love  
Cause all I do is hand out  
A heart that needs your love  
  
When you say we will dance till the light of day  
Its just like the children in Earths joy  
When we pray will you promise me youll always stay  
Its because Im needing that someone  
  
Someone put your hand out  
Im begging for your love  
Cause all I do is hand out  
A heart that needs your love  
Someone put your hand out  
Im begging for your love  
Cause all I do is hand out  
  
Someone put your hand out  
Im begging for your love  
Cause all I do is hand out  
Love
