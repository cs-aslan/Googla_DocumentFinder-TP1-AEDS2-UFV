One morning when I was ridin in my old pickup truck  
A beautiful bluebird came flyin down  
My eyes caught the color as it led me down the road  
Dippin and bobbin in the sun  
  
Beautiful bluebird see how she flies  
Looks like shes always goin home  
If heaven had a window where the sun came shinin through  
Like a beautiful bluebird Id come flyin back to you  
  
Beautiful bluebird see how she flies  
Looks like shes always goin home  
  
Ive never seen that blue before except in one place  
And shes not here with me right now  
And just like a lover I watched her fly away  
And thats what I remember now  
  
Beautiful bluebird see how she flies  
Looks like shes always goin home  
If heaven had a window where the sun came shinin through  
Like a beautiful bluebird Id come flyin back to you  
  
Beautiful bluebird see how she flies  
Looks like shes always goin home  
  
Beautiful bluebird see how she flies  
Looks like shes always goin home  
  
If heaven had a window where the sun came shinin through  
Like a beautiful bluebird Id come flyin back to you  
  
If heaven had a window where the sun came shinin through  
Like a beautiful bluebird Id come flyin back to you
