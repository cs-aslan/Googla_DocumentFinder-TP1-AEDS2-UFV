Youve known so long that you were wrong  
But still you had your way  
You told her lies and alibis  
And hurt her more each day  
But now your conscience bothers you  
Youve reached your journeys end  
Youre asking me for sympathy  
Im sorry for you my friend  
  
You laughed inside each time she cried  
You tried to make her blue  
She tagged along through right and wrong  
Because she worshiped you  
You know that youre the one to blame  
Theres no use to pretend  
Todays the day you start to pay  
Im sorry for you my friend  
  
Today as she walked arm in arm  
At someone elses side  
It made you stop and realize  
That time has turned the tide  
You should have known youd be alone  
cause cheaters never win  
You tried and lost now pay the cost  
Im sorry for you my friend
