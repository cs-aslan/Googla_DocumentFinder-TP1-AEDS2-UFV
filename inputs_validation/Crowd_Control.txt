Listen now Im talking  
Ive been here for weeks  
Waiting in this growing crowd  
Staring at my feet  
  
The world around mes turning  
Im just standing still  
The time has come for changes  
Do something or I will  
  
Im a feather in a storm  
Im a raindrop in the sea  
If I dont get enough of you  
Im a lighter shade of me  
  
Sisters brothers all around you  
Theres a devil in the crowd  
Meet his eye and its the end of time  
If youre praying dont be loud  
  
Its crowded in the lowland  
But the fools stay on the hill  
You control us now  
You have the reins  
Do something or we will  
  
So show us why we came here  
Before we lay on the ground  
Give it to us loud and clear  
Make the devil turn around  
  
The world around mes turning  
Im just standing still  
The time has come for changes  
Do something or I will  
  
Its crowded in the lowlands  
But the fools stay on the hill  
You control us now  
You have the reins  
Do something or we will  
  
So show us why we came here  
Before we lay on the ground  
Give it to us loud and clear  
Make the devil turn around  
  
The world around mes turning  
Im just standing still  
The time has come for changes  
Do something or I will  
  
The time has come for changes  
Do something or I will  
The time has come for changes  
Do something or I will
