Shes mostly gone some other place  
Im getting by in other ways  
Everything they whispered in our ear  
Is coming true  
  
Trying to justify the things I used to do  
Believe in you  
  
Watching you drown  
Ill follow you down  
I am here right beside you  
  
The lights in the sky  
Have finally arrived  
I am staying right beside you  
Trying to stay away  
Just in case  
Ive come to realize we all have our place  
Time time has a way you know to make it clear  
And I have my room and yes I cant disappear  
Or leave you here  
  
Watching you drown  
Ill follow you down  
And I am here right beside you  
The lights in the sky are waving goodbye  
And I am staying right beside you
