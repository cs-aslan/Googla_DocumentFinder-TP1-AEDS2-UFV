Ive seen em doing battle  
Ive heard in times of war  
Still I keep on going  
Though its different than before  
Theyve been riding high  
Up where the cold winds blow  
Miles above that highway  
Where the rest of us all go  
  
To find out  
You have to find out  
Its good to find out  
Before you open your mouth  
Find out  
Now dont you find out  
You better find out  
Before you fill in the blanks  
  
Go find out what it takes  
To make a boy break down and cry  
Go find out his young mistake  
Is a premature goodbye its a privilege you can buy  
  
Find out  
Where it goes  
Find out  
Faster roads  
Find out  
It never grows  
Find out  
For yourself  
  
You never tried to find the time it takes  
To work it out  
Its not a waste to taste  
The sweat it takes  
To work it out  
  
Work  
  
You dont need a battle  
You dont need a war  
You dont need any lessons  
To find out whats in store  
  
You been riding high  
You felt the cold winds blow  
Now get back on the highway  
Where the others have to go  
  
And find out  
And maybe when you do  
Youll even find out  
You havent got a clue  
Unless you find out  
Its never like they say  
Your gonna find out  
Youll take it all the way  
  
Go find out what it takes  
To make a boy break down and cry  
Go find out his young mistake  
Is a premature goodbye its a privilege you can buy  
  
You never tried to find the time it takes  
To work it out  
Its not a waste to taste  
The sweat it takes  
To work it out  
  
Find out  
Before you open your mouth  
You better find out
