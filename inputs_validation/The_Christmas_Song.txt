Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide songs being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
They know that Santas on his way  
Hes loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mothers child will want to spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so Im offering this simple phrase  
For kids from one to ninetytwo  
Although its been said many times many ways  
Merry Christmas to you  
They know that Santas on his way
