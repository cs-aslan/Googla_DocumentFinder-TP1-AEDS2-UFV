I can only speak for  
The things that Ive been through  
So when it comes to our love  
Ill talk the whole night through  
About the love Ive been missin  
Lately baby I aint had no kissin  
Dont you love me  
Cant we stay together  
  
Like when we used to be in love  
But now youve got your head on another cloud  
Girl we had a good thing  
But now youve turned around  
Dont you care how this love weve had turns out  
  
Promise me youll leave me never  
And that well be in love forever  
Promise me youll leave me never  
And that well be in love forever  
  
We can work at our love  
And make it all brandnew  
If we stay together  
Theres nothing we cant do  
Improve the lovin is what Im seeing  
Lets do it baby  
Dont fight the feeling  
Wont you love me  
Cant we stay together
