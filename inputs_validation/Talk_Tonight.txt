Sittin on my own  
Chewin on a bone  
A thousand million miles from home  
When something hit me  
Somewhere right between the eyes  
  
Sleepin on a plane  
You know you cant complain  
You took your last chance once again  
I landed stranded  
Hardly even knew your name  
  
I want to talk tonight  
Until the mornin light  
Bout how you saved my life  
You and me see how we are  
You and me see how we are  
  
All your dreams are made  
Of strawberry lemonade  
And you make sure I eat today  
You take me walking  
To where you played when you were young  
  
Ill never say that  
I wont ever make you cry  
And this Ill say I dont know why  
I know Im leavin  
But Ill be back another day  
  
I want to talk tonight  
Until the mornin light  
Bout how you saved my life  
You saved my life  
I want to talk tonight  
I want to talk tonight  
Bout how you saved my life  
I want to talk tonight  
Bout how you saved my life  
I want to talk tonight  
Bout how you saved my life  
I want to talk tonight  
Bout how you saved my life  
I want to talk tonight 4x
