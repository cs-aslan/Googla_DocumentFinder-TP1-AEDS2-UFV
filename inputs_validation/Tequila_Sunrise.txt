Its another tequila sunrise  
Starin slowly cross the sky said goodbye  
He was just a hired hand  
Workin on the dreams he planned to try  
The days go by  
  
Evry night when the sun goes down  
Just another lonely boy in town  
And shes out runnin round  
  
She wasnt just another woman  
And I couldnt keep from comin on  
Its been so long  
Oh and its a hollow feelin when  
It comes down to dealin friends  
It never ends  
  
Take another shot of courage  
Wonder why the right words never come  
You just get numb  
Its another tequila sunrise this old world  
Still looks the same  
Another frame mm
