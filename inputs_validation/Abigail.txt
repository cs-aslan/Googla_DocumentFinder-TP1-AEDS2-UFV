Abigail I know Youre in control of her brain Abigail  
And I know that Youre the one thats  
speaking through her Abigail  
Miriam can You hear me  
  
I am alive inside Your Wife  
Miriams dead I am her head  
  
Abigail dont You think I know what  
Youve done Abigail  
Ill get a priest he will know  
How to get her soul back  
  
Oh Jonathan this is Miriam  
Our time is out  
Remember the stairs its the only way  
  
Abigail nothing I can do but give in Abigail

Miriams dead I am her head soon Ill be free
