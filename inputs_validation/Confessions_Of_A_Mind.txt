She goes away for a couple of days  
So you phone a few number you fancy a change  
You say youll miss her but deep down inside  
There are thoughts of another girl waiting somewhere for you  
  
Shes been away for a couple of days  
The affairs werent so good so youre mending your ways  
You realize that theres nobody else who can do what she does for you  
You tell yourself dont be a fool  
Dont let her go chase as hard as you can  
Or youll be the loser  
Swallow your pride you can still be a man  
Shell never refuse you  
  
She deserved to be loved she wants to love you  
If you went away you know shed be true yes you do  
  
Baby i was lonely still love you only but i was a bad boy  
Know you couldnt see me thought youd never leave me so i was bad boy  
Even though im trying there is no denying i am just a bad boy  
Met a little baby thought she was a lady still i was a bad boy  
  
She gives me everything a girls supposed to do  
She gives me everything still i cant be true  
She gives me everything she gives me everything  
  
Going off to different places  
All i see is different faces  
I love them all but not like you  
  
She deserves to be loved she wants to love you  
If you went away you know shed be true yes you do  
  
She deserves to be loved  yes she does you know she does  
She deserves to be loved  even if she goes away  
She deserves to be loved  no one else can take her place  
She deserves to be loved  youll be the loser if you let her go  
She deserves to be loved  she gives you everything a girls supposed to do  
She deserves to be loved  you love them all but shes the one for you  
She deserves to be loved  yes she does you know she does  
She deserves to be loved  even if she goes away  
She deserves to be loved  no one else can take her place
