Whats your lie  
Warm glance a fake smile  
Eyes meet your mind runs wild  
This game you play I like in a way  
  
You expect to grab a child grab a child  
You think Im innocent not wild  
Take me lets see how much Im tamed  
  
Everybody listen while I think of all I know  
How to live for sure  body wall into my precious soul  
Ill show you fears pleasure pain is my control  
Let your body lay in there warm flesh to your fear  
  
Warm lips a big smile  
Hatred runs through your insides  
This game you play  intimidation each day

Anger twisted your life into pain
