Shes a face without a soul  
This ladys heart is gold  
Shes a face without a soul  
This ladys heart is gold  
  
Though her hands are cool theyll burn  
You may kiss her but youll have to take your turn  
In her life youre just another bird in the sky  
When she says you must be ready to fly  
Ready to fly up and fly away  
  
Shes a face without a soul  
This ladys heart is gold  
Shes a face without a soul  
This ladys heart is gold  
  
This lady has no love  
Herself perhaps is who she puts above  
Everything and of course everyone  
Knows this lady thinks shes number one  
Number one yes the only one  
  
Shes a face without a soul  
This ladys heart is gold  
Shes a face without a soul  
This ladys heart is gold  
  
Shes gonna fall on her face someday  
Find other men for her games to play  
Im gonna make sure everyone knows  
What she is trying to do  
  
Shes a face without a soul  
This ladys heart is gold  
Shes a face without a soul
