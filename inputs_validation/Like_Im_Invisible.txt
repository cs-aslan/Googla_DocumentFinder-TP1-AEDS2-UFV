You talk about me as if Im not there  
You dont even whisper cause you just dont care  
I stand there and listen to my life go by  
And at times I wonder why I even try  
  
Well I try because I like to finish what I start  
And I have faith it can get better tomorrow  
But it wont if you keep treating me  
Like Im invisible  
  
Say that you wont treat me  
The way youre treating me  
Say that you wont  
I see you but you just keep looking right through me  
Like someone you dont even see  
Like Im invisible  
  
You brag to your friends how much I must want ya  
You said I was someone you could do with or without  
Youre so confident that Id never leave you  
No wonder youre surprised that I am walking out  
  
Well I have to leave no matter how sad it might be  
Because this hurts become my reality  
And I wont let you keep on treating me  
Like Im invisible  
  
Say that you wont treat me  
The way youre treating me  
Say that you wont  
I see you but you just keep looking right through me  
Like someone you dont even see  
Like Im invisible  
  
Well I finally got the nerve to move on  
cause a fly kind of guy like me  
Surely deserves more much more  
My new love can see whats inside of me  
And she told me to thank you  
For the good love that you blew and oh  
  
I wish you could see the way she looks at me  
She dont keep me insecure or treat me lovelessly  
She dont hide me from her friends when we have company  
And she never ever makes me feel  
Like Im invisible  
  
And after we lay here she wants me to stay here  
Im not just for making love then expected to leave  
Im not only someone used for helping her ends meet  
And shed never ever walk on by me  
Like Im invisible  
  
Like Im invisible
