At first when I heard of some people who claim  
That the oldtime religion was real  
I said Ill go down take a look at the crowd  
For just that weakminded I feel  
  
I walked up the steps and I peeked in the door  
But the devil said dont you go in  
But I said it wont hurt me Ill just step inside  
And Ill set as far back as I can but  
  
Chorus  
Something got a hold of me praise god  
Yes something got a hold of me oh lord  
I went there to fight but Ill tell you that night  
God certainly got a hold of me  
  
They sang like they meant it they all clapped their hands  
I said its commotion thats all  
when they get down to pray Ill just get up and leave  
For I dont wanta be seen here at all  
  
But I bowed that time he got started to preach  
And he looked straight down at me  
He told evrybody how mean that I was  
He didnt talk like he thought much of me  
  
I sat in my seat just thinkin it oer  
And then they all started to pray  
The fire fell from heaven I fell to the floor  
I prayed there and God had his way for  
  
Chorus
