Lets take the phone off the hook  
Turn the lights way down low  
Baby put down that book  
Tell the maid to go  
Do not disturb  
Hang the sign on the door  
Do not disturb  
Its time to make love  
And I cant wait anymore  
Ill just pull down the blind  
Now come over here  
Ive got one thing in mind  
Lets get comfortable dear  
Do not disturb  
Hang the sign on the door  
Do not disturb  
Its time to make love  
And I cant wait anymore  
Everythings right tonight  
Mmmm its great when we kiss  
Now your arms hold me tight  
Lets stay like this
