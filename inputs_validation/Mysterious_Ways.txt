Johnny take a walk  
With your sister the moon  
Let her pale light in  
To fill up your room  
Youve been living underground  
Eating from a can  
Youve been running away  
From what you dont understand  
Love  
  
Shes slippy  
Youre sliding down  
Shell be there  
When you hit the ground  
  
Its alright its alright its alright  
She moves in mysterious ways  
Its alright its alright its alright  
She moves in mysterious ways  
  
Johnny take a dive  
With your sister in the rain  
Let her talk about the things  
You cant explain  
To touch is to heal  
To hurt is to steal  
If you want to kiss the sky  
Better learn how to kneel on your knees boy  
  
Shes the wave  
She turns the tide  
She sees the man inside the child yeah  
  
Its alright its alright its alright  
She moves in mysterious ways  
Its alright its alright its alright  
She moves in mysterious ways  
Its alright its alright its alright  
Lift my days light up my nights  
  
One day youll look back  
And when you see  
Where you were held  
How by this love  
While you could stand there  
You could move on this moment  
Follow this feeling  
  
Its alright its alright its alright  
She moves in mysterious ways  
Its alright its alright its alright  
She moves in mysterious ways  
Ah oh oh ah huh  
Move move move move  
She moves with it  
She moves me like  
Lift my days and light up my nights  
Love
