One life Im gonna live it up  
Im takin I said Ill never get enough  
Stand tall Im uh young and kind of proud  
Im on the top but as long as the musics loud  
  
If you think Ill sit around as the world goes by  
Youre thinkin like a fool cause its a case of do or die  
Out there is a fortune waiting to be had  
If you think Ill let you go youre mad  
Youve got another thing comin  
Youve got another thing comin  
  
Thats right heres where the talking ends  
Well listen this night therell be some action spent  
Drive hard callin all the shots  
I got an ace card comin down rocks  
  
If you think Ill sit around while you chip away my brain  
Listen I aint foolin and youd better think again  
Out there is a fortune waiting to be had  
If you think Ill let it go youre mad  
Youve got another thing comin  
Youve got another thing comin  
Youve got another thing comin  
  
In this world were livin in we have our share of sorrow  
Answer now and dont give in aim for a new tomorrow

Real strong got me some security  
Hey Im a big smash Im goin for infinity yeah  
  
If you think Ill sit around as the world goes by  
Youre thinkin like a fool cause its a case of do or die  
Out there is a fortune waiting to be had
