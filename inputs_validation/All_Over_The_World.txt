All over the world  
All over the world  
  
Love is the thing  
Its the one thing youll see  
All that it takes  
Is a he and a she  
  
All over the world  
All over the world  
  
Love was and love is  
And always will be  
All over the world  
  
Whether youre in  
Maine or California  
Doesnt matter I know  
You can be in Tennessee or  
You can be in old Mexico  
  
It can happen  
Summer spring or fall or  
When the winter winds blow  
Love is a wonderful thing  
  
Lovers can be found  
In foggy London town  
In Rome or Peru  
  
Even in Damascus  
Lovers never ask us  
What they should do  
  
You dont have to park  
In Paris after dark  
To know that its true  
Love is a wonderful thing  
  
All over the world  
All over the world  
  
Love was and love is  
And always will be  
All over the world  
All over the world
