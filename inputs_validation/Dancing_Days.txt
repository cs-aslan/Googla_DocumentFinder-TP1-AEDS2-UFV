Original by  Led Zeppelin  
  
Dancing days are here again  
As the summer evenings grow  
I got my flower I got my power  
I got a woman who knows  
Chorus  
  
I said its alright  
You know its alright  
I guess its all in my heart  
  
Youll be my only my one and only  
Is that the way it should start  
Crazy ways are evident  
In the way that youre wearing your clothes  
Suppin boze is precedent  
As the evening starts to glow  
Chorus  
I told your mamma Id get you home  
But I didnt tell her I had no car  
I saw a lion he was standing alone  
With a tadpole in a jar  
Chorus  
Dancing days are here again  
As the summer evening grows  
You are my flower you are my power  
You are my woman who knows  
Chorus
