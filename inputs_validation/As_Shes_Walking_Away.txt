We never spoke a word  
But every thought she had I heard from across the room  
  
If we were standing face to face  
I couldnt find the words to say  
Give me one more move  
  
I dont even know her name  
I guess foolish prides to blame  
  
Now Im falling in love as shes walking away  
And my heart wont tell my mind to tell my mouth what it should say  
May have lost this battle live to fight another day  
Now Im falling in love  
As shes walking away  
  
Wise man next to me did say  
Bout the one that got away  
Son I missed my chance  
  
Dont you let regret take place  
Of the dreams you have to chase  
Ask her to dance go on son  
  
You might fall down on your face  
Roll the dice and have some faith  
  
And dont be falling in love as shes walking away  
When your heart wont tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say  
May have lost this battle live to fight another day  
Dont be falling in love  
As shes walking away  
  
You might fall down on your face  
Roll the dice and have some faith  
  
And dont be falling in love as shes walking away  
When your heart wont tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say  
May have lost this battle live to fight another day  
Dont be falling falling falling in love  
As shes walking away
