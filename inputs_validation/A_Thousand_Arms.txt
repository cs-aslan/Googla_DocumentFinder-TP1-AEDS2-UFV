A thousand arms to hold you tight  
Five hundreds hours to love you right  
  
Darling each and every day Ive known you  
I fall in love with you a little more  
More than just my arms and hours can show you  
Maybe thats why I keep wishin for  
  
A thousand arms to hold you tight  
Five hundreds hours to love you right  
A thousand arms to never let you go  
Five hundred hours to always love you so  
  
It seems I just cant do enough things for you  
To ever pay you back for lovin me  
I idolize and worship and adore you  
Still if I had one wish that wish would be  
  
A thousand arms to hold you tight  
Five hundreds hours to love you right  
A thousand arms to never let you go  
Five hundred hours to always love you so  
  
A thousand arms to hold you tight  
Five hundreds hours to love you right  
A thousand arms to never let you go  
Five hundred hours to always love you so
