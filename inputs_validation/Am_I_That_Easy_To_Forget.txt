They say youve found somebody new  
But that wont stop my lovin you  
I just cant let you walk away  
Forget the love I had for you  
  
Guess I could find somebody too  
But I dont want no one but you  
How could you leave without regret  
Am I that easy to forget  
  
Before you leave be sure you find  
You want his love much more than mine  
Cause Ill just say weve never met  
If Im that easy to forget  
  
Before you leave be sure you find  
You want his love much more than mine  
Cause Ill just say weve never met  
If Im that easy to forget
