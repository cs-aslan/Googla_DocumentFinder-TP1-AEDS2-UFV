Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm  
I am the black crow king  
Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm  
I am the black crow king  
Keeper of the nodding corn  
Bam Bam Bam Bam  
All the hammers are atalking  
All the nails are asinging  
So sweet and low  
You can hear it in the valley  
Where live the lame and the blind  
They climb the hill out of its belly  
They leave with mean black boots on  
I just made a simple gesture  
They jumped up and nailed it to my shadow  
My gesture was a hooker  
You know my shadows made of timber   
And the storm is arolling  
And the storm is arolling  
All down on me  
And Im still here rolling after everybodys gone  
And Im still here rolling after everybodys gone  
Ahm still here rolling and Im left on my own  
The blackbirds have all flown  
Everyones rolled on  
I am the black crow king  
Keeper of the trodden corn  
I am the black crow king  
Wont say it again  
And the rain it raineth daily  
Lord  
And wash away my clothes  
I surrender up my arms  
To a company of crows  
I am the black crow king  
I wont say it again  
And all the thorns are acrowning  
King ruby on each spine  
And the spears are asailing  
O my o my  
And the storm is arolling  
And the storm is arolling  
All down on me  
And Im still here rolling after everybodys gone  
And Im still here rolling after everybodys gone  
Im still here rolling and left on my own  
Those blackbirds they have all flown and  
I am on my own  
I am the black crow king  
Keeper of the forgotten corn  
The King The King  
Im the king of nuthin at all  
The hammers are atalking  
The nails are asinging  
The thorns are acrowning him  
The spears are asailing  
The crows are amocking  
The corn is anodding  
The storm is arolling  
The storm is arolling  
The storm is arolling down  
The storm is arolling down  
The storm is arolling  
Down on me  
Rolling down on me  
Rolling down on me
