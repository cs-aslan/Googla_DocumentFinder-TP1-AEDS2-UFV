Painted blue across my eyes  
And tied the linen on  
And Im on my way  
Looking for the paradigm  
So I can pass it off  
Is it on my side  
  
Is to the sky  
Looking to the sky and down  
Searching for a ground  
With my good eye closed  
  
If I took you for a ride  
Would you take it wrong  
Or would you make it right  
Looking for a pedestal  
That I can put you on  
And be on my way  
  
Is it to the sky  
Looking to the sky and down  
Searching for a ground  
With my good eye closed  
  
Stop youre trying to bruise my mind  
I can do it on my own  
Stop youre trying to kill my time  
Its been my death since I was born  
I dont remember have the time  
If Im hiding or Im lost  
But Im on my way
