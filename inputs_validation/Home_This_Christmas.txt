Looking out the window  
Waiting for your headlights  
To pull up in the driveway  
Its really coming down tonight  
Youre scared that I wont make it through the storm  
You should be here with me safe and warm  
  
Ill be waiting under the mistletoe  
While youre driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
Pacing down the hallway  
Trying to fight the urge to call  
I could almost hear a pin drop  
Cept for the clock on the wall  
And Im scared you wont make it through the storm  
You should be here with me safe and warm  
  
Ill be waiting under the mistletoe  
While youre driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
Im praying that you make it home tonight  
So we can lay down by the fireside  
You and I till Christmas morning  
Theres nothing else that I want this year  
More than just to have you here whoa  
Ill be waiting  
  
Ill be waiting under the mistletoe  
While youre driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
Looking out the window  
Waiting for your head lights  
To pull up in the driveway  
Its really coming down tonight
