They say the world must end somehow  
They say the ends not far from now  
I think theyre wrong  
Dont worry your life away  
Start living for today  
Dont think about tomorrow  
  
Chorus  
And if the lights go out  
On all of us  
In just a year or two  
And if the sky falls down  
Like pouring rain  
Then Ill be here with you  
Ill go down with you  
  
Well Im gonna try  
For all Im worth  
To stay with you till the ends of the earth  
Dont let me down  
Dont let your feelings win  
Dont give out and dont give in  
Dont think about tomorrow  
  
Chorus x2
