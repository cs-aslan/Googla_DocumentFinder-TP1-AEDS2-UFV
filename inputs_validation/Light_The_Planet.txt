Lyrics  
Oh yeah  
Light it up  
Theres no love where  
Theres no life  
Where its dark  
And we fuss and fight  
Weve gotta lighten up  
Weve gotta open up  
Everybody  
Gotta light the world up  
Any man  
Aint that bad  
Neither is  
Being sad  
We gotta let it out  
Scream and shout  
Letting go is  
What its all about  
Well its time to give  
Be positive  
Open up  
Then you can live  
Just check your motive  
Make sure its positive  
In everything you do  
There must be love  
Gotta light it up  
Light that world  
Oh yeah  
Heres the score  
No more war  
Just lots of love with  
Open doors  
To a higher realm  
Where hate is sensitive  
Remember open up and  
Love one and all  
You know what Im talkin about  
Just gotta lighten up
