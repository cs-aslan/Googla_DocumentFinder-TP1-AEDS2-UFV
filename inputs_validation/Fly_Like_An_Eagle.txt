Time keeps on slippin slippin slippin  
Into the future  
Time keeps on slippin slippin slippin  
Into the future  
  
I want to fly like an eagle  
To the sea  
Fly like an eagle  
Let my spirit carry me  
I want to fly like an eagle  
Till Im free  
Oh Lord through the revolution  
  
Feed the babies  
Who dont have enough to eat  
Shoe the children  
With no shoes on their feet  
House the people  
Livin in the street  
Oh oh theres a solution  
  
I want to fly like an eagle  
To the sea  
Fly like an eagle  
Let my spirit carry me  
I want to fly like an eagle  
Till Im free  
Fly through the revolution  
  
Time keeps on slippin slippin slippin  
Into the future  
Time keeps on slippin slippin slippin  
Into the future  
Time keeps on slippin slippin slippin  
Into the future  
Time keeps on slippin slippin slippin  
Into the future  
  
I want to fly like an eagle  
To the sea  
Fly like an eagle  
Let my spirit carry me  
I want to fly like an eagle  
Till Im free  
Fly through the revolution  
  
Time keeps on slippin slippin slippin  
Into the future  
Time keeps on slippin slippin slippin  
Into the future
