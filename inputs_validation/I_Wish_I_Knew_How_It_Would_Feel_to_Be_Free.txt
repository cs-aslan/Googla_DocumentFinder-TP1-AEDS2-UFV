I wish I knew how it would feel to be free  
I wish I could break all the chains holding me  
And I wish I could say all the things that I should say  
Say em loud say em clear for the whole world to hear  
  
I wish I could share all the love thats in my heart  
Remove all the bars that keep us apart  
And I wish you could know what it means to be me  
Then youd see and agree that every man should be free  
  
I wish I could give Im longing to give  
And I wish I could live like Im longing to live  
And I wish I could do all the things I can do  
Though Im way overdue Id be starting to move  
  
Well I wish I could be like a bird up in the sky  
How sweet it would be if I found I could fly  
Well Id soar to the sun then Id look down at the sea  
Then Id sing cause Id know  
Yes Id sing cause Id know  
Sing cause I know  
I know Im free yeah  
Yes I know Im free
