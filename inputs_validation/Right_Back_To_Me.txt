Wherever I go its coming back to me  
Whoever Ive known they sent it back to me  
I know the night will be all right  
As long as your love keeps coming  
Right back to me right back to me  
For all to see that our love is true  
I put on a show its very clear to me  
And when I am low I feel youre near to me  
I know the night will be all right  
As long as your love keeps coming  
Right back to me right back to me  
For all to see that our love is true  
I recall some years ago when I truly was alone  
Now at last all that is past  
Now Im never on my own  
I know my light will be shining bright  
As long as your love keeps coming  
Right back to me right back to me  
For all to see that our love is true
