Another night Im waiting for you  
Waiting for my fantasy to crash and burn  
Its you I am looking for  
Another night of summer passes  
Wide awake Im waiting for you patiently  
I want something more  
  
Light a flame and I will find you  
Call for me Ill be beside you  
Youre the one I think about each day  
Just tell me that you want me  
Fall and I will run to catch you  
Look to me and Ill provide you  
With a light to guide you on your way  
Just tell me that you want me  
  
Tell me why cant you just tell me  
How you feel are you that scared of hurting me  
Im stronger than you know  
Are we friends are something more than just another passing moment  
Im sure what youre looking for  
  
Light a flame and I will find you  
Call for me Ill be beside you  
Youre the one I think about each day  
Just tell me that you want me  
Fall and I will run to catch you  
Look to me and Ill provide you  
With a light to guide you on your way  
Just tell me that you want you  
  
Remember last November  
When I met you in the rain  
Remember what you told me  
Are you feeling still the same  
Did you tell the truth then  
Or was it just another game  
Tell me x3
