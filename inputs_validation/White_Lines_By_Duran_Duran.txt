Fun baby  
  
Freeze Rock  
  
Bass  
  
Oh white Whiterepeat 3x ooooo  
  
chorus 1  
White lines vision dreams of passion  
blowin through my mind and all the while I think of you  
Pipe cries a very strange reaction  
for us to unwind the more I see the more I do  
something like a phenomenom baby  
tellin your body to come along but white lines blow away  
  
Blow Rock it Blow  
  
Ticket to ride white line highway  
tell all your friends that they can come my way  
pay your toll  
sell your soul  
pound for pound cost more than gold  
the longer you stay the more you pay  
my white lines go a long way  
either up your nose or through your veins  
with nothing to gain except killin your brain  
  
Freeze Rock repeat 4x  Go  
  
Get higher baby  
get higher baby  
and dont ever come down Freebase  
  
Arangdigdangitydanggitang  
arangdigdangitydanggitang

Pipe cries pure as the driven snow  
connected to my mind and now Im havin fun baby  
pipe rides its getting kind of low  
cuz it makes you feel so fine i need some oneonone baby  
  
Dont let it blow yor mind away baby  
And go to a little hide away  
cuz whitle lines blow away  
  
Blow Rock Blow  
  
A million magic crystals  
painted pure and white  
a multimillion dollars  
Almost over night  
twice as sweet as sugar twice as bitter as salt  
and if you get hooked baby  
its nobodyelses fault so dont do it  
  
Blow Rock repeat 4x  
  
Higher baby

And dont ever come down Freebase  
  
Dont you get to high dont you get to high baby  
Turns you on you really turn me on and on  
told you to come down my temperature is risin  
when the thrill is gone no I dont want you to go  
  
A street kid gets arrested  
gonna do some time  
he got out three years from just to commit more crime  
a business man is caught with 24 kilos  
hes out on bail and out of jail  
And thats the way it goes Rrrhuh  
  
Sugar Cane repeat 2x  
  
Ahletes reject it  
governors correct it  
ganstars thugs and smugglers are throully respected  
the money gets divided  
The women get excited  
now Im broke and its no joke  
Its hard as hell to fight it dont buy it  
  
Freeze Rock repeat 4xrrruh Go  
  
Get higher baby  
Get higher girl

repeat chorus 1  
  
Little jack horner  
sittin in a corner  
with no shoes or clothes  
this aint funny  
but he took his money  
And sniffed it up his nose  
  
repeat chorus 1
