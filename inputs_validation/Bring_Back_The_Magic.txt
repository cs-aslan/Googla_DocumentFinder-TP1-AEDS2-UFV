Nothing can tear you apart  
If you keep living straight from the heart  
Though you know that youre gonna hurt some  
The magic will come  
  
If you keep living straight from the heart  
You will know when to stop and to start  
Once you see that no one really wins  
Then the magic begins  
  
Bring back the magic  
Dont make life so tragic  
Bring back the magic  
Dont make life so tragic  
  
Beachcombers ride oh children lost in the tide  
Times never at their command  
Waves melt all castles of sand  
Melts all castles of sand  
  
Bring back the magic  
Dont make life so tragic  
Bring back the magic  
Dont make life so tragic  
  
Red sky at night such a sailors delight  
Red sky at dawn oh gypsy songs comin on  
Gypsy song comin on  
Song comin on  
  
Nothing can tear you apart  
If you keep living straight from the heart  
Though you know that youre gonna hurt some  
The magic will come  
  
If you keep living straight from the heart  
You will know when to start and to stop  
Once you see that no one really wins  
Then the magic begins  
  
Bring back the magic  
Dont make life so tragic  
Bring back the magic  
Dont make life so tragic
