Dont be cruel  
To a heart thats true  
Dont be cruel  
To a heart thats true  
I dont want no other love  
Baby its just you Im thinking of  
Well you know I can be found  
  
Sitting home all alone  
If you cant come around  
Well at least please telephone  
  
Dont be cruel  
To a heart thats true  
Baby if I made you mad  
For something I might have said  
Please lets forget the past  
Cause the future looks bright ahead  
  
Dont be cruel  
To a heart thats true  
I dont want no other love  
Baby its just you Im thinking of  
Well now dont stop thinking of me

Come on over here and love me  
You know I want to say  
  
Dont be cruel  
To a heart thats true  
Why should we be apart  
I really really love you baby  
  
Cross my heart  
Well lets walk up to the preacher  
And let us say I do  
And then youll know you have me  
And Ill know Ill have you too  
  
Dont be cruel  
To a heart thats true  
I dont want no other love  
Baby its just you Im thinking of
