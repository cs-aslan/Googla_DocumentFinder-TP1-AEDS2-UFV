Well they say that its a fact  
If you watch the sky at night  
And if you stare into the darkness  
You might see celestial light  
And if your heart is empty  
And theres no hope in sight  
Theres a chance youll find an answer in the sky  
  
Well they say that its a shame  
If you have nothing to believe  
And if you cant hold onto something  
You might as well die where you sleep  
You dont need a prayer  
And theres no price to ask why  
Sometimes youll find an answer in the sky  
  
And its all so much bigger than it seems  
And it all overwhelms us now and then  
And Im banking on a chance we believe  
That good can still control the hearts of men  
  
Sometimes youll find an answer in the sky  
  
And its all so much bigger than it seems  
And it all overwhelms us now and then  
And Im banking on a chance that we believe  
That good can still control the hearts of men  
  
This lifes a long old road  
We shouldnt have to walk alone  
But if you find the right companion  
You wont feel so worn out when youve grown  
All life is precious  
And every days a prize  
And sometimes youll find an answer in the sky  
  
All life is precious  
And every days a prize  
And sometimes youll find an answer in the sky  
  
And sometimes youll find an answer in the sky  
  
And sometimes youll find an answer in the sky
