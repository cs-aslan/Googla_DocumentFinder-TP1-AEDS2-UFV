One night she came in from the cold  
Like a long lost friend someone to hold  
She said dont ask me now  
Cause whats in a name  
But when Im gone youll never be the same  
  
So wont you hold me now  
Cant you see what I came here for  
Save me now cause I now  
Well keep on headin through  
Lights and shadows  
Were talkin lights and shadows  
  
She came from far with so much to tell  
Cause when youre lookin for love  
You can walk through hell  
Just like a ricochet she might come and go  
And one look can say more than youll ever know  
  
So wont you hold me now  
  
Oh lights and shadows  
Were talkin lights and shadows  
  
So wont you hold me now  
  
Oh lights and shadows  
  
We keep on headin through  
Lights and shadows
