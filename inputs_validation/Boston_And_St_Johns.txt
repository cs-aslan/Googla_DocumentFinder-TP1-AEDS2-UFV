Girl dont tell me that its morning  
Can we keep the curtains drawn  
I havent given you fair warning  
But our ship she sails at dawn  
  
Chorus  
Its true I must be going but I swear I wont be long  
There isnt that much ocean between Boston and St Johns  
Im a rover and Im bound to sail away  
Im a rover Can you love me anyway  
  
And if some suitor comes approaching  
Will you let him through your door  
And what if I return half broken  
Will you still want me anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
Close your eyes and dream  
Tell me what you see  
Tell me what you want  
Just tell me that youll wait for me  
  
Girl dont tell me that its morning  
Can we keep the curtains drawn  
I havent given you fair warning  
But our ship she sails at dawn  
  
Chorus
