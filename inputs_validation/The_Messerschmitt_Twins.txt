My mind is made up Im changing faster  
Your mind is made up avoiding worries  
My old image is set to fade away  
Forget the talking  
Forget the actions  
And quiet voices and all that happened  
In just one of hour  
You could knock me down  
  
The twos are one now  
And ones are fuller  
No longer giving  
No longer taking  
These ways are tried  
They never seem to fail  
  
And when youre asking  
You sound like telling  
Despite the questions  
Youre not receiving  
I cant explain  
Why you disappear  
  
Your mind is made up  
The time is taken  
You reach decisions  
We cant avoid them  
Theres no success  
No matter what we do  
  
The twos are one now  
And ones are fuller  
No longer giving  
No longer taking  
These ways are tried  
They never seem to fail  
These ways are tried  
They never seem to fail  
These ways are tried  
They never seem to fail  
These ways are tried
