Theres a certain something in the way  
You looked at me and said youd stay  
That let me know that I was out of line  
But I didnt know what else to do  
And like a fool I tested you  
By demanding things of you which werent mine  
  
And now I feel like such a fool  
For making you crawl back to me  
But you did it with such love  
That youre standing far above  
Me and all I did to you  
Im sorry now what can I do  
  
I know that never in the world  
That I have found me such a girl  
Whos there to pick me up before I fall  
And if in the end we should go  
Both our separated ways I know  
The lesson Ive learned here is worth it all  
  
Cause now I feel like such a fool  
For making you crawl back to me  
But you did it with such love  
That youre standing far above  
Me and all I did to you  
Im sorry now what can I do  
  
I know that never in the world  
That I have found me such a girl  
Whos there to pick me up before I fall  
And if in the end we should go  
Both our separated ways  
I know the lesson Ive learned here is worth it all
