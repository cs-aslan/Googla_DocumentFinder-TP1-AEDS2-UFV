Ill be loving you eternally eternally  
With a love thats true eternally eternally  
From the start within my heart  
It seems Ive always known  
The sun would shine shine  
When you were mine mine  
And mine alone mine alone  
  
Ill be loving you eternally eternally  
Therell be no one new my dear for me eternally  
Though the sky should fall  
Remember I shall always be  
Forever true true  
And loving you you  
Eternally
