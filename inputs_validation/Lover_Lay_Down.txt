Spring sweet rhythm dance in my head  
Slip into my lovers hands  
Kiss me wont you kiss me now  
And sleep I would inside your mouth  
Dont be us too shy  
For knowing its no big surprise that  
I will wait for you  
I will wait for no one but you  
  
Oh please lover lay down  
Spend this time with me  
Together share this smile  
Lover lay down  
Spend this time with me  
Walk with me walk with you  
Hold my hand your hands  
So much we have dreamed  
And you were so much younger  
Hard to explain that we are stronger  
A million reasons life to deny  
Lets toss them away  
See you and me we  
Lay down look see  
She and he  
By my lovers side  
Together share this smile  
Each others tears to cry  
Together share this smile  
Lover lay down  
Oh please oh please  
Oh please lover lay down  
Oh please lover lay down  
And you weep  
Lover lay down  
Cause its over  
Lover lay down  
  
Say love say love say love say love say love  
Should I love you  
Could you love me  
Darling its all the same  
Til we dance away  
Chasing me all around  
Leading me all around  
Leading me all around in circles
