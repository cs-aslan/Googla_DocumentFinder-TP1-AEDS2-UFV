Turn on your receiver Im gonna lay it on the line  
Cause Im a great believer in hangin on to what is mine  
So come over here and listen I dont want you to be missin  
What I say  
And I aint gonna waste my time sayin it all again  
  
Ive been hearin stories fact the words all over town  
Ive had my share of worries ever since youve been around  
So come over hear and listen I dont want you to be missin  
What I say  
And I aint gonna waste my time sayin it all again  
  
Turn on your receiver theres a message comin through  
Keep your hands off my woman  
Keep your hands to yourself  
Keep your hands off my woman
