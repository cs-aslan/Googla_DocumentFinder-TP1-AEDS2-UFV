Im feelin static  
Nothings moving here for me  
Dead unromantic  
Thats the way lifes squeezin me  
I get the feelings  
When Im pushed in a situation  
Like climbin ceilings  
This is a case of renegotiaion  
I aint the soft touch you think I am  
Aint no pussy to think you care  
  
Between a rock and a hard place  
Ill make sure you remember my face  
Between a rock and a hard place  
Youre just something I will erase  
  
Ill tell you something  
That you never thought before  
When I get dangerous  
Theres no such thing as outside the law  
Let me tell you for your information  
Youre gonna need rehabilitation  
  
Between a rock and a hard place  
Ill make sure you remember my face  
Between a rock and a hard place  
Youre just something I will replace  
  
Theres no giving up no more losing ground  
Hang on in  
Were gonna stick around movin up  
You cant bring me down
