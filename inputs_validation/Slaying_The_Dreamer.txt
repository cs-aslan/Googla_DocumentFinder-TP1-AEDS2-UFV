Im a priest for the poorest sacrifice  
Im but a raft in a sea of sorrow and greed  
You bathed in my wine  
Drank from my cup mocked my rhyme  
Your slit tongues licked my aching wounds  
  
Put a stake through my heart  
And drag me into sunlight  
So awake for your greed  
As youre slaying the dreamer  
  
Swansong for the Wish of Night  
God it hurts give a name to the pain  
Our primrose path to hell is growing weed  
  
Blame me its me  
Coward a good for nothing scapegoat  
Dumb kid living a dream  
Romantic only on paper  
  
Tell me why you took all that was mine  
Stay as you lay dont lead me astray  
  
Wake up mow the weed  
Youd be nothing without me  
Take my life if you have the heart to die  
  
You bastards tainted my tool  
Raped my words played me a fool  
Gather your precious glitter and leave me be  
The Great Ones are all dead  
And Im tired too  
  
I truly hate you all
