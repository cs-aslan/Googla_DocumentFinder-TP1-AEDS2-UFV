The snow was falling on his shoulders by the side of the road  
And he watched as the sun went down  
Falling on the building  
Swallowing the children  
Its the gun in your back  
Its the heart attack  
Its the way you look back before you step out  
  
In time to see the number of the bus thats running you down  
A million lonely people with their bead in the sand  
Trying to make some sense of what they dont understand  
Waiting on somebody just to give them a hand  
Youre designed to fall apart on the day the warranty ends  
And you try but you just cant stop  
Running round in circles  
Knocking over hurdles  
Its the knife in your back  
Its the heart attack  
Its the way you look back before you step out  
In time to see the shadow of the one thats cutting you down  
  
The snow was falling on his shoulders by the side of the road  
And he watched as the lights came on below  
And the children were sleeping  
And the women were weeping  
There was nobody keeping him here
