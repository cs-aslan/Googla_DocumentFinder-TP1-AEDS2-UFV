Wake up wake up  
Turn on the water  
Close the door  
I wont let you tear me down  
Just another moment  
When the sound of your voice  
Cuts me to the ground  
Locked in here just to make  
Myself feel better  
Look in the mirror  
And tell myself that Im okay  
I know it doesnt matter  
Whatever I do  
Its always second best  
I gotta free my mind  
Exactly what you wanted  
You opened me up  
The secrets I confessed  
Wake up wake up  
Im not here just to  
Make you feel better  
Stroke your ego  
Live happy ever after  
Im not sleeping  
And I aint dreaming  
And I aint fooled anymore  
Im not sleeping  
Just to wake up on the floor  
Im not sleeping  
Anymore  
So many times  
I wanted to go  
But I just lost my way  
Watching you unravelling  
The last piece of thread  
That held me into place  
I dont care if you hear a word  
Im saying  
I can only hear  
The voices screaming in my head  
Im not sleeping  
And I aint dreaming  
And I aint fooled anymore  
Im not sleeping  
Just to wake up on the floor  
Im not sleeping  
I done beat your game  
But Im not even sleeping no more Im not even tired  
And Im sick of dreaming pain  
Tossing and turning all night and waking wide up  
Now Im really looking at the door shouldve made this move before  
I cant take this anymore  
I dont want no more nightmares in the night  
No not tonight  
I already seen the light  
I gotta free my mind  
And wake up wake up  
Im not sleeping  
And I aint dreaming  
And I aint fooled anymore  
Wake up  
Im not sleeping  
Just to wake up on the floor  
Im not sleeping  
I done beat your game  
But Im not even sleeping no more Im not even tired  
Go to wake up  
I done beat your game  
But Im not even sleeping no more Im not even tired  
Im not sleeping  
Just to wake up on the floor  
Im not sleeping  
Anymore
