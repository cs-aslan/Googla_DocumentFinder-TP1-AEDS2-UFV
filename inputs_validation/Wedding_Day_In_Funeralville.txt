Its wedding day in Funeralville  
Your soup spoons on your right  
The King and Queen will alternate  
With the refrigerator light  
Theyll be boxing on the TV show  
The colored kids will sing  
Hoo ray for you and midnights oil  
Lets burn the whole damn thing  
Felicia is my dark horse girl  
Ill take her if it rains  
She throws up punch upon the host  
And says many stupid things  
But she aint so bad  
When were all alone shes as different as can be  
Shes a part a my heart dontcha pull us apart  
Shes like one of the family  
Oh no trouble in the attic  
Wont somebody turn on a light  
Got so so many troubles  
Cant even tell wrong from right  
Im gonna comb my hair  
Darn my socks tip my hat and say goodnight  
Its wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight  
Its wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight  
My car is stuck in Washington  
And I cannot find out why  
Come sit beside me on the swing  
And watch the angels cry  
Its anybodys ballgame  
Its everybodys fight  
And the street lamp said as he nodded his head  
Its lonesome out tonight  
Oh no trouble in the attic  
Wont somebody turn on a light  
Got so so many troubles  
Cant even tell wrong from right  
Im gonna comb my hair  
Darn my socks tip my hat and say goodnight  
Its wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight  
Its wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight
