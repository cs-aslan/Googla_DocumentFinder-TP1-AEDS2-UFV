If I had to say what love feels like  
Id say you  
If I had to say what love tastes like  
Id say you  
If I had to show what love looks like  
Thats an easy thing to do  
Id pick your favorite colors  
And honey Id paint you  
  
If someone asked what heaven is  
Id say you  
If I describe what pleasure is  
Id say you  
If I had to show what a dream looks like  
Thats an easy thing to do  
Id pick your favorite colors  
And honey Id paint you  
  
In Websters book  
Id even add a word or two  
Under perfect lover  
Id put see you  
  
If I had to show my biggest thrill  
Thats an easy thing to do  
Id pick your favorite colors  
And honey Id paint you  
  
Id say you  
Id say you  
  
If I had to show what love looks like  
Thats an easy thing to do  
Id pick your favorite colors  
And honey Id paint you
