Unholy city a sinners delight  
Noone was spared out of mind out of sight  
Hatred and slaughter degradation and lust  
Self destruction never counting the cost  
Noone knew the suffering  
Behind the city walls  
Noone heard the cry for help  
Noone heard the call  
  
One thousand days in Sodom  
One thousand days in Sodom  
The ways of god forgotten  
One thousand days in Sodom  
  
Children slaughtered daily there mothers by their sides  
No mercy given no matter how they cried  
The smell of death was near  
Its presence ever near  
The priests lay bound in chains noone would ever hear  
Noone knew the blasphemy  
The torture and the pain  
Noone saw the madness  
The priests they died in vain  
  
Day completes its cycle and night takes on its role  
Satans cloak shrouds the land and his children spill their fold  
No golden cross of heaven  
Or ancient key of kings  
Could save the world of sinners when the midnight sabbath rings  
Few could hear the suffering  
And the pain of ripping flesh  
But those who did were damned in hell  
And breathed their final breath  
  
One thousand days  
One thousand years youve lived your life in hell
