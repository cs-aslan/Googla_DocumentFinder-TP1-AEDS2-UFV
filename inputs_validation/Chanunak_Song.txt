Okay  
This is a song that uhh  
Theres a lot of Christmas songs out there and uhh  
Not too many Chanukah songs  
So uhh  
I wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who dont get to  
Hear any Chanukah songs  
Here we go  
  
Put on your yarmulke  
Here comes Chanukah  
So much funukah  
To celebrate Chanukah  
Chanukah is the festival of lights  
Instead of one day of presents we have eight crazy nights  
  
When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree  
Heres a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me  
David Lee Roth lights the menorah  
So do James Caan Kirk Douglas and the late Dinah Shoreah  
  
Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli  
Bowser from Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzerelli  
Paul Newmans half Jewish Goldie Hawns half too  
Put them together what a fine lookin Jew  
  
You dont need Deck The Halls or Jingle Bell Rock  
Cause you can spin a dreidel with Captain Kirk and MrSpock both  
Jewish  
  
Put on your yarmulke  
Its time for Chanukah  
The owner of the Seattle Supersonicahs  
Celebrates Chanukah  
  
OJ Simpson not a Jew  
But guess who is Hall of famer Rod Carew he converted  
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby  
Harrison Fords a quarter Jewish not too shabby  
  
Some people think that Ebenezer  
Scrooge is  
Well hes not but guess who is  
All three Stooges  
So many Jews are in showbiz  
Tom Cruise isnt but I heard his agent is  
  
Tell your friend Veronica  
Its time to celebrate Chanukah  
I hope I get a harmonicah  
Oh this lovely lovely Chanukah  
So drink your gin and tonicah  
And smoke your marijuanikah  
If you really really wannakah  
Have a happy happy happy  
Happy Chanukah  
  
Happy Chanukah
