I see you just like the movies  
I see your face  
Across a crowded room  
And I have learned through  
Simple trial and error  
Not to speak too soon  
  
Your eyes just like a magnet  
Theyre drawing my eyes around  
And I cant hear one  
Word of conversation  
I cant hear a sound  
  
I see you looking at me  
You see me looking at you  
  
Chorus  
I dont wanna know your name  
And I dont wanna play this game  
Where two lovers meet  
And one lover parts in pain  
  
I feel this urge to meet you  
I feel this urge to run  
Repairing hearts so easily shattered  
Is never any fun  
  
I see you looking at me  
You see me looking at you  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont wanna know your name  
I dont wanna play this game  
I dont wanna know your name  
I dont wanna play this game
