You aint goin nowhere  
Gonna sit by this pool until you fall in  
Didnt know what you were getting into  
When you walked into this room  
Did you kid  
  
We got some girls over here  
We got some boys over there  
And theyre here just for your fun  
  
So have some dinner baby  
Play some records  
Just remember one thing son  
  
This is serious business  
Sex and violence and rock and roll  
This is serious business  
Sex and violence and rock and roll  
  
You know my head is sweating  
I cant dance and I cant relax  
Outside is too threatening now  
Ive come this far and I cant go back  
  
Call up some old friends  
Call up some strangers  
Get me used to that French telephone  
Donna Donna educate me  
But tell those girls that Im not alone  
  
Take my life and take my soul  
Put me on the cross for all to see  
Put my name around my neck  
Let those people throw stones at me  
  
This is serious business  
Sex and violence and rock and roll
