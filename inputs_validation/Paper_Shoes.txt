I fly  
I soar  
This I  
Adore  
  
Then like a locomotive  
The sound of your sorrow calls  
Im tired of the way that it feels  
I only apologized to you to make you feel better  
But I think Ive outgrown that horsehair sweater  
  
Id rather be alone  
Youre about as reliable as paper shoes in bad weather  
But pain will roll off like water on feather  
  
youd fly  
Youd soar  
  
But then like a locomotive  
The sound of your sorrow comes  
Im tired of the way that it feels  
I only apologized to you to make you feel better  
But I think Ive outgrown that horsehair sweater  
  
Id rather be on my own  
Youre about as reliable as paper shoes in bad weathers  
But pain will roll off like water on feathers
