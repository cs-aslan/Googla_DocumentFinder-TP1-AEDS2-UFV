Baby  
I can be your sweet baby  
When things get crazy  
Make sure you come and save me save me  
  
Lil miss fast car  
I can really get far  
And dont break my heart  
Lets make out Lets make out Lets make out  
  
Chorus  
You can come take me away  
Theres no pressure play all day  
Hold me tight and dont let go  
Mmm Papa love you  
Mmm Papa love you  
You love it when Im freakin out  
Things get rough and theres no doubt  
You will always be there for me  
Mmm Papa love you  
Mmm Papa love you  
  
Stuck in  
The middle of it all  
To many people around me  
Can you hear me call  
I look this way  
And youre not there  
If you dont mind  
My soul out there  
  
Mmm Papa Mmm Papa Mmm Papa  
  
Chorus  
  
Mmm Papa Mmm Papa Mmm Papi  
Mmm Papi Mmm Papi Mmm Papi  
Mmm Luvi Mmm Luvi Mmm Papi  
  
You will always be there for me  
You will always be there for me  
  
You love it when Im freakin out  
Things get rough and theres no doubt  
You love it when Im freakin out  
Things get rough and theres no doubt  
  
Chorus  
  
Now see

And that make you Papi  
And that makes us Luvi  
  
Mmm Papa Mmm Papa Mmm Papa Repeat x3
