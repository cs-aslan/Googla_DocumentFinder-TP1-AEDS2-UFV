Grandpa pissed his pants again  
He dont give a damn  
Brother Billy has both guns drawn  
He aint been right since Vietnam  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Play that dead bands song  
Turn those speakers up full blast  
Play it all night long  
  
Daddys doing Sister Sally  
Grandmas dying of cancer now  
The cattle all have brucellosis  
Well get through somehow  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Play that dead bands song  
Turn those speakers up full blast  
Play it all night long  
  
Im going down to the Dew Drop Inn  
See if I can drink enough  
There aint much to country living  
Sweat piss jizz and blood  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Play that dead bands song  
Turn those speakers up full blast  
Play it all night long
