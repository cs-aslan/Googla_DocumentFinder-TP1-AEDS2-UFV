I dont drink as much as I used to  
Lately it just aint my style  
And hard times dont last like they used to  
They pass quicker like when I was a child  
Chorus  
Somehow Ive learned how to listen  
To a sound like the sun going down  
And the magic the morning is bringing home  
A song for a life I have found  
It keeps my feet on the ground  
Solo  
The midsummer days sit so heavy  
But dont they blow like a breeze through your mind  
When nothing appears in a hurry  
To make up for someones lost time  
Chorus
