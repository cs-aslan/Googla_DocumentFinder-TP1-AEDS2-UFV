When I look in your eyes I can feel the fire  
A see through disguise cant conceal desire  
Ive been readin your lips they dont need no translation  
They want more than a kiss I come to make my donation  
  
So turn out the lights Im going down slowly  
Dont tell me whats right Just tell me you want me  
Tell me you want me  
Just tell me you want me want me want me  
  
Lets make it baby  
Lets make it baby  
Lets make it baby  
Lets make it baby  
  
Come come come a little bit closer  
I want to play doctor  
It keeps getting harder harder harder to keep me away  
I want to taste the sweat thats runnin off of your body  
Get the sheets all wet I wanna make you feel naughty  
  
Lets make it baby  
Lets make it baby  
Lets make it baby  
Lets make it baby  
  
Turn out the lights  
Dont tell me you love me  
Just tell me you want me  
Dont tell me you love me  
Tell me you want me want me  
Want me want me want me want me want me  
  
Lets make it baby  
Lets make it baby  
Lets make it baby  
Lets make it baby
