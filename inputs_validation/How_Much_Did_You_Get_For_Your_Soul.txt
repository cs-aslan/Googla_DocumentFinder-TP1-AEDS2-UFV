Hey baby  
I want to know  
How much  
Did you get for your soul  
You had the gospel  
When you were shackled to a tree  
Now youve got your freedom  
You sing for the money  
Soul  
Soul  
Soul  
Soul  
How much did ya  
How much did ya  
How much did ya get  
  
Hey babe  
Tell me please  
How much  
Did you get for that sleaze  
You finally made it  
Right up to the top  
Millions of kids are looking at you  
You say let them drink soda pop  
Soul  
Soul  
Soul  
Soul  
How much did ya  
How much did ya  
How much did ya get  
  
Whos got soul  
Whos got soul  
From the African nation  
To the Pepsi generation  
Whos got soul  
Whos got soul  
  
It dwell from tree to sea  
Every living entity  
Share the super soul  
We got super soul  
Whos got soul  
Who could think that youre for real   
A puppet in a cabaret  
To increase your wealth  
Baby realize yourself  
  
Hey baby  
I want to know  
From the agogo to the disco  
Where did you really go  
You finally made it  
Youre gonna make it rich  
As long as some poor bastard in Africa  
Is lying in a ditch  
Soul  
Soul  
Soul  
Soul  
How much did ya  
How much did ya  
How much did ya get
