Well its funny you should ask me how I feel  
As the scenes before my eyes begin to reel  
I cant remember how long I cried  
I cant remember how hard I tried  
Turned my thoughts away from you  
Like I had something else to do  
And now I find you here  
  
And its funny you should want to see me now  
Well Id refuse you but I cant remember how  
I cant remember how long I cried  
I cant remember how hard I tried  
Id tell myself I didnt care  
That I was down and you werent there  
Youve been away so long  
  
And its funny you should want to know my plans  
As the future disappears beneath my hands  
I cant remember how long I cried  
I cant remember how hard I tried  
Now Ill cast aside my memories  
And shut you out most bitterly  
Im down on my last smile
