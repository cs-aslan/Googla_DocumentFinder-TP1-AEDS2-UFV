I have to wonder if this waves too big to ride  
Commit or not commit in such a crazy tide  
Its sooner than I thought but you called me out  
Ive lost control and theres no doubt  
Im gonna start all over  
  
Chorus  
Out of the fire and into the fire again  
You make me want to forget  
And start all over  
Here it comes straight out of my mind or worse  
Another chance to get burned  
And start all over  
Im gonna start all over  
  
Fantastic and romantic all a big surprise  
Youve got the warning hesitation pushed aside  
Its sooner than i want but you caught my heart  
I guess Im ready now to start  
Im gonna start all over  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat x3  
Its so easy  
You disrupt me  
Cant complain  
  
Its so easy  
Im gonna start all over  
  
Chorus x2
