You got the shakin I got the shimmy  
You got the takin I got the gimme  
And I dont want to go but baby you send me  
You want it all and I want to give it  
You are the dream and I want to live it  
And I dont want to go but baby you send me  
  
Baby its me Im the same as you  
A dreamer who dreams thats a dream come true  
And all my life all Ive wanted to meet someone just like you  
Someone just like you who wants to love me too  
Someone just like you  
  
weve got the spark weve got the desire  
The longer we burn the higher the fire  
And baby take my heart I want you to have it  
Our loves a storm it goes on forever  
The more that it rains the better the weather  
And baby take my heart I want you to have it  
  
Baby its me Im the same as you  
A dreamer who dreams thats a dream come true  
And all my life all Ive wanted to meet someone just like you  
Someone just like you who wants to love me too  
Someone just like you  
  
You got the shakin I got the shimmy  
You got the takin I got the gimme  
And I dont want to go but baby you send me  
You want it all and I want to live it  
You got a dream and I want to live it  
And I dont want to go but baby you send me  
  
Baby its me Im the same as you  
A dreamer who dreams thats a dream come true  
And all my life all Ive wanted to meet someone just like you  
Someone just like you who wants to love me too  
Someone just like you  
  
Oh yeah
