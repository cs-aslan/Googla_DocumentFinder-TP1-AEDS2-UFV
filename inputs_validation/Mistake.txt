Now that Im thinking sober  
Dont you try to get no closer  
Im just gonna get my car and drive and drive  
Looking in the rear view mirror  
Everything is so much clearer  
Watch me wave it all goodbye goodbye  
  
The lights flashing giving me all the danger signs  
Someone to save to save but it dont work that way  
  
Chorus  
Think you made your greatest mistake  
Im not gonna call this a break  
Think you really blew it this time  
Think you could walk on such a thin line  
Wont be taking your midnight calls  
Ignore the rocks you throw at my wall  
I see it written on your face  
You know you made it your greatest mistake  
  
When the last straw is broken  
When the last door is closing  
I aint that dumb to stick around stick around  
I aint got the time for looking back  
When you let yourself slip through the cracks  
And you just keep going down down down  
  
I must stay undercover lay low need some time  
No one to save to save these sick cycles over me  
  
Chorus  
  
Why you looking at me spitting the same old line  
Trying bring back aint no flipping my mind  
Dont you get it by now the storys over over  
Still calling my name outside my house  
Im hitting the switch watch the lights go out  
Watch the lights go out  
  
I hope you ache ache ache ahohoh  
I hope you ache ache ache ahoh yeahyeahyeah  
  
Chorus
