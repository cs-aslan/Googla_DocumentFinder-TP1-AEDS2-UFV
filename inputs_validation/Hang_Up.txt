Baby Im Lying all alone  
The pillow is all I have to hold  
I cant feel you God it isnt fair  
With out you I so wanna take you there  
  
Chorus  
Dont hang up its just gettin serious now  
Ur making me delerious  
Dont hang up  
Till Ive finished with you  
Im not alone  
  
Im not alone I am not alone  
I can still feel you  
Even when Im lonely and now Im coming to  
X2  
  
Tell me tell me what you see  
Feel me feel me on my knee  
Slowly we began to breathe  
Hold on holdon to your beliefs  
  
Chorus  
  
Your far away well well find a way  
O baby now lets make it right  
Close your eyes  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont hang up  
  
Do you feel it too  
Close your eyes
