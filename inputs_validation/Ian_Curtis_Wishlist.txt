Someday JS  
When you tell me everything  
It will make me want to take it too far  
And when you ask me everything  
I will take it too far  
The twentyhundred private loops making up my  
Ahh

Via heave and via gasp  
Will seem like and will actually be  
Just wicked stupid pride  
Oh what will happen  
Oh what will happen  
Will you ever bleep out  
Do you love me Jamie Stewart  
JS I am kidding  
Im just kidding
