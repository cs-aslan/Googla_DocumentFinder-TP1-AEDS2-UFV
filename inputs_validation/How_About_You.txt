When a girl meets boy  
Life can be a joy  
But the note they end on  
Will depend on little pleasures they will share  
So let us compare  
  
I like New York in June how about you  
I like a Gershwin tune how about you  
I love a fireside when a storm is due  
I like potato chips moonlight and motor trips  
How about you  
  
Im mad about good books cant get my fill  
And Franklin Roosevelts looks give me a thrill  
Holding hands at the movie show  
When all the lights are low  
May not be new but I like it  
How about you  
  
I like Jack Bennys jokes  
To a degree  
I love the common folks  
That includes me  
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue  
I like banana splits late supper at the Ritz  
How about you  
  
I love to dream of fame maybe Ill shine  
Id love to see your name right beside mine  
I can see were in harmony  
Looks like we both agree  
On what to do  
And I like it how about you  
  
Im so delighted Ive ignited the spark within you  
Let me continue to make it burn  
With you I will be like a Trilby so lets not dally  
Come on Svengali Ive lots to learn  
When youre arisin start exercisin daily  
For example just a sample  
Bend and touch the floor fifty times or more  
Ha A fine start to be a Bernhardt  
  
A dictionarys necessary but not for talking  
Its used for walking the Ziegfeld way  
Is this okay  
Thats the trick youre catching on quickly  
Should I take a bow  
Aho Let me show you how  
Just like partners on the stage  
If you can use a partner  
Im the right age
