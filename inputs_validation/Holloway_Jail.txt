They took my baby to Holloway jail  
They took my baby down Holloway jail  
She was a lady when she went in  
Now shes in jail and its giving me hell  
  
She was succeeding in the city  
She was just beginning to excel  
Then a spiv named Frankie Simes  
Led her to a life of crime  
And led her on the downward trail  
  
Frankie came home late from work one evening  
The ClD were hot on his trail  
Frankie promised everything  
And then he went and turned her in  
She went and took the rap for him  
Now shes impaled in Holloway jail  
  
They took my baby down Holloway jail  
They took my baby to Holloway jail  
There aint no pity there aint no bail  
And she assures me that its living hell  
  
She was young and ever so pretty  
Now she looks so old and pale  
She never sees the day  
She wastes her life away  
Sitting in that prison cell  
  
They took my baby to Holloway jail  
They took my baby down Holloway jail  
She was a lady when she went in  
Now shes in jail and its giving me hell  
  
Shes impaled in Holloway jail
