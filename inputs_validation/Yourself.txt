Yourself  
Are you older than your enemy self  
Youre not big  
Im not strong enough to carry you here  
Youre there  
  
Youre well  
I believe you are a victum of this  
Youre so bad  
I cannot express the emotion I had  
Youre there  
  
No  
Where you stop  
You beg your time  
You know its why Im not so right  
When you talk  
You know just why Im out  
Youre heavier than  
Yourself  
  
You  
Youre there  
Youre a victum you are suffering  
Youre so sad  
You cannot explain that time that you laughed  
Youre there  
  
No  
Where you stop  
You be you lie  
You talk about when I come back  
When you talk  
You know you lie about  
Youre right below  
Youre there  
  
You build a sound  
Looking back  
Burning burning  
While you stare  
When you do  
I dont know  
I dont know  
I dont know  
I dont know
