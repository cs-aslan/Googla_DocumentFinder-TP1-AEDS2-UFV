Chorus  
Ride when we ride we ride  
Its til the day we die  
When we ride we ride  
Its til the day we die  
  
Its real late  
Bout a quarter to one  
Thinkin about everythang  
We become  
And I hate it  
I thought we could make it  
But Im ready to scratch this  
Just wanna forget about it  
I saw the pictures  
And the letters she sent  
You had me thinkin  
You were out we your friends  
Im so foolish  
Treat me like Im stupid  
Cause I thought it was just you and I oh  
  
Now I look back on the time  
That we spent and  
I see it in my mind  
Playing over and over again  
Cause boy right now  
You got me breaking down  
And I just cant figure out why  
But this is what you say  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
Visions in my mind  
Of the day that we met  
You showed me thangs  
Thatll never forget  
Took me swimming  
In the ocean  
You had my head up in the clouds  
Make me feel like Im floating yeah  
You think Im playing  
When you now its the truth  
Nobody else can do it  
Quite like I do  
All my kisses  
And my lovin  
But aint nobody  
Better than us  
  
Now I look back on the time  
That we spent and  
I see it in my mind  
Playing over and over again  
Cause boy right now  
You got me breaking down  
And I just cant figure out why  
But this is what you say  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
I guess its over  
And definitely  
But you and I know  
Its not that easy  
To let go  
Of everything everything that we planned  
And start all over again  
Just blame yourself cause you blew it  
I wont forget how you do it  
Sweet baby  
This is where the game ends now somehow  
Might not believe you and me  
We can figure it out  
  
Chorus  
  
You finna make me say boy  
I wish that you come hold me  
When Im lonely  
When I need someone to talk to  
You would phone me  
Just like everything its on me  
when we ride we ride its til the day we die  
Boy you forgot about the promises  
You made me  
And now well let the memories  
Just fade away  
But I remember  
What you used to say  
when we ride we ride its til the day we die  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
We ride
