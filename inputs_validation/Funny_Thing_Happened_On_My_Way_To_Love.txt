You dont have to shout  
From now on Im out of the kitchen  
Whats more I cant stand your cigarette brand  
And Im switchen  
Im unhappy with things the way that theyve occured  
It is time to face facts and not mince a word  
Certain parties with birdbrains are getting the bird  
Au revior faretheewell and goodbye And Ill tell you why  
  
A funny thing happened on my way to love  
I lost the young fella Ive been dreaming of  
He changed while I waited and hoped for his call  
To someone whos no fun at all  
Well Ive stopped forgetting what else can I do  
And much thanks for letting me practise on you  
Its farewell my lovely excuse please my dust  
Unravel and travel I must  
No tears no hurt surprise  
Its with a pleasant glow I realise  
If I have that much love so deep true and strong  
All ready to hand you my dear Mr Wrong  
Then think of the treasures the joy and delight  
Ill give to my own Mr Right  
My own Mr Right  
So asta la vista tata toodleoo  
The world will keep turning but not around you  
Theres someone else waiting thats more than a friend  
Best wishes and dishes Ill send  
And so solong Im on my way  
Thanks for the buggyride and may I say   
If I have that much love so deep true and strong  
Already to hand you my dear Mr Wrong  
Then think of the treasures the joy and delight  
Ill give as long as I live at night  
To my own Mr Right
