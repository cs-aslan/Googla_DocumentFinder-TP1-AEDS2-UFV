I got to tell you that he waited all his life  
For someone like you to come make the wrong things right  
I know he didnt have the answers all the time  
But you cant tell me that youve never told a lie  
  
Were almost twentythree and youre still mad at me  
So much that I said to you and I want to take it back now  
Twentythree and its so sad to me  
You tell the world Im dead to you  
But I know you want me back now  
  
Was it fun for you to watch him fall apart Watch me fall  
And suffocate him while you held him in your arms in your arms  
I swear to God I wish he never let you in let you in  
And I just hope we never hear from you again  
  
Were almost twentythree and youre still mad at me  
So much that I said to you and I want to take it back now  
Twentythree and its so sad to me  
you tell the world Im dead to you  
But I know you want me back  
  
Wasted on you wasted on you  
Wasted on you so much time Ive  
Wasted on you wasted on you  
Wasted on you  
On you  
On you  
  
Twentythree and youre still mad at me  
So much that I said to you and I want to take it back now  
Twentythree and its so sad to me  
You tell the world Im dead to you  
But I know you want me back now
