KawLiga was a wooden indian standing by the door  
He fell in love with an indian maid over in the antique store  
KawLiga just stood there and never let it show  
So she could never answer yes or no  
  
He always wore his sunday feathers and held a tomahawk  
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday hed talk  
KawLiga too stubborn to ever show a sign  
Because his heart was made of knotty pine  
  
Poor old kawliga he never got a kiss  
Poor old kawliga he dont know what he missed  
Is it any wonder that his face is red  
KawLigathat poor old wooden head  
  
KawLiga was a lonely indian never went nowhere  
His heart was set on the indian maid with the coal black hair  
KawLiga just stood there and never let it show  
So she could never answer yes or no  
  
Poor old kawliga he never got a kiss  
Poor old kawliga he dont know what he missed  
Is it any wonder that his face is red  
KawLigathat poor old wooden head  
  
Then one day a wealthy customer bought the indian maid  
And took her oh so far away but old kawliga stayed  
KawLiga just stands there as lonely as can be  
And wishes he was still an old pine tree  
  
Poor old kawliga he never got a kiss  
Poor old kawliga he dont know what he missed  
Is it any wonder that his face is red  
KawLigathat poor old wooden head  
  
Kawliga Kawliga KawLiga
