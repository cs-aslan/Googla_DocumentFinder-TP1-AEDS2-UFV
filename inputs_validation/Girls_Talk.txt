There are some things you cant cover up with lipstick and powder  
Thought I heard you mention my name cant you talk any louder  
Dont come any closer  
Dont come any nearer  
My vision of you cant come any clearer  
Oh I just wanna hear girls talk  
  
Got a loaded imagination being fired by girls talk  
Its a more or less situation inspired by girls talk  
But I cant say the words you want to hear  
I suppose youre gonna have to play it by ear right here and now  
  
Girls talk  
And they wanna know how girls talk  
And they say its not allowed girls talk  
If they say that its so dont they think that I know by now  
That the word up on everyones lips stick that youre dedicated  
You may not be an old fashioned girl but youre gonna get dated  
Was it really murder were you just pretending  
Lately I have heard you are the living end  
  
Girls talk  
And they wanna know how girls talk  
And they say its not allowed girls talk  
And they think they know how girls talk  
if they say that its so dont they think that I know by now  
  
But I cant say the words you want to hear  
I suppose youre gonna have to play it by ear right here  
There are some things you cant cover up with lipstick and powder  
Thought I heard you mention my name cant you talk any louder  
Dont come any closer  
Dont come any nearer  
My vision of you cant come any clearer  
Girls talk  
And they think they know how girls talk  
And they say its not allowed girls talk  
And they think they know how girls talk  
Girls talk girls talk
