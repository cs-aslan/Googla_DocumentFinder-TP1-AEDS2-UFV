Everybodys looking for last gang in town  
You better watch out for theyre all comin around  
  
The sport of today is exciting  
The in crowd are into infighting  
When some punk sees some rockolla  
Its rock and roll all over  
In every street and every station  
Kids fight like different nations  
And its brawn against brain  
And its knife against chain  
But its all young blood  
Flowing down the drain  
  
The Crops hit the Stiffs  
An the Spikes whipped the Quiffs  
Theyre all looking round  
  
For the last gang in town  
  
Meanwhile down in black town  
Those old soul rebels are haingin around  
An when some punk come a looking for sound  
Rastafari goes to ground  
The white heart flipped his pocket dipped  
cause a black sharp knife never slips  
And they never say to one another  
That tomorrow we might kill our brothers  
  
Down from the edge of London  
The rockabilly rebels came  
From another edge of London  
Skinhead gangs call out their name  
But not the Zydeco kids  
From the high rise  
Though they cant be recognized  
When you hear a Cajun fiddle  
Then youre nearly in the middle  
Of the last gang in town
