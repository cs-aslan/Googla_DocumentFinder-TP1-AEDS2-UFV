Headcase baby  
Shes a cool kind of crazy  
Wild and shes willing  
Into early Dylan

Heidi is a headcase a rebel and a rouser  
Cranks up her Rickenbacker  
Blasts away for hours  
Whats she doin now on the escalator  
Snorting up some speed on the picture of or Stiv Bators

When I look into her big brown eyes  
Im so glad to know shes mine
