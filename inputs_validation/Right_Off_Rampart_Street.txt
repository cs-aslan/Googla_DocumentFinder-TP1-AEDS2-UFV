Way down south in Louisiana up under the Delta heat child  
Theres an old boy plays an electric guitar right off Rampart Street  
Sometimes a GoGo girl come in with him she be shakin out a Mojo beat  
That old boy sure pick some old mean guitar right off Rampart Street  
Stays crowded every time hes there people come there from near and far  
I dont think nobody knows his name they just know its a GoGo guitar  
They just know its a GoGo guitar  
Way down south in Louisiana up under the Delta heat child  
Go see that old boy play his guitar right off Rampart Street  
Right off Rampart Street
