Ribbons of love  
Please keep me true sane  
Until I reach home on the morrow  
Never never to wander again  
Im weak and Im weary of sorrow  
  
London to Dublin  
Australia to Perth  
I gazed at your sky  
I tasted your earth  
Sung out my heart  
For what it was worth  
Never again shall I ramble  
  
Theres nowhere left  
In this world where to go  
My arms my legs theyre atremblin  
Thoughts both clouded and blue as the sky  
Not even worth the rememberin  
  
Now as I stumble  
And reel to my bed  
All that Ive done  
All that Ive said  
Means nothin to me  
Id soon as be dead  
All of this world be forgotten  
  
No words of comfort  
No words of advice  
Nothin to offer a stranger  
Gone the love gone the spite  
It just doesnt matter no longer  
  
My skys getting far  
The grounds gettin close  
My self goin crazy  
The way that it does  
Ill lie on my pillow  
And sleep if I must  
Too late to wish Id been stronger  
Too late to wish Id been stronger
