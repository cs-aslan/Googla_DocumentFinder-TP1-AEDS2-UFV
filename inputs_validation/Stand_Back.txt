I recall once upon a time  
Livin was so easy and I felt so fine  
But my my my right before my very eyes  
Satan came with fire to burn me  
Wouldnt listen when they warned me  
A dagger in my back while shes calling me honey  
Wouldnt stand back for neither love nor money  
  
Thirty minutes after my ship set sail  
She put up a sign and my house began to wail  
But why why why I couldnt see it in my little girls eyes  
She had such a way to fool me Lord she had a way to fool me  
And I would ask the woman Can you find it in yourself to please stand back  
You aint gonna rule me  
  
Just when all began to fade  
I reached out threw the Ace of Spades  
I put her on a train to the Everglades  
  
Now that its all over and gone  
Somehow I just dont feel so alone  
But lie lie lie it seemed like such a waste of time  
She did not ever seem to know me  
But now its much too late to show me  
But if I ever see that woman walkin down the street Ill just stand back  
And try to move away slowly  
Oh yeah
