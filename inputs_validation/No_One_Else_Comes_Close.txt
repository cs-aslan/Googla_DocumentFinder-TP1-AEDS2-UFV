When we turn out the lights  
The two of us alone together  
Somethings just not right  
But girl you know that I would never  
Ever let anothers touch come between  
the two of us  
  
Cause no one else will ever take your place  
  
Chorus  
No one else comes close to you  
No one makes me feel the way you do  
Youre so special girl to me  
And youll always be eternally  
Every time I hold you near  
You always say the words I love to hear  
Girl with just a touch you can do so much  
No one else comes close  
  
And when I wake up to  
The touch of your head on my shoulder  
Youre my dream come true oh yeah  
Girl you know Ill always treasure  
Every kiss and everyday Ill love you girl in  
every way  
And I always will cause in my eyes  
  
Chorus
