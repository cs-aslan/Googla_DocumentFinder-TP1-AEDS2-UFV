Ill be damned here comes your ghost again  
But thats not unusual  
Its just that the moon is full  
And you decided to call  
  
And here I sit hand on the telephone  
Hearing the voice Id known  
A couple of light years ago  
Headed straight for a fall  
  
But we both know what memories can bring  
They bring diamonds and rust  
Yes we both know what memories can bring  
They bring diamonds and rust  
  
Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair  
Now were smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over Washington Square  
Our breath comes in white clouds mingles and hangs in the air  
Speaking strictly for me we both couldve died then and there  
  
Now youre telling me youre not nostalgic  
Then give me another word for it  
You were so good with words  
And at keeping things vague  
  
Cause I need some of that vagueness now  
Its all come back too clearly yes I love you dearly  
And if youre offering me diamonds and rust Ive already paid  
  
But we both know what memories can bring  
They bring diamonds and rust  
Yes we both know what memories can bring  
They bring diamonds and rust  
  
Diamonds diamonds and rust  
Diamonds diamonds and rust  
Diamonds diamonds and rust  
Diamonds diamonds and rust
