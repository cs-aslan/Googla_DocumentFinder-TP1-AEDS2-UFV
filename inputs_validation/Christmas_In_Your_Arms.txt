All my friends are asking me where I plan to spend the holidays  
People seem to celebrate the season in so many different ways  
Some go where the weathers freezing cold while others like it warm  
I dont care about the weather just whether I spend Christmas in your arms  
  
Chorus  
We could drive up to the mountains build a fire and watch it snow  
We could sail down to the islands where the gentle breezes blow  
Id be happy in the city Id be happy on the farm  
I dont care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms  
  
It was only last December I had no Christmas spirit in my heart  
My world lay cold and shattered in the ashes of a dream that fell apart  
But now youre here beside me no greater gift is wrapped beneath my tree  
And the arms you wrap around me and the precious gift of love you give to me  
  
Chorus  
I dont care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms
