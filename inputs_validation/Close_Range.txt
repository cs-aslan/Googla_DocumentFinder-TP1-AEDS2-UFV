  
I want to scream I want to shout  
I want to know what its all about  
Ive seen it before but not like this  
I saw your name it was on the list  
  
By 4 oclock Its gonna change  
You were pretty high Its gonna change  
Lying on the floor Its gonna change  
Looking at the sky Its gonna change  
I remember you Its gonna change  
When you were a kid Its gonna change  
It was pretty strange Its gonna change  
The things you did  
  
Youve got to pull yourself together man  
Youve got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand   
Youve got the world right in your hand  
  
No cold heart could turn away  
And not be moved by what I saw today  
There on the floor thirty years or more  
He doesnt care he just wants to score  
  
By 4 oclock Its gonna change  
You were pretty high Its gonna change  
Lying on the floor Its gonna change  
Looking at the sky Its gonna change  
I remember you Its gonna change  
When you were a kid Its gonna change  
It was pretty strange Its gonna change  
The things you did  
  
Youve got to pull yourself together man  
Youve got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand   
Youve got the world right in your hand  
  
Youve got to pull yourself together man  
Youve got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand   
Youve got the world right in your hand  
  
Yet it only seems just like yesterday  
We used to run and hide  
Remember in the park where we used to play  
The grass looked ten foot high  
  
Youve got to pull yourself together man  
Youve got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand   
Youve got the world right in your hand  
  
Youve got to pull yourself together man  
Youve got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand   
Youve got the world right in your hand
