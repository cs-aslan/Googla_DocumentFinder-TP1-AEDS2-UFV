Theres a secret place I like to go  
Everyone is there but their face dont show  
If you get inside you cant get out  
Theres no coming back I hear them shout  
Welcome to my hide away my secret place  
How I arrived I cant explain  
Youre welcome to if you want to stay  
But everyone just runs away  
Let me in get me out  
Cant do more than twist and shout  
Lost my soul without a trace  
Found it again in my secret place  
In disgrace  
I hide from those that try to find me  
Scary things thats right behind me  
I lost myself I must confess  
I cant explain how I got this mess
