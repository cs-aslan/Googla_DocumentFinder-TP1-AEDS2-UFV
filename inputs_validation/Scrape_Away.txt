Your twisted cynicism  makes me feel sick  
Your open disgust for idealistic naive  
Youve given up hope youre jaded and ill  
The trouble is your thoughts a catching disease  
Ooh  you need to get away  
Ooh  you need a change of pace  
Because youre all dried up and you dont believe  
You reckon Im dreaming when I say I still feel real  
You say you work for yourself and its the only way  
But I look at you talking and to me you just scrape away  
What makes once young minds get in this state  
Is it age or just the social climate  
Youre talking like some fucking hardened MP  
Youre saying powers all  
And its power you need  
Ooh  you need to get away  
Ooh  you need a change of place  
Because youve given up on hope  
Youre emotionless  
Youve no need for love its just hate hate hate  
But I look at you shaking and it is you  
Who is scraping away  
You who is scraping away
