Blind man wavin by the side of the road  
Im in a flat bed Ford carrying a heavy load  
With a sweet thing sippin on a blueberry wine  
On a flat black highway down in Carolina  
Black bird slippin in a sky of blue  
  
All Im thinkin about is you baby  
All Im thinkin about is you honey  
All Im thinkin about is you baby  
All Im thinkin about is you  
Aint nothin in this world I can do about it  
All Im thinkin about is you  
  
Little boy carryin a fishin pole  
Little girl pickin berries straight off of the vine  
Brown bag filled with a little green toad  
We hook em through the lip and throw em off of the line  
Your sweet brown legs got me feeling so blue  
  
All Im thinkin about is you baby  
All Im thinkin about is you  
All Im thinkin about is you baby  
All Im thinkin about is you  
Aint nothin in this world I can do about it  
All Im thinkin about is you  
  
Black car shinin on a Sunday morn  
Mama go to church now Mama go to church now  
Friday night daddys shirt is torn  
Daddys goin downtown daddys goin downtown  
Aint no one understand this sweet thing we do  
  
All Im thinkin about is you baby  
All Im thinkin about is you  
All Im thinkin about is you baby  
All Im thinkin about is you  
Aint nothin in this world I can do about it  
All Im thinkin about is you  
  
Field turned up the seed is sowed  
Rain comin in from over cross the road  
Big black curtain coming cross the field  
Blind ll see the lame will be healed  
Brown eyed girl I turned my back on you now its lonely  
  
All Im thinkin about is you babe  
All Im thinkin about is you  
All Im thinkin about is you babe  
All Im thinkin about is you  
Aint nothin in this world take away these blues  
  
All Im thinkin about is you  
All Im thinkin about is you babe  
All Im thinkin about is you  
All Im thinkin about is you  
All Im thinkin about is you  
Aint nothin in this world I can do about it  
All Im thinkin about is you
