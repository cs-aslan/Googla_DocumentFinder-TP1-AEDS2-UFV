J Cole  
Hey to the college kids no scholarships  
Starting your semester  
Unpacking your suitcases filling up your dresser  
Enjoy it while you got it after that its God bless ya  
Life is your professor you know that btch is gon test ya  
I got some sht Id like to get off my chest  
I spill out my soul I spit out my stress  
And can I spit out my stress  
Its the feeling in the air you bout to drop a real classic  
He said Cole a lil birdy told me on the low you got an Illmatic  
Nobody touching Nas ngga its more like Villematic  
These fayettnam tales be paying off well  
What story is my audio theatre gon tell  
I know my debut will ship but is it gon sell  
I guess its in Gods hands  
I make the type of pieces that make Jesus say God damn  
Thats for your nonbelievers  
Im the truth only time will teach ya  
And fck the haters probably never love they mommas neither  
Old bitterass sit around in middle class homes with computers on hating on
the newest song  
While you was browsing I was taking out them student loans  
Trying to do this sht better than the nggas we grew up on  
Name a fcking song I aint threw up on  
Talk is cheap its like yall grew up in a Jewish home  
Pardon the stereotype  
But yall giving me mixed feelings like you married a white woman  
One minute Im overrated next minute Im the saviour  
You hate it before you played it I already forgave ya  
For bullshttin and the ngga Cole spittin it real  
Wrote this line on a plane got flown straight from the Ville  
To Miami where the same time last year  
I was broker than you I just wanna make that clear  
Cause now Im dealing with money Ive never seen before  
And Rnb btches want me that was just dreams before  
Now do I give in to the temptation Im facin  
The thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasin  
But Im just a man at times the timing is wrong  
Plus my dck is like a man with a mind of its own  
But Im trying to be strong remind myself she aint about sht  
These hoes the same all that change is the outfit  
Looking for chesse on some mouse sht  
Suck a ngga fck a ngga than go run they mouth quick  
Rappers took a vacation I came over the house sit  
You want change this that between the seats in your couch sht  
The fck you thought I lost it  
All that flame on my name would get exhausted  
Au contraire my ngga they all ears  
Sit back enjoy the ride its finna be a long year yeah  
Its finna be a long year yeah  
  
I know you feel that the tingle in your spine dont conceal that  
Dont conceal that  
This exactly what you thought  
Somebody bought the real back  
End
