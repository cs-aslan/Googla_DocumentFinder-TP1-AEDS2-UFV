Some people always know the right thing to say  
I dont really think I was born that way  
And with the gift of charm theyre well endowed  
I love to watch them float right through a crowd  
I used to think it took a giggly girl  
To win some fame in this mixed around world  
But I know better now  
One day I met a man who showed me love  
There standing on His head was a snow white dove  
And He saidOnce I came down to this mire for you  
But Im the Son of God Hes your Father too  
It wasnt long before my new walk began  
Since I found Jesus my life is in His hands  
Now I have life no one can take it from me  
And Ive a home above Im waiting to see  
Therere many rooms in the House of the Lord  
Why dont you come along and bring someone more  
I used to think it took a giggly girl  
To win some fame in this mixed around world  
But I know better now  
I know better now I know better now  
I know better now I know better now  
I know better now I know better now  
I know better now  
I know I know I know  
I know better now
