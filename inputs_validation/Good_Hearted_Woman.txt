A long time forgotten are dreams that just fell by the way  
And the good life he promised aint what shes living today  
But she never complains of the bad times or the bad things hes done  
She just talks about the good times theyve had and all the good times to come  
Shes a good hearted woman in love with a good timin man  
And she loves him in spite of his ways that she dont understand  
And through teardrops and laughter theyll pass through this world hand in
hand  
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin man  
  
Now he likes the night life and bright lights and good timin friends  
And when the partys all over shell welcome him back home again  
Though she dont understand him but she does the best that she can  
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin man  
Shes a good hearted woman  
Shes a good hearted woman
