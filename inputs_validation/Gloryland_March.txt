Glory hallujah we are marching on  
As we sing this song and it wont be long  
The man of Galilee will set us everyone free  
So get in the gloryland march  
There is an army that is marching onto victory  
The Captain is a man from Galilee  
Theyve all been saved and their souls set free  
By the blood of the Lamb on calvary  
So wont you join in the Spirit and be saved today  
Get on your knees and pray  
Help lead the wrong to right come join in the fight  
And get in the gloryland march  
Glory hallujah we are marching  
 steel  fiddle  guitar   
Blessed is the army that will follow God  
Longing for His kingdom as we onward trod  
Waiting for that moment when we leave the sod  
To live in peace forever in the presence of God  
He will give us power over man and sin well shout and enter in  
Well hear the victory ring when weve found our Saviour King  
So get in the gloryland march  
Glory hallujah we are marching
