Boss Man Boss Man what do ya say  
I gotta get you alone in the mine some day  
Boss Man Boss Man turn it around  
If you dont look away how can I sit down  
  
Look at this load upon my back  
Gotta get this wheel back on the track  
I cant hold on but I cant let go  
And I cant say yes I cant say no  
  
Holes in my pockets and holes in my shoes  
If youre ready for me Im ready for you  
The company plan takes all my pay  
Got a child in July and another last May  
  
Boss Man Boss Man what do ya say  
Gonna get you alone in the mine some day  
Push your face down in the coal  
Cause you got no heart you got no soul  
  
Country lifes the life for me  
In ten more years Ill a pensioner be  
The younger lad knows when the girls are out  
But you might say hes a rural sprout  
  
Boss Man Boss Man what do ya say  
Gonna get you alone in the mine some day  
Boss Man Boss Man clear the track  
Youre gonna tear the skin right offa my back  
  
Boss Man Boss Man what do ya say  
If you cant lend a hand then get outta my way  
Itll be murder in the first degree  
If you ever lay your hands on me  
  
Boss Man Boss Man pay my rent  
A dollar Ive earned is a dollar Ive spent  
The company plan takes all my check  
For breakin my back and riskin my neck  
  
Boss Man Boss Man what do ya say  
I gotta get you alone in the mine some day  
I cant hold on but I cant let go  
And I cant say yes I cant say no
