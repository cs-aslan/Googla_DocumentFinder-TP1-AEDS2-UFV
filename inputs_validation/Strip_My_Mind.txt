Arthur J did indicate  
The boulevard will never be  
So full of life and love again  hey  
Aw say goodbye to your boots man  
  
Hot as Hades early eighties  
Sing another song  
Make me feel like Im in love again hey  
You gotta lose to win  
  
Oh yeah  
Oh  
Please dont strip my mind  
Leave something behind  
Please dont strip my mind  
  
All in favor sign the waiver  
Bloody Carolina  
Wont you take another look inside hey  
Aw it will make me cry  
  
Operator cocreator  
Come on baby Ellie  
Wont you blow another compensator hey  
Ah you only get what you bring  
  
Oh yeah  
Oh  
Please dont strip my mind  
Leave something behind  
Please dont strip my mind  
  
El Dorado won the lotto  
All the cash and not a clue  
But now you know what Ive been through hey  
  
Oh yeah  
Oh  
Please dont strip my mind  
Leave something behind  
Please dont strip my mind  
Leave something behind
