I know what youre like  
Youre not sleepin at night  
I know youre losing control  
I know your plans  
  
Where youre keeping your hands  
I know its taking its toll  
Sweet little innocent girl  
Making your way in this world  
  
Something youre feeling tonight  
Tells you whats wrong and whats right  
You gotta keep me comin keep me comin  
Keep me comin keep me comin  
  
You gotta keep me comin keep me comin  
Keep me comin babe keep me comin  
Hands on my shoulders now  
Youre getting bolder  
  
Your fears are slipping away  
Each little bite lets me know that youre ripe  
Youre thinking maybe youll stay  
Now that youre burning to know  
  
How far youre willing to go  
Now that its under your skin  
Now that youre lettin me in  
You gotta keep me comin  
  
Ooh yeah comin comin  
Ooh yeah right here right now  
You gotta keep me comin
