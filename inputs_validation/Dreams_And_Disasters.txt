We were alone on the road driving faster  
So far from home we were chasing disaster  
Pour on the gas til the car caught on fire  
We had to laugh as the smoke billowed higher  
  
I wanna feel alive forever after  
And you say you say you wanna feel alive forever after  
And I and I and I say  
Fooollow the liiine through the dreams and disasters  
Fooollow the liiine to the edge and the after  
We wont turn around  
We will not slow down  
Fooollow the liiine through the dreams and disasters  
  
Think of the sun and the sound of it rising  
Still on the run with our eyes on the horizon  
  
I wanna feel alive forever after  
And you say you say you wanna feel alive forever after  
And I and I and I say  
Fooollow the liiine to the dreams and disasters  
Fooollow the liiine to the edge and the after  
We wont turn around  
We will not slow down  
Fooollow the liiine to the dreams and disasters  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
Fooollow the liiine through the dreams and disasters  
Fooollow the liiine to the edge and the after  
We wont turn around  
We will not slow down  
Fooollow the liiine through the dreams and disasters  
  
We wont turn around  
We will not slow down  
Fooollow the liiine through the dreams and disasters
