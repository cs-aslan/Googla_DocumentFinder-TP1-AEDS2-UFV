Well its a long hot night  
And the stars are shining kinda extra bright  
Sitting on the back porch glidin  
Whetting my appetite  
  
Well Im a sixpack high  
And start missing the light of my babys eyes  
Wasnt it beautiful the kind of a soul they said would never die  
  
Well its muggy in the shack  
And the backwoods are black  
Cause the clouds hid the moon away  
The light from my cigarette flickers in the dark  
The only way she knows Im here  
Then suddenly the sounds of the fiddles and accordions  
Sweetly begin to play and I can almost hear her sweet voice say  
  
Chorus  
Come on Joe just count to ten  
Pull yourself together again  
And come on Joe you gotta get hold of this mood youre in  
Come on Joe you gotta be strong  
Youre still young and life goes on to carry on  
Til were together again  
  
Hey I know shes right  
But its hard to fight when youre hurtin so  
I tried to walk out of that door before but I just cant go  
With the tears and the laughter in every rafter in every room  
Wasnt it beautiful  
Wasnt it the kind of happiness and glow  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on Joe  
Hey come on Joe  
To carry on til were together again
