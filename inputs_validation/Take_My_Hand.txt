Ohoh take my hand and walk with me  
Ohoh Im so lonely that I dont know what to do  
Wont someone take my hand and walk with me  
Ohoh at night I sleep and in my sleep I weep  
For someone to take my hand and walk with me  
I know that I will someday find a love  
And when I do I will thank the Lord up above  
Im so lonely that I dont know what to do  
Wont someone take my hand and walk with me  
Take my hand and walk with me
