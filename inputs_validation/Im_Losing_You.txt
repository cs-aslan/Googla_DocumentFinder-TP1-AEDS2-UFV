Here in some strangers room  
Late in the afternoon  
What am I doing here at all  
Aint no doubt about it  
Im losing you  
  
Somehow the wires have crossed  
Communications lost  
Cant even get you on the telephone  
Just got to shout about it  
Im losing you  
  
Here in the valley of indecision  
I dont know what to do  
I feel you slipping away  
I feel you slipping away  
Im losing you  
Im losing you  
  
You say youre not getting enough  
But I remind you of all that bad stuff  
So what the hell am I supposed to do  
Just put a bandaid on it  
And stop the bleeding now  
Stop the bleeding now  
  
I know I hurt you then  
But that was way back when  
And well do you still have to carry that cross  
Dont want to hear about it  
Im losing you  
Im losing you
