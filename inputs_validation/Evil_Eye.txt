Something about the way that you look on me  
You watch every move every word every fantasy  
Got no time for love theres something on your mind  
Got the face of an angel but the stare of a devil inside  
  
Got hell looking up heaven looking down  
People say the womans got an evil eye  
Got hell looking up heaven looking down  
Free me from the woman with the evil eye  
  
I turn away but still I see that evil stare  
Trapped inside my dreams I know youre there  
Thoughts of happiness you destroyed them all  
First inside my head then inside my soul  
  
Got hell looking up heaven looking down  
People say the womans got an evil eye  
Got hell looking up heaven looking down  
Free me from the woman with the evil eye
