Gotta give you love oh cherry  
Dance for me theres only you  
Play the barrooms just for pennies  
Wish I wasnt just passing through  
Tell me your secrets tell me no one way lyin now  
We are golden  We are golden  
And Im out here on the road I feel just like a rolling stone  
Into the highways of the night I roll alone  
On the tabletops shes dancing sit and smile into your beer  
Turn around no cherry for me let me know you know Im here  
We are golden We are golden  
And Im out here on the road I feel just like a rolling stone  
Into the highways of the night making it feel all right  
Come on cherry lets make it together  
Out of the neon and into my life  
We cant play this game forever now  
  
Gotta give my love oh Cherry dance for me there s only you  
Play the barrooms just for pennies wish I wasnt just passing through  
Tell me your secrets tell me no one way lyin now  
We are golden we are golden  
And Im out here on the road I feel just like a rolling stone  
Into the highways of the night I roll alone
