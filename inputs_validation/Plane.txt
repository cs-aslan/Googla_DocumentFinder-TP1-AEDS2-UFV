Drain the veins in my head  
Clean out the reds in my eyes to get by security lines  
Dear xray machine  
Pretend you dont know me so well  
I wont tell if you lied  
Cry cause the droughts been brought up  
Drinkin cause youre lookin so good in your Starbucks cup  
I complain for the company that I keep  
The windows for sleeping rearrange  
And Im nobody  
Well whos laughin now  
  
Im leaving your town again  
And Im over the ground that youve been spinning  
And Im up in the air so baby hell yeah  
Well Honey I can see your house from here  
If the plane goes down damn  
Ill remember where the love was found  
If the plane goes down damn  
  
Damn I should be so lucky  
Even only 24 hours under your touch  
You know I need you so much  
I cannot wait to call you  
And tell you that I landed somewhere  
And hand you a square of the airport  
And walk you through the maze of the map  
That Im gazing at  
Gracefully unnamed and feeling guilty for the luck  
And the look that you gave me  
You make me somebody  
Aint nobody knows me  
Not even me can see it yet I bet Im  
  
Im leaving your town again  
And Im over the ground that youve been spinning  
And Im up in the air so baby hell yeah  
Oh honey I can see your house from here  
If the plane goes down damn  
Ill remember where the love was found  
If the plane goes down damn  
  
You keep me high minded  
You get me high  
  
Flax seeds well they tear me open  
And supposedly you can crawl right through me  
Taste these teeth please  
And undress me from these sweaters better hurry  
Cause Im keeping upward bound now  
Oh maybe Ill build my house on your cloud  
Here Im tumbling for you  
Stumbling through the work that I have to do  
Dont mean to harm you  
  
By leaving your town again  
But Im over the quilt that youve been spinning  
But Im up in the air said baby hell yeah  
Oh honey I can see your house from here  
If the plane goes down damn  
Ill remember where the love was found  
If the plane goes down damn  
Ill remember where the love was found  
If the plane goes down damn  
Well Ill remember where the love was found  
If the plane goes down damn  
  
You keep me high  
You get me high minded  
You keep me high  
You get me high minded
