Many rivers to cross Live from The Mirage  
  
Many rivers to cross  
But I cant seem to find my way over  
Wandering I am lost  
As I travel along the white cliffs of dover  
Yes Ive got many rivers to cross  
And its only my will that keeps me alive  
Cause Ive been licked washed up for years  
And I merely survive because of my pride  
  
And this lonliness wont leave me alone  
Its such a drag to be on your own  
Cuz my man left me and he didnt say why  
So I guess Ill have to cry  
  
Ive got many rivers to cross  
But just where to begin Im playing for time  
Cuz thereve been times I find myself  
Thinking of committing a dreadful crime  
  
And this lonliness wont leave me alone  
Its such a drag to be on your own  
My man left me and he didnt say why  
So I guess Ill have to cry  
  
Ive got many rivers to cross  
But just where to begin Im playing for time  
But Ive been licked and washed up for years  
And I merely survive because of my pride  
Many rivers to Oh cross
