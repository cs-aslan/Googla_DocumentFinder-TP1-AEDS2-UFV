We met as two total strangers  
As many lovers often do  
But who could have ever seen the danger  
I didnt know Id fall in love with you  
  
Chorus  
You are this lonely pickers daydream  
Like a wish thats wishing to come true  
So Liberty just now Im waiting  
To share this love song with you  
  
But do you think about me when youre lying in his bed  
Wont you take the time to explain  
Do you ever think youd rather be with me instead  
Or do you only think about me when it rains  
  
We shared some special nights together  
We said wed watch the morning rise  
But when the sun was all around us  
Wasnt nothing I hadnt seen in your eyes  
  
I try so hard to keep it hidden  
But I am hurting deep inside  
For every time Ive seen you smile  
There are two times that I have cried  
  
Chorus  
  
Now and forever my love will be the same  
I will be waiting underneath the pouring rain
