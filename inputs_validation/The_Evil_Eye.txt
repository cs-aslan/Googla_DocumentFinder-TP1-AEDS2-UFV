Whos that aknockin at my door tonight  
Leave me alone til theres morning light  
You live and learn you make mistakes  
You cant imagine why  
The fire burns for heavens sake  
Look out for the evil eye  
Who was that damsel with that wicked stare  
Get off my case and take your sins elsewhere  
You love and learn you cross that bridge  
You want to pacify  
The tables turn and youve dug your ditch  
Look out for the evil eye  
Oh look out  
Oh look out  
I said look out  
I said look out  
You live and learn you make mistakes  
You wonder how and why  
The fire burns for heavens sake  
Look out for the evil eye  
Oh look out  
Oh look out  
I said look out  
I said look out
