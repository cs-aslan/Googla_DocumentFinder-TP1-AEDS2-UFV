Love doesnt come with a contract  
You give me this I give you that  
And its scary business  
Your heart and soul is on the line  
Baby why else would I be standing round here so tonguetied  
  
Chorus  
If I knew what I was doing Id be doing it right now  
I would be the best damn poet  
Silver words out of my mouth  
Well my words might not be magic  
But they cut straight to the truth  
So if you need a lover and a friend  
Baby Im in Im in  
  
Baby come on in the waters fine  
Ill be right here you take your time  
Just let me hold you and well both take that leap of faith  
Its like I told you theres no guarantees when you feel this way  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby Im in and Im in  
  
Baby come here next to me Ill show you how good it can be  
Ill breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am  
Everything thing I am  
  
Oh and if I knew what I was doing Id be doing it right now  
I would be the best damn poet silver words out of my mouth  
Well my words might not be magic  
But they cut straight to the truth  
So if you need a lover and a friend yeah  
If you need a lover and a friend  
Oh baby Im in and Im in  
Baby Im in and Im in  
  
Baby come here next to me Ill show you how good it can be  
Ill breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am  
And baby come here next to me Ill show you how good it can be  
And baby come here next to me Ill show you how good it can be  
Baby come here baby come here baby come here
