Come on baby dont you wanna go  
Way down south talkin bout Mexico  
Straight through the jungle out to the sea  
Well have some fun if you fly away with me  
Like some old movie in black and white  
Well fall in love in the middle of the night  
Me and you down in Veracruz  
Do what you wanna do down in Veracruz  
Come on baby dont you wanna come  
In the town people movin to the drums  
Let me tell ya that  
Rosas Cantina it never stops  
Drinkin cerveza people party til they drop  
Forget the laundry forget the rain  
Well get to heaven on the seven thirty plane  
Me and you down in Veracruz  
Do what you wanna do down in Veracruz  
In Incomprehensible it never stops  
You wanna party We can party til we drop  
Forget the laundry forget the rain  
Got to get to heaven on the seven thirty plane  
Me and you down in Veracruz  
Do what you wanna do down in Veracruz  
Me and you down in Veracruz  
Do what you wanna do down in Veracruz  
Me and you  
Down in Veracruz  
Down in Veracruz
