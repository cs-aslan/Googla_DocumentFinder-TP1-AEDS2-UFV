Battersea how it is  
Its over forget  
Memories full of chocolate  
Ive got to get over it forget  
Your world is different than mine  
Ive got to get over Ive got to forget  
And Sgurd is the one I dont like  
Im afraid of him Ive got to forget  
  
Knocking on the blue water  
Its over forget  
Praline and chocolate ice  
Got to get over forget  
Your world doesnt match with mine  
Ive got to get over Ive got to forget  
And Sgurd rules your friends life  
Im afraid of him Ive got to forget
