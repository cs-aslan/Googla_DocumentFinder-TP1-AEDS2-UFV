I wonder if you sleep right now  
Do you realize Im clinging to  
The edge of this bed I have  
Nowhere to go I have nowhere  
  
If I leave youll call me quitter  
If I stay youll punish me with silence and somehow  
Youll fall asleep Youll fall asleep  
  
Chorus  
Well do you know that I wont sleep  
No I wont sleep all night long  
As your silhouette turns its back on my spoon  
Im mesmerized by the ricochet moon  
Leaping this leprechauns Rumplestiltskins wall  
  
Im so disenchanting  
Intoxicated by my own tears soul  
And come tomorrow  
When my beauty is old  
Like a speckled princess  
Ill try to cash in clovers for gold  
So Ill light a candle and begin to  
Write turn to my work as refuge  
  
Though my womb is a rush hour taxi  
Ride but I will try  
To metamorphose pain along my plight  
But Ill despise each word I write  
So I am clinging to the  
Edge like some soapopera star  
With her ten second fade  
As the light cascades  
Do you love me anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill try to spin straw into gold  
Straw into gold Straw into gold Straw into gold  
Spinning for mercy  
Spinning for hope  
Spinning for love  
Spinning for gold
