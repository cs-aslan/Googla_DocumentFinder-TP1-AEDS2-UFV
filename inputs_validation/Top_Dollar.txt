Well I tried to find something  
Something to hold on to  
I thought it was you  
Cause Im sick and tired  
Of trying to make something  
  
Something out of nothing  
I guess that you were bluffing  
Now I think Im losing my mind  
The pain in my heart  
  
Was it worth the price  
The pain in my heart  
Was it worth the time that I wasted on you  
Youre giving me the Top Dollar blues  
  
And I gave you it all all  
All that I could give you  
Youve taken what Ive given  
And thrown it all away  
  
Like its nothing  
Never meant nothing  
Now Im left with nothing  
What an awful price Ive paid  
  
The pain in my heart  
Was it worth the price  
The pain in my heart  
Was it worth the time that I wasted on you  
  
Youre giving me the Top Dollar blues  
Ive bet all my money and thats how it goes  
You ran a good race  
But you lost just by a nose  
  
Its true  
Baby youre giving me the Top Dollar blues  
The Top Dollar blues  
I gave you it all all  
  
All that I could give you  
And the Top Dollar blues  
Top Dollar blues
