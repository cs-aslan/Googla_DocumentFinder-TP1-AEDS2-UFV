Remember how lonely I told you it would be  
Without you here with me  
But you just turned and walked away  
And now that Ive found somebody new  
Youve changed your tune  
You want me back but all I can say  
  
Chorus  
Its too late now  
Just tell me how long did you think  
Id be your fool  
And I would sit right here an wait  
For you to make up  
Your mind to show up  
Well just turn around  
Im sorry its too late now  
  
Well didnt I tell you that one of these days  
It would be too late  
To say youd made a big mistake  
And now youve come back like youve never been gone  
Well baby youre wrong  
Somebody else has taken your place  
  
Chorus
