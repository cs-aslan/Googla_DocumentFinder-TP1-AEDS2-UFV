What Im lookin for  
Is a love thats forever  
Someone who can capture my soul in a heartbeat  
And stay for all time  
What Im prayin for  
Is a match made in heaven  
Someone who will worship my body  
And still put his heart on the line  
  
Commitment  
Someone wholl go the distance  
I need somebody with staying power  
Wholl make me go weak in the knees  
Commitment  
And everything that goes with it  
I need honor and love in my life from somebody  
Whos playin for keeps  
  
What Im searching for  
Is a man wholl stand by me  
Who will walk through the fire  
And be my flame in the night  
I wont settle for  
Less than what I deserve  
A friend and a lover wholl love me  
For the rest of my life  
  
Commitment  
Someone wholl go the distance  
I need somebody with staying power  
Wholl make me go weak in the knees  
Commitment  
And everything that goes with it  
I need honor and love in my life from somebody  
Whos playin for keeps  
  
Yeah Ive had promises broken  
Three words left unspoken  
They just left me achin for more  
But Ill fight temptation  
I wont be impatient  
Theres one thing thats worth waitin for  
  
Commitment  
Someone wholl go the distance  
I need somebody with staying power  
Wholl make me go weak in the knees  
  
Commitment  
And everything that goes with it  
I need honor and love in my life from somebody  
Whos playin for keeps  
  
Commitment  
Someone wholl go the distance  
I need somebody with staying power  
Wholl make me go weak in the knees  
  
Commitment  
And everything that goes with it  
I need honor and love in my life from somebody  
Whos playin for keeps  
  
Way  
Commitment
