Late at night I like to hide  
I dwell inside the shadows  
But I wasnt always this alive  
Since you hung me from the gallows  
You know I love the night  
And I love the darkness  
As I cruise along the highway  
Now there is no more light  
And there is no more sweetness  
I will always have it my way  
Well I am the ghost inside your head  
And I will rock your world from dusk to dawn  
Dont you cry for those who bled  
Cause I will rock your world from dusk to dawn  
I am the bogeyman  
Well dont believe in what you see  
And dont believe in what you hear  
Dont you worry its only me  
And I am the sum of all your fears  
Well I am the ghost inside your head  
And I will rock your world from dusk to dawn  
Dont you cry for those who bled  
Cause I will rock your world from dusk to dawn  
I am the bogeyman And Im no holyman  
I am the bogeyman  
I am the bogeyman  
guitar solo  
I am the bogeyman  
I am the bogeyman  
And Im no holyman  
I am the bogeyman
