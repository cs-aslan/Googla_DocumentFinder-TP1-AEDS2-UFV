I forgot that love existed troubled in my mind  
Heartache after heartache worried all the time  
I forgot that love existed  
Then I saw the light  
Everyone around me make everything alright  
  
Oh oh Socrates and Plato they  
Praised it to the skies  
Anyone whos ever loved  
Everyone whos ever tried  
  
If my heart could do my thinking  
And my head begin to feel  
I would look upon the world anew  
And know whats truly real
