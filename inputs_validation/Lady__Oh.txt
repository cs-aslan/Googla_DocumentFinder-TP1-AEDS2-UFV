Ladyoh ladyoh I walked the streets again last night  
I saw you in the city light like a vision ladyoh  
Lady I lady I Ive been waitin around such a long long time  
Believin I could make you mine just wanting you ladyoh  
But here I am and there you are much too far to even hear me  
Hurts a lot you know it does it hurts a lot  
Oh ladyoh am I gonna ever learn what I never learned before  
City lights city lights burn so warm and they burn so bright  
But me I walk the city night to forget you ladyoh  
But here I am and there you are much too far to even hear me  
Hurts a lot you know it does it hurts a lot  
Oh ladyoh am I gonna ever learn what I never learned before
