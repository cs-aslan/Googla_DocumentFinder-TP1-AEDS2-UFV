I dont know where Ive come from  
I dont know where Im off to  
And I need to find a way out  
And hes here to help me find it  
  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
Im not going to race you today  
  
I need a life the same as  
And I dont believe in anything  
I promise to leave you one of these days  
I promise itll be real soon  
  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
Im not going to race you today  
  
I promise to leave you  
I promise to leave you  
I promise to leave you  
I promise to leave you
