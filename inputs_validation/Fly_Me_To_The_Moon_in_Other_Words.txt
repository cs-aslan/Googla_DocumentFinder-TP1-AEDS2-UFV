Poets often use many words  
To say a simple thing  
It takes thought and time and rhyme  
To make a poem singing  
With music and words Ive been flying  
For you I have written a song  
To be sure that youll know what Im saying  
Ill translate as I go along  
Fly me to the moon  
And let me play among the stars  
Wont you let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars  
In other words Hold my hand  
In other words Darling kiss me  
Fill my heart with song  
And let me sing forever more  
You are all I long for all I worship and adore  
In other words Please be true  
In other words I love you  
In other words Please be true  
In other words I love you  
Comon just take me to the moon yeah
