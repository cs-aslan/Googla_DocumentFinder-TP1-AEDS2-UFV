Dont care too much for  
Your backstabbin and side steppin  
Youre all sweet talk youre all lust  
Youre the kind yeah I dont trust

Before you damage my pride  
Let me through dont spoil my view

You got me runnin you got me runnin  
But I aint gonna hide  
And yesterday everything seemed okay  
Yeah you better run and hide away
