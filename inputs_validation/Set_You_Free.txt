We often fool ourselves  
And say that its love  
Only cause when its gone  
We end up being lonely  
So how are we to know  
That it just isnt so  
That we just have to let each other go  
There were many times  
When we shared precious moments  
But later realized  
They were only stolen moments  
So how are we to know  
That it just wasnt so  
That we just had to let each other go  
CHORUS  
If loving you is all that means to me  
When being happy is all I hope youd be  
Then loving you must mean  
I really have to set you free  
Each day we meet my love for you  
Keeps growing stronger  
But everytime we meet  
Makes leaving you so much harder  
So how are we to know  
That this just wasnt so  
That we just have to let each other go  
CHORUS  
If loving you is all that means to me  
When being happy is all I hope youd be  
Then loving you must mean  
I really have to set you free  
BRIDGE  
Letting go is not an easy task  
When smiling feels like I must wear this lonely mask  
It hurts deep inside  
And I just cannot hide  
That theres anguish at the thought  
That we should have to part  
CHORUS  
If loving you is all that means to me  
When being happy is all I hope youd be  
Then loving you must mean  
I really have to set you free  
If loving you is all that means to me  
When being happy is all I hope youd be  
Then loving you must mean  
I really have to set you free
