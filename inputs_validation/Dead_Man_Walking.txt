I hear the angels talking talking talking  
Now Im a dead man walking walking walking  
I hear the angels talking talking talking  
Now Im a dead man  
  
I hear the angels talking talking talking  
Now Im a dead man walking walking walking  
I hear the angels talking talking talking  
Now Im a dead man  
  
I see you standing there but youre already gone  
Im holding your hand but youre barely holding on  
Im kissing your lips but it just dont feel the same  
Am I dead there now left living with the blame  
Oh I hear the angels talking talking talking  
Now Im a dead man walking walking walking  
  
Already broken already gone  
Already know youre moving on  
Im a breathing talking  
Dead man walking  
Already see it in your face  
Already someone in my place  
Im a breathing talking  
Dead man walking  
  
I hear the angels talking talking talking  
Now Im a dead man walking walking walking  
I hear the angels talking talking talking  
Now Im a dead man  
  
Were in the same room just one million miles away  
With all these books around but we aint go two words to say  
Am I a dead man now left living with the shame  
Im  
  
Already broken already gone  
Already know youre moving on  
Im a breathing talking  
Dead man walking  
Already see it in your face  
Already someone in my place  
Im a breathing talking  
Dead man walking  
  
Im a breathing talking  
Dead man walking  
  
I hear the angels talking talking talking  
Now Im a dead man walking walking walking  
I hear the angels talking talking talking  
Now Im a dead man  
  
Already broken already gone  
Already know youre moving on  
Im a breathing talking  
Dead man walking  
Already see it in your face  
Already someone in my place  
Im a breathing talking  
Dead man walking  
  
Im a breathing talking  
Dead man walking  
Im a breathing talking  
Dead man walking  
  
I hear the angels talking talking talking  
Now Im a dead man walking walking walking  
I hear the angels talking talking talking  
Now Im a dead man  
  
I hear the angels talking talking talking  
Now Im a dead man walking walking walking  
I hear the angels talking talking talking  
Now Im a dead man  
  
Now Im a dead man
