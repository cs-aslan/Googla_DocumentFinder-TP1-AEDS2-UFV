Looking for salvation Im blind  
Thought contamination I find  
Greedy spiders talk to me in my head  
I think Im drifting  
  
Im in the big machine My next heros calling  
Who knows what he may bring to me  
  
Government intrusion again  
Cultural illusion offends  
Grain of sand in traffic jam and Im late  
I think Im drifting  
  
Im in the big machine My next heros calling  
Who knows what she may bring to me  
  
See the demons all around and sometimes  
I feel like one of them Feel the rage is building inside  
I walk to the final edge Im dreaming  
  
Im in the big machine My next heros calling  
Who knows what he may bring to me
