I still remember the ways that you touched me  
Now I know I dont mean anything to you  
Youre easy breezy and Im Japanesewhy  
Soon youll mean exactly nothin to me  
And that means  
  
You look stupid  
Tellin all your friends how you got the best of me  
I intended to share the pleasure  
Only I look stupid  
Were livin in a world with a lot of pressure  
Its quite unneeded to put more pressure on me  
  
You came and went and left my house like I was just passin by  
Hello goodbye you left a note saying twas nice stoppin by  
I should have never ever let you inside  
  
Chorus  
I still remember the ways that you touched me  
Now I know I dont mean anything to you  
Youre easy breezy and Im Japanesewhy  
Soon youll mean exactly nothin to me  
Does that mean anything to you  
  
Easy breezy  
Do you whistle so high that youre feelin lonely  
How do I breathe  
With all this pressure on me  
Easy breezy  
When you wrestle you know that you hurt somebody  
How do I breathe  
With all this pressure on me  
  
You came and went and left my house like I was just passin by  
Konnichiwa sayanora  
Twas nice of you to stop by  
Would it amuse you if I told you that I  
  
I still remember the ways that you touched me  
Now I know I dont mean anything to you  
Youre easy breezy and Im Japanesewhy  
Soon youll mean exactly nothin to me  
Does that mean anything to you  
  
Youre easy breezy and Im Japanesewhy  
Soon youll mean exactly nothin to me  
Does that mean anything to you  
  
Youre easy breezy and Im Japanesewhy  
Soon youll mean exactly nothin to me  
Does that mean anything to you  
Youre easy breezy and Im Japanesewhy  
  
Shes got a new microphone  
Shes got a new microphone  
Youre easy breezy and Im Japanesewhy  
Shes got a new microphone  
Doesnt need you anymore  
She doesnt need you anymore
