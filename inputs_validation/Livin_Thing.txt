Sailin away on the crest of a wave  
Its like magic  
Rollin and ridin and slippin and slidin  
Its magic  
  
And you and your sweet desire  
You took me higher and higher  
Its a livin thing  
Its a terrible thing to lose  
Its a given thing  
What a terrible thing to lose  
  
Making believe this is what you conceived  
From your worst day  
Moving in line then you look back in time  
To your first day  
  
And you and your sweet desire  
You took me higher and higher  
Its a livin thing  
Its a terrible thing to lose  
Its a given thing  
What a terrible thing to lose  
  
Takin a dive cos you cant halt the slide  
floating downstream  
So let her go Dont start spoiling the show  
Its a bad dream  
  
And you and your sweet desire  
You took me higher and higher  
Its a livin thing  
Its a terrible thing to lose  
Its a given thing  
What a terrible thing to lose
