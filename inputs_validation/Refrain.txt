I look out and  
I see the rain  
As it falls on  
My window pane  
And the music  
Thats in my heart  
Is a  
Sad refrain  
  
Endless traffic of  
Sounds and sights  
Midst the glitter  
Of neon lights  
Still the music  
Thats in my heart  
Is the same  
Sad refrain  
  
Memries of you follow  
Everywhere I go  
Down the high and  
Biways of my days  
Music of your laughter  
Fills my every dream  
Like a love song  
From long ago  
Never ending streams  
Of faces come and go  
Million diffrent  
People all around  
No use searching for  
Ill never find you  
There for you are  
Far beyond compare  
  
Take a jet  
To a hideaway  
From the humdrum  
Of everyday  
Still the music  
Thats in my heart  
Is a  
Sad refrain  
  
Fluctuations in  
The market scene  
Fill my DowJones  
With every beam  
And the music  
Thats in my heart  
Is the same  
Sad refrain  
  
Memries of you follow  
Everywhere I go  
Down the high and  
Biways of my days  
Music of your laughter  
Fills my every dream  
Like a love song  
From long ago  
Never ending streams  
Of faces come and go  
Million diffrent  
People all around  
No use searching for  
Ill never find you  
There for you are  
Far beyond compare  
  
La ra ra ra ra  
Ra ra ra ra  
No use searching  
For Ill never  
No use searching for  
Ill never find you  
There for you are  
Far beyond compare
