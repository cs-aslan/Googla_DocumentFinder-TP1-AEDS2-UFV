Oh look out kids its that time of year  
When ole Santas on his way  
Dont look now but the top is down  
On his candy apple sleigh  
  
Headin on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in his hair  
Make no mistake its here  
Holiday fun good cheer  
Its Christmas time again  
In California wooh  
  
The boulevard lights of red and green  
As the snow birds make the scene  
Hollywood doesnt miss a beat  
Its another childhood dream  
  
Headin on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in your hair  
Make no mistake its here  
Holiday fun good cheer  
Its Christmas time for sure  
In California  
  
People say it cant be true  
That the spirit lives here too  
But youll find Christmas everywhere  
Under palm trees sun and moon  ah  
  
Headin on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in your hair  
Make no mistake its here  
Holiday fun good cheer  
Its Christmas time again  
In California  
  
Make no mistake its here  
Holiday fun good cheer  
Its Christmas time again  
In California  
In California  
In California wooh
