When i feel down i look to you  
When i feel low your words ring true  
Its not by might or in my strength  
But its by your spirit moving in my life  
Cause God you are my life  
  
I will praise you  
youre everything to me  
Ill live for you  
Youre the reason that i sing  
I wont go back to the way it used to be  
Cause ive found you and your everything to me  
  
At times when i look down and all i see is  
Sinking sand  
Im thankful that its you the solid rock on  
Which i stand
