Like shining oil this night is dripping down  
Stars are slipping down glistening  
And Im trying not to think what Im leaving now  
No deceiving now its time you let me know  
Let me know  
  
Chorus  
When the lights go out and we open our eyes  
Out there in the silence Ill be gone Ill be gone  
Let the sun fade out and another one rise  
Climbing through tomorrow Ill be gone Ill be gone  
  
This in between us is getting thinner now  
Into winter now bitter sweet  
Across that horizon this sun is setting down  
Youre forgetting now its time you let me go let me go  
  
Chorus  
  
And tell them I couldnt help myself  
And tell them I was alone  
Oh tell me I am the only one  
And theres nothing left to stop me  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill be gone Ill be gone
