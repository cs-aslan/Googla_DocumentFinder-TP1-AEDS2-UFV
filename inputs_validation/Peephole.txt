When your stars are baked  
And your rivers fly  
Do you ever believe you were stuck out in the sky  
  
When your castle breaks  
And your feet are dry  
Do you ever believe you were stuck out in the sky  
  
Do you believe when youre high  
That your life is tried  
  
Dont you ever get stuck in the sky  
Dont you ever get stuck in the sky  
Dont ever get stuck in the sky when youre high  
  
When your moon is fake  
And your mermaids cry  
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky  
  
When your tunnel fades  
And your guide is shy  
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky  
  
Do you believe when youre high  
That your life is tried  
  
Dont you ever get stuck in the sky  
Dont you ever get stuck in the sky  
Dont ever get stuck in the sky when youre high  
Dont you ever get stuck in the sky  
Dont you ever get stuck in the sky  
Dont ever get stuck in the sky when youre high  
  
Dont you ever get stuck in the sky  
Dont you ever get stuck in the sky  
Dont you ever get stuck in the sky  
Dont you ever get stuck in the sky  
Dont you ever get stuck in the sky  
Dont you ever get stuck in the sky  
Dont ever get stuck in the sky when youre high
