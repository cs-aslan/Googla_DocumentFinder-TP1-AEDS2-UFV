Baby theres no way of knowing  
If weve got a good thing going  
Better not believe in true love  
Thats what people say  
  
Theres nothing fatal in attraction  
Im just looking for some action  
Better not go chasing rainbows  
Thats what people say  
  
Every time i see your face  
Emotion takes control of me  
It turns me round and puts me in a spin  
Oh cant you see  
  
Chorus  
I just want to love you  
I want to be the one  
Whos holding you tonight  
I just want to love you  
Every minute of the hour  
Every morning noon and night  
  
Theres gotta be a way to show you  
Id really like to get to know you  
I could make you happy  
If youd take a chance on me  
  
Dont want to talk about forever  
Cant you see its now or never  
Dont think about tomorrow  
Take a change on me  
  
You know it makes me so excited  
Every time i think of you  
It turns me round and puts me in a spin  
Oh cant you see  
  
Chorus  
  
I just want to love you  
I i just want to love you  
holding you tonight  
I just want to love you  
I i just want to love you  
every morning noon and night  
  
Take a chance take a chance chance  
Take a chance take a chance  
Take a chance on me  
Take a chance take a chance chance  
Take a chance take a chance  
Take a chance on me  
  
Chorus  
  
I just want to love you  
I just want to love you  
holding you tonight  
I just want to love you  
I just want to love you  
every morning noon and night  
  
Chorus
