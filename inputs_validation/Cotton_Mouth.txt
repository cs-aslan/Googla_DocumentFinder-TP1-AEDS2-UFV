Red eyed momma keep cryin  
Blue eyed cat keeps a lyin  
Catfish keep his eye on the string  
And that cotton mouth keep on windin  
Sing sing sing  
Dark moon keeps hidin  
And gator he keeps right on slidin  
And bull frog he aint mindin  
Oh cotton mouth keep on windin  
Sing sing sing  
Lightnin bugs in bottles  
They gimme all the light I need  
And Im seinin bait for linin  
And that cotton mouth keeps on windin  
Sing sing sing  
Oh that big iron pots a boilin  
And that red eyed momma keeps toilin  
And the crawdad meats for dinin  
And oh that cotton mouth keeps on windin lord  
Sing sing sing
