I dont want to know the reason why you dont love me  
I dont want to know the reason why you dont care  
I dont want to know the reason why youre leaving me  
Im not the only one that lost my love way down there  way down there  
  
I dont want to hear the reason why you dont need me  
I dont want to hear the reason why you dont stay  
I dont want to hear the reason why youre seeing him  
All I know is that I want you back but youre  
  
Chorus  
  
A million miles away and its killing me inside  
Theres a stranger in a carriage and hes taking her out tonight  
The devils riding on a full moon and he sends his love  
When Im a million miles away  
  
I dont want to be the reason why you dont love me  
And I dont want to be the reason why you dont care  
I dont want to be the reason why youre leaving me  
Im not the only one that lost my love  
  
He sends his love and Im a hundred million miles away
