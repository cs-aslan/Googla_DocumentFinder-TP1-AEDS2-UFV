If you think I want the life you choose to live  
I dont think I want the love youve got to give  
If you think my goals could be so trivial and small  
Then I dont think you know me at all  
Born between the covers of your fashion books  
You think you can make it girl on just your looks  
But you could never bring me up  
Between us stands a wall  
No I dont think you know me at all  
Believing in the promise painted in your smile  
Ive chased what I was running from girl all my life  
Ive known you a hundred times in memories I recall but  
I dont think you know me at all  
I dont think you know me at all
