Baby come close let me tell you this  
In a whisper my heart says you know it too  
Baby we both share a secret wish  
And youre feeling my love reaching out to you  
  
Timeless  
Dont let it end no  
Now that youre right here in my arms where you should stay  
Hold tight baby  
Timeless  
Dont let it fade out of sight  
Just let the moments sweep us both away  
Lifting us to where  
We both agree  
This is timeless love  
  
I see it all baby in your eyes  
When you look at me I know I feel it too yes I do  
So lets sail away and be forever baby  
Where the crystal ocean melts into the sky  
We shouldnt let the moment pass  
Making me shiver lets make it last  
Why should we lose it dont ever let me go  
  
Timeless  
Baby its timeless  
Oh baby its timeless  
  
Timeless  
Dont let it fade out of sight  
Just let the moments sweep us both away  
Lifting us to where  
We both agree  
Its just timeless  
Its just timeless  
  
Love
