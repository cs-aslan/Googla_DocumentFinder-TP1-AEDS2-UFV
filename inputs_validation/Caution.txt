do not stop on tracks  
I went down one day I went down one day to see a gypsy woman  
Just one old day yes I did  
I want to find out I want to find out  
I want to find out I want to find out now  
Whats wrong with me and my baby  
We aint gettin down like we used to do  
I mean its pretty good now but there was a time  
When it didnt work too well  
I went down to see this gypsy woman you understand  
I told her my story I told her what was goin on  
And she told me man she said all you need all you need  
She said all you got to have oh lord  
Just a touch of mojos hand oh bring it back on  
And it feels pretty good yes indeed
