How could you be everything  
We were crackin you up to be  
Were cracking ourselves up too  
Were cracking ourselves up to be you  
Had you in my hand now whered you go Aurora  
See you up ahead but I dont know if I could go as far as you go  
Everything keeps on happening and its happening to me  
Im losing side of its meaning  
You blew away the meaning  
Had it in my head but whered it go Aurora  
See you up ahead but I dont know if I could go as far as you go  
And everyone keeps telling me that this is good  
I needed you to tell me it was is good too  
Had you in my head but whered you go Aurora  
I See you up ahead but I dont know if I could go as far as you go
