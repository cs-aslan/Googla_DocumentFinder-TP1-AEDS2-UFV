Quarter after seven got a phone call  
Telling me to get here quick  
Said your girl is in a bad situation  
They dont know if shes gonna make it  
  
As I hurry to be by her side  
I ask a thousand times why oh why  
Theres no rhyme or reason in my life  
With you lying here this way  
  
Id give anything just to trade places with you  
So Im begging heaven down on my knees  
To help you make it through  
  
Tell me can heaven wait  
Can heaven wait just one more night  
Tell me what its gonna take  
To keep you with me in my life  
  
Giving up the shame of my other life  
Now Im seeing things in a whole new light  
Lord I vow to change if you just make it right  
Can heaven wait one night  
  
Thinking back on times that Ive wasted  
I should have cherished every day  
All the different flavors that I tasted  
Cant compare to you no way  
  
As I reminisce by your side  
Tears of guilt are streaming from my eyes  
All the things I did that werent right  
Wish I could apologize  
  
Id give anything if I could trade places with you  
So Im beggin heaven down on my knees  
To help you make it through  
  
Tell me can heaven wait  
Can heaven wait just one more night  
Tell me what its gonna take  
To keep you with me in my life  
  
Im gonna stop the world reverse the time  
Do whatever it takes to keep you alive  
Heaven has to wait one more day  
  
Baby take my breath so you can breathe  
I need you here so dont you leave  
Heaven has to wait  
  
Tell me can heaven wait  
Can heaven wait just one more night  
Tell me what its gonna take  
To keep you with me in my life  
  
Tell me can heaven wait  
Can heaven wait just one more night  
Tell me what its gonna take  
To keep you with me in my life
