Maybe no one told you there is strength in your tears  
And so you fight to keep from pouring out  
But what if you unlock the gate that keeps your secret soul  
Do you think that theres enough you might drown  
  
Chorus  
If no one will listen  
If you decide to speak  
If no one is left standing after the bombs explode  
If no one wants to look at you  
For what you really are  
I will be here still  
  
No one can take you where you alone must go  
Theres no telling what you will find there  
And God I know the fear that eats away at your bones  
Its screaming every step Just stay here  
  
Chorus  
  
If you find your fists are raw and red from beating yourself down  
If your legs have given out under the weight  
If you find youve been settling for a world of gray  
So you wouldnt have to face down your own hate  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I will be here still
