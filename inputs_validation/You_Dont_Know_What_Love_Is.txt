In some respects I suspect  
Youve got a respectable side  
When pushed and pulled and pressured  
You seldom run and hide  
But its for someone elses benefit  
Not for what you wanna do  
Until I realize that youve realized  
Im gonna say these words to you  
Yeah you dont know what love is  
You do as youre told  
Just as a child at ten might act  
But youre far too old  
Youre not hopeless or helpless  
And I hate to sound cold  
But you dont know what love is  
You just do as youre told  
I can see your man cant help but win  
Any problems that may arise  
But in his mind there can be no sin  
If you never criticize  
You just keep on repeating  
All those empty I love yous  
Until you say you deserve better  
Im gonna lay right into you  
Yeah you dont know what love is  
You just do as youre told  
Just as a child at ten might act  
But youre far too old  
youre not hopeless or helpless  
And I hate to sound cold  
But you dont know what love is  
No you dont know what love is  
No you dont know what love is  
You just do as youre told  
Yeah you do as youre told yeah
