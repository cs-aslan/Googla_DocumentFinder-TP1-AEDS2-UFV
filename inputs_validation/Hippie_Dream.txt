Take my advice  
Dont listen to me  
It aint paradise  
But it used to be  
There was a time  
When the river was wide  
And the water came running down  
To the rising tide  
But the wooden ships  
Were just a hippie dream  
Just a hippie dream  
  
Dont bat an eye  
Dont waste a word  
Dont mention nothin  
That could go unheard  
Cause the tiedye sails  
Are the screamin sheets  
And the dusty trail  
Leads to blood in the streets  
And the wooden ships  
Are a hippie dream  
Capsized in excess  
If you know what I mean  
  
Just because its over for you  
Dont mean its over for me  
Its a victory for the heart  
Every time the music starts  
So please dont kill the machine  
Dont kill the machine  
Dont kill the machine  
  
Another flower child goes to seed  
In an etherfilled room of meathooks  
Its so ugly  
So ugly
