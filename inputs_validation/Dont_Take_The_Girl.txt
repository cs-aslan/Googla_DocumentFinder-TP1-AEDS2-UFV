Johnnys daddy was taking him fishin  
When he was eight years old  
  
Little girl came through the front gate  
Holdin a fishin pole  
His dad looked down and smiled  
He said We cant leave her behind  
Son I know you dont want her to go  
But someday youll change your mind  
And Johnny said  
Take Jimmy Johnson  
Take Tommy Thompson  
Take my best friend Bo  
Take anybody that you want as  
Long as she dont go  
Take any boy in the world  
Daddy please dont take the girl  
  
Same old boy same sweet girl  
Ten years down the road  
He held her tight and kissed her lips in  
Front of the picture show  
Stranger came and pulled a gun  
Grabbed her by the arm said  
If you do what I tell you to  
There wont be any harm  
And Johnny said Take my money  
Take my wallet  
Take my credit cards  
Heres the watch that my Grandpa gave me  
Heres the key to my car  
Mister give it a whirl  
But please dont take the girl  
  
Same old boy  
Same sweet girl  
Five years down the road  
Theres gonna be a little one and she  
Says its time to go  
Doctor says the babys fine  
But youll have to leave  
Cause his mommas fading fast and  
Johnny hit his knees and there he prayed  
Take the very breath you gave me  
Take the heart from my chest  
Ill gladly take her place if youll let me  
Make this my last request  
Take me out of this world  
God please dont take the girl  
  
Johnnys daddy  
Was taking him fishin  
When he was eight years old
