Perhaps its the color of the sun cut flat  
And coverin the crossroads Im standing at  
Or maybe its the weather or something like that  
But mama you been on my mind  
  
I do not mean you trouble dont put me down dont get upset  
I am not pleadin or sayin I cant forget you  
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent but yet  
Mama you been on my mind  
  
Even tho my eyes are hazy  
And my thoughts they might be narrow  
Where you been dont bother me or bring me down with sorrow  
I dont even mind where you be wakin up tomorrow  
But mama you been on my mind  
  
Im not asking you to say words like yes or no  
Please understand me Ive no place Im calling you to go  
Im just whisperin to myself so I can pretend that I dont know  
Mama you been on my mind  
  
When you wake up in the mornin baby look inside your mirror  
You know I wont be next to you you know I wont be near  
Id just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear  
As someone who has had you on his mind  
As someone who has had you on his mind  
Mama you been on my mind
