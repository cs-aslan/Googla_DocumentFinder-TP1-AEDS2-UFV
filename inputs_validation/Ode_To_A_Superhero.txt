Peter Parker was pitiful  
Couldnt have been any shyer  
Mary Jane still wouldnt notice him  
Even if his hair was on fire  
  
But then one day he went to that science lab  
That mutated spider came down  
Oh and now Peter crawls over everyones walls  
And hes swingin all over town  
  
La li la li de da  
La la li le la da dumb  
  
Sling us a web youre the SpiderMan  
Sling us a web tonight  
Cause were all in the mood for a hero now  
And theres evil doers to fight  
  
Now Harry the rich kids a friend of his  
Who horns in on Mary Jane  
But to his great surprise it seems she prefers guys  
Who can kiss upside down in the rain  
  
With great power comes great responsibility  
Thats the catch phrase of old Uncle Ben  
If you missed it dont worry theyll say the line  
Again and again and again  
  
Oh la la la di de da  
La la di di da da dom  
  
Now Normans a billionare scientist  
Who never had time for his son  
But then something went screw and before you knew he  
Was trying to kill everyone  
  
And hes ridin around on that glider thing  
And hes throwin that weird pumpkin bomb  
Yes hes wearin that dumb Power Rangers mask  
But hes scarier without it on  
  
Sling us a web youre the SpiderMan  
Sling us a web tonight  
Cause youre brave and youre strong and so limber now  
But whered you come up with those tights  
  
Its a pretty sad day at the funeral  
Norman Osborn has bitten the dust  
And I heard Harrys said he wants SpiderMan dead  
Aw but his buddy Pete he can trust  
  
Oh and MJ is all hot for Peter now  
Aw but Peter he just shuts her down  
Mary Jane dont you cry you can give it a try  
Again when the sequal comes round  
  
Oh la la la di de da  
La la di di da da dumb  
  
Sling us a web youre the SpiderMan  
Sling us a web tonight  
Cause we all sure could use us a hero now  
And we think that youll do all right
