I thought love was only true in fairy tales  
Meant for someone else but not for me  
Love was out to get me  
Thats the way it seemed  
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams  
  
Then I saw her face now Im a believer  
Not a trace of doubt in my mind  
Im in love and Im a believer  
I couldnt leave her if I tried  
No not if I tried  
  
I thought love was more or less a giving thing  
Seems the more I gave the less I got  
Whats the use in tryin  
All you get is pain  
When I needed sunshine I got rain  
  
Then I saw her face now Im a believer  
Not a trace of doubt in my mind  
Im in love and Im a believer  
I couldnt leave her if I tried  
Not if I tried  
  
Love was out to get me  
Thats the way it seemed  
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams  
Whats the use of trying  
All you get is pain  
When I wanted sunshine I got rain  
  
Then I saw her face now Im a believer  
Not a trace of doubt in my mind  
Im in love and Im a believer  
I couldnt leave her if I tried  
No not if I tried  
Not if I tried no  
Cause Im a believer  
Yes Im a believer
