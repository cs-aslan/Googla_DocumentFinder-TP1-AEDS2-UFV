I am so in love with you  
I just cant deny it  
Everybody knows I cant deny it  
Everybody knows  
  
You can read me like a book  
Just like a fortune teller  
Everybody needs a fortune teller  
Telling you the very truth  
  
You bring me feelin  
You bring me fire  
You give me a love thats taking me higher  
It just goes to prove  
What one good woman can do  
  
You bring out the best in me  
With love and understanding  
Anytime I need some understanding  
You are always there  
  
And if I ever lose my way  
Youre always there to guide me  
Anyone can see youre here inside me  
Anyone can see it  
  
You bring me feelin  
You bring me fire  
You give me a love thats taking me higher  
It just goes to prove  
What one good woman can do  
  
You fill me with hope  
With love and devotion  
You taught me how to show my emotion  
It just goes to prove  
What one good woman can do  
  
This is our time we have it all  
We have a way of knowing if were heading for a fall  
Well work it out and get it right  
And when I get home to you  
Youre such a sight for my poor eyes  
  
This is our time we have it all  
When I come home at night  
Youre such a sight for my poor eyes  
  
You bring me feelin  
You bring me fire  
You give me a love thats taking me higher  
It just goes to prove  
What one good woman can do  
  
You fill me with hope  
With love and devotion  
You taught me how to show my emotion  
It just goes to prove  
What one good woman can do  
  
You bring me feelin  
You bring me fire  
You give me a love thats taking me higher  
It just goes to prove  
What one good woman can do  
  
You fill me with hope  
With love and devotion  
You taught me how to show my emotion  
It just goes to prove  
What one good woman can do
