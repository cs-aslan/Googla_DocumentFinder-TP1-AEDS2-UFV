Speeding motorcycle  
Wont you change me  
In a world of funny changes  
Speeding motorcycle  
Wont you change me  
  
Speeding motorcycle  
Of my heart  
Speeding motorcycle  
Always changing me  
Speeding motorcycle  
Dont you drive wrecklessly  
Speeding motorcycle  
Of my heart  
  
Many girls have taken you out for a ride  
Hurt you deep inside but you never slowed down  
  
Speeding motorcycle  
Of my heart  
Speeding motorcycle  
Lets be smart  
Because we dont want a wreck  
We can do a lot of tricks  
We dont have to break our legs  
To get our kicks  
Speeding motorcycle  
The road is ours  
Speeding motorcycle  
Lets speed some more  
  
Because we dont need reason  
And we dont need logic  
Because we got feelin  
And were damn proud of it  
  
Speeding motorcycle  
Theres nothing you can do  
Speeding motorcycle  
I love you  
Speeding motorcycle  
Lets just go  
Speeding motorcycle  
Lets go lets go lets go
