Am I asleep  
Or have I died  
wanting peace  
We fall in space  
wanting peace  
We cant look down  
Death may come  
something takes a hold of me  
Peace I have found  
something takes a hold of me  
I want to say my whole life  
Am I asleep  
We fall down  
We come to this place  
Falling through time  
Living a hollow life  
Always were taking  
Waiting for signs  
Hollow lives  
Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky  
Search in vane  
Asking why  
All alone  
Where is god  
Looking down  
We dont know Repeat x2  
We fall in space  
We cant look down  
Death may come  
Peace I have found
