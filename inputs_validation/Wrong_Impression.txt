Calling out calling out  
Have you ever wondered  
Why Im always alone when youre in my dreams  
Calling out calling out  
Have you ever wondered  
What we could have been if youd only let me in  
  
I want you but I want you to understand  
I need you I love you  
  
Didnt want to leave you with the wrong impression  
Didnt want to leave you with my last confession  
Yeah of love  
Wasnt tryin to pull you in the wrong direction  
All I want to do is try to make a connection yeah  
  
Fallng out fallin out  
Have you ever wondered if this was ever more  
Than a crazy idea  
Falling out falling out  
Have you ever wondered  
  
I want you but I want you to understand  
I need I love you  
  
Didnt want to leave you with the wrong impression  
Didnt want to leave you with my last confession

Wasnt tryin to pull you in the wrong direction  
All I want to do is try to make a connection yeah
