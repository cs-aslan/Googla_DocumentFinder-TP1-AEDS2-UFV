Here comes old Rosie shes looking mighty fine  
Here comes hot Nancy shes steppin right on time  
There go the street lights bringin on the night  
Well theyll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight  
All through the shadows they come and they go  
Only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below  
  
Here comes the rich man in his long black limousine  
Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green  
Here comes the lawyer banker and the cop  
One thing for certain it aint never gonna stop  
When it all gets too heavy  
Thats when they come and go  
Only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below  
  
It happens out in Vegas happens in Moline  
On the blue blood streets of Boston  
Up in Berkeley and out in Queens  
And it went on yesterday and its going on tonight  
Somewhere theres somebody aint treatin somebody right  
  
And hes looking out for Rosie and shes looking mighty fine  
And hes walking the streets for Nancy  
And hell find her everytime  
When the street light flicker bringing on the night  
Well theyll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight  
All through the midnight  
Watch em come and watch em go  
Only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below
