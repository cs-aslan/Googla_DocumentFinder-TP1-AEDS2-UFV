Dolly Parton  
Mothers hold on to your sons and you daughters  
Should Hollywood claim them youll hold then no more  
Cause theyll become claimed to the Hollywood potters  
And theres no escape once they walk through that door  
Hollywood Hollywood Dungeon of Drama  
Center of sorrow city of schemes  
Hollywood Hollywood Terrace of Trauma  
Palace of promises dealer in dreams  
Some they go hungry and some go insane  
Some go to the bottle and some to the vains  
Some become users and some become used  
And some even make it but most never do  
Hollywood Hollywood Dungeon of Drama  
Center of sorrow city of schemes  
Hollywood Hollywood Terrace of Trauma  
Palace of promises dealer in dreams  
You spin them around like a merrygoround  
You mold them and shape them and then throw them down  
All of your glitter and all of your gold  
Is that what you give in exchange for a soul  
Cause they sell their soles for the likes of you  
While you chew up and spit out what you cannot use  
Mothers hold on to your sons and you daughters  
Should Hollywood claim them youll hold then no more  
Cause theyll become claimed to the Hollywood potters  
And theres no escape once they walk through that door  
Hollywood Hollywood Dungeon of Drama  
Center of sorrow city of schemes  
Hollywood Hollywood Terrace of Trauma  
Palace of promises dealer in dreams
