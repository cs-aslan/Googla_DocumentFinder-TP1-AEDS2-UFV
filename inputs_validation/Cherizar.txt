Im gonna wait till the sun comes out and  
Im gonna wait till you come and shout it  
Cherizar  
Cherizar no matter where you are  
Cherizar youll always be my star  
Cherizar no matter what you are  
Cherizar Ill always be your darlin  
Im gonna wait till the sun comes out  
Im gonna wait till you come and shout it  
Were gonna kiss till the moon is drunk and  
Were gonna love till noon has sunk it  
Cherizar your heart is lonely  
Though your first love not for me  
Cherizar  
Cherizar  
Cherizar no matter where you are  
Cherizar
