Come along it is the break of day  
Surely now youll have some things to say  
Its not the time for telling tales on me  
  
So come along it wont be long  
Til we return happy  
Shut your eyes there are no lies  
In this world we call sleep  
Lets desert this day of hurt  
Tomorrow well be free  
  
Lets not fight Im tired cant we just sleep tonight  
Dont turn away its just theres nothing left here to say  
Turn around I know were lost but soon well be found  
  
Well its been rough but well be just fine  
Work it out yeah well survive  
You mustnt let a few bad times dictate  
  
So come along it wont be long  
Til we return happy  
Shut your eyes there are no lies  
In this world we call sleep  
Lets desert this day of work  
Tomorrow well be free  
  
Lets not fight Im tired cant we just sleep tonight  
Dont turn away its just theres nothing left here to say  
Turn around I know were lost but soon well be found
