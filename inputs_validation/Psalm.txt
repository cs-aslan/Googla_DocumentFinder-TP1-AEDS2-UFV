Try on your love  
Like a new dress  
The fit and the cut  
Your friends to impress  
Try on your smile  
Square on your face  
Showing affection  
Should be no disgrace  
Try out your God  
Hope He will send  
Kindness from strangers  
  
On whom you depend  
Try on His coat  
A mantle most fine  
Myriad colors  
His harmonythine  
Believe in me  
Once seemed a good line  
Now belief in Jesus  
Is faith more sublime  
Head in the clouds  
But I cant see the Lord  
Short of perfection  
Ill try to be good  
Ill stand at His gate  
Ill wait for His sign  
Then Ill walk in His garden  
  
When its my time  
Drink from His cup  
Hush now dont you cry  
His quiet waters  
Will never never run dry  
Nearing deaths vale  
Hes here by my side  
He leads me to paradise  
A mountain so high  
Dont be afraid  
Just treasure His word  
Singing His praises  
I know that Ill be heard  
Hes gonna take you by the hand  
Hes gonna make you feel so good  
Open up your eyes  
  
And then youll see all that you should  
Forget all your troubles  
You will feel no pain  
Hes all that you need  
Hes your everything  
When Im feeling all at sea  
Deliverance is that distant shore  
I will not be worried  
Someday His house will be my home  
For ever more
