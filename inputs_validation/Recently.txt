Used to be that I could see  
A reason to be happy cause I was free  
But then recently it seems  
Ive been lettin your memry get to me  
  
Used to be that I could pretend  
That I wasnt really hurt back then  
But then recently it seems  
Ive been lettin your memry get to me  
  
Cause memries can be friends  
Or they can take you to a place  
The you never thought youd be again  
And take you to a place  
That you never ever thought  
That you would see again  
  
Cause memries can be friends  
Or they can take you to a place  
The you never thought youd be again  
And take you to a place  
That you never ever thought  
That you would see again  
  
Doesnt matter now who was wrong  
The future is tomorrow cause the past is gone  
And Im findin that Im not as strong  
As I thought that I used to be  
Cause recently it seems  
Ive been lettin your memry get to me
