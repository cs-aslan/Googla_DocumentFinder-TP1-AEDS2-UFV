Chorus  
  
I dont want to be like old George Reeves  
Stuck in a Superman role  
Ive got a long way to go in my career  
And some day my fame will make it clear  
That I had to be a Superman  
  
Verse 1  
He came from another place deep in his mind  
As far as the planets in space  
As galaxys mysteries start to unwind  
Some changes are bound to take place  
  
Though gravity constantly weighs on my travels  
My mission is close to adrift  
Though I can be strong when my power unravels  
I still come to you for a lift  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2  
I know I can fly when my plane hits the sky  
I believe Ive got nothing to lose  
But when Im alone with the bed and the phone  
I get the terminal metropolis blues  
  
I flew to the coast where Supermans Ghost  
Lay shot on the bedroom floor  
He said Watch out for TV it crucified me  
But it cant crucify me no more  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
Im red white and blue Ive got justice to do  
Im the man of your fantasy dreams  
But Im an alien man from an alien land  
Whos alive on your orthicon screens  
I once ruled the world and when flags were unfurled  
  
I performed for you live not on tape  
But the public is cruel when played for a fool  
As you see by the blood on my cape  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 4  
  
Well I never was real or stronger than steel  
Im a figment of Freudian need  
And the video screen is a psychotic scene  
And its all done with mirrors and green  
  
My agent just called the talks have been stalled  
I soon will be pulled from the air  
But the image persists in the video mists  
That a Superman still will be there  
  
Chorus
