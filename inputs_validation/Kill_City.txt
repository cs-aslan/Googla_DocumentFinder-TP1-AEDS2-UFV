Well I live here in kill city where the d meets the sea  
I live here in kill city where the d meets the sea  
Its a playground to the rich but its a loaded gun to me  
Well Im sick of keeping quiet and I am the wild boy  
Im sick of keeping quiet and I am the wild boy  
But if I have to die here first Im gonna make some noise  
chorus  
give it up   turn before you  
give it up   turn before you  
give it up   turn before you  
give it up   turn before you  
Yeah the sea is fascination man and everythings for free  
The sea is fascination man and everythings for free  
Until you wind up in some bathroom overdosed and on your knees  
chorus  
give it up  turn before you  
give it up  turn before you  
give it up  turn before you  
give it up  turn before you  
give it up  turn before you  
give it up  turn before you
