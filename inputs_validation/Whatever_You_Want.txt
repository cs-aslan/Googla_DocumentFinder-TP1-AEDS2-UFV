Whatever you want me to do I will do it for you  
Whatever you want me to be I will be what you need  
Because its love that I feel whenever youre really near  
Im feeling sensual  
I cant rely on myself Im wanting you and no one else  
Youve got me wrapped up  
Cause times takes what love heals  
Wherever you are I know its for real  
  
Whatever you want me to do I will do it for you  
Whatever you want me to be I will be what you need  
Because its love that I feel whenever youre really near  
Im feeling sensual  
And I I know that its real  
  
I know youve had pains in your heart that have torn you apart  
I know youve been safe on your own but together were strong  
Because its love that I feel whenever youre holding me  
Im feeeling passionate  
And I cant deny it in myself Im wanting you and no one else  
Youve got the power  
Cause love takes what time steals  
And deeep in my heart I know that its real  
  
Whatever you want me to do I will do it for you  
Whatever you want me to be I will be what you need  
Because its love that I feel whenever youre next to me
