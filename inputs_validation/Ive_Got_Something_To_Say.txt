Ive got something to say boys  
Ive got something to say  
Just as soon as I can find a way boys  
Ive got something to say  
  
I was standing in a ally one dark lonely night  
There were three or four shotguns wanting to fight  
Now me and the devil we were seeing the light  
Looking for someplace to run  
  
And I said Ive got something to say boys  
Ive got something to say  
Just as soon as I can find a way boys  
Ive got something to say  
  
I caught with a couple of friends  
I was just slipping out they was just slipping in  
I was too hurt to laugh I was to sick to grin  
Watching the woman I love  
  
The cop at the gate swore I was insane  
Cause me and my pistol tried boarding a plane  
Now we were both loaded and its hard to explain  
How wed ever gotten that far  
  
I was the first one to get the last laugh  
When they said my son was to old for the draft  
Thats when the government gave me the shaft  
Drafted my daughter instead
