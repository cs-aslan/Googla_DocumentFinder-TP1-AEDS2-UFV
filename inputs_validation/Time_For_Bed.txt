What you wanna do girl  
Weve been on the phone  
Weve been sending texts  
When you coming through girl  
I dont wanna talk  
I just wanna see whats next  
Girl bring your behind to me  
I promise to give you what you need  
Tell me your fantasies  
And I guarantee that you wont ever wanna leave  
  
So listen you on your way  
Cause I know Im turning you on  
Name no play like foreplay  
At 3 oclock in the morn  
And it aint no way the neighbors aint gon hear all that moaning  
And that screaming  
Are you ready baby  
  
Girl I think its time for bed  
But I aint tryna go to sleep  
So just bring your body to me  
Cause its time for bed  
See Im gon give you what I need  
When were rolling our bodies to jeans  
Cause its time for bed  
Time for bed  
Girl its time for bed  
Time for bed  
Girl its time for bed  
Time for bed  
  
Justin Bieber  
And I know that I can turn you on  
Guess til forever til the early morning  
And I dont know if youre on the streets no more  
Im gonna swear that you be going back at me for more
