Well IttyBittyBetty got some rockin shoes  
Well shes gonna rock away all her blues  
Well shes agonna make it to the record hop  
And when she starts adancin man she aint gonna stop  
Well IttyBittyBetty she just loves to dance  
When she starts aswingin man you aint got a chance  
IttyBittyBetty loves the record hops  
Well your toes will be apoppin right through your socks  
Well now IttyBittyBetty just awatch her go  
And when you rock with Betty dont you rock too slow  
Shell rock you to the left and shell rock you to the right  
If you see bitty Betty you better duck out of sight
