Was it wonderful for you  
Was it holy as it was for me  
Did you feel the hand of destiny  
That was guiding us together  
You were young enough to dream  
I was old enough to learn something new  
Im so glad I got to dance with you  
For a moment of forever  
Sometimes when youre cryin youre happy  
Sometimes youre just cryin  
I know I know  
Come whatever happens now  
Aint it nice to know that dreams still come true  
Im so glad that I was close to you  
For a moment of forever
