Verse 1  
Look in the mirror  
Who do I see  
Who do I wanna be today  
If you came for a show  
Which role should I take  
Fading to grey  
So did we make a big mistake  
True colorsll show  
Baby just put me on display  
  
PreChorus  
Think Ive been here before  
Ive turned some hearts into stone  
And I cant hide it no more  
Chorus  
My love is a mood ring  
Up and down emotions  
All these mood swings  
You know how to read the touch of my skin  
Nothing on my body but this mood ring  
You change me ah  
Mood  
  
Verse 2  
I have no secrets  
Cause theres a version of me  
That I dont know how to hide  
When youre making me glow  
With your fingers against my thighs  
Glow  
  
PreChorus  
Think Ive been here before  
Ive turned some hearts into stone  
And I cant hide it no more

My love is a mood ring  
Up and down emotions  
All these mood swings  
You know how to read the touch of my skin  
Nothing on my body but this mood ring  
You change me ah  
Mood  
Nothing on my body but this mood ring this mood ring  
  
Bridge

My temperature is at your command  
By my demand and now Im falling for you  
I turn to golden from blue  
And you do too ah

And I cant hide it no more
