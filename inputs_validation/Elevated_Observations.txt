On top of a hill is a nice place to be at  
Diggin the country for miles around  
Watchin the people like ants on a hillside  
Running around running around  
  
So far below me I see the confusion  
Smallminded men with their smallminded wives  
If they could see themselves where I am standing  
Theyd alter their lives alter their lives  
  
And Im so high up I touch the sky  
And Im so high up I touch the sky  
Climb up here jump up here  
Skip up or run up  
Get up here somehow cause youll find your head  
Finally finding the level youre after  
Ego is dead ego is dead  
  
And Im so high up I touch the sky  
And Im so high up I touch the sky  
  
Wish theyd start using the path of tomorrow  
Theres only way up and one way down  
Decide for yourself on the path youll be taking  
When you look down down and around  
  
And Im so high up I touch the sky
