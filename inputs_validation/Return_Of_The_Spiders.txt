Well stop look and listen there are ants that are gathered here  
With my hands raised to speak but you all wont hear no you all wont hear we
all wont hear  
Let me in your living door let me in knock knock I said is there  
Well its me theyre reaching in and Im coming after you Im coming after you
coming after you  
Well Im tired yes Im weary from my long journey but Im not yet all ready to
rest  
For you can come along with me we go searching for rest yes  
Come on and search with me oh search with me woah search with me  
Come on and search with me wo woah come on and search with me aah
