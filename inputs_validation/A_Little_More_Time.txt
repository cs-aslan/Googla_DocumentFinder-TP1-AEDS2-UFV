Ive been runnin so fast I didnt see the world pass me by  
Just kept spinnin on without me  
  
Monday turned to Friday like a blur January was July  
And I dont know why  
  
Been poppin pills and seeing shrinks  
Tellin me all about my anxiety  
  
Chorus  
I just need some time to break away from this state mind  
I want to find a lighter side of me  
Always try to please everybody thinks Im so strong  
But sometimes I get weak  
They give me all their remedies  
When all I really need is a little more time for me  
  
Finally gonna open my eyes the possibilities surround me  
  
I want the love of my life all the things that money cant buy  
Peace of mind  
Life like this would be the sweetest dream  
But right know its not my reality  
  
I just need some time to break away from this state mind  
I want to find a lighter side of me  
Always try to please everybody thinks Im so strong  
But sometimes I get weak  
They give me all there remedies  
When all I really need is a little more time for me  
  
Time to breathe time to be me time to learn  
Time to fall time to save myself from it all  
  
Chorus
