Put a lid on it  
Whats that you say  
Put a lid on it  
Oh man no way  
Put a lid down on it and everything will be all right  
Put a lid on it  
Dont hand me that  
Put a lid on it  
Im all right Jack  
Put a lid down on it before somebody starts a fight  
  
Say every time I turn it loose you cats Come down and cook my goose  
When I start I just cant stop  
But if you keep this up youre gonna blow your top  
Put a lid on it  
Too late this time  
Put a lid on it  
Ive got to get whats mine  
Put a lid down on it and everything will be all right  
  
Well grab your drink and clear a space I think its time to torch  
This place  
Now the girls in overdrive  
But some of your pals want to stay alive  
Ill put a lid on it  
Ill put a lid down on it  
Save it for another night
