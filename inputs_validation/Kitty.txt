Oh Kitty My Darling remember  
That the doom will be mine if I stay  
Tis far better to part though its hard to  
Than to rot in their prison away  
Tis far better to part though its hard to  
Than to rot in their prison away  
  
So softly he kissed her pale lips  
Twas the same story over an oer  
Hush mavourneen the police are watching  
And you know that I must go ashore  
Hush mavourneen the police are watching  
And you know that I must go ashore  
  
In a day now Ill be over the mountain  
Therell be time enough left for to cry  
So good night and God guard you forever  
And write to me once you get by  
So good night and God guard you forever  
And write to me once you get by
