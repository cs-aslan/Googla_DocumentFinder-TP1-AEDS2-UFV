We Live and we die  
And we learn to find  
The things we live and die for  
  
I dont want to be an ordinary man  
No I dont want to be as neat as a new pin  
I dont care about just being safe and calm  
Give it up for little li li life  
Give it all up for little li li life  
  
I dont want to be a worker everyday  
No I dont want to be a boss that you obey  
I dont care about what people might just say  
Give it up for little li li life  
Give it all up for little li li life  
  
And the time that we have inside it keeps on ticking till the end  
So its time that we live our lives and celebrating  
  
Chorus  
I dont want to say I didnt take the chance  
I dont want to say I never learned the dance  
I want to be someone someone they show respect  
Give it all up for a little li li life  
Give it all up for a little li li life  
  
And the time that we have inside it keeps on ticking till the end  
So its time that we live our lives and celebrating  
  
Chorus  
  
Life is all to short to spend on doing boring things  
And I want and I want I want to have fun  
Holding on to be the one I am  
Holding on to be the one I am  
  
Chorus
