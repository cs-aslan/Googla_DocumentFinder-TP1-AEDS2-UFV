Dont lose your head  
Then lose your guy  
You cant lose a broken heart  
  
If you ever break up  
Then try to make up  
Its tough to make a brand new start  
  
Take a walk  
Think it over  
While strolling neath the moon  
Dont say things in December  
Youll regret in June  
  
Ware your remark  
Before you speak  
Or you may be sorry soon  
Dont be erratic  
Be diplomatic  
To keep your hearts in tune  
  
Cruel harsh words  
Often spoken  
Will upset your applecart  
So dont lose your head  
Then lose your guy  
Cause you cant lose a broken heart  
No you cant lose a broken heart
