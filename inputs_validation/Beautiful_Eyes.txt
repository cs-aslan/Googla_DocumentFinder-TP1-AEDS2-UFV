Your beautiful eyes  
Stare right into my eyes  
And sometimes I think of you late at night  
I dont know why  
I want to be somewhere where you are  
I wanna be where  
  
Chorus  
Youre here your eyes are looking into mine  
So baby make me fly  
My heart has never felt this way before  
Im looking through your  
Im looking through your eyes  
  
I wake up Im alive  
In only a little while I cry  
Cause youre my lullaby  
So baby hold me tight cause II  
I want to be everything you need  
I want to be where  
  
Chorus  
  
Just as long as youre mine  
Ill be youre everything tonight  
Let me love you kiss you  
Oh baby let me miss you  
Let me see your  
Dream about  
Dream about  
Dream about your eyes  
Eyes eyes beautiful eyes
