I was born under a bad sign left out in the cold  
Im a lonely man who knows just what it means to lose control  
But I took all the heartache and turned it to shame  
Now Im movin movin on and I aint taking the blame  
  
Chorus  
Dont come running to me I know Ive done all I can  
A hard loving woman like you just makes a hard loving man  
So I can say it to you babe Ill be a fool for your loving no more  
A fool for your loving no more  
Im so tired of trying I always end up crying  
A fool for your loving no more Ill be a fool for your loving no more  
  
Im tired of hiding my feelings you left me lonely too long  
I gave my heart and you tore it apart  
Oh baby you done me wrong  
  
Chorus
