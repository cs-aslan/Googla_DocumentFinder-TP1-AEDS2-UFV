You didnt listen when you went to school  
You dressed like a clown and you behaved like a fool  
But now your education is about to begin  
The difference between love and the mess that youre in  
You figured youre cool Ill bend all the rules  
Ill get them going red flags to a bull  
Its not like the movies no duel in the sun  
You need the answer to get your love done  
Now youre going back to school  
Now youre going to learn the rules  
Now youre going back youre going back  
Youre going back to school  
You know the business or so you believe  
You set all your sights but you aim to deceive  
You think youll hit the target every time that you fire  
You think you know the difference between love and desire  
But someones waiting to turn you around  
Shell shoot you down and put your feet on the ground  
Its not like dreamin you can make mistakes  
A lesson learned is not so easy to take  
Now youre going back to school  
Now youre going to learn the rules  
Now youre going back youre going back  
Youre going back to school  
Now youre going back to school  
Now youre going to learn the rules  
Now youre going back youre going back  
Youre going back to school  
Youre doin numbers but you dont keep the score  
Theyre scratchin the surface but they dont  
Reach the core  
You only bought the ticket cause the price was all in  
Youll never reach the heart until youve broken the skin  
Youre busy running but you never relax  
Live now pay later including the tax  
But now your education is about to begin  
Forget about the stories and the places youve been  
Now youre going back to school  
Now youre going to learn the rules  
Now youre going back youre going back  
Youre going back to school  
Back to school back to school
