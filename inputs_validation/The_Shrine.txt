The night is rising my eyes  
Even in the dark I know Im alive  
I am burning for you yeah you know its true  
Voices are calling in the night  
Breaking the changing sleep of night  
I see your face I cant deny it  
Darkness you are a holy shrine  
The night awake us tonight  
This is where we all meet The ones left behind  
I am burning for you yeah you know its true  
Voices are calling in the night  
Breaking the changing sleep of night  
I see your face I cant deny it  
Darkness you are a holy shrine  
Darkness you are a holy shrine  
The night awake us tonight This is where we all meet  
The ones left behind  
I am burning for you yeah you know its true  
Voices are calling in the night Breaking the changing sleep of night  
I see your face I cant deny it  
Darkness you are a holy shrine I am burning for you  
Darkness you are a holy shrine I am burning for you
