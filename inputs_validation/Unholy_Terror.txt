I was here when time began  
I was in them all  
A wicked one magicians hand  
Im what john had saw  
Im a thing that lives and breathers  
  
With slaves to worship me  
There are many that are born of me  
Anytime there are many mes  
Crowned messiah I crucified him  
  
And still ya dont believe  
I am kings  I am queens  
Unholy terrors me  
Im the feces of the species  
  
Still youre all in awe  
Im something a prophet saw  
Hister with a rise all fall  
Obsessed with lennon  
  
Manifested marx  
Im incest in the hearts of dark  
Im riding on some atomic bomb   
To blind you all into kingdomcome  
I am  I am  I am  I am
