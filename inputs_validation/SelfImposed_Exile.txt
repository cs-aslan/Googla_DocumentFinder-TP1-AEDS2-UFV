Free souls dont live in suburbia suburbia  
I was stranded stranded I must have been blind  
Self preservation the only way to attack attack attack attack attack  
Chinese numbers tattoed on my back  
  
We were victims of the present time  
Juvenile delinquents fallen angels  
Played the part without relief  
Broken hearts like leaves on the street  
Self preservation the only way to attack attack attack attack attack  
Chinese numbers tattoed on my back  
  
Well Im in selfimposed exile  
Im in selfimposed exile  
Im in selfimposed exile  
Im in selfimposed exile  
  
We were searching searching for a space  
Living for a moment just a moment  
Take what we wanted dont seem much  
Time for time to sit and watch  
Self preservation the only way to attack attack attack attack attack  
Chinese numbers tattoed on my back  
  
Well Im in selfimposed exile  
Im in selfimposed exile  
Im in selfimposed exile  
Im in selfimposed exile  
  
Free souls dont live in suburbia suburbia  
I was stranded stranded I must have been blind  
  
Im in selfimposed exile  
Im in selfimposed exile  
Im in selfimposed exile  
Im in selfimposed exile  
  
We were searching searching for a space  
Living for a moment just a moment  
We were searching searching for a space  
Living for a moment for a moment  
We were searching searching for a space  
Living for a moment just a moment  
We were searching searching for a space  
Living for a moment for a moment  
We were searching searching for a space  
Living for a moment just a moment  
We were searching searching for a space  
Living for a moment for a moment
