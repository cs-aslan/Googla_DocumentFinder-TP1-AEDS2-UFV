Gimme back my breath  
Gimme back my senses  
Gimme back my life  
All My Second chances  
  
If Im gonna give my all  
Never be without you  
Tell me will you catch my fall  
Cause Im about to  
  
Love is written on your face  
You believe in what you found  
Ill be lost in time and space  
Until I hear that sound  
  
I want to hear you say it  
Doesnt get any better than this  
If this aint really love  
Than tell me baby what it is  
  
Without you I cant breathe  
What do you promise me  
I want to hear you say it  
I want to hear you say it  
  
Gimme back my pride  
Take away my silence  
Gimme back my faith  
Show me where this road ends  
  
Take away my choice  
Deliver me forever  
You can free me with your voice  
Even if you whisper  
  
Love is written on your face  
You believe in what you found  
Ill be lost in time and space  
Until I hear that sound  
  
I want to hear you say it  
Doesnt get any better than this  
If this aint really love  
Than tell me baby what it is  
  
Without you I cant breathe  
What do you promise me  
I want to hear you say it  
I want to hear you say it  
  
Dont make me wait for it  
You know I ache for it  
Dont make me break down and walk away  
Your eyes have said to me  
  
Walk to the ledge with me  
Were on the edge baby  
Tell me what I need to know  
I want to hear you say it  
  
Doesnt get any better than this  
If this aint really love  
Than tell me baby what it is  
I want to hear you say it  
  
Doesnt get any better than this  
If this aint really love  
Than tell me baby what it is  
Without you I cant breathe  
  
What do you promise me  
I want to hear you say it  
I want to hear you say it  
I want to hear you say it  
  
Doesnt get any better than this  
If this aint really love  
Than tell me baby what it is  
Without you I cant breathe  
  
What do you promise me  
I want to hear you say it  
I want to hear you say it
