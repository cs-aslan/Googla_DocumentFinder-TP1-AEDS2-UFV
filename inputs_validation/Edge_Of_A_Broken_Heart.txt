I cant believe I couldve been so blind  
But love is strange  
I thought about it for a long long time  
But the truth remains  
I dont need another lonely night to dry my tears  
The answers plain as black and white  
And I can see the picture very clear  
  
Ive been livin on the edge of a broken heart  
I dont wanna fall I dont wanna crawl  
Ive been livin on the edge of a broken heart  
Dont you wonder why I gotta say goodbye  
  
It isnt like you never had the chance  
To change your tune  
Did you think that Im a dime a dance  
Well the dance is through  
Ive been doin things your way too long  
But baby thats over  
It wont be easy but Ive gotta be strong  
And if I wanna cry I dont need your shoulder  
  
Ive been livin on the edge of a broken heart  
I dont wanna fall I dont wanna crawl  
Ive been livin on the edge of a broken heart  
Dont you wonder why I gotta say goodbye  
  
Ill find someone else whos nothing like you  
Two can play the game as well  
And youre gonna be sorry baby  
When its over  
  
guitar interlude  
  
Ive been doin things your way too long  
But baby thats over  
It wont be easy but Ive gotta be strong  
And if I wanna cry I dont need your shoulder  
  
chorus out
