Like a mirage riding on the desert sand  
Like a vision floating with the desert winds  
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands  
Your are the keeper of the mystery in your hands  
  
Nomad rider of the ancient east  
Nomad rider that men know the least  
Nomad where you come from no one knows  
Nomad where you go to no one tells  
  
Undercover of the veil of your disguise  
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise  
No ones certain what you future will behold  
Youre a legend you own story will be told  
  
Nomad rider of the ancient east  
Nomad rider that men know the least  
Nomad where you come from no one knows  
Nomad where you go to no one tells  
  
No one dares to even look or glance your way  
Your reputation goes before you they all say  
Like a spirit that can disappear at will  
Many claim of things but no ones seen you kill  
  
Nomad youre the rider so mysterious  
Nomad youre the spirit that men fear in us  
Nomad youre the rider of the desert sands  
No mans ever understood your genius  
  
Those who see you in horizon desert sun  
Those who fear your reputation hide or run  
You send before you a mystique thats all your own  
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone  
  
Nomad youre the rider so mysterious  
Nomad youre the spirit that men fear in us  
Nomad youre the rider of the desert sands  
No man ever understood your genius  
  
Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue  
But no ones spoke to you and lived to tell the tale  
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men  
Others say that you have died and live again  
  
Nomad youre the rider so mysterious  
Nomad youre the spirit that men fear in us  
Nomad youre the rider of the desert sands  
No man ever understood your genius
