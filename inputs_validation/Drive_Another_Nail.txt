Sam was a carpenter fifty years  
He pounded out blood sweat and tears  
One day he hung his hammer up  
He wanted to do the things he loved  
What once was Sunday fishin  
Now was seven days a week  
He told his wife to find me  
Ill be down at the creek  
Cause I dont want to drive another nail  
Ive worked hard to do my job and I did it well  
Ive got the scars on these two hands  
That show I havent failed  
But I dont want to drive another nail  
Now she was a woman full of faith  
And old Sam was full of pride  
And she knew that he had one more job  
To do before he died  
Easter Sunday rolled around  
In a country church for the lost and found  
Oh Sam was there against his will  
As the preacher spoke on Calvarys Hill  
Of how they took the Master  
And they nailed Him to a tree  
And you could hear old Sam a cryin  
As he fell down on his knees  
I dont wanna drive another nail  
I want to live my life for You I want to do it well  
Youve got the scars on Your two hands  
That show where I have failed  
Lord I dont want to drive another nail  
I dont wanna drive another nail  
I want to live my life for You I want to do it well  
Youve got the scars on Your two hands  
That show where I have failed  
Lord I dont want to drive another nail
