All aboard the disco train hahaha  
All right now O yeah  
  
O you can tell by the way I move and  
walk im a womens man no time to talk  
Music loud and women warm  
Ive been kicked around since I was born  
  
Its all right Its okay  
you may look the other way  
We can try to understand  
the New York Times effect on man  
  
Whether youre a brother or whether youre a mother  
youre stayin alive stayin alive  
Feel the city breakin and everybody shakin  
and youre stayin alive stayin alive  
Ah ah ah ah stayin alive stayin alive

Every one one on the dance floor darling  
Where going to dance with the devil  
  
Well now I get low and I get high  
and if I cant get either I really try  
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes  
Im a dancin man and I just cant lose  
You know its all right its okay  
Ill live to see another day  
We can try to understand  
the New York Times effect on man  
  
Whether youre a brother or whether youre a mother  
youre stayin alive stayin alive  
Feel the city breakin and everybody shakin  
and youre stayin alive stayin alive  
Ah ah ah ah stayin alive stayin alive  
ah ah ah ah stayin alive  
  
Its all right Its okay  
you may look the other way  
We can try to understand  
the New York Times effect on man  
  
Its all right Its okay  
you may live to see another day  
We can try to understand  
the New York Times effect on man
