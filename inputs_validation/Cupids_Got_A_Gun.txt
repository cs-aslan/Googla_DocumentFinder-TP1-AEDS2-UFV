So many lonely people looking for a way  
To fill the empty nights when the phone wont ring  
We all want to fall in love hear the birds sing  
So if youre feeling desperate dont give up  
Times they are a changing and so is your luck  
  
Cupids got a gun  
Arrows wouldnt do  
Hes got the power love for you  
Its a big big love  
His aim is true  
Dont try to run  
Cupids got a gun  
  
Dont you just sit there feeling sorry for yourself  
Reading romance novels and laying around the house  
Dreaming that the good parts were written just for you  
Then waking up saying this will never come true  
Stop your hesitating go out tonight  
You know hes out there waiting  
To get you in his sights  
  
Cupids got a gun  
Arrows wouldnt do  
Hes got the power love for you  
Its a big big love  
His aim is true  
Dont try to run  
Cupids got a gun  
  
Its a real tough job helping people fall in love  
That old bow and arrow just wasnt strong enough  
Cupid wasnt stupid he knew just what to do  
Now hes loaded for love  
Hes coming for you
