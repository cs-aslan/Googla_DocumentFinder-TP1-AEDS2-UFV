I woke up this morning  
My baby was gone  
I woke up this morning Lord  
My baby was gone  
I thought that she loved me  
It seems that Im wrong  
Yes I am wrong  
  
I cried every night darling  
For you to come home yes I do  
I cried every night darling  
For you to come home  
Im feeling so lonely darling  
Im left all alone  
Yes Im left all alone  
  
I woke up this morning Lord  
The rain was falling down  
I woke up this morning Lord  
The rain was falling down  
Im getting so lonely darling  
Oh yeah baby I wish I could cry  
Oh yes the rain is falling on the ground
