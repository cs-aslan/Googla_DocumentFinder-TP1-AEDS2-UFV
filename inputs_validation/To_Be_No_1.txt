Give me a job  
The one I havnt got  
Dont write me off at anytime  
Dont ever leave me unsatisfied  
I dont want to come in a second  
I just want to come  
Dont want to be the last in line  
Dont want to be just left behind  
  
And in the evening when I come home  
It is time to throw my dog a bone  
Thats when I wear my shirt that says  
In capital letters In capital letters  
  
Isnt it fun fun fun to be number one  
Hes got no job got no blow got no Monica to go to  
Isnt it fun fun fun to be number one  
Hes a superstar wunderbar out of touch too much  
  
Dont tell me Im small  
An inch too short  
I might not be your size but Im sure great  
And definitely underpaid  
So give me a job  
The one I havent got  
Dont tell me Im too poor to join the club  
To hang out with the big shots  
  
And in the evening when I come home  
It is time to give my dog a bone  
Thats when I wear my shirt that says  
In capital letters In capital letters  
  
Isnt it fun fun fun to be number one  
Hes got no job got no blow got no Monica to go to  
Isnt it fun fun fun to be number one  
Hes a VIP wannabe all he ever wants is

Hes a VIP wannabe all he ever wants is
