Escaping nights without you with shadows on the wall  
My mind is running wild tryin hard not to fall  
You told me that you love me but say Im just a friend  
My heart is broken up into pieces  
Cause I know Ill never free my soul  
Its trapped between true love and being alone  
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told  
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor  
  
Why oh why tell me why not me  
Why oh why we were meant to be  
Baby I know I could be all you need  
Why oh why oh why  
  
Chorus  
I wanna love you  
If you only knew how much I love you  
So why not me  
  
The day after tomorrow Ill still be around  
To catch you when you fall and ever let you down  
You say that were forever our love will never end  
Ive tried to come up but its drowning me to know  
Youll never feel my soul  
  
Its trapped between true love and being alone  
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told  
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor  
  
Tell me baby  
  
Why oh why tell me why not me  
Why oh why we were meant to be  
Baby I know I could be all you need  
Why oh why oh why  
  
Chorus  
  
You wont ever know  
How far we can go  
You wont ever know  
How far we can go go  
  
Why oh why tell me why not me  
Why oh why we were meant to be  
Baby I know I could be all you need  
Why oh why oh why  
  
Why oh why tell me why not me  
Why oh why we were meant to be  
Baby I know I could be all you need  
Why oh why oh why  
  
Chorus  
  
why not me why not me
