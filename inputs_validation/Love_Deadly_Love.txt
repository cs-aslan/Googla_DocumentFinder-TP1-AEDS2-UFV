A greyhound bus weaves its way across town  
Im sitting here thinking  
Never thought I could be brought down  
And low yes Im sinking  
  
Bet on a wild one I got stitched  
Caught up in a fight  
I was dreaming dreaming oh I saw you last night  
I got a 4 by 8 on Rikers Yard  
8 to 15 Im doin hard  
For you and your lover  
  
Shot through the head  
Air conditioning lead  
The honeymoon was over  
With the telephone bill  
  
Yes youve been tumbled  
With your fingers in the till  
The Chelsea Hotel with a private line  
Now its payback time  
  
Sha la la la I cant let you go  
Its not over till its over no  
Sha la la la I cant set you free  
Oh no cant let go  
Cause I put you right above  
Love deadly love  
Love deadly love  
  
Through the shadows of my backyard  
Now brother Im leaving a calling card  
This mission tonight  
Feels so right Mr DOA  
Some they can take it and some lie down  
Some just wear that thorny crown  
Like a halo round the head  
Oh now youre better off dead  
  
Sha la la la I cant let you go  
Its not over till its over no  
Sha la la la I cant set you free  
Oh no cant let go  
Cause I put you right above  
Love deadly love  
Love deadly love  
  
Sha la la la I cant let you go  
Its not over till its over no  
Sha la la la I cant set you free  
Oh no cant let go  
Cause I put you right above  
Love deadly love  
Love deadly love  
  
Theres a visit and one phone call  
And sometimes a stroll  
If Im straight in five years  
Maybe remission or parole  
  
Bet on a wild one I got stitched  
Caught up in a fight  
I was dreaming dreaming oh I saw you last night  
I got a 4 by 8 on Rikers Yard  
8 to 15 Im doin hard  
For you and your lover  
  
Five card stud thats your game  
Ill cut stack and lose its all the same  
You could never say no never say no no no no  
Love deadly love love deadly love  
Love deadly love love deadly love  
Love deadly love love deadly love
