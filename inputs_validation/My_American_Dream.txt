Found on Heard  
  
I always thought that I wanted a long new shiny Cadillac  
That a real man wears five hundred dollar suits upon his back  
I always thought that I needed a big old house with a million dollar view  
But baby since we fell in love all I needed is you  
  
Waking up waking up to my American dream  
Shes a long haired blue eyed country girl  
Shes better than a fantasy  
Waking up waking up to my American dream  
And I would not trade the whole wide world  
For what she means to me  
  
Shes pretty as the moonlight on the gulf of Mexico  
And her heart is pure and true as any California gold  
I put her on a pedastel like Lady Liberty  
Know there is no finer girl from sea to shining sea  
  
Im waking up waking up to my American dream  
Shes a long haired blue eyed country girl  
Shes better than a fantasy  
Waking up waking up to my American dream  
And I would not trade the whole wide world  
For what she means to me  
  
Waking up waking up to my American dream  
Shes a real live blue eyed country girl  
The best thing Ive ever seen  
And I would not trade the whole wide world  
For what she means to me  
Im waking up waking up to my American dream  
Im waking up Im waking up to my American dream
