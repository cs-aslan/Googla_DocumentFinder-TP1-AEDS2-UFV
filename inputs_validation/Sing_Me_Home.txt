I fell by the wayside  
I fell on my knees  
Cryin why was I so hard to please  
I stood at the crossroads  
Took a long look at me  
Sometimes you dont know where  
Youre from til you leave  
  
Chorus  
And Ive been out there searching  
For a place where I belong  
And on my way I heard my song  
Let it sing me home  
  
The sun on my shoulders  
And the wind at my back  
Im bound and determined  
To get back on track  
  
To where the heart is  
Where its been all along  
Sometimes you dont know what youve  
Got til its gone  
Gone gone gone  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 3x  
  
Chorus
