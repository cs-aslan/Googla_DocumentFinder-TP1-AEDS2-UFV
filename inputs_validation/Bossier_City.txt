My hands are shaking as Im sadly learning  
The truth behind your innocent disguise  
You never thought I knew that you had been untrue  
But I once saw the devil somewhere in your eyes  
  
And now you got the nerve  
To ask me where Im going  
And I dont believe Id tell you if I knew  
Ill be gone when the sun comes up tomorrow  
I believe its time to say goodbye to you  
And it sure smells like snow in Bossier City  
But there aint no weather quite as cold as you  
Id sooner stand in mother natures anger  
Than to spend another lonely night with you  
  
Im talking but Im feeling  
Youre not listenin  
My words they just fall  
Heavy on the floor  
Yes its true that you knew  
I would not stay forever  
And you wont see me cryin  
When I walk out your door  
And now you got the nerve
