I came to you and never asked too much  
Wondering what you would say  
Hoping youd understand  
Its not a role I usually play  
Dont speak too much of whats been going on  
The past is over and gone  
Give me your troubled mind  
You know its due  
I can do so much for you  
  
I want you  
Having you near me holding you near me  
I want you to stay and never go away  
Its so right  
Having you near me holding you near me  
Ill love you tonight it feels so right  
Feels so right  
  
Youre brave to say that you get lost in love  
But you opened your heart to me  
Underneath all you feel you know  
How deep our love could be  
Tonight well touch until its time to go  
Then Im leaving it up to you  
Even a fool would know that Im not through  
I can do so much for you  
  
I want you  
Having you near me holding you near me  
I want you to stay and never go away  
Its so right  
Having you near me holding you near me  
Ill love you tonight it feels so right  
Feels so right
