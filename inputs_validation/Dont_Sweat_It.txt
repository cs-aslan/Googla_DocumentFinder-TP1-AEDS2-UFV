Id like to see you before I go  
Theres a few things Id like to do  
And when youre gone youll be gone for long  
And soon Ill be gone too  
  
But dont sweat it dont sweat it dont sweat it ooh  
Dont sweat it dont sweat it dont sweat it  
  
Are you happy with the color of your tea  
Could you use some sugar now  
Youre satisfied with your boy or your girl  
Your little butter cup  
  
But dont sweat it dont sweat it dont sweat it  
Dont sweat it dont sweat it dont sweat it  
  
Id like to see you before I go  
Theres a few things Id like to do  
And when youre gone youll be gone for long  
And soon Ill be gone too  
  
But dont sweat it dont sweat it dont sweat it  
Dont sweat it dont sweat it dont sweat it
