And so the story begins  
City dweller successful fella  
Thought to himself  
Oops Ive got a lot of money  
Im caught in a rat race terminally  
Im a professional cynic  
But my hearts not in it  
Im paying the price of living life at the limit  
Caught up in the centurys anxiety  
It preys on him hes getting thin  
  
Now he lives in a house a very big house in the country  
Watching afternoon repeats  
And the food he eats in the country  
He takes all manner of pills  
And piles up analyst bills in the country  
Its like an animal farm  
Lots of rural charm in the country  
  
Now hes got morning glory and lifes a different story  
Everything going Jackanory  
In touch with his own mortality  
Hes reading Balzac knocking back Prozac  
Its a helping hand  
That makes you feel wonderfully bland  
Oh its the centurys remedy for the faint at heart  
A new start  
  
He lives in a house a very big house in the country  
Hes got a fog in his chest  
So he needs a lot of rest in the country  
He doesnt drink smoke laugh  
He takes herbal baths in the country  
Oh its like an animal farm  
But youll come to no harm in the country  
  
Blow blow me out I am so sad I dont know why
