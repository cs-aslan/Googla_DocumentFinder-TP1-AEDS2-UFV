I lied just a little  
When I said I need you  
You stretched the truth  
When you said that you knew  
Just cant believe it  
Theres nothing to say  
I was almost honest almost  
Living alone cant stand this place  
Its four in the morning and I still see your face  
I was nearly pure  
When I said I loved you  
You were semisincere  
You said Id bleed for you  
We were kind of candid  
Now youve gone away  
You were almost honest almost  
Living alone falling from grace  
I want to atone but theres just empty space  
I cant face tomorrow now youre not coming back  
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks  
I question your call by the tone of your voice  
I know I should hang up but I dont have a choice  
It happened that night when you told me to go  
Dont ask whos to blame I dont know  
Almost almost honest  
Almost I was almost honest
