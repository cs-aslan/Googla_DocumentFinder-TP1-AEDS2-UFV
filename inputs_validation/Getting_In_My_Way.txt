I wish I could forget you but I wont  
I wish I loved another but I dont  
Its just the same day after day  
Your memory keeps getting in my way  
But Im hoping I will be alright  
But I dont even sleep at night  
I close my eyes I see your face  
Your memory keeps getting in my way  
I dont know why I cant forget you  
I dont see why I should let you  
Keep messing up my mind with all those thoughts of yesterday  
Your memory keeps getting in my way  
Its easy for someone to lie  
Im saying Ill forget you and Ill try  
Heres hoping that I will someday  
Your memory keeps getting in my way  
I dont know why I cant forget you  
I dont see why I should let you  
Keep messing up my mind with all those thoughts of yesterday  
Your memory keeps getting in my way
