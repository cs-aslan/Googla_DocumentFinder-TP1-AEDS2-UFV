Trouble chasing me again  
Breaking down my best defense  
Im looking  
God Im looking for your  
  
Weary just wont let me rest  
And fear is filling up my head  
Im longing  
God Im longing for you  
But I will  
  
Find you in the place Im in  
Find you when Im at my end  
Find you when theres  
Nothing left of me to offer you  
Except for brokenness  
  
You lift me up  
You never leave me thirsty  
When I am weak  
When Im lost and searching  
I find you on my knees  
  
So what if sorrow shakes my faith  
What if heartache still remains  
Ill trust you  
My god Ill trust you  
Cause you are faithful  
And I will  
  
When my hope is gone  
When the fear is strong  
When the pain is real  
When the its hard to heal  
  
When my faith is shaken  
And my heart is broken  
And my joy is stolen  
God I know that you lift me up  
You never leave me searching
