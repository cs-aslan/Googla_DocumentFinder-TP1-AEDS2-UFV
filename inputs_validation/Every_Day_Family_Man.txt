Youve heard songs about the bright lights of the city  
And songs about the heroes of our land  
But theres one guy around who never lets us down  
The every day family man  
He works hard to pay the mortgage and the taxes  
And theres lots of things that he dont understands  
While we spend millions on the moon when the world may blow out soon  
The every day family man  
You wont read it in the headlines of the papers  
The things he does with his two calloused hands  
But every night when he comes home hes a king of his Rome  
The every day family man  
 piano   
He wont be there when awards and all are given  
But hes close by when his neighbor needs a hand  
When he tells his kids goodnight the whole world for him is right  
The every day family man  
Yeah you wont read it in the headlines  
The every day family man
