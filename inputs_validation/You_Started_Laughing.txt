When youre in heaven  
What you gonna do  
Youre gonna sit around a cloud and say  
Hey what a lovely view  
Is there a reason why youre like you are  
Is there a reason youll be leaving  
Is my love out of season  
I wouldnt mind but to me that is Treason  
You started laughing  
When I held you in my arms  
You started leaving  
When I told you of my charms  
I was in love with you and then you said were through  
And then I said Boo hoo  
Was my tie not on straight  
Was it something I ate
