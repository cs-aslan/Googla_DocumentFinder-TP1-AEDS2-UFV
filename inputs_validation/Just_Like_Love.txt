See the color of roses  
Sail across America  
I couldnt wait to find you  
Im looking for a miracle  
And somewhere out of the blue  
In the heart of getting by  
CHORUS  
It only takes a second to learn  
It only takes a second to hurt  
And its just like love to be the hardest thing  
Its just like love to be everything Repeat  
An illusion of laughter  
Lost in a desert sky  
Thats how I feel without you  
I cant take another night  
Somewhere out of the blue  
From my heart and in your eyes  
CHORUS  
Oh I can feel it all  
Right or wrong Im here  
Here for you  
CHORUS Repeat to fade
