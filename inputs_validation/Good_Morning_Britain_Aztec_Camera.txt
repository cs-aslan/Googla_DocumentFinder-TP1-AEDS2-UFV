Jocks got a vote in Parochia  
Ten long years and hes still got her  
Paying tax and and doing stir  
Worry about it later  
And the wind blows hot and the wind blows cold  
But it blows us good so weve been told  
Musics food til the artbiz folds  
Let them all eat culture  
  
Chorus  
The past is steeped in shame  
But tomorrows fair game  
For a life thats fit for living  
Good morning Britain  
  
Twenty years and a loaded gun  
Funerals fear and the war aint won  
Paddys just a figure of fun  
It lightens up the danger  
And a corporal sneers at a catholic boy  
And he eyes his gun like a rich mans toy  
Hes killing more than celtic joy  
Death is not a stranger  
  
Taffys times gonna come one day  
Its a loud sweet voice and it wont give way  
A house is not a holiday  
Your sons are leaving home Neil  
In the hills and the valleys and far away  
You can hear the song of democracy  
The echo of eternity  
With a RakaRaka feel  
  
Chorus  
  
From the Tyne to where to the Thames does flow  
My English brothers and sisters know  
Its not a case of where you go  
Its race and creed and colour  
From the police cell to the deep dark grave  
On the undergrounds just a stop away  
Dont be too black dont be too gay  
Just get a little duller  
  
But in this green and pleasant land  
Where I make my home I make my stand  
Make it cool just to be a man  
A uniforms a traitor  
Love is international  
And if you stand or if you fall  
Just let them know you gave your all  
Worry about it later  
  
Chorus
