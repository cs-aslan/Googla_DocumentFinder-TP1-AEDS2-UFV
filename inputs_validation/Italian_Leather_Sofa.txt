She doesnt care whether or not hes an island  
  
She doesnt care just as long as his ships coming in  
  
She doesnt care whether or not hes an island  
  
They laugh they make money  
  
Hes got a gold watch  
  
Shes got a silk dress and healthy breasts  
  
that bounce on his Italian leather sofa  
  
She doesnt care whether or not hes a good man  
  
She doesnt care just as long as she still has her friends  
  
She doesnt care whether or not hes an island  
  
they laugh they make money  
  
Hes got a gold watch  
  
Shes got a silk dress and healthy breasts  
  
That bounce on his Italian leather sofa  
  
Shes got a serrated edge  
  
that she moves back and forth  
  
Its such a simple machine she doesnt have to use force  
  
When she gets what she wants  
  
she puts the rest on a tray in a ziplock bag  
  
REPEAT  
  
in the freezer  
  
She doesnt care whether or not hes an island  
  
She doesnt care just as long as his ships coming in  
  
She doesnt care whether or not hes an island  
  
They laugh they make money  
  
Hes got a gold watch  
  
Shes got a silk dress and healthy breasts  
  
that bounce on his Italian leather sofa
