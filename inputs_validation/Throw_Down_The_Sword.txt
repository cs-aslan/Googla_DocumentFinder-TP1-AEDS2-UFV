Throw down the sword  
The fight is done and over  
Neither lost neither won  
To cast away the fury of the battle  
And turn my weary eyes for home  
  
There were times when I stood at deaths own door  
Only hoping for an answer  
  
Throw down the sword  
And leave the glory  
A story time can never change  
To walk the road the load I have to carry  
A journeys end a wounded soul  
  
There were times when I stood at deaths own door  
Only searching for an answer
