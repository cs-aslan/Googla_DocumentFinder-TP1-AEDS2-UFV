He lays alone cries on his own  
For horizons that hell never reach  
And all of those dreams are washed on the beach  
Shes drowning in oceans of shackled emotions  
Going round and around in her head  
While out on the streets people forget  
That its love you want  
Love you want  
Love you want  
She speaks of hoping he speaks of fighting  
And tells her that they will come through  
Cause he wants to feel the shock of the new  
People that hurt you and they burn you  
With acid the falls that falls from the sky  
And out of the silence your voice says why  
If its love you want  
Love you want  
Love you want  
Its a matter of time a matter of time  
But youre asking why oh life makes you cry  
Turn moss into roses and blood into wine  
Its a matter of time a matter of time  
But all of your past still plays on your mind  
And maybe tomorrow youll live by design  
Its a matter of time  
This isnt giving this isnt living  
Ooh just days that pull you apart  
And tears turn to rust that fall on still hearts  
So swallow your maybes and cradle your babies  
Tell them that they will come through  
Their gonna feel the shock of the new  
And if its love you want  
Love you want  
Love you want  
Its a matter of time a matter of time  
But youre asking why oh life makes you cry  
Turn moss into roses and blood into wine  
Its a matter of time a matter of time  
But all of your past still plays on your mind  
And maybe tomorrow youll live by design  
Its a matter of time  
A matter of time a matter of time  
A matter of time a matter of time  
A matter of time a matter of time  
A matter of time a matter of time
