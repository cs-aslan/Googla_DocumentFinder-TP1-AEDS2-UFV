No no no  
Tesla girls Tesla girls  
Testing out theories  
Electric chairs and dynamos  
Dressed to kill theyre killing me  
But heaven knows their recipe  
  
No no no  
  
You wouldnt believe me if I said  
The things Ive seen went over my head  
Ive been patient heaven knows  
Ive learned the rules and how it goes  
I cant sit still or settle down  
And when I walk I dont touch the ground  
See those girls theyre heaven blessed  
I guess its so they know best  
  
Tesla girls Tesla girls  
Writing in their diaries  
Now and then theyll watch tv  
Now and then theyll speak to me  
But heaven knows their recipe  
  
No no no  
  
You wouldnt believe them if they said  
The things theyve seen went over their heads  
Theyve been patient heaven knows  
They seem to care and so it goes  
They cant sit still or settle down  
And when they walk they dont touch the ground  
See those girls theyre heaven blessed  
I guess its so they know best

Testing out theories  
Electric chairs and dynamos  
Dressed to kill theyre killing me

Now and then theyll watch tv  
Now and then theyll speak to me  
But heaven knows their recipe
