Oh the night is here  
Its hot tonight  
Look into the shadows oh dont you see  
Minute by minute theyre being born around me  
I need a little light  
In the darkness my eyes cant see  
And I got a feeling that someones watching me  
Its hot tonight  
Listen To the darkness can you hear it breathe  
I can feel it all around me  
I need a little light  
In the darkness my eyes cant see  
And I got a feeling that someones watching me  
Is anybody there Hiding in the shadows  
Is anybody there Hiding looking in from the dark  
Solo  Andy  
Help me Help me what is that I hear  
Help me There it is again Help me is anybody there  
Help me must be in my head Help me  
Cause there is only me in here and then my Magic cat  
Solo  Mike  
Is anybody there Hiding in the shadows  
Is anybody there Hiding looking in from the dark  
Is anybody there Is anybody here  
Its hot tonight  
Listen to the darkness can you hear it breathe  
I can feel it all around m  
I need a little light  
Solo Mike  
Is anybody here  Help me  Help me
