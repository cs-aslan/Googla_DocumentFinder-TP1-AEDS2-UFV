Warm me from the wind and take my haand  
A song is sounding softly singing  
My song is cast upon the rainbow waves  
Forever splashing in the sunlight  
Prove to me theres a love still left  
In all of this emptiness around me  
Take me from the chilling of the evening  
  
Though you know my love that I must go  
Afollowing the winds that blow inside me  
Ive nowhere left to run or hide  
Except if you will come and run beside me  
And even if you do therell be a lot for us to do  
To keep believing  
Take me from the chilling of the evening  
  
And now my time has come down many streets  
Im coming from a night decaying  
The song that itself sings is all alone  
I cannot even hear it playing  
Now to leave before I understand  
Just what it is Im leaving  
Take me from the chilling of the evening
