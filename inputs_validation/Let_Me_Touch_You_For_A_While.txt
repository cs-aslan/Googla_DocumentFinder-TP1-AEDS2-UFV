Its been a long time coming  
As you shed a lonesome tear  
And now youre in a wonderama  
I wonder what youre doing here  
The flame no longer flickers  
Youre feeling just like a fool  
You keep staring into your liquor  
Wondering what to do  
I dont hardly know you  
But Id be willing to show you  
I know a way to make you smile  
Let me touch you for a while  
Im gonna ruin my black mascara  
Youre drinking whisky when it should be wine  
You keep looking into that mirror  
But to me youre looking really fine  
I dont hardly know you  
But Id be willing to show you  
I know a way to make you  
Laugh at that cowgirl as shes walking out your door  
I know a way to make you smile  
Just let me whisper things youve never heard before  
Just let me touch you baby  
Just let me touch you for a while  
I dont hardly know you  
But Id be willing to show you  
I know a way to make you smile  
Its been a long time  
Let me touch you for a while
