Tonight at midnight you came by  
I Shook my head tried not to cry  
Halfway weeping halfway sleeping  
Tossing turning trembling burning  
  
Here it comes heartache  
You wore your hair down  
I love it that way  
You reached out and touched me  
  
And then you faded away  
Its unreal the way I feel  
Its almost dawn and you are gone  
Here it comes heartache  
  
Heartache of heartache  
Deeper than blue  
Teardrop on teardrop  
Im still in love with you  
  
What a way to start a day  
here it comes heartache over you  
Heartache for you  
Everytime you walk through my mind  
I get that old heartache
