It used to seem to me  
That my life ran on too fast  
And I had to take it slowly  
Just to make the good parts last  
But when youre born to run  
Its so hard to just slow down  
So dont be surprised to see me  
Back in that bright part of town  
  
Ill be back in the high life again  
All the doors I closed one time will open up again  
Ill be back in the high life again  
All the eyes that watched me once will smile and take me in  
And Ill drink and dance with one hand free  
Let the world back into me  
And on Ill be a sight to see  
Back in the high life again  
  
You used to be the best  
To make life be life to me  
And I hope that youre still out there  
And youre like you used to be  
Well have ourselves a time  
And well dance til the morning sun  
And well let the good times come in  
And we wont stop til were done  
  
Well be back in the high life again  
All the doors I closed one time will open up again  
Well be back in the high life again  
All the eyes that watched us once will smile and take us in  
And well drink and dance with one hand free  
And have the world so easily  
And oh well be a sight to see  
Back in the high life again  
  
Well be back in the high life again  
All the doors I closed one time will open up again  
Well be back in the high life again  
All the eyes that watched us once will smile and take us in  
And well drink and dance with one hand free  
And have the world so easily  
And oh well be a sight to see  
Back in the high life again
