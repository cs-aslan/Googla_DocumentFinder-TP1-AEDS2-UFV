I stand accused before you  
I have no tears to cry  
And you will never break me  
Till the day I die  
  
A criminal mind is all I  
All Ive ever had  
Ask one whos known me  
If Im really so bad  
I am  
  
Ive spent my life behind these steel bars  
Ive paid my dept in time  
But being brought to justice  
That was my only crime  
  
A criminal mind is all I  
All Ive ever had  
Ask one whos known me  
If Im really so bad  
I am  
  
Before you hand me over  
Before you read my sentence  
Id like to say a few words  
Here in my own defense  
  
Some people struggle daily  
They struggle with their conscience till the end  
I have no guilt to harm me  
I feel no wrong intent  
  
A criminal mind is all I  
All Ive ever known  
Dont try to reform me  
Cause Im made of cold stone  
  
My criminal mind is all I  
All I ever had  
Ask one whos known me  
If Im really so bad  
I am yeah  
  
Whoa oh I am  
Whoa oh I am  
Made of cold stone  
Im made of cold stone  
Just like the prison walls  
Im made of cold stone  
Got a criminal mind  
Whoa oh oh  
Whoa oh oh yeah  
A criminal mind  
I got a criminal mind  
Hey hey hey yeah  
  
A criminal  
Mind
