We can race over the mountains  
Sail over the spheres  
We can ride under the oceans  
But we cant fight our fear  
Somethings wrong with the world today  
Do you know what it is  
We believe to govern nature  
Find ways to lengthen our life  
And we go through digital stages  
Still the children cry  
Somethings wrong with the world today  
Do you know what it is  
The planet could be a better place  
If we spot the miss  
But I guess I would see a start  
I will sing it loud  
Wont you put your feet back on the ground  
We explore the existence of aliens  
Try to conquer the space  
We refine nuclear science  
Still to die in the haze  
Somethings wrong with the world today  
Do you know what it is  
The planet could be a better place  
If we spot the miss  
But I guess I would see a start  
I will sing it loud  
Wont you put your feet back on the ground  
Somethings wrong with the world today  
Do you know what it is  
The planet could be a better place  
If we spot the miss  
But I guess I would see a start  
Take without doubt  
Wont you put your feet back on the ground  
Wont you put your feet back on the ground
