Freeloader Freddy got a cold chevy nova  
Where he got the papersdont know  
Got a line on sweet act sheer heart attack  
Were sticking close to the floor  
  
Refrain  
How you feel all right now  
Im king of the road  
How you feel red lights fading  
King for an hour I need another  
  
Freeloader Freddy knows all the ladies  
Standing on the corner downtown  
Doing lines off the dash own private stash  
Oh the word is getting around  
  
Refrain  
  
Im taking my time making it mine  
Ive got some people to see  
And you want to play you got to pay  
Yesterday it used to be free  
  
Refrain  
  
Assorted Ad Libs  
Its all right come on babe  
Freeloader Freddy oh yeah  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
Some words are definately wrong
