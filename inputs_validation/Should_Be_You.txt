Dont you hate a coulda woulda shoulda oh oh no oh oh no  
Coulda did what it did why ya shoulda shoulda oh oh no oh oh no  
  
If I had a dollar for every should be know how reach I would be  
Like they say it is what it is not what it could be  
Cant cry feel guilt over spilled milk  
Im too fly Im too cool word to Versace silk  
And my watch be filled with mad diamonds  
I got good watches just bad timing Oh oh no  
The chick I met at the club was cute  
Still feel like Im getting brain from the substitute  
Cause this aint you and that aint me  
Claim you happy then why youre so mad at me  
Cant hold on to what you had just what you got  
You should be here but youre not  
  
Im doing it again  
What I told myself I would not do oh  
Its 415 AM Im sittin here drinkin reminiscing on you oh  
And how I used to let you smoke even though I dont  
You get blowed then we both get low  
As I lay here with some girl I dont know  
In the back of my mind one million times  
I tell myself  
  
It should be you should be you  
Should be you and me right now  
Said it should be you Should be you  
Should be you Should be you  
Should be you and me right now oh oh  
  
As I watch her sleep all that I can think  
Shes beautiful Beautiful but shes not you but shes not you  
Love her just a night then out of my life Out of my life  
Damn why cant I do this right  
When you told me you wanted to leave Wanted to leave  
I pretended it didnt hurt me didnt hurt me  
But as I lay here I can hardly breathe  
Laying next to she when in reality it should be  
  
It should be you should be you  
Should be you and me right now  
Said it should be you Should be you  
Should be you Should be you  
Should be you and me right now oh oh  
  
Uh uh should be you should be you baby ah  
  
Hey check this out  
My life lights camera fame and action  
Feeling dreams from all these private planes Im catchin  
Willing to trade all the flashy chains Im flashin for a night  
Back up for us exchangin pain and passion Lets go  
Romances kinda like the Phantom doors you used to ride  
Cause its tryin to open up its like suicide  
God teaches lessons every day  
You was all I needed like Meth and Mary J  
The sun dont shine forever  
Any time that we fall that just means we just climb together  
Guess we avoided what we couldve went through  
That dont change the fact Girl it should be you that it shouldve been you  
  
It should be you should be you  
Should be you and me right now Should be you and me girl  
Said it should be you should be you  
Should be you Should be you  
Should be you and me right now ah  
  
Oh said it should be you  
It should be you you whoa  
I said it should be you it should be you uh oh oh oh
