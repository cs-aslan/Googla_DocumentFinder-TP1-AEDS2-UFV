All my life is on me now hail the pages turning  
And the futures on the bound  
Hell dont know my fury  
Youre all I need youre all I need  
Youre all I needand maybe some faith would  
Do me good  
  
I dont know what Im doing dont know should I  
Change my mind I cant decide theres too many  
Variations to consider  
No thing I do dont do no thing but bring me  
More to do  
Its true I do imbue my blue unto myself  
I make it bitter  
Baby lay your head on my lap one more time  
Tell me you belong to me  
Baby say that its all gonna be alright  
I believe that it isnt
