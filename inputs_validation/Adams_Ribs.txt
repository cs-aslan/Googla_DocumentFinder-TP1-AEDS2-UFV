Dont look at my waist cause the pants dont fit right  
Im a dedicated follower of skin tight  
As long as we dont eat everything will be fine  
I just want to look fascinating snorting the diet pills Im grating  
  
As long as we throw up everything will be fine  
As long as were emasciated  
Tastes outdated yeah everything will be fine  
Everytime I eat is a slate away from every photo that I emulate  
  
As long as my fingers fit everything will be fine  
Cheeks like a valley and ribs like grater  
But just think of all that cash Im saving  
As long as we throw up everything will be fine  
  
As long as were emasciated  
Taste out dated yeah everything will be fine  
It will be fine It will be fine  
Make me grow up
