You can pack up your bags and go looking  
For all things that need to be done  
Or you can spend all your life not thinking  
Never ending what you begun  
  
You take a step in the right direction  
But the man knocks us down on the floor  
And although he may think we are broken  
Well get up and take two steps more  
  
Its your life to do what you want to  
By the way you push yourself out to the fore  
And whatever you think of the reason  
You bet your life youre here for more  
  
Its your life to do what you want to  
By the way you push yourself out to the fore  
And whatever you think of the reason  
You bet your life youre here for more  
  
You may think that youre pretty good people  
And you run at an even score  
But whatever you think you are here for  
You bet your life youre here for more
