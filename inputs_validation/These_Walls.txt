These walls too hard to climb  
And that ladder is too hard to find  
I dont want to be here anymore  
  
These roads too hard to walk  
With the things youve been saying  
I dont even want to talk  
I dont want to wind up on the floor  
I dont want to be here anymore  
  
Fair amount of disbelief  
These walls are killing me  
I dont want to be here anymore  
  
Speak your mind or speak your peace  
I swear were sinking deep  
I dont want to wind up on the floor  
I dont want to be here anymore  
  
The sky is falling all over again  
Just another disconclusion  
Another disillusion  
The sky is falling all over again  
Am I losing my composure  
Way too much exposure to compromise  
I cant take on these walls  
  
Youve been yelling up into the red  
But you havent heard a word Ive said  
I dont want to be here anymore  
  
Give it all Ive got can be bittersweet  
You think everyones beneath your feet  
I dont want to wind up on the floor  
I dont want to be here anymore  
  
The sky is falling all over again  
Just another disconclusion  
Another disillusion  
The sky is falling all over again  
Am I losing my composure  
Way too much exposure to compromise  
I cant take on these walls  
  
Theyre too hard to climb  
These walls  
I cant take on these walls  
I cant take on these walls
