One more depending on a prayer  
And we all look away  
People pretending everywhere  
Its just another day  
Theres bullets flying through the air  
And they still carry on  
We watch it happen over there  
And then just turn it off  
  
Chorus  
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah  
We must stand together  
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Theres no giving in  
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Hand in hand forever  
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Thats when we all win  
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Thats thats thats when we all win  
Thats thats thats when we all win  
  
They tell us every things alright  
And we just go along  
How can we fall asleep at night  
When somethings clearly wrong  
When we could feed a starving world  
With what we throw away  
But all we serve are empty words  
That always taste the same  
  
Chorus  
  
The right thing to guide us  
Is right here inside us  
No one can divide us  
When the light is leading on  
But just like a heartbeat  
The drumbeat carries on  
  
And the drumbeat carries on  
Just like a heartbeat  
  
Chorus
