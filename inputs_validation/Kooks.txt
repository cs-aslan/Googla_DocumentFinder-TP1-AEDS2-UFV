CHORUS x2  
Will you stay in our lovers story  
If you stay you wont be sorry  
Cause we believe in you  
Soon youll grow so take a chance  
With a couple of Kooks  
Hung up on romancing  
  
We bought a lot of things  
To keep you warm and dry  
And a funny old crib on which the paint wont dry  
I bought you a pair of shoes  
A trumpet you can blow  
And a book of rules  
On what to say to people  
When they pick on you  
Cause if you stay with us youre gonna be pretty Kookie too  
  
CHORUS  
  
And if you ever have to go to school  
Remember how they messed up  
This old fool  
Dont pick fights with the bullies  
Or the cads  
Cause Im not much cop at punching other peoples Dads  
And if the homework brings you down  
Then well throw it on the fire  
And take the car downtown  
  
CHORUS repeat ad inf
