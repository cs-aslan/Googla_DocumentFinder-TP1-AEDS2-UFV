Baby my baby you accuse me of flirting and hurting you no end  
You say baby Im a cheater  
You oughta know that cheaters never win  
Because it takes one to know one who will hurt you  
It takes one to know one wholl make you blue  
It takes one to know one like I know you  
Youre my kind hold my hand use your mind understand  
  
Baby my baby dont blame me for playing and saying things unkind  
You think baby Im a loser  
But I could win if you were close behind me  
Because it takes one to know one who will love you  
It takes one to know one who will cry for you  
It takes one to know one like I know you  
Youre my kind hold my hand use your mind understand  
  
Baby baby were birds of a feather baby baby well live together  
Baby Im yours you are mine  
And it takes one to know one it takes one to know one  
Yes it takes one to know one every time
