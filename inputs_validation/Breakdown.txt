Wasnt it long ago  
Wasnt it on a New England coast  
Wasnt it the standard  people praying to  
The Son and the Father and the Holy Ghost  
One nation over God  
Is that what weve now become  
The founding fathers left a noble legacy  
To their sons and daughters  
To their sons and daughters  
Look at what weve done  
Look at what weve done  
  
Chorus  
Breakdown breakdown breakdown  
As we learn to bite the hand  
That tries to feed us  
Breakdown breakdown breakdown  
If we say that we are free  
Who will believe us  
If we breakdown breakdown breakdown  
Breakdown break  
  
See the powder on the glass  
See the pillow on the street  
See the charter of a modern love  
With no obligationsor promises to meet  
  
Hear the fear of disease  
Hear the baby never born  
Hear a people crying out  
Somebody save us  oh please somebody save us  
From what were headed for  from what were headed for  
  
Chorus  
  
Breakdown breakdown breakdown  
As we learn to bite the hand  
That tries to feed us  
Breakdown breakdown breakdown  
  
Chorus
