Well this aint no Sunday drive  
Got the tach red lined throttle opened wide  
Gentlemen start the engines  
  
You got an all new diagnostic tuned  
Polished shined lookin like new  
This car will blow your mind  
And your door right off  
  
Rotated tires balanced aligned  
Highest octane money can buy  
She looks like shes flyin  
When shes sittin at a stop  
Your grocery gettin garbage  
Is nothing next to mine  
  
This aint no Sunday drive  
Got the tach red lined throttle opened wide  
Gonna kill a lot of bugs pass a lot of poles  
Burn a little rubber down a blacktop road  
Better be able to bury that needle your pink slips on the line  
This aint no Sunday drive no they aint  
  
On your mark set and ready fly  
Be waitin at the finish  
Hand your keys to my baby  
And dont ask for a ride  
This aint no Sunday drive no it aint son  
  
Well this aint no Sunday drive  
Got the tach red lined throttle opened wide  
Gonna kill a lot of bugs pass a lot of poles  
Burn a little rubber down a blacktop road  
Better be able to bury that needle your pink slips on the line  
This aint no Sunday drive this aint no Sunday drive  
  
Overdrive overdrive overdrive overdrive  
This aint no Sunday drive
