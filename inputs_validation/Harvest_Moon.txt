Come a little bit closer  
Hear what I have to say  
Just like children sleepin  
We could dream this night away  
  
But theres a full moon risin  
Lets go dancin in the light  
We know where the musics playin  
Lets go out and feel the night  
  
Because Im still in love with you  
I want to see you dance again  
Because Im still in love with you  
On this harvest moon  
  
When we were strangers  
I watched you from afar  
When we were lovers  
I loved you with all my heart  
  
But now its gettin late  
And the moon is climbin high  
I want to celebrate  
See it shinin in your eye  
  
Because Im still in love with you  
I want to see you dance again  
Because Im still in love with you  
On this harvest moon
