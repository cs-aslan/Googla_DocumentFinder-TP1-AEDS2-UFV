Orange Blossom Special  
The Wabash Cannonball  
The Chattanooga ChooChoo  
This hobos seen em all  
Ive watched the Sante Fe  
Lay her smoke against the sky  
And listen to old number three rollin  
Through the night  
Ride the train ride the train  
Anywhere Im going I ride trains  
Sleepin in a boxcar when it rains  
Ride the train ride the train  
Southern Pacific  
The Overland Express  
And up ahead the coal cars of West  
Virginias best  
And Oklahomas Frisco  
The biggest one of all  
Ive listened to the Silver Steeds  
Lonesome midnight call  
Ride the train ride the train  
Anywhere Im going I ride trains  
Sleepin in a boxcar when it rains  
Ride the train ride the train  
Ride the train  
Trains
