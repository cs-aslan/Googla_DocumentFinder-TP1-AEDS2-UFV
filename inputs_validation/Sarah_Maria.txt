Well the moon is in the ocean  
And the stars are in the sky  
And all that I can see  
Is my sweet Marias eyes  
Sarah Sarah Maria  
Sarah Maria ya ya ya ya  
  
Well you know about the sugar cane  
That comes from way down South  
Shes got one end in her hand  
Shes got one end in her mouth  
Come on Sarah Sarah Maria  
Sarah Maria ya ya ya ya  
  
She took me out walking  
To the corner of the world  
Where everyone was atalking  
About such a pretty little girl  
Come on Sarah Sarah Maria  
Sarah Maria ya ya ya ya  
  
Well the moon is in the ocean  
And the stars are in the sky  
And all that I can see  
Is my sweet Marias eyes  
Sarah Sarah Maria  
Sarah Maria ya ya ya ya  
Sarah Sarah Maria  
Sarah Maria ya ya ya ya
