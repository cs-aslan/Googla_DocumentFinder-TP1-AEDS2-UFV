Little baby on my shoulder  
I could fall into your dreams  
Wrap myself up all around you  
Till you dont know what it means  
  
Dont lie shrugging your shoulders now like I shouldnt stare  
Dont sigh so deep  
Are you the kind of man that I hoped you would or wouldnt be  
  
Maybe babys gone to sleep  
Maybe babys gone to sleep  
  
Pull myself a little closer  
I could feel your body breath  
Hear the pulsing of my heartbeat  
Rhyming rhythms endlessly  
  
If I could catch three wishes from a falling star  
One I would keep  
And two I would put on your pillow with a lullaby  
Maybe babys gone to sleep  
Maybe babys gone  
  
Hold on to a thought at the end of the day  
Someday well be watching the clouds as theyre drifting away  
And you might think about leaving but Ill always stay  
  
Little baby on my shoulder  
I could fall into your dreams  
Wrap yourself up all around me  
Till you dont know what it means  
I could fall into your dreams  
I could fall into your dreams  
Maybe babys gone to sleep
