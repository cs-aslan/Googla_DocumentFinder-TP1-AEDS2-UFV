Shes a quicksilver girl  
A lover of the world  
She spreads her wings  
And shes free  
Shes a quicksilver girl  
A lover of the world  
Shes seen every branch  
On the tree  
Ah ah quicksilver girl  
Ah ah quicksilver girl  
Ah ah quicksilver girl  
Ah ah quicksilver girl  
Ahhhh ahhhh ahhhh ahhhh  
If you need a little lovin  
Shell turn on the heat  
If you take a fall  
Shell put you back on your feet  
If youre all alone  
Shes someone to meet  
If you need someone  
Shes a quicksilver girl  
A lover of the world  
She spreads her wings  
And shes free
