I walk into the kitchen  
The silverware is gone  
The furniture is missing  
I guess you got it all uhuh  
This is where it ought to hurt  
Seems like every time you leave me  
You try to think of something worse  
  
Chorus  
I cant even get the blues no more  
I try to worry like I did before  
And nothing happens when I walk the floor  
So what am I supposed to do  
I toss and turn but then I fall asleep  
Im going under but its not too deep  
You want to hurt me but its just no use  
I cant even get the blues  
  
Well this time aint no different  
The suns up in the sky  
Sitting on the back porch  
Clouds are rolling by  
Oh this is where it ought to rain  
But it doesnt really matter  
To me its all about the same  
  
Repeat Chorus  
You try and hurt me  
  
Repeat Chorus
