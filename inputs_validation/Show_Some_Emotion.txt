Wait youve gone too far  
Who for Gods sake who for Gods sake  
Who is it you think you are  
You know you should should shoulda known better  
Than take a chance  
If you cant feel the rhythm  
If you cant feel the rhythm dont dance  
  
You cant run  
You cant hide  
On the wings of a dove  
Or behind your vicious pride you better come through it  
  
Hey  
You gotta silver tongue  
You use it and you use it  
And youll get us all hung  
You know you should should shoulda known better  
Than take a chance  
Cause if you cant feel the rhythm  
If you cant feel the rhythm dont dance  
  
You cant run  
You cant hide  
On the wings of a dove  
Or behind your vicious pride you better come through it  
  
Show me show me some emotion  
Show me show me some emotion
