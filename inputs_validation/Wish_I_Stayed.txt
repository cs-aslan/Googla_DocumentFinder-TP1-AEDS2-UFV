Why cant we speak another language  
One we all agree on  
When men look outside they see houses  
Instead of the fields they grew from  
We are constantly uprooted from them  
Making us tiresome and fearful  
Can you get up right now  
Endeavor to free fall  
  
You can fall if you want to  
Its just a matter of how far  
Youve treasured our hometown  
But youve forgotten where you are  
And it will stay with you until your minds been found  
And it has been found wondering around  
  
With that skipping rope the trampoline  
The crafty smoke that made us choke  
But we didnt give up hope  
Its just the simple ways of getting paid  
The carelessness of running away  
I wish I stayed  
I wish I stayed  
  
Patterns all arranged in my background  
Pillars and posts keeping this country on form  
Letters were all sent  
With no addresses so that people cant discover  
That were always under cover  
Why do I always draw triangles  
Instead of words this paper deserves  
  
I dont own my clothes but I own my mind  
And its not what youve lost but its what you find  
I dont own my clothes but I own my mind  
And its not what youve lost but its what you find  
  
With that skipping rope the trampoline  
The crafty smoke that made us choke  
But we didnt give up hope  
Its just the simple ways of getting paid  
The carelessness of running away  
I wish I stayed  
I wish I stayed  
  
You can fall if you want to  
Its just a matter of how far  
Youve treasured our hometown  
But youve forgotten where you are  
And it will stay with you until your minds been found  
And it has been found wondering around  
  
With that skipping rope the trampoline  
The crafty smoke that made us choke  
But we didnt give up hope  
Its just the simple ways of getting paid  
The carelessness of running away  
I wish I stayed  
I wish I stayed
