My body is a cage that keeps me  
From dancing with the one I love  
But my mind holds the key  
  
My body is a cage that keeps me  
From dancing with the one I love  
But my mind holds the key  
  
Im standing on a stage  
Of fear and selfdoubt  
Its a hollow play  
But theyll clap anyway  
  
My body is a cage that keeps me  
From dancing with the one I love  
But my mind holds the key  
  
Youre standing next to me  
My mind holds the key  
  
Im living in an age  
That calls darkness light  
Though my language is dead  
Still the shapes fill my head  
  
Im living in an age  
Whose name I dont know  
Though the fear keeps me moving  
Still my heart beats so slow  
  
My body is a cage that keeps me  
From dancing with the one I love  
But my mind holds the key  
  
Youre standing next to me  
My mind holds the key  
My body is a  
  
My body is a cage  
We take what were given  
Just because youve forgotten  
That dont mean youre forgiven  
  
Im living in an age  
That screams my name at night  
But when I get to the doorway  
Theres no one in sight  
  
My body is a cage that keeps me  
From dancing with the one I love  
But my mind holds the key  
  
Youre standing next to me  
My mind holds the key  
  
Set my spirit free  
Set my spirit free  
Set my body free
