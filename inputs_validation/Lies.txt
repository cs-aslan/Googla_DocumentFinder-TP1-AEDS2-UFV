lies lies  
youre telling me that youll be true  
  
lies lies  
thats all I ever get from you  
  
tears tears  
I shed a million tears for you  
  
tears tears  
and now youre loving someone new  
  
someday youre gonna be happy  
but I dont know when just now  
  
lies  
lies  breaking my heart  
  
you think that youre such a smart girl  
and Ill believe what you say  
but who do you think you are girl  
to lead me on this way  
  
lies lies  
I cant believe a word you say  
  
lies lies  
Im gonna make you sad someday  
  
someday youre gonna be lonely  
but you wont find me around  
  
lies  
lies  breaking my heart  
  
yeah  
  
someday youre gonna be lonely  
but you wont find me around  
  
lies  
lies  breaking my heart  
  
you think that youre such a smart girl  
and Ill believe what you say  
but who do you think you are girl  
to lead me on this way  
  
lies lies  
I cant believe a word you say  
  
lies lies  
Im gonna make you sad someday  
  
someday youre gonna be lonely  
but you wont find me around  
  
lies  
lies  breaking my heart  
  
breaking my heart  
breaking my heart  
breaking my heart  
breaking my heart  
breaking my heart
