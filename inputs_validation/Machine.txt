Rising above  
Tension below  
Learn from the inbetween  
  
Blinded by trust  
Asleep to the truth  
Awakened by disbelief  
  
But somewhere Ive found  
Strength in my soul  
But still you refuse to see  
  
Are you sure Im not all right  
Cause lately Ive been feeling fine  
  
Every lifeline leads its own way to the heavens  
But I have seen you run in circles unforgiven  
Is there anything in this world that can make you stop  
Oh youre a machine  
  
A world of your own  
Hollow inside  
Careful when worlds collide  
  
Im filling my life  
With all it can hold  
Ill carry it on with pride  
  
Are you sure Im not all right  
Cause lately Ive been feeling fine  
  
Every lifeline leads its own way to the heavens  
But I have seen you run in circles unforgiven  
Is there anything in this world that can make you stop  
Oh youre a machine  
  
The suns still above  
All the rain thats coming down  
And I can fell the clouds drifting away  
Now the sky is open wide  
  
Turn the light on  
And you will see things so much clearer  
Theres no heart theres no heart  
And Ive spent all this time feeling  
Something you cant feel at all  
Youre a machine  
Oh youre a machine
