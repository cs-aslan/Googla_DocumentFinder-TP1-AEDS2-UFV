You gotta help me out  
Its all a blur last night  
We need a taxi cause youre hungover and Im broke  
I lost my fake id but you lost the motel key  
Spare me your freakin dirty looks  
Now dont blame me  
You roll the cash out  
And get the hell out of town  
  
Chorus  
Dont be a baby  
Remember what you told me  
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is  
Thats what you get for waking up in Vegas  
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now  
Thats what you get for waking up in Vegas  
  
Why are these lights so bright  
Oh did we get hitched last night dressed up like Elvis  
Why am I wearing your class ring  
Dont call your mother  
Cause now were partners in crime  
  
Chorus  
  
You got me into this  
Information overload situation lost control  
Send out an SOS  
And get some cash out  
Were gonna tear up the town  
  
Dont be a baby  
Remember what you told me  
Remember what you told me  
Remember what you told me  
Told me you told me you told me  
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is  
Thats what you get for waking up in Vegas  
  
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now  
Thats what you get for waking up in Vegas  
Thats what you get baby shake the glitter shake shake shake the glitter  
Give me some cash out baby  
Give me some cash out baby
