Only the Lord knows the answer  
To the mess this world is in  
At the end of the rainbow  
Were scared to death once again  
  
Lifes getting shorter every hour  
It keeps on feeding in my face  
Why cant we stop the evil power  
That will kill the human race  
  
Right baby dont cry  
Keep on dancing tonight  
On the edge of time  
  
Right baby dont cry  
Keep on dancing tonight  
On the edge of time  
  
Only the Lord knows the answer  
To the mess this world is in  
This place has turned into Atlantis  
And its already started to sink  
  
Life in the fast lane  
Has turned into a dead end street  
Lets turn the wheel back to the future  
Lets use the power of our dreams  
  
Right baby dont cry  
Keep on dancing tonight  
On the edge of time  
  
Right baby dont cry  
Keep on dancing tonight  
On the edge of time  
  
Right baby dont cry  
Keep on dancing tonight  
On the edge of time  
  
Right baby dont cry  
Keep on dancing tonight  
On the edge of time
