Couple of guys sittin around drinkin  
Down at the Starlight Bar  
One of em says You know Ive been thinking  
Other one says That wont get you too far  
  
He says This is your life and welcome to it  
Its just workin and drinkin and dreams  
Ad on TV says Just Do It  
Hell if I know what that means  
  
The secret of life is a good cup of coffee  
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball  
The secret of life is a beautiful woman  
And Marilyn stares down from the barroom wall  
  
You and me were just a couple of zeros  
Just a couple of downandouts  
But movie stars and football heroes  
What have they got to be unhappy about  
  
So they turn to the bartender Sam what do you think  
Whats the key that unlocks that door  
Sam dont say nothin just wipes off the bar  
And he pours them a couple more  
  
Cause the secret of life is in Sams martinis  
The secret of life is in Marilyns eyes  
The secret of life is in Monday Night Football  
Rolling Stones records and Moms apple pie  
  
Sam looks up from his Sunday paper  
Says Boys youre on the wrong track  
The secret of life is there aint no secret  
And you dont get your money back  
Hey  
  
The secret of life is gettin up early  
The secret of life is stayin up late  
The secret of life is try not to hurry  
But dont wait  
Dont wait  
  
The secret of life is a good cup of coffee  
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball  
The secret of life is to find the right woman  
The secret of life is nothin at all  
Oh its nothin at all  
The secret of life
