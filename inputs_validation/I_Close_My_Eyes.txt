Look at me Im riding high  
Dont know whats wrong with me  
Cant you see Im not the guy  
That I pretend to be  
Though I know I will be lonely  
But our love will never die  
I close my eyes everyday I close my eyes  
  
The more I try the more I fail  
Id like to run away  
But if I try you pass me by  
I know that I cant stay  
Though I know I will be lonely  
But our love will never die  
I close my eyes everyday I close my eyes  
  
Though I know I will be lonely  
But our love will never die  
I close my eyes everyday I close my eyes  
I close my eyes Repeat x3
