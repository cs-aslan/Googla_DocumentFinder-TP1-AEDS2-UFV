Dora in the middle of the night  
Will you wait for me  
Till the morning sun shine bright  
For its all a dream  
And its only make believe  
  
Dora oh it hurts to hear you say  
Youre all alone  
And the pain wont go away  
But its all a dream  
And its only make believe  
  
Listening through the hours of the day  
Waiting for the night to end  
Thinking though its not for me to say  
When will I see you again  
When will I see you again  
  
Forget the lies they whisper in your ear  
And every superstitious word you hear  
Dora though the truth is hard to face  
And the fantasy  
Is not easy to replace  
Its all a dream  
And its only make believe  
  
Oh I keep thinking  
Of the words I shouldnt say  
When will I see you again  
When will I see you again  
  
And every doubt they whisper in your ear  
And all the halfforgotten past you fear  
One day will fade away and disappear  
  
Dora in the middle of the night  
Do you wait for me  
Where the morning sun shine bright  
Is it all a dream  
Is it only make believe  
  
Is it all a thread  
Of the tangled web you weave  
Is it all a dream  
Is it only make believe
