You came in  
Thats what my little heart was looking for  
Laughter in the rain  
Feeling like a fool in love again  
  
The laughter came  
When the tears stopped falling  
Now all I do is just call your name  
When I say lover  
You walked in and my heart discovered  
That my life would never be the same  
Oh you are my destiny  
You are my one and only  
You gave back joy to me  
When my whole world was lonely  
Angel in disguise  
With your power of love  
You just hypnotize  
I just love the magic of your spell  
How much joy well have together  
Only time will tell  
  
Every day every night  
Oh I know its so right  
When I see your face  
Only times gonna tell  
But I know you so well  
Girl my loves for real  
  
From the first time that I saw you  
I know it was forever  
This mighty love between us  
Will keep us together  
Youre the girl God sent from heaven  
Im so glad I found you  
Forever forever forever forever forever forever  
Im so glad to be around you  
You are my destiny  
You are my one and only  
You gave back joy to me  
When my whole world was lonely  
Its alright its alright  
Do it again  
Its alright its alright  
Dont let this love end  
Its alright its alright  
Do it again  
Its alright its alright  
Dont let this love end
