Quizas algun dia  
La encuentre otra vez alli  
En una frontera  
Me robo el corazon  
  
Yo sabia que a ella la perdia  
Vi todoun mundo en  
  
Camelitas eyes  
She took me somewhere  
Somewhere thats far beyond  
Was going no where  
  
And I couldnt go for long  
The waitin and prayin  
Was makin me tell myself lies  
And all I could see was my  
  
Carmelitas eyes  
Vi todoun mundo en  
Carmelitas eyes  
How did I live it before  
  
I just dont understand  
Afraid that shed read me and  
Finally deceive me  
I closed my eyes and I ran  
  
But I want to be  
Carmelitas man  
Hey hey  
Yes I lost her cross the border  
  
It was higher than I realize  
And I left my whole world in  
Carmelitas eyes  
Vi todoun mundo en  
  
Carmelitas eyes  
I saw the whole world in  
Carmelitas eyes  
Vi todoun mundo en  
  
Carmelitas eyes  
I saw the whole world in  
Carmelitas eyes
