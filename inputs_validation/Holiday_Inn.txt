Silent Night Snowy Night The First Noel alone  
The only Jingle Bells round here are on the motel phone  
She calls me comforts me holding back a tear  
Shes wishing on that yonder star and Im missing Christmas here  
  
At the Holiday Inn no tinsel or mistletoe  
Holiday Inn one bed and HBO  
The whole world is rejoicing with family and friends  
And Im watching Its A Wonderful Life at the Holiday Inn  
  
Christmas Eve used to be a peaceful dream of joy  
But as I toss and turn tonight I hear a scuffled noise  
Whats that it cant be it sounds kinda like reindeer  
But I really doubt the bearded one makes deliveries here  
  
At the Holiday Inn no tinsel or mistletoe  
Holiday Inn one bed and HBO  
The whole world is rejoicing with family and friends  
And Im watching Its A Wonderful Life at the Holiday Inn  
  
I look out the peephole I cant believe what I see yeah  
Its my baby in a Santa hat and shes smilin at me  
She brings in a two foot tree and hangs a wreath on the wall  
Looks like its gonna be a very merry after all  
  
Holiday Inn with tinsel and mistletoe  
Holiday Inn one bed and HBO  
The whole world is rejoicing with family and friends  
And were watching Its A Wonderful Life at the Holiday Inn  
Yeah and its a wonderful life at the Holiday Inn
