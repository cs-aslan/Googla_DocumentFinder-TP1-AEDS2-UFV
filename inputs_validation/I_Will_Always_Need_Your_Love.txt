In the book of my life  
Till the day that its through  
You know most of the pages belong to you  
Every interesting chapter  
  
Every twist every turn  
Youre my willing accomplice to the lessons  
Ive learned  
Till the end of the story  
  
Ill be riveted  
And when I write my dedication Ill say  
I will always need your love  
Wish I could write it in the daily news  
  
I will always need your love  
It would be very hard to fill your shoes  
I will always need your love  
So many ways that I depend on you  
  
I will always need your love  
No one else no one else could love me like you  
You know all of my faults  
Every strength every quirk  
  
You can dictate a handbook on the way that I work  
Many towering hurdles  
Youve helped me climb  
What was already great is even better with time  
  
Youve discovered each secret  
Every fantasy  
The only thing I really need you to see  
I will always need your love  
  
Wish I could write it in the daily news  
I will always need your love  
It would be very hard to fill your shoes  
I will always need your love  
  
So many ways that I depend on you  
I will always need your love  
No one else no one else could love me like you  
I will always need your love  
  
Wish I could write it in the daily news  
I will always need your love  
It would be very hard to fill your shoes  
I will always need your love  
  
So many ways that I depend on you  
I will always need your love  
No one else no one else no one else could love me like you  
I will always need your love  
  
I will always need your love  
I will always need your love  
Always need your love  
I will always need your love  
  
So many ways that I depend on you  
I will always need your love  
No one else no one else could love me like you  
I will always need your love
