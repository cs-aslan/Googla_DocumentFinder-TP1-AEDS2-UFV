My flesh is tired of seeking god  
But on my knees Ill stay  
I want to be a pleasing child  
Until that final day  
  
My mind is full of many thoughts  
That clutter and confuse  
But standing firm i will prevail  
In faith that Ill be used  
  
Amen Im asking once again  
Wont you help me my friend lord Jesus  
Holy lord spirit set us free  
From chains we cannot see  
Come release us  
  
I wrestle not with flesh and blood  
My fight is with the one  
Who lost the keys of hell and death  
To gods most precious son  
  
One sleepless night of anguished prayer  
I triumphed over sin  
One battle in the holy war  
Gods promised me to win  
  
Amen Im asking once again  
Wont you help me my friend lord Jesus  
Holy lord spirit set us free  
From chains we cannot see  
Come release us  
  
My flesh is tired of seeking god  
But on my knees Ill stay  
I want to be a pleasing child  
Until that final day
