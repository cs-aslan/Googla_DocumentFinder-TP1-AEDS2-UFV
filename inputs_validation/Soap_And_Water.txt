Ian Hunter  
  
I cant believe what you did you know  you just cant let it go  
Im sick n tired of listening to your innuendo  
I cant believe what you did you know  you sawed me in half  
When I was at the end of my endurance  
All you did was bite the hand that fed you from the start  
  
Oh  oh  oh  oh  a little soap n water na na na na na na  would not
come amiss  
Oh  oh  a little soap n water  a little soap n water a little soap n
water  
  
I cant believe what you did why  why you stoop so low  
Why am I the target for your slings and arrows  
I cant believe what you did when  you showed me no class  
Every mirror tells a different story  
Who gave you the right to be the keeper of my past  
  
Oh  oh  oh  oh  a little soap n water na na na na na na  would not
come amiss  
Oh  oh  a little soap n water  a little soap n water were gonna have
to wash your mouth out if you persist  
  
You know I was never loyal to you  you were never loyal to me  
We were both loyal to the cause  
That cause died  there was nothing left inside  
It aint my fault let it  it aint your fault  let it ride  
  
I cant believe what you did you know  you know how to hurt  
All you do is drag old memories through the dirt  
I cant believe what you did  you show no mercy  
Yesterday dont last until tomorrow  
My oh my what a pitiful cry  youre your own worst enemy  
  
Oh  oh  oh  oh  a little soap n water na na na na na na  would not
come amiss  
Oh  oh  a little soap n water  a little soap n water were gonna have
to wash your mouth out if you persist  
  
I got just what you need I got just what you need  
I got just what you need I got just what you need  
I got just what you need I got just what you need  
I got just what you need
