Chorus  
Our love is still alive  
And all I want is just to be right by your side  
And all Im asking you is give me one more try  
I know the future has a place for you and I  
Cause baby our love our love is still alive  
  
You say that our love is gone and  
Whatever we did was wrong  
That everything we built is now history yeah  
Youve taken my heart away and I cant seem  
To make you stay but baby I believe  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive given it all to you and Ive been living my life through  
You and Im not gonna give in now  
Weve come too far I know that were gonna work it out  
And even if you still doubt it baby I believe  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Believe me things will get better  
Hold me Im more than a friend  
Trust me I promise you one thing  
Ill stay with you till the end
