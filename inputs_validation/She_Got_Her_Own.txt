Remix I love her cause she got her own  
She dont need mine she say leave mine alone  
There aint nothing thats more sexy then a girl  
That want but dont need me  
Young independent yea she work hard  
But you cant tell from the way that she walk  
She dont slow down cause she aint got time  
To be complaining shawty goin shine  
She dont expect nothing from no guy  
She plays aggressive but she still shy  
But you never know her softer side  
By looking in her eyes  
Knowing she can do for herself  
Makes me wanna give her my wealth  
Only kinda girl I want  
Independent queen  
Workin for her throne  
  
Chorus  
I love her cause she got her own she got her own  
I love her cause she got her own  
She got her own I love it when she say  
Its cool I got it I got it I got it  
I love it when she say its cool I got it I got it I got it Remix  
  
I love her cause she got her own  
She dont need mine she say leave mine alone  
There aint nothing thats more sexy  
Then a girl that want but dont need me  
Lovely face nice thick thighs  
Plus she got drive that matches my drive  
Sexy thing shes Ms Fly  
All the while paying her bills on time  
She dont look at me like captain save em  
Gold digging no she dont do that  
Now she look at me like inspiration  
She wanna be complimenting my swag  
And everything she got she work for it  
Good life made for it she take pride in saying  
That she paid for it only kind of girl I want  
Independent queen working for her throne  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont make me laugh boo never did that bad too  
Make you even have to but even if I had to  
Ask my better half to youd be more than glad to  
When I do that math boo you always try and add two  
I need someone who ride for me  
Not someone who ride for free  
She say boy I dont just ride  
Shell pull up beside of me I had to ask her  
What she doing in that caddy  
She say cause you my baby  
Ill be stunting like my daddy  
And theres not many who catch my eye  
We both wearin Gucci she match my fly  
And thats why I supposed to keep her closer  
Right by my side toaster in the holster  
And now she went Loso case you didnt know so  
You can save your money dog shawty getting dough so  
What she care what his cost you can call her miss boss  
I got it backwards Kriss Kross shawty got her own  
  
Now all my ladies that dont need a man for nothing  
Cept some of that good lovin let me here you say oh oh oh oh  
  
And all my fellas know you need to stop the frontin  
if you love an independent woman let me hear you say oh oh oh oh
