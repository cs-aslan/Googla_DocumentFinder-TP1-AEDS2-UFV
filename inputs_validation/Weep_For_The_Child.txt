Hey you do you ever cry  for the child  
  
Falling in love with strangers feeling incomplete hey thats me  
Some are fly some are shy some are acting like they own the street ooh  
One minute were together then the next youre acting really cool so cool  
You can play me any way but dont ever treat me like a fool no no no  
  
Sometimes so hateful  
Sometimes so shy  
Dont ask me why  
  
Weep for the child  
Better raise your hand  
Were twisting the style  
Aint no need to understand  
Dont leave me alone to make it tonight  
No dont go  
  
Wearing your desperation wrapped me on your sleeve yes you do  
Youve got everything you want but you just cant get the things that you
need oh no no no  
  
Sometimes you fake it  
Sometimes you lie  
Dont ask me why  
  
Weep for the child  
Better raise your hand raise your hand  
Were twisting the style  
Aint no need to understand  
Dont leave me alone to make it tonight no no no  
  
Sweet baby  
  
You never understood  
You never treat me right  
  
Weep for the child  
Better raise your hand raise your hand  
Were twisting the style  
Aint no need to understand do you understand  
Dont leave me alone to make it tonight yeah  
  
Weep for the child  
Weep  
Weep  
Weep  
In your heart  
  
Weep for the child  
Better raise your hand raise your hand  
Were twisting the style  
Aint no need to understand no need  
Dont leave me alone to make it  
Alone to make it  
Alone to make it tonight
