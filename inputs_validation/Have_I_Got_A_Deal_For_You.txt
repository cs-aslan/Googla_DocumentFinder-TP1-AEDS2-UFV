Well you look like the kind whos got an eye for a bargain  
A kind of guy who likes to shop around  
Well I got me this old heart  
That Im putting on the market  
And Ill make you a deal you cant turn down  
  
Chorus  
Have I got a deal for you  
A heart thats almost like brand new  
And Ill let it go so cheap  
Youll think you stole it fore youre through  
Have I got a deal for you  
  
Well you could search the whole world over  
And never find another like it  
Its got a built in lifetime guarantee  
Its a one time only offer  
And darling once youve tried it  
Youre gonna fall in love with it youll see  
  
Chorus
