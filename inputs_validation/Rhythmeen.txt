According to Gibbons this stands for mean rhythm and indicates  
the albums general mood Straight from Bo Diddley Land  
  
Solidsilver beat machine  
Hunkin down  
Funkin up on Magazine  
On rhythmeen in New Orleans  
  
Drinkin Dixie 45 with hot links  
In a silver Continental  
Wired as hell and doin things  
Thats what you get on rhythmeen  
  
Oh yeah way up  
Oh yeah way out  
Uhhuh get on up  
Rhythmeen is down  
Rhythmeen thing  
Mean mean rhythmeen  
  
Cant get enough of that special sauce  
The backbeats the big boss  
Here comes another dope fiend  
Tradin up for rhythmeen  
  
Oh yeah weird up  
Oh yeah fear not  
Uhhuh get on up  
Rhythmeen is down  
  
Leanin on a silver Lincoln  
A Galaxy 500  
In a Mustang might Tchoupitoulas  
Rhythmeen up everything
