By Guy Clark  
  
And Id sing the red river valley  
And hed sit in the kitchen and cry  
Run his fingers through seventy years of living  
Wondering lord has every well I drilled ran dry  
We were friends me and that old man  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
Hes A drifter and A driller of oil wells  
And an old school man of the world  
Taught me how to drive his car when hes too drunk to  
And hed wink and give me money for the girls  
And our lives was like some old western movie  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
From the time that I could walk hed take me with him  
To A place called the green frog cafe  
And there was old men with beer guts and dominoes  
Lying about their lives while they played  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
And I looked up and he was pushing eighty  
And there was brown tobacco stains all down his chin  
To me hes one of the heroes of this country  
See whys he all dressed up like some old man  
Drinking beer and playing moon in fortyTwo  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
The day before he dies I went to see him  
I was grown and he was almost gone  
We just closed our eyes and dreamt us up A kitchen  
And sang another verse to that old song  
DONT CRY JACK ITS ONLY JESUS COMING  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train
