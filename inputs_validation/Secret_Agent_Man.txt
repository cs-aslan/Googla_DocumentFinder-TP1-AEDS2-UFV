You know I live a life of danger  
For the FBI  
Keeping tabs on our nation  
On the land on the sea in the sky  
But every single night  
Before I go to bed  
I get down on my knees  
And thank God  
Im a secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
Theyve given me a number  
But theyve taken way my name  
I got one hell of a job to perform  
For the U S of A  
Got the responsibility  
Of our nations top security  
But every night and day  
I salute the flag and say  
Thank you Jesus  
Cause Im Im a secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
  
You know they got me doin this  
Doin that  
And a little bit of something else  
Fighting cavities of evil  
Safeguarding Americas health  
But not an afternoon pass  
I dont get up off my ass  
Thank you God  
Cause Im Im a secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
  
Cause Im a secret agent man
