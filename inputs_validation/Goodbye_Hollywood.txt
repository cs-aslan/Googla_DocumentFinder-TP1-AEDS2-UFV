Born and raised in the windy city  
I moved west to kick start a dream  
What I found was a town without pity  
Thatll chew you up and swallow you clean  
  
Im amazed at the life Im livin  
Dont want to seem like Im rockin the boat  
But it aint all about taking but giving  
I feel something tugging at my coat  
No one ever told me it would be like this  
That thered be something called home thats too hard to miss  
  
Chorus  
Im saying goodbye to the glamor  
Back to the old neighborhood  
All that I need is a place that I can breathe  
Im saying goodbye to Hollywood  
  
Done my time in the Hoodoo Jungle  
Tired of waking up in another mans dream  
Ive got the ball and I aint gonna fumble  
Gonna make a winner of this team  
All that ever mattered were the goals I chased  
Now Im ready to run in the human race  
  
Chorus  
  
Me and the Mrs done made up our minds  
Were gonna give our boys a little less sunshine  
Call it runnin say what you like  
Ive got my own definition of paradise  
Id rather be knee deep in snow than knee deep in jive  
I may be cold but my soul is alive  
  
Chorus
