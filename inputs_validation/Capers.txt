All words that look prounouncable are not typos any that look unpronouncable
are probably typos Each set of two lines is one line in the lyric book ie
what has not gotsir namesone line  
  
What has not got my heart in it shall we be dubbed sir names  
Wither million blither tongues mounting bristling guilt frames  
In the fakeache of the gloomloom slippers slap me alive  
The hours hands down a miracle to spend with ugly types  
So we can catch and thread a minstrel bleed a tower down to its ankles  
So we cant go up or stay up find the thumb dumb in your ear brain  
Get unfunny Such as choirs do why the clocklock bought up this one  
Just when things seem so paperparrent like my toothface Like my outdo  
  
  
Oh a streak Otreacly not a typo inkinks tied my knees all up in elbows  
Erase that lapsing smile tub lose the slip of the small soapfellows  
Account the addups till Donots are we balanced were in business  
Idle tidal rush in tried all with a limbs all legs and armour  
I had a dreadful diehood diehard drunken sunken Monkheart  
Oh I had a Wonderful diehood thanks to my fa fa family
