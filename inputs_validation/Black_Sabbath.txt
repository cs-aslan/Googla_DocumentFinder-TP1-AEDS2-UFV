What is this that stands before me  
Figure in black which points at me  
Turn round quick and start to run  
Find out Im the chosen one  
  
Oh no  
  
Big black shape with eyes of fire  
Telling people their desire  
Satan sitting there hes smiling  
Watches those flame get higher and higher  
  
Oh god lease help me  
Oh no no  
  
Child cries out for its mother  
Mother screaming in the fire  
Satan points at me again  
Opens the door to push me in  
  
Oh no  
Oh god  
  
Is it the end my friend  
Satans coming round the bend  
People running cause theyre scared  
You people better go and beware  
  
No no  
Please god no
