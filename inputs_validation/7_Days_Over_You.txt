Well its Friday night and Im waiting  
On your call girl like I do  
Am I wasting my time by this telephone line  
Waiting on your call to come through  
  
Chorus  
I should be already over you  
Tell me Mama what can I do  
Its been a long hard road that you put me through  
Seven days over you  
Seven days seven days over you  
Seven days over you  
  
Kick it  
  
I kick and fight for you baby  
But thats never enough for you  
Youve been twisted and torn since the day you were born  
You make a game of breaking hearts in two  
  
Now I want to give up but I dig the rush too much  
I guess thats what love will do  
So drag your heartstopping mind trip downtown girl  
By Friday night Ill find someone new  
  
Chorus  
  
Lord knows what you put me through  
  
Already over you tell me mama what can I do  
Already over you tell me mama what can I do  
  
Chorus
