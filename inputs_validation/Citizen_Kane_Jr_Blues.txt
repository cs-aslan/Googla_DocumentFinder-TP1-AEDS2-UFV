Good lookin Millys got  
A gun in her hand  
But she dont know how to use it  
Sooner or later shell  
Have to take a stand  
And she aint about to lose it  
All the towns people gather around  
Theyve come to see  
Whats going down  
Although no one hears a sound  
Theres another poor man  
Falling down  
Falling down falling down  
Falling down falling down  
  
On this noisy shore  
Standing at the edge of you  
Could those dreams of yours be true  
Or did you did you did you  
Pushed it over the end  
How much time did you spend  
Pushed it over the end  
  
Good lookin Millys  
Into politics now  
And things are looking much better  
She keeps ten men in her garage  
Knitting her fine sweaters  
At the end of a weary day  
She feels hard and she looks hard  
Although no one hears a sound  
Theres another poor man  
Falling down  
Falling down falling down  
Falling down falling down  
  
I came back for more  
And found you waiting at the door  
And far inside your walls  
I called  
Did you did you did you  
Pushed it over the end  
How much time did you spend  
Pushed it over the end  
  
How much love did you spend  
Pushed it over the end
