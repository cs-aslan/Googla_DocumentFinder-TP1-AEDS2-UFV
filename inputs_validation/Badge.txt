Im thinking about the times you drove in my car  
Im thinking that I might have drove you too far  
Im thinking of the love  
That you laid on my table  
  
I told you not to wander round in the dark  
I told you bout the swans that they live in the park  
Then I told you about our kid  
Now hes married to mabel  
  
Yes I told you that the life goes up and down  
Notice how the wheel goes round  
And youd better pick yourself up from the ground  
Before they bring the curtain down  
Yes before they bring the curtain down  
  
Talking about a girl that looks quite like you  
She didnt have the time to wait in the queue  
She cried away her life since she fell out the cradle
