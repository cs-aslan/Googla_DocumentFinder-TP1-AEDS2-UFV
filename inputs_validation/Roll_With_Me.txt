Chorus Faith Evans  
Sure enough riding wont you come roll with me  
Come on roll with me  
We can put the top down on the highway and feel the breeze

Chorus  
  
MJG  
Pimp tight MJG  
Fin to get up on the mic with a passion  
Get up on some pads Gwen my chick get her ass in  
For the track make my money  
Bring it on back to the middle of the floor  
I want the whole stack  
Plus I need a little more I gotta eat a little mo  
My seed gotta grow  
I got a reason to flow a reason to show  
What I mean is I go  
off like a champ when I cling to the floor  
My Twinkies shine when I hit the strip llac dipping  
Strictly pimping as long as tricks invest in women  
From the Memphis Tenn to the Nwhysee Im representing  
I put mo spice into yo life than yo entire kitchen  
Big dicking choking hoes with anaconda  
If my pimping was a drink itd be a can of Thunder  
I slang lumber a spell I keep my women under  
Through all seasons they fall winter spring and summer  
I hit the highway smoked out pistol gripping  
But I aint tripping though Im high as hell spaceshipn  
  
Chorus x2
