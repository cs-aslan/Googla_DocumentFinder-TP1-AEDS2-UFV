Way back yonder in the days of old  
The men was working but not saving any dough  
Then came a woman looking real cool  
She said to herself Now thats my fool  
  
Im gonna ball tonight  
Im gonna ball tonight  
Well I cant break the rule because  
Every man is some womans fool  
  
Met a girl on the avenue  
She was shy and I was blue  
Like a teacher and a student in school  
Looked at me and said Youre my fool  
  
Im gonna ball tonight  
Were gonna ball tonight  
Well I cant break the rule  
That every man is some womans fool

Were gonna ball tonight  
Were gonna ball tonight
