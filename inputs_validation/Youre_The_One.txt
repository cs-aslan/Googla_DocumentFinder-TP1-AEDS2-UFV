Some say youre crazy  
Say that youre no good  
Say your familys cursed with bad blood  
But I think youre cute and misunderstood  
And I wouldnt change you if I could  
  
Let em talk you down  
Call you names  
My minds made up  
It aint gonna change  
Im sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
Youre the one  
Youre the one  
Youre the one for me  
  
Some say youre bitter  
Think youre mean  
Uncouth untamed and unrestrained  
But I think youre sensitive and sweet  
Stay as you are  
Dont change a thing  
  
Let em talk you down  
Call you names  
My minds made up  
It aint gonna change  
Im sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
Youre the one  
Youre the one  
Youre the one for me  
  
Some say youre bawdy  
Wicked and wild  
A restless useless juvenile  
But I think youre funny and I like your smile  
Want to be with you  
Want you to stay a while  
  
Let em talk you down  
Call you names  
My minds made up  
It aint gonna change  
Im sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
Youre the one  
Youre the one  
Youre the one for me  
  
A no count mixed up  
Amount to nothing  
A day away from a bum on the street  
Some low class kind of royalty  
Thats what they say about you  
When theyre talking to me  
  
Some say youre bad  
A bad bad seed  
You love to play with fire you love gambling  
But I know what you love and I know what you need  
And I like it when you play with me  
  
Let em talk you down  
Call you names  
My minds made up  
It aint gonna change  
Im sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
Youre the one  
Youre the one  
Youre the one for me  
  
Im sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
Youre the one  
Youre the one  
Youre the one for me
