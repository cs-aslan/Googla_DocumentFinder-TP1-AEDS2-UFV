I will remember you  
Will you remember me  
Dont let your life pass you by  
Weep not for the memories  
  
Im so tired  
I cant sleep  
Standing on the edge of something  
Much too deep  
  
Its funny how we feel so much  
And cannot say a word  
Were screaming inside  
But we cant be heard  
  
Chorus  
  
So afraid to love you  
More afraid to lose  
Clinging to a past  
That doesnt let me choose  
  
Well once there was a darkness  
A deep and endless night  
You gave me everything  
You gave me life  
  
Chorus  
  
Remember all the good times that we had  
Let them slip away from us  
When things got bad  
  
How clearly I first saw you  
Smiling in the sun  
I want to feel your warmth around me  
I want to be the one  
  
Chorus   
  
Chorus   
  
Weep not for the memories  
  
Weep not for the memories
