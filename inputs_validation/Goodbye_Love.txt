Its not the way that love is meant to be  
You took me by surprise but now I see  
You know this heartachenight is killing me  
Baby byebye  
Forget the past honey  
Better try someone new Baby dont cry  
Theres nothing left here  
For me or for you  
You know this heartachenight  
Will soon be through  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
Whats done is done darling  
This much is true  
Its all over now  
Dont be blue  
You know this heartachenight  
Will soon be through  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
Baby byebye  
Goodbye love  
Baby byebye  
Goodbye love  
Baby byebye  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love
