How I love you baby  
So dont let me wait too long  
  
How I miss you baby  
So dont let me wait too long  
  
How I miss you baby  
So dont let me wait too long  
  
Till youre here by my side  
Now only you know how to dry up all  
Of those tears that Ive cried  
  
Here with our love  
Now only you know how to lay it down  
Like it came from above  
  
You know its you that I love  
  
Now dont let me wait too long  
Now dont let me wait too long  
Now dont let me wait too long  
Now dont let me wait too long  
  
Till youre here by my side  
Now only you know how to dry eye up  
All of those tears that Ive cried  
  
Here with your love  
Now only you know how to lay it there  
Like it came from above  
  
You know that its you that I love  
  
So dont let me wait too long  
So dont let me wait too long  
  
How I miss you baby  
So dont let me wait too long  
  
How I miss you baby  
So dont let me wait  
  
Dont let me wait  
Dont let me wait too long
