Be careful what you say  
Loose talk could sink this ship  
Well the way that I am as weak as a lamb  
See it on my shaky lip  
Theres more to these actions  
That you could ever know  
With the moon and the tide Im drawn to your side  
And moving with the flow  
When its time to choose and its sink or swim  
I know Ill drown this time  
When the cold wind blows and Im falling in  
Throw the line  
Now Im swept  
And Im lost within my mind  
On a love that makes me blind  
And this feeling I just cant forget  
Now Im swept  
On a tide thats in my soul  
And this feeling that I have is losing me control  
And I hope it doesnt end just yet  
Now Im swept  
Mind over matter  
No matter where this mind will be  
Theres more to be said oh for games in the head  
Than anything youll ever see  
Theres safety in dreaming  
So wrap me in things that I know  
With my head in the sand  
Im at your command  
And moving with the flow  
When its time to choose and its sink or swim  
I know Ill drown this time  
When the cold wind blows and Im falling in  
Throw the line  
Now Im swept  
And Im lost within my mind  
On a love that makes me blind  
And this feeling I just cant forget  
Now Im swept  
On a tide thats in my soul  
And this feeling that I have is losing me control  
And I hope it doesnt end just yet  
Now Im swept
