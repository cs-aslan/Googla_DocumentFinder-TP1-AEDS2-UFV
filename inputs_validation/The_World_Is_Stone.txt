Stone the world is stone  
Its no trick of the light  
Its hard on the soul  
Stone the world is stone  
Cold to the touch  
And hard on the soul  
In the gray of the streets  
In the neon unknown  
I look for a sign  
That Im not on my own  
That Im not here alone  
As the still of the night  
And the choke of the air  
And the winners delight  
And the losers despair  
Closes in left and right  
I would love not to care  
Stone the world is stone  
from a faraway look  
Without stars in my eyes  
Through the halls of the rich  
And the flats of the poor  
Wherever I go  
Theres no warmth anymore  
Theres no love anymore  
So I turn on my heels  
Im declining the fall  
Ive had all I can take  
With my back to the wall  
Tell the world Im not in  
Im not taking the call  
Stone the world is stone  
But I saw it once  
With the stars in my eyes  
When each color rang out  
In a thunderous chrome  
Its no trick of the light  
I cant find my way home  
In a world of stone
