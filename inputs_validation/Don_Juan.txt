The man whos escorting Don Juan to his bride  
Knows he is courting an impudent pride  
Think of his jealousy oh where will he hide  
The man whos escorting Don Juan to his bride  
  
The man who will cover for Don Juans old soothsayer  
Films for a Warner brother or Mister GoldwynMayer  
Think of his starlet how much will he pay her  
The man who will cover for Don Juans old soothsayer  
  
An impasse has been reached with the teacher of the rich  
To quit would be discreet and swift  
But you know that I cant do that  
It would be a disaster  
It would be a disaster  
  
Ive got this sinking feeling Im not dreaming  
Well be sorry soon  
  
At the end of the day when everyones resigned  
To the heart of the matter and the measures in mind  
King Zogs back from holiday Mary Lupescus grey  
And King Alexander is dead in Marseilles  
  
An impasse has been reached with the teacher of the rich  
To quit would be discrete and swift  
But you know that I cant do that  
It would be a disaster  
It would be a disaster  
  
Ive got this sinking feeling Im not dreaming  
Well be sorry soon  
  
Ha ha
