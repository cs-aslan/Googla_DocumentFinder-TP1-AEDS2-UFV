I cant get you off of my mind  
When I try Im just wastin my time  
Lord Ive tried and Ive tried and all night long Ive cried  
But I cant get you off of my mind  
Well you think you would leave me behind  
But I guess youre the good timin kind  
Do you think that its smart to jump from heart to heart  
When I cant get you off of my mind  
I cant get you off of my mind  
When I try Im just wastin my time  
Lord Ive tried and Ive tried and all night long Ive cried  
But I cant get you off of my mind  
You believe that a true love is blind  
So you fool every new love you find  
Youve got stars in your eyes but they cant hide the lies  
I cant get you off of my mind  
I cant get you off of my mind  
When I try Im just wastin my time  
Lord Ive tried and Ive tried and all night long Ive cried  
But I cant get you off of my mind
