Theres a time and place for everything for everyone  
We can push with all our might but nothings gonna come  
Oh no nothings gonna change  
And if I asked you not to try  
Oh could you let it be  
I wanna hold you and say  
We cant throw this all away  
Tell me you wont go you wont go  
Do you have to hear me say  
I cant stop lovin you  
  
And no matter what you say or do  
You know my heart is true oh  
I cant stop lovin you  
You can change your friends your place in life  
You can change your mind  
We can change the things we say  
And do it anytime  
Oh no but I think youll find  
That when you look inside your heart  
Oh baby Ill be there  
  
Hold on  
Im holding on  
Baby just come on come on come on  
I just wanna hear you say  
I cant stop lovin you  
And no matter what you say or do  
You know my heart is true oh  
I cant stop lovin you  
Oh Im twisted and tied  
And all I can remember  
Is how hard we tried  
Only to surrender  
  
And when its over  
I know how its gonna be  
And true love will never die  
No not fade away  
I cant stop lovin you  
And no matter what you say or do  
You know my heart is true oh  
I cant stop lovin you  
And I know what I got to do  
Hey ray what you said is true  
I cant stop lovin you oh  
Oh I cant stop lovin you
