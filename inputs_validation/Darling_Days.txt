If I never love again I wont feel cheated  
You gave me more than I knew how to use  
On the day we met my journey was completed  
Even though my autumn years wont be with you  
  
Seems like yesterday we called each other darling  
Seems like yesterday you reached and touched my hand  
Id love to hear you say good morning darling  
Oh what Id give to live those darling days again  
  
Today my heart survives on love thats borrowed  
From all the happy yesterdays we knew  
If I knew for sure the world would end tomorrow  
I have to spend my last days loving you  
  
Seems like yesterday we called each other darling  
Seems like yesterday you reached and touched my hand  
Id love to hear you say good morning darling  
Oh what Id give to live those darling days again  
  
Oh what Id give to live those darling days again
