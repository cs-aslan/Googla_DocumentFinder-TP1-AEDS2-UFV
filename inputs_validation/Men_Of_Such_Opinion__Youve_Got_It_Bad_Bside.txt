Summer death slow step  
Walk behind the mother of the thirteen year old browneyed boy  
Attitudes attitudes  
Sloganized by middle boots  
The men who slogged the browneyed boy  
  
And its the end of everything that youve been told about  
Decency honesty  
And its the end of holding back and breaking bones and building bombs  
And hanging witchhunts conducted by men of such opinion  
  
Repeat first verse  
  
And its the end of building roads to load the dead to someone elses field  
And its the end of falling back on breaking backs and aching handshakes  
And playing fields conducted by men of such opinion  
  
But the fathers crossed you boys  
I fire so heaven knows it only righteous folk  
But righteous taste hold the keys to sitting grace  
To conduct and to proclaim decisions made of such opinions  
  
And its the time of summer days  
When children sing about the killing fields  
Winter melts the snow and knees will crack on rock  
And the iron on earth beneath the dearth bequeathed  
 By men of such opinion
