On the street  
Theyre preaching violence  
Mr man its in your head  
On the street  
The midnight cowboy  
Needs no gun  
To shoot you dead  
  
Why do I live the way I do  
Aint it obvious  
Im just a man like you  
  
Mr man full of love  
Mr man full of hate  
Got his heart on the trigger  
But he pulled it too late  
  
Mr man is a pilot  
Mr man is a fake  
Mr mans feeling hungry  
And hes lying in wait  
  
On the street  
The lights are fighting  
Searching for someone like you  
Better find a good messiah  
To help the sad and lonely through  
  
Why do I live the way I do  
Aint it obvious  
Im much more black than blue  
  
On the street theyre preaching violence  
Mr man its in your head  
On the street  
The midnight cowboy  
Needs no gun  
To shoot you dead
