When Paul Revere went riding while the stars were burning bright  
It was all it was all it was all in a nights work  
When Edison stayed up so late he finally saw the light  
It was all it was all it was all in a nights work  
And when a girl and fellow get underneath that moon  
Its not a long shot you can bet on something happening soon  
So when they ask me just how come I came up winning you  
Though it took hours of flowers and the wining and dining and telephone calls
to get the pot to perk  
I smile and say it was all in a nights work  
It was all it was all it was all in a nights work  
It was all it was all it was all in a nights work  
And when a girl and fellow get underneath that moon  
Its not a long shot you can bet on something happening soon  
So when they ask me just how come I came up winning you  
Though it took hours of flowers and the wining and dining and telephone calls
to get the pot to perk  
I smile and say it was  
All in a nights work  
All in a nights work
