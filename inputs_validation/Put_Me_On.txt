Put me on Im your brand new record album  
Side one cut one listen to the songs  
Play me loud dont you worry bout your nieghbors  
Hope I make you feel good all day long  
All day long  
  
Put me on and play me loud  
Im the madman screaming in your living room  
Ill soon be coming to your town  
To sing and play a little tune  
  
I said put me on and play me loud  
Turn your stereo up all the way  
All the way  
Now your bodys immersed in sound  
So hear the synthesizers play  
  
And now youre in the mood  
Let the melody just drift your cares away  
Its got to do you good  
As it mesmerizes you in its own way  
So drift away
