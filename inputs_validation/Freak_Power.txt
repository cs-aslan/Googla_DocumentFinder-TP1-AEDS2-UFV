A man a plan he doesnt understand  
He cant live the life he wants to lead  
Dealin with fools and brother ridicule  
Every day he got new rules to read  
Stop and fight man  
Make it right man  
Change the things you really hate  
The life he leads turns him inside out  
Coz hes livin in a master state  
  
Freak Power  
Riding the freak wave  
Freak Power  
True bein a freak slave  
Freak Power  
Walking the freak walk  
Freak Power  
Talking like a freak talks  
  
A woman cant walk alone shes on her own  
Takin it home  
Footsteps in an alleyway but shes got no other way to go  
Stop and think man Watcha doing man  
Cant you let your sister breathe  
She got the right 2 wnader day and night  
And move where she please  
  
Some people say and some people do  
All I want to know is which one are you  
People stand around doggin on their brother  
Part 1 of the plan respect each other
