Its not the way that I intended this  
I didnt realize how much I would miss  
But with every parting of our company  
I hate to think what it has done to me  
  
Chorus  
You didnt see that I was sorry  
This has to be my apology  
  
When cruelty comes with blind indifference  
My humanity becomes my best defense  
But if you consider the alternative  
I really didnt have that much to give  
  
A tragic victim of my circumstance  
Never give the devil a second chance  
If you do you know that you never will  
Probably best to forget and begin again
