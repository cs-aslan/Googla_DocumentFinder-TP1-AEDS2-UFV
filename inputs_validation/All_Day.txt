I dont care what they say about me  
Its all right all right  
I dont care they think about me  
Its all right theyll get it one day  
  
PreChorus  
I love you Ill follow you  
You are my my life  
I will read my Bible and pray  
I will follow you all day  
  
I dont care what it costs anymore  
Cause you gave it all and Im following you  
I dont care what it takes anymore  
No matter what happens Im going your way  
  
PreChorus  
  
Chorus  
All Day  
All Day now  
All Day  
Ill follow You  
  
I dont care what they say about me  
Its all right all right  
I dont care they think about me  
Its all right theyll get it one day  
  
PreChorus  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
Anyone around can see  
just how good youve been to me  
For all my friends that dont know you  
I pray that you would save them too  
  
Chorus
