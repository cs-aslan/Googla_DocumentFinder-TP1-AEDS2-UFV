When my friends told me you had someone new  
I didnt believe a single word was true  
I told them all I had faith in you  
I kept aright on sayin  
  
Oh no not my baby  
Oh no not my sweet baby  
Youre not like all those other girls  
Who play with the mens hearts like they were toys  
  
My mama told me Son when rumors spread  
That there is truth somewhere  
And you should use your head  
But sure didnt listen to what she said  
Dont you know I kept aright on sayin  
  
Oh no not my baby  
Oh no not my sweet baby  
  
Youre not like all those other girls  
Who lead you on and tell you lies  
No no my baby  
  
Tell me baby  
I dont believe what they say no  
  
Oh no not my baby  
Oh no not my sweet baby  
Oh no not my baby  
Oh no not my sweet baby  
  
Not my baby not my baby  
Not my baby not my baby  
Not my baby not my baby  
Not my sweet sweet baby  
  
Not my baby not my baby  
Not my baby not my baby  
Not my baby not my baby  
No way not my baby  
  
Not my baby not my baby  
Not my sweet sweet baby  
Oh no not my baby  
Oh no not my sweet baby  
  
Oh no not my baby  
Oh no not my sweet baby  
Oh no not my baby  
Oh no not my sweet baby  
  
Oh no not my baby  
Oh no not my sweet baby
