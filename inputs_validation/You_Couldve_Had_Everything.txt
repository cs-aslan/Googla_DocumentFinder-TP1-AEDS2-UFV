ignorance and arrogance mean quite the same to me take a look around you and
im sure you will agree the world is full of people filled with hatred filled
with greed its such a rare example when youve found a human being you
couldve had everything but you you wouldve been scared of what to do you
shouldve been so much more to us than just exonerated why shouldnt it break
your heart in two i find little entertains me anymore the problems of the
world are often tedious and worn im reading all about it with a chuckle and a
sneer they say a new beginning and they say the end is near get in your self
assuredness and take it for a spin youll be standing by yourself when theyve
all given in its take before its taken from you every single day i wish it
wasnt like this i dont know another way
