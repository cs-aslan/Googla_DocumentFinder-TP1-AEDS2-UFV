Its dark in the day now say now dont complain  
Look up the sun its just a call away  
You so afraid to cry but your heart be feeling dry  
Its time to change  
But you keep thundering thundering  
Im wondering wondering why it keep thundering  
Wont you just pray and get it over with  
  
Tonight feel the pain now baby I wont complain  
I hate saying look up the sun its just a call away  
And I was so afraid to cry  
And when you need a way to ride thats the way  
Keep thundering thundering  
Im wondering wondering why it keep thundering  
Want to just fucking rage and get it over with  
And get it over with
