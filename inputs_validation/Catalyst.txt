Attitude is my addiction  
I live life with no regret  
Unlike you its my conviction  
That sets me apart from the rest  
  
I live for competition  
Your cynicism only makes me stronger  
I am the culmination  
Setting the standard that all will follow  
  
I live it every day  
Dont know another way  
  
Within my eyes theres devastation and fury  
You cant understand  
In my fight  
Win by attrition I bring it with all that I fucking am  
  
You never dealt with such rejection  
Licking your wounds that wont fucking heal  
Youve never seen so much aggression  
I am the scream to your fucking silence  
  
I live it every day  
Dont know another way  
  
Attitude is my addiction  
I live life with no regret  
Unlike you its my affliction  
That creates the template of all that I am  
  
You know and I know  
No matter what you say  
Youll be beaten today  
Like every other day  
  
Something about you  
Keeps you from letting go  
Of lame obsessions  
Built up inside you  
Forget the guesswork  
Youre starting at the source  
Gazing into my eyes  
Youll see theres no remorse  
Cause this is my war  
All day and every day  
Its all about the conflict  
Yeah  
  
Bring on the competition  
Your pessimism only makes me stronger  
I am the culmination  
The fucking standard that all will follow  
  
I live it everyday  
Dont know another way
