Run  
Run for cover  
For for cover  
Dont shoot

Shes so dangerous  
Shotgun  
Gun  
Dont shoot shotgun  
Maybe Im wrong maybe Im right  
Fallin head over heals at the speed of light  
Hey little miss heaven on earth  
Whoa wont you walk this way but I see a red alert  
Oh my senses say keep away  
So dont shoot  
Dont shoot shotgun  
Dream on nightmare  
Touch n go  
Dove turned destroyer she cut you up shes a slave of love  
Run for cover shes so dangerous  
Undercover shes so shameless  
Dont shoot shotgun  
You got me bitin my lip  
Dont shoot shotgun  
Ya shootin straight from the hip  
So dont shoot shotgun  
Shoot me baby

Hit n miss flesh and blood  
Shes sweet and indiscreet she cant get enough  
A little midnight madness  
Oh baby you cant hide  
So wild n unpredictable  
Step aside  
cause youre youre shooting wide  
Run for cover shes so dangerous  
Undercover shes so shameless  
Dont shoot shotgun  
You got me bitin my lip  
Dont shoot shotgun  
Ya shootin straight from the hip  
Oh  
Shake it shake it

You got me bitin my lip  
Dont shoot shotgun  
Ya shootin straight from the hip

Oh shoot it
