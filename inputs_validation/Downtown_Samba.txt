This ones called  
Now for you  
Downtown samba  
  
Canal Streets where we dance  
We do the rhumba samba  
The citys hot were almost naked  
Its a scandal  
Nights still young  
We do the samba with the congo warrior  
  
Downtown samba  
Downtown samba  
  
Hey you over there  
You shouldnt dance alone  
Watch me come on closer  
Cause I am the one  
To dance with you  
All night long  
Im dancing like a mambo  
Go go go for sambo  
Dancing dancing dancing  
Tango  
Over there mister  
Come see youll see  
So dance the tango tango
