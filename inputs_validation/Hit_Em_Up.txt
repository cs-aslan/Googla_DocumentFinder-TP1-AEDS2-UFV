I tried to talk to him  
Quit talkin Im a hang ya by your tongue yea  
Any motormouth could get hung high  
We dont fuck wit niggas like fungi  
We dont even hear ya  
Hollerin bullshit nigga quit the diarrhea  
Pistol lie inside of the armrest um yes  
Lay a nigga down in his own mess dont mess  
Playa fuck around wit the homeless charmless  
You can leave out here armless no homies  
Honest you niggas is harmless  
Im calm as a Don is supposed to be  
Costa Nostra dont ever approach him  
Dont get close to him  
Shootouts and nothin but rock n roll to him  
Leave your blood on the dash call it rosewood  
Nother murder nother page out the notebook  
It aint nothin it dont make it if you no good  
I tried to talk to him but then a nigga had to  
  
Chorus  
Hit em up  
Hit em up  
I aint even wanna hit em up really  
I was tryna be calm  
But uh that chopper rocked  
put his head in his arms  
And man  
I tried to talk to him  
I tried to talk to him  
Hit em up  
Hit em up  
I aint even wanna hit em up  
fuck it make a nigga get loose  
He had too much talk not enough proof  
I tried to talk to him  
I tried to talk to him  
Hit em up  
Hit em up  
I aint even wanna hit em up hit em up  
I aint even wanna hit em  
but I hit em up  
I tried to talk to him  
I tried to talk to him  
  
Yall take them shoes off your teeth  
Stop runnin your mouth  
No shoes no feet Ill run in your mouth  
Ill come to your house me and my goons  
Loadin up bangers ridin under the moon  
Throwin up fingers sayin My side rule  
If a nigga disagree thats when my side prove  
That Maybach coupe a cockeyed fool  
And Im in it like Bennett hoe arent I cool  
But if that thermostat switch and that needle move  
Then the attitude switch and the heatll move  
I got that Shakita banana clip for the tool  
Meet a disaster pity the fool eat a catastrophe  
Swallow the truth belch reality  
How does it taste powder your face  
you a bitch nigga  
All pussy stop cummin out your lips nigga  
I tried to talk him but then a nigga had to  
  
Chorus  
  
Real talk boy chill wit the talk boy  
That Tommy Gunll tear your neighborhood apart boy  
Yeah leave your feelings in your heart boy  
Start with the wrong boy it end wit a song boy  
Wit your friends to carry you alone  
To a concrete mattress and a fluffy tombstone  
Fuck discussion I aint in to it boy  
I just get to it lets do it rip through a boy  
Big Uzi tissue the boy  
Im inside lookin out you just an intruder boy  
You need sutures on your smooches boy  
But I tried to talk to him but then a nigga had to  
  
Chorus
