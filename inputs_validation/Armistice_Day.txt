On Armistice Day  
The Philharmonic will play  
But the songs that we sing  
Will be sad  
Shufflin brown tunes  
Hanging around  
  
No long drawn blown out excuses  
Were made  
When I needed a friend she was there  
Just like an easy chair  
  
Armistice Day  
Armistice Day  
Thats all I really wanted to say  
  
Oh Im weary from waiting  
In Washington DC  
Im coming to see my Congressman  
But hes avoiding me  
Weary from waiting down in Washington DC  
  
Oh Congresswoman  
Wont you tell that Congressman  
Ive waited such a long time  
Ive about waited all I can  
Oh Congresswoman  
Wont you tell that Congressman
