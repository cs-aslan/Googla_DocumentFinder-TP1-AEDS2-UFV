Cryin cryin  
Cryin drunk  
Walker lives on the island  
Im still stuck in the south  
Walker lives off his hands now  
I still live off my mouth  
The only difference is youve got integrity I dont  
Only difference is Ill do a lot of things you wont  
Youd like to think Im sleeping very peacefully Im not  
Im cryin drunk Im cryin drunk Im cryin  
Walker says youre a Cancer  
I just think youre a flu  
Oh but then again Im a Virgo  
Im no match for you  
Yeah the only difference is that I pretend that its alright  
So cut up pretendin I can make it through the night  
Youd like to think Im sleeping very peacefully Im not  
Im cryin drunk Im cryin drunk  
Im cryin Im cryin Im cryin Im cryin drunk  
The only difference is youve got integrity I dont  
Only difference is Ill do a lot of things you wont  
Youd like to think Im sleeping very peacefully Im not  
Im cryin drunk Im cryin drunk Im cryin drunk  
Im cryin
