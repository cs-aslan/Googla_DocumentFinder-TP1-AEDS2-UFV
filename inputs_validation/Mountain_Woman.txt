They lived together in a dirty old shack  
At the edge of the black rocky mountain  
And they drank mountain dew and they lived on the food  
That they grew at the side of the mountain  
  
Shes a mountain woman hes her mountain man  
They lived all their lives by the valley  
Shes a mountain woman hes her mountain man  
Uneducated but theyre happy  
  
Mountain woman couldnt read nor write  
But she knew good from evil she knew wrong from right  
When the government tried to buy her water rights  
Her intuition was her only guide  
  
Shes a mountain woman hes her mountain man  
Lived all their lives by the valley  
Shes a mountain woman hes her mountain man  
Uneducated but theyre happy  
Spend my life with my mountain woman  
Were uneducated by were happy  
  
The civil servant used compulsory purchase  
To acquire the valley for the nation  
Theyll dig up the land theyre gonna make a dam  
And build a hydroelectric power station  
  
And now she lives on the thirty third floor  
Of a man made concrete mountain  
She got an elevator and refrigerator  
And an automobile to run around in  
  
Fast talkin lawyers from the government  
Went and beat proud mountain woman down  
Hey mountain woman take your mountain man  
They took your land and flood your valley  
  
Spend my life with my mountain woman  
Theyre uneducated by theyre happy
