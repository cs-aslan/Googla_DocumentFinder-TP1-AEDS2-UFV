Chorus  
Now I know the only compass that I need  
Oh is the one that leads back to you  
Now I know the only compass that I need  
Is the one that leads back to you  
  
She had cat eyes nine lives no tan lines thigh highs  
She ride me like a drive by Im real these niggas SciFi  
But thats neither here nor there  
She been contemplating short hair  
She said she tryna be different  
But she just like the rest of these bitches  
But thats neither here nor there  
And my dick is her chair  
It be sexual warfare I be loaded like software  
Got so many hoes Im hoin but she the only one worth knowin  
And yeah I do my dirt but thats for the flowers to grow in  
I aint trippin but she be trippin  
They aint got shit on me but she keep sniffin  
Look girl just gimmie that brain and Ill return the favor  
Them hoes say Imma dog but how come I dont chase em  
I lick her with no chaser I pick her out a line up  
I just wanted some time she say okay Im ya honor  
But she been wantin to break up since dolce and gabbana  
All that ass I just be like come sit yo groceries on my counter  
I drink tea she drink wine call it tijuana  
I dyin to meet a girl but she want me to meet her momma  
Swear I may go Issey Miyake Bond no 9  
The weed in funky but Im smelling fine  
Tunechi  
  
Chorus  
  
I got that shit in my system  
Somebody gon be my victim  
Eh so where you at wit it  
Cause I cant do it by myself I need an assistant  
I got that good good that get right  
That early morning that midnight  
I beat it up like a fist fight  
One two three four five six nights  
That dick all in yo windpipe  
Some of her friends I dislike  
Some of yo friends they alright  
Sometimes I think yall all dykes  
But fuck all that Im on one  
Dont wanna be with the wrong one  
That cold head that warm tongue  
My third leg run marathons  
I feel you like Im blind girl  
Cant you see its meant to be  
So come to me then come for me  
My game cold one degree  
Im rollin with two bad bitches cuz misery loves company  
One sweet one sour my honeybee and my bumblebee  
I miss you in the worst way ride that dick no speed bumps  
No redlights no stop lights just get to Lil Tunechi  
  
Chorus  
  
Should I call somebody else  
Cause girl its almost twelve and this dick wont suck itself  
Girl you know it need some help itll make a niggas day  
If you said you on your way yeah  
Should I call somebody else  
Cause girl its almost twelve and this dick wont suck itself  
Girl you know it need some help it make a niggas day  
I just hope you know the way  
And she said
