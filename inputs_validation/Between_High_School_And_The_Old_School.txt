Hey Hey  
Hey Hey  
I guess Im a loner and I dont fit in No  
I aint too comfortable in my skin oh  
An I dont play well with the others  
  
Im stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I cant decide between my rules and your rules  
  
Hey Hey  
Hey Hey  
Nobody wants me hanging round  
Unless its from a tree in the middle of town  
And Im out of step with the others  
  
Im stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I cant decide between my rules and your rules  
Im stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
So I defy maybe all rules maybe no rules  
  
My clothes dont make me  
My hair aint cut right  
And I dont care much  
No I dont care at all  
  
I guess my brain is out of synch I think  
  
  
Im stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I cant decide between my rules and your rules  
Im stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I cant decide I just cant decide  
  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Aw
