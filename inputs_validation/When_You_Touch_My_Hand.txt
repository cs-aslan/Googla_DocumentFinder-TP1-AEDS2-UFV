Lyricsbosson music bosson  
Youre close to me still so far away  
Wanna take my hand but somethings in the way  
Sometimes I get the feeling that you dont care  
I know youve got it tough but its just not fair  
What about meyou see  
Chorus  
When you touch my hand  
I wanna fly to wonderland with you  
When you look at me  
With the cutest smile man can see your dignity  
The show goes on I am used to the scene  
Its the same old song love can be so mean  
Honey stop playing the silly game  
I know youve got another but hell never be  
What Ill befor you  
Chorus  
Come on baby why cant you see  
We could run this thing together just you and me  
I beg you please Im down on my knees  
One day you will understand how much  
You mean to me  
Chorus
