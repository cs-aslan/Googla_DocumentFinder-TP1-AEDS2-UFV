Yeahhh  
Hello  
Here I am  
Here we arewe are one  
Ive been waiting for this night to come  
Get up  
Now its time for me to take my place  
The makeup runnin down my face  
Were exiled from the human race  
  
Youre in the psy  
Youre in the psycho circus  
Youre in the psy

I say welcome to the show  
  
Ive been waiting here to be your guide  
So come  
Reveal the secrets that you keep inside  
Step up  
No one leaves til the night is done  
The amplifier starts to hum  
The carnival has just begun  
  
Youre in the psy  
Youre in the psycho circus
