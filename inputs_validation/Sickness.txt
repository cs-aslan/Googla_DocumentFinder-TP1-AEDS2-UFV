Hey little girl  
Youre black and blue  
Hey little girl  
Youre six foot two  
I know a man who loved too hard  
He lost his mind it wasnt hard  
  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
This sickness of love  
  
Cute little knees that you got  
Out in the dark parking lot  
Cute little voice whispering  
I know a man lost everything  
  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
  
This sickness of love  
This sickness is hauntin me  
Till I cannot see  
This sickness is what I am  
I greet it like a friend  
Amen  
  
Hey little girl  
Im almost trough  
Hey little girl  
Im almost you  
Hey little girl  
The river runs  
Hey little girl  
The rising sun  
  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
This sickness of love  
  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
This sickness of love
