Leave My Business P Tosh Honorary Citizen album  
Wake up one morning and dont have no tea  
Me no want no one come sorry for me  
Thats nobodys business but my own  
The other day comes and it happens the same  
Dont think that Im going to feel ashamed  
Thats nobodys business but my own  
So you better leave my business leave my business  
Leave my business and mind your own  
If I get high and fly like bird  
You should never say a word  
Thats nobodys business but my own  
And if you drink rum and tumble down  
You alone go and have your fun  
Thats nobodys business but your own  
When landlord come collecting rent  
Me not come beg you fifty cent  
Thats nobodys business but my own  
And if he says that Im to move  
That wont stop me from improve  
Thats nobodys business but my own  
Leave my business leave my business  
Leave my business and mind your own
