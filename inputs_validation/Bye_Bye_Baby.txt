Well everythin I do is wrong everythin I say is wrong  
My baby tellin me so long what am I gonna do  
Cause theres just no more dreams to dream no more tears to cry  
Nothin left to say but a baby a baby bye bye  
Oh I once was your sweetheart now you found a new sweetheart  
I hate to see you break my heart what am I gonna do  
Cause theres just no more dreams  
 guitar   
Yeah oh I have got to get by ah itll be hard but Ill try  
Im a gonna love you till I die here I am walkin alone  
Cause theres just no more dreams  
Oh baby a baby bye bye yeah oh baby a baby bye bye oh baby a baby bye bye
