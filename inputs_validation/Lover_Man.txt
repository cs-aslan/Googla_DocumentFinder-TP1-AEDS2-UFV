I dont know why  
But Im feeling so sad  
I long to try  
Something I never had  
Never had no kissing  
Ooh what Ive been missing  
Lover man oh where can you be  
The night is cold  
And Im so all alone  
Ill give my soul  
Just to call you my own  
Hugging and kissing  
Ooh what weve been missing  
Lover man oh where can you be  
Ive heard it say  
That the thrill of romance  
Can be like a heavenly dream  
I go to bed with the prayer  
That youll make love to me  
Strange as it seems  
Someday well meet  
And youll dry all my tears  
Then whisper sweet little things in my ears  
Hugging and kissing  
Ooh what weve been missing  
Lover man oh where can you be  
Ive heard it say  
That the thrill of romance  
Can be like a heavenly dream  
I go to bed with the prayer  
That youll make love to me  
Strange as it seems  
Someday well meet  
And youll dry all my tears  
Then whisper sweet little things in my ears  
Hugging and kissing  
Ooh what weve been missing  
Lover man oh where can you be
