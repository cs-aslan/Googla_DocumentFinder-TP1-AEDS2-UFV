Outta touch most the time  
Gotta lotta things on my mind  
Kickin down where to start  
Its the hardest thing  
Oh  
Grow it long shave it off  
Life is hard never soft  
I need a change I need it quick  
Before it makes me sick  
Thats whats on my mind  
Pay attention watch your back  
Pay your dues stay on track  
Got no room to secondguess  
Puts me under stress  
Oh  
If I were you you were me  
I wonder who Id want to be  
With just one wish you cant refuse  
I wouldnt know what to choose  
Feelinno dont like what Ive been  
Told Im feelin  
Feelin what no one else will ever  
Know Im feelin  
Oh  
Now black is white and white is  
Black  
Got politicians smokin crack  
And John Pauls all bulletproofed  
It puts me through the roof  
Yea  
I were you and you were me  
I wonder who Id rather be  
If I had one wish Id take it  
Feelinoh I dont like what Ive been  
Told Im feelin  
And Im seein  
What no one else will ever know Im  
Seein  
Come on feelin  
Hey I dont understand these things  
Im feelin

Outta touch most all the time  
Too many things on my mind  
Shuttin down gotta stop this thing  
Feelinno I dont like what Ive been  
Told Im feelin

Ever know Im bleeding  
DealinIm dealin with these things

Dreamin things that show me what
