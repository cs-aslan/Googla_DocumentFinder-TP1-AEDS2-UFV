Three in the morning and I gotta be someplace  
I dont remember where  
friends try to make me stay or call me a cab home  
I grab my keys and a beer  
  
Cops they took my license away  
got my car out of impound today  
Ive been drunk since last Saturday  
better stay out of my way  
  
I drink and drive  
Feel so alive  
Never take that dive  
Feel so alive  
Doing 95  
I drink and drive  
Feel so alive  
I drink and drive  
  
Early in the morning and the freeways deserted like its all mine  
Im trying to set a new drunken speed record  
but I cant drive a straight line  
Flashing lights split the night  
Im tossing bottles as I swerve to the right  
now Ive slammed my face into the back of a big rig  
At least youll never get me you fucking pigs  
Designate someone other than me  
Im so drunk I can hardly see  
Another shot of Jager and I turn the key  
I got so many places to be  
  
When Im on a binge my friends all cringe  
They wont drive at night  
Cause way down on the freeway its such a fright  
But I think I drive alright
