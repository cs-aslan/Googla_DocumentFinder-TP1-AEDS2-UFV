Yeah  
Its nothing new  
Cause this is exactly what I do  
What up E haha  
The good weeds lit on this one yeah  
Riding by myself  
  
The world turning the weed burning  
Them haters talking I keep earning  
Know some will say that lifes a bitch  
Well Ima flirtin and fuck that bitch for the money and Louie V purchases  
Old folks jock my car cause they know just what this is  
Niggas felxin hard with no bars they got weak servants  
Keep verses Mortal Kombat  
Look at my ring if I aint ballin bitch then what you call that  
Nothing but net aint back cause I never left  
I did everything right nigga better yet  
Rolling bomb for the niggas thats around us  
Something like a contractor building from the ground up  
Now just oh  
Twist up this weed  
Realize that you are in the presence of a G  
Dont fuck up my paper meaning my cheese  
Or the ones I use to roll up my trees  
Fuck it you know what I mean  
  
Chorus  
Im riding round smoking my music up loud  
Kinda doin my thing no disrespect to the niggas before me  
Some smile up in your face but then they dont on the low  
Now I just stunt on my own  
Now I just stunt on my own  
Im in a race and taking the winners place  
No foot on the brakes  
One the best homie thats what they call me  
Its lonely at the top got no company so  
Now I just stunt on my own  
Now I just stunt on my own  
  
See me when Im alone wishing they could fuck with me  
My ex calling my phone wishing she could stunt with me  
But Im just riding dog doing a buck fifty  
Stunting like Jet Li boat houses and Jet Skis  
Thirty on the flight ice like the Gretskys  
My dime piece only recognize the best trees  
Treat em like I dont need em boy you best believe  
You in her face You in her face  
I let her breath  
  
From debated on to waited on  
From hated on to the nigga they put cake up on  
Cause we are  
Young movie stars  
Cause we are  
Young movie stars  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh ooh oohoohooh  
Ooh ooh oohoohooh  
Ooh ooh oohoohooh  
Ooh ooh oohoohooh  
  
Ohoohoh now I just stunt on my own  
Bitches aint say shit to me  
But now they wont leave me alone  
Used to walk the other way  
But now they all come to my home  
And they calling my phone  
Cause my paper is long  
Heard nothing but they singing my songs  
Get hired up if they want than I bring them along  
We flying up no you wont need a ticket at all  
Need a ticket at all  
Tell em bitch Ima ball and Ima buy a new crib for my niggas n all  
Cause I remember days wed sit and picture it all  
Nigga swear Id leave or pictured Id fall  
Counting reasons why they hate your bitch think Im a star  
Cause we are young gifted  
Not to mention out here making motherfucking millions  
Yeah I said it motherfucking millions  
Got my money up Im in the building  
Yup  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh ooh oohoohooh  
Ooh ooh oohoohooh
