Well I wandered alone  
Through a desert of stone  
And I dreamed of my future wife  
My swords in my hand  
And Im next in command  
In this version of Death called Life  
My plate and my cup  
Are right straight up  
I took a rose from the hand of a child  
When I kiss your lips  
The honey drips  
Im gonna have to put you down for a while  
  
Every day we meet  
On any old street  
And youre in your girlish prime  
The short and the tall  
Are coming to the ball  
I go there all the time  
Behind every tree  
Theres something to see  
The river is wider than a mile  
I tried you twice  
You cant be nice  
Im gonna have to put you down for a while  
  
Here come the nurse  
With money in her purse  
Here come the ladies and men  
You push it all in  
And youve no chance to win  
You play em on down to the end  
Im laying in the sand  
Getting a sunshine tan  
Moving along riding in style  
From my toes to my head  
You knock me dead  
Im gonna have to put you down for a while  
  
I count the years  
And I shed no tears  
Im blinded to what might have been  
Natures voice  
Makes my heart rejoice  
Play me the wild song of the wind  
I found hopeless love  
In the room above  
When the sun and the weather were riled  
Youre as fine as wine  
I aint handing you no line  
Im gonna have to put you down for a while  
  
All the merry little elves  
Can go hang themselves  
My faith is as cold as can be  
Im stacked high to the roof  
And Im not without proof  
If you dont believe me come see  
You think Im blue  
I think so too  
In my words youll find no guile  
The games gotten old  
The decks gone cold  
And Im gonna have to put you down for a while  
  
The games gotten old  
The decks gone cold  
And Im gonna have to put you down for a while
