I remember when you were born  
I felt like one lucky  
Son of a gun  
  
And when you turned into two  
I was so happy  
When you said I love you  
  
Held you in my arms so tight  
Id never forget  
The best years of my life  
  
Chorus  
Apple of your daddys eye  
want to be the one to hold you in the night  
Apple of your daddys eye  
Oh oh sleep tight  
Dont you worry gonna be alright  
  
I remember when you were three  
You were so lovely  
So very pretty  
  
And when you turned into four  
I finally realized  
What God put her here for  
  
Chorus  
  
If I had my way  
Time would stand still  
Youd stay as sweet as you are  
But time waits for no one  
It never will  
Your gonna leave me soon enough  
Im just sad cause youre growing up  
  
Held you in my arms so tight  
Id never forget  
The best years of my life  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont stop ever lovin me because  
Youre the apple of your daddys eye
