Verse  
Whatever you dont know  
Baby I will teach you  
Anywhere you go  
Know my love can reach you  
Not a wall too high  
Or a mountainside  
Could keep me from seeing you  
  
Verse  
Whenever youre too tired  
I could give you power  
Go the extra mile  
In your darkest hour  
Any day or night  
Call my name and I  
Ill come running to be with you  
  
Verse  
And Ill be fierce as a tiger  
If anyone tries to fight ya  
But Ill be soft as a lamb  
When youre in my hands  
I can bend  
However I need to  
  
Chorus  
Thats what I call love  
Thats what I call love  
My fears and my flaws  
You stand through it all  
Thats what I call love  
  
Verse  
I will understand  
When you need space  
I will hold your hand  
When youre in pain  
Ill be patient and pause  
Most relationships  
Require a give and take  
  
Verse  
And I will never let my ego  
Nor the words of other people  
Get in the way  
Or stop from saying  
How much I care and I need you  
  
Chorus  
Thats what I call love  
Thats what I call love  
My fears and my flaws  
You stand through it all  
Thats what I call love  
  
Bridge  
For better or for worse  
Thats what I call love Baby  
Its more than just a word  
Let me show you my love Baby  
  
Chorus 2  
Thats what I call love  
Thats what I call love  
My fears and my flaws  
You stand through it all  
Thats what I call love  
  
Thats what I call love  
Thats what I call love  
Thats what I call love  
Thats what I call love  
Thats what I call love  
Thats what I call love
