And I finally see the light again  
The light of my return  
After too much time in darkness  
Ive had enough of being underground  
By now its all over  
Forgotten from memory  
And from the heart of the living  
My sepulchre has become decrepit  
Decaying as my mortal remains  
They are corroded by time  
By vice and by worms  
So many years now have passed  
From the last time  
That someone cried  
Or even prayed for me  
Oooh zombie what do you want from us  
Oooh zombie why have you come back to life  
Men dont care about their dead  
Dont know that they come back  
Come back to kill them  
Dont believe that its all over  
At the moment of burial  
There is something more important  
That pushes us to come back  
The living cry the dead but the dead kill the living  
That is the greatest day for me  
The day of resurrection  
I dont know who I was  
I dont remember my ancient name  
But now I feel a new reason  
I have no fear to kill  
Oooh zombie what do you want from us  
Oooh zombie is this real life
