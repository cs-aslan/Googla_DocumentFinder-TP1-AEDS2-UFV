I intrude on patience  
I intrude on young hearts  
I intrude on all such things  
That can take you by surprise  
Time and time again  
So  
  
Ive no welcome for you  
Ive no welcome for talk  
Ive no welcome in my house  
Ive tried too long you know  
Time and time again  
  
Oh look theres a man inside  
The heads not the museum its supposed to be  
We sleep with machines that breathe  
And some even have names the executive dream  
  
Were all so sincere  
Ill sing a song from the film that broke your heart  
Oh look at the smile that cracks  
Tomorrow well be civilized  
And buy the whole world clothes  
  
We dont believe in you  
Were specialized mechanics in repairing the bitch  
You bounce around my head  
You say its a little but Im sure its ok
