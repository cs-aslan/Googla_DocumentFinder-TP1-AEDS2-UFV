Hey come inside  
While I stand here acting bored  
Yes I feel this way  
Clear out the cobwebs in my soul  
  
Chorus  
This time I turn around  
Things have changed  
Now I dont feel the same yeah  
Start a fight kick a fit  
One more time  
Dammit I changed again  
  
Now I dont see things  
The way I did before  
Things I feel today  
Just dont matter anymore  
It doesnt make any sense  
To feel so different everyday  
Yes I feel this way  
When nothings changed except for  
  
Next time I  
  
Chorus  
  
Next time I turn around  
Things have changed  
Now I dont feel the same yeah  
Start a fight kick a fit  
One more time  
Dammit I changed again  
  
Chorus  
  
I see it
