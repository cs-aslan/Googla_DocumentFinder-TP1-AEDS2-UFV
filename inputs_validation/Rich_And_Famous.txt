Of the insane clown posse

First mancow put us on the air  
And everybody jumped on our wagons right there  
Mancows been down with the clown  
Since kurt cobains head was still around  
I wont forget how i made my bread  
Cause i remember we was like john denver hehedead  
Back then i thought i was the bomb  
I couldnt even sell a tape to my own mom  
I was broke dinner was grain and rye  
Now i sit with chilled faygo in a phat ride  
And at shows i sold out nightly  
On top of that i think erma likes me

So bitch get used to my ugly face cmon

Mancow made us rich and famous

Now look at us platinum status  
We owe it all to mancow
