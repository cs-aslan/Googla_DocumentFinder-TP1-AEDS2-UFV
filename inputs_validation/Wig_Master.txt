You said Ill build you a bed of cactus where you could sleep when the night
is too sharp  
I said Ill cover you with wax and light your hair like a wick when the
night is too cold  
You dont think of me as often as Id like you to  
But when you do its of me looking for you on the ship  
The plane Im waiting on has your face printed on the wings  
When it crashes Ill eat the paint off  
Im going to spank your ass so hard youll hate the wig master  
But Ill put two pillows on your dining room chair  
Youre like a parrot something that belongs to me and not to you  
Loneliness isnt being alone its when someone loves you and you dont have
it in you to love them back  
Look at my hair its a dirty little mop crying for you to send it away  
All a guy needs is a chance to pull off my clothes and snicker try harder  
If you mail me a toy Ill use it but thats the most I have to offer  
Do you want to see my panties is the last thing Ill ever say to you  
I want to finger every teenager I see is the last thing youll say to me  
Dont make fun of my night out
