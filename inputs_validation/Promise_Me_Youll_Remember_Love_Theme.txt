Promise me youll remember  
This love together today  
We may not have tomorrow  
Its not for us to say  
Fate isnt kind to lovers  
It breaks the hardest hearts  
Promise youll remember  
How good we are  
  
Why do I find the sadness  
Under your sweetest kiss  
Destiny seems to whisper  
It wont stay like this  
  
Whenever were together  
I feel time standing still  
I only know I love you  
And I always will  
If we should lose each other  
Somewhere inside the dark  
Promise me youll remember  
How good we are  
  
Whenever were together  
I feel time standing still  
I only know I love you  
And I always will  
If we should lose each other  
Somewhere inside the dark  
Promise me youll remember  
How good we are  
  
Time isnt kind to lovers  
It breaks the hardest hearts  
Promise me youll remember  
How good we are
