I feel thats somethings right  
You dont like holding me tight  
Whats wrong with me  
I dont know  
Maybe its time I should go  
  
But just as I get to the door  
You look at me and say no  
Come and be good to me  
Come and make love to me  
Stay Stay  
  
Cause you like to love me  
And just me and nobody else  
And I like to love you  
And just you and nobody else  
  
We should get out more I know  
But were just too lazy to go  
Whats outside thats not in here  
Nothings so good thats so near
