Oh it feels like it was yesterday  
When you came into my life  
And took my heart away  
Now I find myself looking back  
And Im realizing how  
You turned me inside out  
And left with no doubt  
  
Oh youre the only one  
The love I feel  
And youre the only one  
It seems unreal  
  
Now I see what its all about  
No more chasin my own tail  
Theres nothing left to fear  
As long as you are here  
  
Oh youre the only one  
The love I feel  
And youre the only one  
It seems unreal  
  
Oh youre the only one I know  
The love I feel  
And youre the only one  
It seems unreal  
  
I cant explain the way I feel  
Ive waited so long  
For someone like you
