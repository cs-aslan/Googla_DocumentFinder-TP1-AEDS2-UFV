Feelin good today

A beautiful day in the neighborhood  
Cant go wrong I feel strong and the flavors good

Latifahs on vacation Im just plain on day to day  
I strap out step out in every direction  
Glock techs jimmy hats in case I need protection  
So I land cruise play I want to bes  
A kid in the increase gettin jack right in front of me  
So I pull the tech close my fingers on the trigger  
Dont want to get wet so they step  
Cause mines is slighty bigger  
But better yet Ima threat so ya better walk  
Or get sketched out in chalk cause I dont want to talk

Verse 2  
Time to chill hit the hill uptown lets keep it sights  
Shoot some pool act a fool cause its own tonight  
Im doin the knowledge its not easy easy  
Watchin a cop cuff a kid for sellin a clip to a DT  
But its home so I flex get pressures off my chest  
Slip in a tape now which hood should I hit next  
Stomach ache had a steak and take for a bean pie  
Get a final call for the brother in a bowtie  
Im from little kids dream and fiend for fun  
Lots of laughter moms no pops playin wit her son  
I pass by a girl wake they say she died at seven  
Hit by a stray but I pray theirs a hood in heaven  
Fake brothers claim theirs no shame in theyre game  
You know my name show me a real nigga wit a brain  
Too its back to the block time to play  
Its just another day around the way hey  
Chorus 1x  
Verse 3  
You know I gotta get props I cant stop wit out yall  
I be nothin no wreckin no checkin no rhymin no cuttin  
No stages from pages no phones no beepers  
No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah  
I come with the real like respectin in rule  
Cause me and my peoples around the way remain cool  
So its back to the block time to play  
Its just another day around the wha around the muthafuckin way  
Chorus until fade
