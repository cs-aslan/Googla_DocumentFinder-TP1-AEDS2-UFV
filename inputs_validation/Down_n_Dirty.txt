Slow talkin the line youre walkin  
Look like a viper wearin silkin stockings  
You make em guess theyd be gettin the best  
Cant help but wonder if youd pass the test  
Kissin my fingers you touch my face  
n play your hand like youre holdin the ace  
But Baby when it comes around are you gonna pick it up or lay it down  
You make it harder and harder to stop what youve started  
Chorus  
Down n dirty  
Oh my little Rosalee dont you think its goin on time we see  
If youre gonna come with me I bet you I get you  
Ive had enough of this comin on stuff  
I feel like gettin down on somethin tough  
I do believe youre what youre tryin to be  
Now show me honey cause Im dying to see  
Take it baby make your play well make love in different ways  
I call your bluff and stand pretty mama hold me in your hand  
And make it harder and harder to stop what youve started  
Chorus  
Instrumental  
Kissin my fingers you touch my face  
n play your hand like youre holdin the ace  
Baby when it comes around are you gonna pick it up or lay it down  
You make it harder and harder to stop what youve started  
Chorus  
Rosalee dont you think its goin on time we see  
If youre gonna come with me Im dirty down n dirty
