I was sittin with my friend when I saw you walkin in and my heart started
skippin a beat  
I was tryna play it cool but I knew it was true that nobody would ever compete  
Well first comes love and then comes  
First date first kiss we were checkin off the list then you were gettin
down on one knee  
And you didnt have to guess it was always a yes now theres two less fish
in the sea  
  
Lets set the date  
Lets haul the band  
Lets cut the cake  
Tie up the cans  
I love the ring of your name your the ying to my yang  
Oh baby lets give it a shot  
Woo  
Every wall needs a frame every ball needs a chain yeah Im talkin bout
tiein a knot  
Tie it up  
  
Somethin old somethin new somethin borrowed somethin blue  
And the chairs lined up in the yard  
The I dos and the kisses from a miss to a misses  
Cant wait for forever to stop

Cause I think this will be tonight yeah  
  
Well mamas kickin off her shoes and daddys spinnin from the booze and the
last song is finally sung  
We can run to the moon cant stop a hunny moon  
Dont it sound like a lot of fun
