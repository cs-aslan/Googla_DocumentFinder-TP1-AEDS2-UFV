Seasons may change passions may fade  
But one thing remains  
Fashions they pass here for a day  
But one thing remains  
  
Ill always love  
Ill always love  
Ill always love Your name  
  
Troubles may come hardship and pain  
But one thing remains  
And when I am weak when I am frail  
One thing remains  
  
Ill always love  
Ill always love  
Ill always love Your name  
Youll always be  
Youll always be  
Youll always be my praise  
  
Just as the sun will rise up everyday  
And as the dawn will always find a way  
And oceans never cease to bear their waves  
Ill always find a way to bring You praise  
Always Jesus Always Always
