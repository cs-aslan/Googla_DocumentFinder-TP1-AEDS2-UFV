The radio plays the sounds we made  
And everything seems to feel just right  
Coming through your lonely mind  
Well Ive seen things  
That scarred and bruised and left me blind  
So come on listen along with me  
I think you need a little company  
  
And how long will I run for  
Who am I running from  
  
And it makes sense  
The youth coming up and making you dance  
Cause Ive got some living inside of me  
So come on I could use the company  
  
And how long will I run for  
Who am I running from  
But now Ive seen my face in a cardboard wall  
Nobody comes nobody calls  
  
How long will I run for  
Who am I running from  
Teenage tears sting my eyeballs  
In a town where I wasnt born  
And I will never suffer  
So come on come on come on  
But now I see my face in a cardboard wall  
Nobody comes nobody calls  
  
If youre looking for me  
Im there and its you  
If youre looking for me out there its true  
If youre looking for  
Ill be looking for you  
If youre looking for me  
Then Im looking for you  
If youre looking for me  
Then Im looking for you  
If youre looking for me  
Then Im looking for you
