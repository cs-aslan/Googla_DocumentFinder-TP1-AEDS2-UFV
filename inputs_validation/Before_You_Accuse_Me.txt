Chorus  
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself  
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself  
You say Ive been spending my money on other women  
Youve been taking money from someone else  
  
I called your mama bout three or four nights ago  
I called your mama bout three or four nights ago  
Well your mother said Son  
Dont call my daughter no more  
  
Chorus  
  
Come back home baby try my love one more time  
Come back home baby try my love one more time  
If I dont go on and quit you  
Im gonna lose my mind  
  
Chorus
