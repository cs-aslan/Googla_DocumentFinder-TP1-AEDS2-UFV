Cant nobody love you like i do  
Not now no not ever  
There aint no doubt i know this thing  
We have could last forever  
  
Others may promise the stars in the sky  
But sooner or later youll find  
Cant nobody love you like i do  
  
Cant nobody hold you quite this close  
All night like i want too  
Baby put your sweet lips here on mine  
Youll see cause im gonna show you  
  
Just how an angel like you should be loved  
I cant feel you enough  
Cant nobody love you like i do  
Cant nobody love you like i do  
  
Who knows when its meant to be  
Well love knows and it sent you to me  
  
You dont know how i live for the day  
You look at me and you say  
Cant nobody love you like i do  
Cant nobody love you like i do  
Cant nobody love you like i do
