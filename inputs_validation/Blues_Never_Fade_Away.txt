He wasnt famous but I sure did love him  
Ive got his picture in a little frame  
He lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name  
But theres so many more and Ive lost count  
The hows and whys arent important now  
All that matters is they came around  
And brightened up our lives  
  
She was twenty one with her life ahead  
You dont need to know her name  
She breathed her last on the cold stone floor of a Hollywood arcade  
But fates right hand isnt always just  
Puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust  
She was just a little girl aint that enough  
To rage against the day  
  
Chorus  
And how did we get so lucky  
Targets on the rifle range  
Who makes the call and who gets to choose  
Who gets to win and who gets to lose  
Its like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues  
And blues never fade away  
Hey hey hey the colors run when the rain falls  
But blues never fade away  
  
He shone so bright with a lust for life  
Like the Sun King that he was  
His passions hung upon his walls and were printed onto cloth  
And for reasons I never understood  
About the choices made between the bad and good  
Ive tried to figure out but  
The pain never goes away  
  
Chorus  
  
And theres marble markers and little white crosses  
Along the beaten path  
And Ive spread their ashes on the wind  
And I miss John Lennons laugh  
  
Chorus  
  
And how did we get so lucky  
Targets on the rifle range  
Who makes the call and who gets to choose  
Who gets to win and who gets to lose  
  
Its like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues  
And blues never fade away  
Hey hey hey all the colors run when the rain falls  
And blues never fade away
