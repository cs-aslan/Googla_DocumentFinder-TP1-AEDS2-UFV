Is it a mean streak youd swear youd swear  
We never seen a stranger round here  
Is it the way the dust clings to the air  
But youd swear youd swear  
Is it a mean streak a desolation sound  
A copy of desire oh nothings that far down  
A mean streak on a western swing  
On TV saying the damnedest thing  
Mean streak youd swear youd swear  
We never seen a stranger round here  
Its the way the dust clings to the air  
After a strangers been there youd swear youd swear  
Is it a mean streak to a certain degree  
They come whistling down the crookedest street  
A mean streak in the ghost state  
Between the certain and the hesitating  
A mean streak youd swear youd swear  
We never seen a stranger round here  
Its the way that dust clings to the air  
After the strangers been here youd swear youd swear  
Was that you there  
That was you there  
Was that you there  
That was you there  
Sssh sssh sound of the bottoms of their boots  
On the tops of the grass  
As their hay wagon rolled past  
And Id swear Id swear  
The way the dust clings to the air  
After the strangers been here  
Id swear Id swear  
That that was you there  
Was that you there  
That was you there  
Id swear Id swear  
Incomprehensible
