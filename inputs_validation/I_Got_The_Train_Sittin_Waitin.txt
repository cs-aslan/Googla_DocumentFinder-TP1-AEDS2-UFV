I took my woman down to the local depot  
From there to anywhere if you want to you can go  
I said now pretty momma Ive had myself enough  
Of your fussing and your fighting and its sure gonna get rough  
  
Chorus  
I got the train sittin waitin  
Leaving right on time  
So if you want to gobetter get aboard  
But you be the one to make up your mind  
  
Ive tried to love you woman every way I know how  
But you keep on a naggin and Ive had it starting now  
If you dont like the way youre living you know what you can do  
Said the trains sitting there its a big black choochoo  
  
I got the train sittin waitin  
Leaving right on time  
So if you want to goget yourself aboard  
But you be the one to make up your mind  
  
Well I looked up at the schedule and it said nine thirteen  
The central is a leaving all the lights are turning green  
The whistle is a blowin heres your ticket and your pass  
The door is open wide so dont let your coat tail drag  
  
Chorus
