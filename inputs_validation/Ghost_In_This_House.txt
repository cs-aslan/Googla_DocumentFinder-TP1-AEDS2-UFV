I dont pick up the mail  
I dont pick up the phone  
I dont answer the door  
I just soon be alone  
I dont keep this place up  
I just keep the lights down  
I dont live in these rooms  
I just rattled around  
  
Im just a ghost in this house  
Im shadow upon these walls  
As quietly as a mouse  
I haunt these halls  
Im just a whisper of smoke  
Im all thats left of two hearts on fire  
That once burned out of control  
You took my body and soul  
Im just a ghost in this house  
  
I dont care if it rains  
I dont care if its clear  
I dont mind stayin near  
Theres another ghost here  
He sits down in your chair  
And he shines with your light  
And he lays down his head  
On your pillow at night  
  
Im just a ghost in this house  
Im just a shadow upon these walls  
Im living proof of the damage heartbreak does  
Im just a whisper of smoke  
Im all thats left of two hearts on fire  
That once burned out of control  
You took my body and soul  
Im just a ghost in this house  
  
That once burned out of control  
You took my body and soul  
Im just a ghost in this house
