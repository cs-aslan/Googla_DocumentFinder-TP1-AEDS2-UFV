Up in Harlem every Saturday night  
Were the highbrows get together just to write  
They all congregate at an all night hack  
What they do is ooh papa dah  
  
Ol Hannah Brown way cross town  
Gets full of corn and starts bringing em down  
And at the break of day  
You can hear ol Hannah say  
  
Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me daddy move right down  
I feel just like I wanna clown  
Give the piano player a drink  
Because hes bringing me down  
  
Hes got rhythm when he stomps his feet  
He moves me right off to sleep  
Check all your razors and your guns  
Were gonna be arrested when the wagon comes  
  
Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me cause I dont care  
  
I want a pigfoot and a bottle of gin  
Send me daddy move right in  
Feel just like I wanna shop  
Give the piano player a drink  
Because hes knocking me out  
  
Hes got rhythm when he stomps his feet  
He moves me right off to sleep  
Check all your razors and your guns  
Were gonna do the huckabuck until the rising sun  
  
Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of gin  
Move me cause I dont care  
I want a pigfoot and a bottle of beer
