Dear Mr President  
I live in the suburbs  
Its a long way from Washington DC  
Had me a job  
Working for wages  
And they forgot about me  
Cant draw unemployment  
For some unknown reason  
My kids are hungry  
Ive got four mouths to feed  
I go out everyday lookin for suitable  
Employment  
Do you think theres something  
You could do for me  
Cause Im  
  
Down and out here in paradise  
Down and out and Im on my knees  
Im down and out here in paradise  
Looks like the milk and honey  
Done run out on me  
  
Dear Mr President  
I used to be a dancer  
Got a little bit too old  
So I became a secretary  
Married as man  
In Las Vegas Nevada  
And ten years later  
He run out on the kids and me  
Some said I was pretty  
But those days are over  
Now Ive no place to live  
And Im out on the streets  
Oh Mr President  
Can I tell you a secret  
I never ever thought that this could  
Happen to me  
Cause Im  
  
Down and out here in paradise  
Down and out and Im on my knees  
Im down and out here in paradise  
Looks like the milk and honey  
Done run out on me

Down and out and Im on my knees

Looks like the milk and honey  
Done run out on me
