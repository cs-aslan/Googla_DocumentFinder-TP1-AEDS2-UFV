I couldnt love you your way  
Yeah and still you came to see me day by day  
But now I miss you all the time  
No heart can be as sad as mine  
Aint nobodys fault but mine  
  
Ah yeah uh  
  
What will lie due tomorrow  
Burden down and suffer with my sorrows  
But crying aint gonna help me knock  
I made a mistake anyhow  
It aint nobodys fault but mine  
  
Oh got to but  
  
One day I got to pay for my mistakes yall  
Its gonna carry me straight to my grave  
Ooh  
I gotta tell you now  
I wanna tell you sumn  
  
Instead of you trying to spend my money  
Yet your favorite word was to call me honey  
But I was just a doggone fool  
Trying to be so doggone cool  
Aint nobodys fault but mine  
  
I thought I didnt oh  
I made a big mistake yall  
I did something wrong too ah  
Nobodys fault but mine  
It aint nobodys fault but mine  
I did the wrong thing to you girl  
Somebody help me now  
I need a little bit of help now
