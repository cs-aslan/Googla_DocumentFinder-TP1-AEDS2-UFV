If I knew what was bothering you  
I would run to your side  
I dont know why  
I would just die if you left me  
  
Cant you see  
What youre doing to me  
Are you playing a game  
Is it always the same  
Am I to blame  
Or is anyone  
  
I dont want to settle down  
With any other girl but you  
So Im just gonna wait around  
Til you decide what youre gonna do  
  
Cant you see  
What youre doing to me  
Are you playing a game  
Its always the same  
Am I to blame  
Or is anyone  
  
I dont want to settle down  
With any other girl but you  
So Im just gonna wait around  
Til you decide what youre gonna do  
  
If I knew what was bothering you  
I would run to your side I dont know why  
I would just die if you left me  
  
Cant you see what youre doing to me  
Are you playin a game Its always the same  
Am I to blame or is anyone  
  
Chorus  
I dont want to settle down with any other girl but you  
So Im just gonna wait around  
Til you decide what youre gonna do do  
  
Cant you see what youre doing to me  
Are you playin a game Its always the same  
Am I to blame or is anyone anyone anyone  
  
Chorus  
Oh
