Well I had just got out from the county prison  
Doin ninety days for nonsupport  
Tried to find me an executive position  
But no matter how smooth I talked  
  
They wouldnt listen to the fact that I was a genius  
The man say We got all that we can use  
Now I got them steadily depressin low down mind messin  
Working at the car wash blues  
  
Well I should be sittin in an air conditioned office in a swivel chair  
Talkin some trash to the secretaries  
Sayin Here now mama come on over here  
Instead Im stuck here rubbin these fenders with a rag  
  
And walkin home in soggy old shoes  
With them steadily depressin low down mind messin  
Workin at the car wash blues  
You know a man of my ability  
  
He should be smokin on a big cigar  
But till I get myself straight I guess Ill just have to wait  
In my rubber suit arubbin these cars  
Well all I can do is a shake my head  
  
You might not believe that its true  
For workin at this end of Niagara Falls  
Is an undiscovered Howard Hughes  
So baby dont expect to see me  
  
With no double martini in any highbrow society news  
Cause I got them steadily depressin low down mind messin  
Workin at the car wash blues  
So baby dont expect to see me  
  
With no double martini in any highbrow society news  
Cause I got them steadily depressin low down mind messin  
Workin at the car wash blues  
Yeah I got them steadily depressin low down mind messin  
Workin at the car wash blues
