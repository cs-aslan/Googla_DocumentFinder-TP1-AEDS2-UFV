I dont want to be reckless  
I dont want to be rude  
I dont want to regret the stupid  
Things I say to you  
I dont want to be angry  
I dont want to be sad  
I dont want to look back on every thing we could have had  
Perfect love  
Perfect man  
Perfect hand to hold onto  
Perfect love  
Perfect man  
Perfect hand to pull me through  
Perfect love  
Perfect man  
Perfect hand to guide me to  
Perfect you  
I want to be lovely  
I want to be cute  
I want to make all of your sex  
Kitten dreams come true  
I would like to be helpful  
I would like to be pure  
I would like you to love me madly  
As Im walking out the door  
Perfect love  
Perfect man  
Perfect hand to hold onto  
Perfect love  
Perfect man  
Perfect hand to pull me through  
Perfect love  
Perfect man  
Perfect hand to guide me to  
Perfect you
