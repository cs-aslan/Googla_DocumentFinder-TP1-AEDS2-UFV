The office door closed early  
The hidden bottle came out  
The salesman turned to close the blinds  
A little slow now a little stout  
  
But hes still heading down those tracks  
Any day now for sure  
Another day as drab as today  
Is more than a man can endure  
  
Dreams flow across the heartland  
Feeding on the fires  
Dreams transport desires  
Drive you when youre down  
Dreams transport the ones  
Who need to get out of town  
  
The boy walks with his best friend  
Through the fields of early May  
They walk awhile in silence  
One close one far away  
But hed be climbing on that bus  
Just him and his guitar  
To blaze across the heavens  
Like a brilliant shooting star  
  
The middleaged Madonna  
Calls her neighbor on the phone  
Day by day the seasons pass  
And leave her life alone  
But shell go walking out that door  
On some bright afternoon  
To go and paint big cities  
From a lonely attic room  
  
Its understood  
By every single person  
Whod be elsewhere if they could  
So far so good  
And lifes not unpleasant  
In their little neighborhood  
  
They dream in Middletown
