If youre lonely  
And need a friend  
And troubles seem like  
They never end  
Just remember to keep the faith  
And love will be there to light the way  
  
Chorus  
Anytime you need a friend  
I will be here  
Youll never be alone again  
So dont you fear  
Even if youre miles away  
Im by your side  
So dont you ever be lonely  
Love will make it alright  
  
When the shadows are closing in  
And your spirit diminishing  
Just remember youre not alone  
And love will be there  
To guide you home  
  
Chorus  
  
If you just believe in me  
I will love you endlessly  
Take my hand  
Take me into your heart  
Ill be there forever baby  
I wont let go  
Ill never let go  
  
Anytime you need a friend  
I will be here  
Youll never be alone again  
So dont you fear  
Even if youre miles away  
Im by your side  
So dont you ever be lonely  
Its alright  
Its alright
