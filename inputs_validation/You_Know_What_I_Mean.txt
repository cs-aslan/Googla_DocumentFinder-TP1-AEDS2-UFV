Just as I thought Id make it  
You walk back into my life  
Just like you never left  
  
Just as Id learned to be lonely  
You call up to tell me  
Youre not sure if youre ready  
But ready or not youll take what youve got and leave  
  
Leave me alone with my heart  
Im putting the pieces back together again  
Just leave leave me alone with my dreams  
I can do without you know what I mean  
  
I wish I could write a love song  
To show you the way I feel  
Seems you dont like to listen  
Oh but like it or not take what youve got and leave  
  
Leave me alone with my heart  
Its broken in two and Im not thinking too straight  
Just leave leave me alone with my dreams  
Youve taken everything else you know what I mean
