The docks Sailors whores and their customers pimps etc Fantine wanders

Sailors  
I smell women  
Smell em in the air  
Think Ill drop my anchor  
In that harbor over there  
Lovely ladies  
Smell em through the smoke  
Seven days at sea  
Can make you hungry for a poke  
Even stokers need a little stoke  
  
Whores  
Lovely ladies  
Waiting for a bite  
Waiting for the customer  
Who only comes at night  
Lovely ladies  
Waiting for the call  
Standing up or lying down  
Or any way at all  
Bargain prices up against the wall

Join your sisters make money in your sleep  
  
Fantine goes off with one of the sailors  
  
Thats right dearie let him have the lot  
Thats right dearie show him what youve got  
  
Old men young men take em as they come  
Harbor rats and alley cats and every type of scum  
Poor men rich men leaders of the land  
See them with their trousers off theyre never quite as grand  
All it takes is money in your hand  
Lovely ladies  
Going for a song  
Got a lot of callers  
But they never stay for long  
  
Fantine  
Come on Captain  
You can wear your shoes  
Dont it make a change  
To have a girl who cant refuse  
Easy money  
Lying on a bed  
Just as well they never see  
The hate thats in your head  
Dont they know theyre making love  
To one already dead
