Shell bleed you dry  
Shell leave you there to die  
Shell cut you with a knife  
Shell carve away your life  
Yeah just like a wildcat  
Shell scratch you with her claws  
And if you try to leave her  
Shell stab you in the back

Creature schooles in a dark desires and evil

Forbidden reason far below the sea  
Salvation shines from your divinity
