I can see me bound and gagged  
Dragged behind the clownmobile  
You can treat me like a dog  
If you make me feel what others feel  
You can train me you can drain me  
If you make me lose control  
I will be your prisoner  
I will be your hostageo  
I will be your prisoner  
I will be your hostageo  
All you have to do is ask  
Ill be happy to say yes  
Ill put on the creepy mask  
If youll grant me some forgetfulness  
You can strain me you can maim me  
You can chain me to the floor  
I will be your prisoner  
I will be your hostageo  
I will be your prisoner  
I will be your hostageo  
And this loneliness  
Unbearable  
And it all goes by so slow  
I will stand in line  
For the sacrifice  
For the shamefaced love  
Of the ugly vice  
I will pay the price to see how far youll go  
Let me be your prisoner  
Let me be your hostageo  
I can see me bound and gagged  
Dragged behind the clownmobile  
You can treat me like a dog  
If you make me feel what others feel  
You can sprain me you can blame me  
If you make me lose control  
I will be your prisoner  
I will be your hostageo  
I will be your prisoner  
I will be your hostageo
