Watchin you move across the floor  
Youre fire up my mind cant take it no more  
Youre a fancy dancer  
Makin me blind so I cant see  
Youre a fancy dancer  
And you aint no good for me  
You know youre comin on strong  
Youre my favorite misery  
You captured my soul  imprisoned my heart  
You know you control whatever you start  
Youre fancy dancer  
And it aint too hard to see  
Youre fancy dancer  
And youll make a fool of me  
I know it wont be for long  
Until you dance a new song  
But just for tonight wont you dance your dance for me  
Im not the first and I wont be the last  
Dont want your future  just make the night last  
Cmon fancy dancer  
Make me blind so I cant see  
Youre a fancy dancer  
And you aint no good for me  
Yeh we both knew from the start  
Youd try do dance with my heart  
But just for tonight wont you dance your dance for me
