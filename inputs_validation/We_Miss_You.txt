Whyd you have to leave in July  
On a peaceful and serene summer night  
I wish that you would have waited until September  
Just a couple more memories to remember  
  
I guess I had to pay you back to your lender  
I guess I had to send you back to The Sender  
But then again maybe youre gone till November  
And maybe this is just a part of the agenda  
  
Whyd you have to go so soon  
We miss you  
  
Why couldnt you come right home  
When you seen the text message in your phone  
I shouldve put my pradas on to come and find you  
I couldve told you that them niggs was behind you  
  
I couldve told you all about my intuition  
I couldve even brought the extra ammunition  
  
But now youve mmmmoved so fuck you  
Shouldve known from day one I couldnt trust you  
  
Whyd you have to go so soon  
We miss you  
  
Why would they take you from me  
Why the doctors could not stop the bleeding  
If you in a better place then you free  
Well then why cant they make me believe it  
  
You said that you would leave these streets  
And I know you didnt mean in a body bag  
But now you see you not bullet proof  
And Im mad cause you the best that I ever had  
  
Whyd you have to go so soon  
We miss you  
  
Ill never love again
