Baby baby dont treat me so bad  
Im the best boy that you ever had  
You want to leave now and find a new start  
Its gonna kill me if you break my heart  
  
Ooh once you let me down again  
Ooh youre just bound to see the end  
  
Baby baby dont treat me this way  
Im gonna make it again someday  
Theres just one thing Id like you to know  
I got no more to lose if you go  
  
Ooh once you let me down again  
Ooh youre just bound to see the end
