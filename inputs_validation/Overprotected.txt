Spoken  
I need time time  
Love  
Joy joy  
I need space  
I need me  
Action  
  
Say hello to the girl that I am  
Youre gonna have to see through my perspective  
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am  
And I dont want to be so damn protected  
  
There must be another way  
Cause I believe in taking chances  
But who am I to say  
What a girl is to do  
God I need some answers  
  
What am I to do with my life  
You will find out dont worry  
How Am I supposed to know whats right  
  
You just got to do it your way  
I cant help the way I feel  
But my life has been so overprotected  
  
I tell em what I like  
What I want  
And what I dont  
But every time I do I stand corrected  
  
Things that Ive been told  
I cant believe what I hear about the world I realize  
Im Overprotected  
  
There must be another way  
Cause I believe in taking chances  
But who am I to say  
What a girl is to do  
God I need some answers  
  
What am I to do with my life  
You will find out dont worry  
How Am I supposed to know whats right  
  
You just got to do it your way  
I cant help the way I feel  
But my life has been so overprotected  
  
I need time love  
I need space  
This is it this is it  
  
I dont need nobody  
Tellin me just what I want to  
What I what what Im gonna  
I need  
  
Do about my destiny  
I Say No No  
Nobody tell me just what what what I want to do do  
Im so fed up with people telling me to be  
Someone else but me
