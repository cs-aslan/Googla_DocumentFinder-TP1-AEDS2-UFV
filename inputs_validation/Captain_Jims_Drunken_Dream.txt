Well you country fools in your one horse town you can laugh at me  
Its plain as rain that youve never been down to the southern sea  
To see me now is like watching a fish on dry land  
I only wish you could see me down in the islands mister thats my home  
What a fool I was to leave the only happiness Ive known  
  
You see me coming you wink your eye and call me Captain Jim  
And when I dont do nothing but walk on by you say babe get a load of him  
All I need is the sea and the sky and I know where I stand  
Instead of you hicks straight out of the sticks deciding I aint a man  
Youll never understand Up here Im a whisky bum but down there Im a king  
Sounds just like the angels up in heaven when they sing  
Welcome home welcome home Such a sight to see  
Instead of some Salvation Army sister singing Nearer My God To Thee  
  
Now I know that Yankee whisky has taken away my mind  
And I know that rum is the only drink suitable to mankind  
And I know this tree Im under is shaped entirely wrong  
I need to see a gentle palm tree and I wont wait to long  
I can feel that its coming on strong  
The first cold wind of winter is flapping in my clothes  
Showing me the way with the direction that it blows  
Welcome home welcome home Let it blow welcome home welcome home  
Welcome home Such a sight to see  
Instead of some Salvation Army sister singing Nearer My God To Thee  
Let me hear it
