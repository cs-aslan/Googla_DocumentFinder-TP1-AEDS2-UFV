Its the story of a very unfortunate coloured man  
Who got arrested down in old Hong Kong  
He got twenty years privilege taken away from him  
When he kicked old Buddhas gong  
  
And now hes poppin the piano just to raise the  
price  
Of a ticket to the land of the free  
Well he says his homes in Frisco where they  
send the rice  
But its really in Tennessee  
  
Thats why he says  
I need someone to love me  
Need somebody to carry me home to San  
Francisco  
And bury my body there  
I need someone to lend me a fiftydollar bill  
and then  
Ill leave Hong Kong far behind me  
For happiness once again  
  
Wont somebody believe  
Ive a yen to see that Bay again  
Everytime I try to leave  
Sweet opium wont let me fly away  
I need someone to love me  
Need somebody to carry me home to San  
Francisco  
And bury my body there  
  
Thats the story of a very unfortunate coloured man  
Who got arrested down in old Hong Kong  
He got twenty years privilege taken away from him  
When he kicked old Buddhas gong
