Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Everyone is waitin on the bell  
Couple seconds well be raisin hell  
The sun is shinin down school is finally out  
Nothin matters so we might as well  
  
Everybodys bakin in the sun  
Come and party do it while were young  
Move your body when you hear the drum  
So put your hands up  
  
Its gonna be a bitchin summer  
Well be livin fast kickin ass together  
Like high school lovebirds  
Gonna have a blast make it last forever  
Ill pick you up at the liquor store  
Hurry up we can fit one more  
Its now or never

Bitchin summer  
Bitchin summer  
  
Throwin empty bottles in the fire  
Whiskeys got us singin like a choir  
Were all gonna run when the police come  
But in the mornin were so alive  
  
Everybodys bakin in the sun  
Come and party do it while were young  
Move your body when you hear the drum  
So put your hands up  
  
Its gonna be a bitchin summer  
Well be livin fast kickin ass together  
Like high school lovebirds  
Gonna have a blast make it last forever  
Ill pick you up at the liquor store  
Hurry up we can fit one more  
Its now or never  
Its gonna gonna be be a bitchin summer  
Bitchin summer  
Bitchin summer  
  
Rightrightright near the beach  
Te party dont stop  
If we dont get harassed by the motherfuckin cops  
Quarter tank of gas  
About a half a pack  
My cell phones dyin but theres no turnin back  
I can feel the breeze  
Steerin with my knee  
Drummin on the dashboard  
Bumpin to the beat  
Hit the windshield wiper  
Searchin for my lighter  
I gotta get right before this all nighter  
  
Its gonna be a bitchin summer  
Well be livin fast kickin ass together  
Like high school lovebirds  
Gonna have a blast make it last forever  
Ill pick you up at the liquor store  
Hurry up we can fit one more  
Its now or never  
Its gonna gonna be be a bitchin summer  
Bitchin summer  
Bitchin summer  
  
Pick you up at the liquor store  
Hurry up we can fit one more  
Its now or never  
Its gonna gonna be be a bitchin summer
