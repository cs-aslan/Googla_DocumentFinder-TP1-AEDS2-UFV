Im curious I want to know  
Im an idealist Ill let it show  
Im curious with myself  
Im delirious from wanting  
  
The noise that announces a seduction  
Im a volcano  
In a state of eruption  
I live life with a wild intensity  
Need to be aroused  
To the point of intimacy  
  
What are your motives  
I got to know  
Im doing research  
I got to know  
What are your motives  
I got to know  
Tell me your motives oh oh  
  
Cause Im curious I want to know  
Im an idealist Ill let it show  
Im curious with myself  
Im delirious from wanting  
  
The fusing the melting of two bodies  
Im addicted to lethal sexuality  
I live life on the edge of ecstasy  
Need to be desired  
Nothing else fulfills me  
  
What are your motives  
I got to know  
Im doing research  
I got to know  
What are your motives  
I got to know  
Tell me your motives ooh ooh  
  
Im curious I want to know  
Im an idealist Ill let it show  
Im curious with myself  
Im delirious from wanting  
  
Im curious I want to know  
Im an idealist Ill let it show  
Im curious with myself  
Im delirious from wanting  
  
Yes Im curious I want to know  
Im an idealist Ill let it show  
I am curious with myself  
Too delirious from singing  
Cause Im curious I want to know  
Im an idealist Ill let it show  
Im curious with myself  
Im delirious from wanting
