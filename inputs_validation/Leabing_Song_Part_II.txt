This is a song by AFI you guys dont have any AFI on here at all and thats
disgraceful  
Dont waste your touch  
you wont feel anything  
Or were you sent to save me  
Ive thought too much  
you wont find anything  
Worthy of redeeming  
Yo he estado agui muchas veces antes y regreso To  
break down and cease all feeling  
Burn now what once was breathing  
Reach out and you may take my heart away  
Imperfect cry and scream in ecstasy  
So what befalls the flawless  
Look what Ive built  
it shines so beautifully  
Now watch as it destroys me  
Y regreso agui otra vez y comienzo To  
break down and cease all feeling  
Burn now what once was breathing  
Reach out and you may take my heart away  
Break down and cease all feeling  
Burn now what once was breathing  
Reach out and you may take my heart away  
I left it all behind  
and never said goodbye  
I left it all behind  
and never said goodbye  
I left it all behind  
and never said goodbye  
I left it all to die I saw its birth  
I watched it grow I felt it change me I took the life  
I ate it slow  
Now it consumes me I  
break down and cease all feeling  
Burn now what once was breathing  
Reach out and you may take my heart away  
Break down and cease all feeling  
Burn now what once was breathing  
Reach out and you may take my heart away  
Heart away
