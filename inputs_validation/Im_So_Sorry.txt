About time for anyone telling you off for all your deeds  
Not time the roaring thunder stopped in cold to read  
I get mine and make no excuses  
Waste of precious breath No time  
The sun shines on everyone  
Everyone love yourself to death  
  
So you gotta fire up you gotta let go  
Youll never be loved til you make your own  
You gotta face up you gotta get yours  
Youll never know the top till you get too low  
  
Oh a son of a  
Stepfather  
Oh a son of a  
Im so sorry  
  
Oh a son of a  
Stepfather  
Oh a son of a  
Im so sorry  
  
No lies and no deceiving  
Men is what he loves  
I keep trying to conceive  
That death is from above No time  
I get mine and make no excuses  
Waste of precious breath No time  
The sun shines on everyone  
Everyone love yourself to death  
  
So you gotta fire up you gotta let go  
Youll never be loved til you make your own  
You gotta face up you gotta get yours  
Youll never know the top till you get too low  
  
Oh a son of a  
Stepfather  
Oh a son of  
Im so sorry  
  
Oh a son of a  
Stepfather  
Oh a son of  
Im so sorry  
  
Life isnt always what you think itd be  
Turn your head for one second and the tables turn  
And I know I know that I did you wrong  
Will you trust me when I say that Ill make it up to you somehow  
Somehow  
  
So you gotta fire up you gotta let go  
Youll never be loved til youve made your own  
You gotta face up you gotta get yours  
Youll never know the top till you get too low  
  
Oh a son of a  
stepfather  
Oh a son of a  
Im so sorry  
  
Oh a son of a  
Stepfather  
Oh a son of a  
Im so sorry  
  
Im so sorry
