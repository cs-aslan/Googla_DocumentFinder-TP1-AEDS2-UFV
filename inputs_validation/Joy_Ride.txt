Baby baby dont you ever let go  
More and more until we both overflow  
Got a feeling that my hearts never known  
I found love  
Tender kisses and Im floating on air  
You can have me anytime anywhere  
When you need me I will always be there  
I found love  
  
And our love goes round and round  
Way up high a joy ride  
We can touch the stars above  
We found love  
And our love was heaven sent  
From the day we first met  
Weve got something they cant touch  
We found love  
  
Loving you is like a taste of heaven  
want to gaze into your eyes forever  
Run away and spend our lives together  
Ive found love  
Baby baby  
All it takes is one touch  
And immediately I feel a rush  
Baby boy too much is never enough  
I found love  
  
And our love goes round and round  
Way up high a joy ride  
We can touch the stars above  
We found love  
And our love was heaven sent  
From the day we first met  
Weve got something they cant touch  
We found love  
  
I dont need anything  
When youre here next to me  
Nobody in this whole wide world  
Could ever replace you in my eyes  
We found paradise  
Forever you and I  
Our love goes round and round  
On a joy ride  
With ya babe with ya babe  
With ya babe with you baby
