While in these days of quiet desperation  
As I wander through the world in which I live  
I search everywhere for some new inspiration  
But its more than cold reality can give  
  
If I need a cause for celebration  
Or a comfort I can use to ease my mind  
I rely on my imagination  
And I dream of an imaginary time  
  
Chorus   
I know that everybody has a dream  
Everybody has a dream  
And this is my dream my own  
Just to be at home  
And to be all alonewith you  
  
If I believe in all the words Im saying  
And if a word from you can bring a better day  
Then all I have are these games that Ive been playing  
To keep my hope from crumbling away  
  
So let me lie and let me go on sleeping  
And I will lose myself in palaces of sand  
And all the fantasies that I have been keeping  
Will make the empty hours easier to stand  
  
Chorus   
  
Everybody has a dream Repeat
