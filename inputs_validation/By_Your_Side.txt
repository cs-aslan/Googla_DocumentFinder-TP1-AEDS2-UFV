When youre down and youre lonely  
Come to me Ill be your only  
Always remember  
Ill be by your side  
Call me up daytime or night  
Ill always listen every time  
If you need me  
Then please believe me dont you cry  
  
Ill show concern  
And Ill keep my word  
I wont stay away  
Now and then when your hearts in pain  
Id like to say  
Always remember  
Ill be forever  
By your side  
  
Friends like this  
Are hard to find  
With time to talk  
And to confide  
If you need me  
Please believe me  
Im by your side  
  
The secrets kept as we lie in bed  
I cant keep away  
Now and then when your hearts in pain  
Id like to say  
Always remember  
Ill be forever  
By your side
