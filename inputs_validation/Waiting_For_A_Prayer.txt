Hes given hope through the ages  
Give sight to the blind  
Brought understanding to sages  
And peace to troubled minds  
To humble hearts who will call His name  
To all who will believe  
Chorus  
Hes watching with angels Hes ready to fly  
One word just a whisper Hes there  
Knock and Hell open seek and youll find  
Call on His name Hes the answer  
Waiting for a prayer  
Hell give you faith like a fire  
To keep your feet on the path  
And if its mercy you require  
Hell be the touch of Healing Hands  
To humble hearts who will call His name  
To all who will believe  
Chorus  
Fall on your knees and believe  
The Father hears you when you pray  
Anytime night or day  
And He will say  
Chorus  
Im watching with angels Im ready to fly  
One word just a whisper Ill be there  
Knock and Hell open seek and youll find  
Call on His name Hes the answer  
Waiting for a prayer
