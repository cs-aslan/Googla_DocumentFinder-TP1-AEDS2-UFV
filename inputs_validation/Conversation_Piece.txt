I took this walk  
To ease my mind  
To find out whats gnawing at me  
Wouldnt think to look at me  
That Ive spent a lot of time in education  
It all seems so long ago  
Im a thinker not a talker  
Ive noone to talk to anyway  
  
I cant see the road  
For the rain in my eyes  
Ahhhhuh h Uh huh  
  
I live above the grocers store  
Owned by an Austrian  
He often calls me down to eat  
And he jokes about his broken English  
Tries to be a friend to me  
But for all my years  
Of reading conversation  
I stand without a word to say  
  
I cant see the bridge  
For the rain in my eyes  
Ahhhhuh h Uh huh  
  
And the world is full of life  
Full of folk who dont know me  
And they walk in twos or threes or more  
While the light  
That shines above the grocers store  
Investigates my face so rudely  
And my essays lying  
Scattered on the floor  
Fulfill their needs just by being there  
And my hands shake my head hurts  
My voice sticks inside my throat  
Im invisible and dumb  
Noone will recall me  
  
And I cant see the water  
Through the tears in my eyyyes  
Ahhhhuh h Uh huh
