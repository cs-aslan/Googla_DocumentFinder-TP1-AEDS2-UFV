Maybe theres something in me  
Trying to hitch another ride  
Have you ever felt this moment  
When youre looking out of control  
All the ways I could have taken  
Just add up to indecision  
  
Im gonna get this back on line  
To me theres no reason why  
All my troubles soon be leaving  
Wash away the pain of mine  
  
Get me to the place Im standing  
Theres a reason down below  
Maybe theres something in me  
Trying to take another ride  
Have you ever felt the moment  
When youre loosing all control  
  
Im gonna get this back on line  
To me theres no reason why  
All my troubles soon be leaving  
Wash away the pain of mine  
  
All my troubles soon be leaving Repeat x4  
  
Mine  
Mine  
All my troubles soon be leaving  
Mine  
All my troubles soon be leaving  
Mine  
All my troubles soon be leaving  
Mine
