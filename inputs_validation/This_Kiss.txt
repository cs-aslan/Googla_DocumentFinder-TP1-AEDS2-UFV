I dont want another heartbreak  
I dont need another turn to cry no  
I dont want to learn the hard way  
Baby hello oh no goodbye  
But you got me like a rocket  
Shooting straight across the sky  
  
Its the way you love me  
Its a feeling like this  
Its centrifugal motion  
Its perpetual bliss  
Its that pivotal moment  
Its ah impossible  
This kiss this kiss unstoppable  
This kiss this kiss  
  
Cinderella said to Snow White  
How does love get so off course oh  
All I wanted was a white knight  
With a good heart soft touch fast horse  
Ride me off into the sunset  
Baby Im forever yours  
  
Its the way you love me  
Its a feeling like this  
Its centrifugal motion  
Its perpetual bliss  
Its that pivotal moment  
Its ah unthinkable  
This kiss this kiss unsinkable  
This kiss this kiss  
  
You can kiss me in the moonlight  
On the rooftop under the sky or  
You can kiss me with the windows open  
While the rain comes pouring inside  
Kiss me in sweet slow motion  
Lets let every thing slide  
You got me floating you got me flying  
  
Its the way you love me  
Its a feeling like this  
Its centrifugal motion  
Its perpetual bliss  
Its that pivotal moment  
Its ah subliminal  
This kiss this kiss its criminal  
This kiss this kiss  
  
Its the way you love me baby  
Its the way you love me darling yeah  
Its the way you love me  
Its a feeling like this  
Its centrifugal motion  
Its perpetual bliss  
Its that pivotal moment  
Its ah subliminal  
This kiss this kiss its criminal  
This kiss this kiss  
  
Its the way you love me baby  
Its the way you love me darling yeah  
Its the way you love me  
Its a feeling like this
