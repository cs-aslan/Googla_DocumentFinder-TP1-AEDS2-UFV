Mama Nature said  
Its murder what youve done  
I sent you forth my brightest world  
Now its nearly gone  
  
Birds and bees  
Been telling me  
You cant see  
The forest for the trees  
  
You cover up your lies  
With sympathies  
And I got no solutions  
To your persecution  
  
Mama Nature said  
I cant believe its true  
I gave you life and food for thought  
Look what did you do  
  
Youre killing my rivers  
Drowning my baby streams  
Day by day by day by day  
I hear them scream  
  
Im so disillusioned  
Im so disillusioned  
  
Mama Nature said  
Youre guilty of this crime  
Now its not just a matter of fact  
But just a matter of time  
  
Cruel will be the vengeance  
So savage is the deed thats done  
And Ive got no solutions  
To your own pollutions
