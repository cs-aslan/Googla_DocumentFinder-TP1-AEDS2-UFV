Love is all the world  
You say the world is gone  
Love is all the world  
You say its gone  
I dont  
  
The party in your eyes  
Says someone to caress  
A party in the sky  
I think Ill wear a dress  
  
God saves us all and tell us how it ends  
Laugh till we fall so why cant we be friends  
  
Mother taught me what to do in cocktail times  
Work and play all day until the sun is high  
Haley and the comets sang an old rock jam  
The ukulele play another song Ill brag  
  
God saves us all and tell us how it ends  
Laugh till we fall so why cant we be friends  
  
Stole a lot from Peter  
Cause had to pay your Paul  
And when you find thats not enough  
Hell break your fall  
  
Some get on and some  
Get off the carousel  
I think its time to go  
So I will fare thee well  
  
God saves us all and tell us how it ends  
Laugh till we fall so why cant we be friends  
  
Stole a lot from Peter  
Cause had to pay your Paul  
And when you find thats not enough  
Hell break your fall
