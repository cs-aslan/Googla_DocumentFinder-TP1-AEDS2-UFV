I see the lights  
I see the road  
I see everything in the  
Highway code  
Ive been whipped  
And Ive been spun cown  
There aint no religion here  
And Im homeward bound  
  
Wherever you go  
Wherever you are  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
And now I am waiting for an answer  
Some kind of sign  
Looking for a love  
To be my guide  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
  
Friendships come  
And lifetimes go  
In their passing to the  
Bigger show  
The river runs  
The tides will turn  
If theres a hell  
Well Ive yet to learn  
  
Wherever you go  
Wherever you are  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
And now I am waiting for an answer  
Some kind of sign  
Looking for a love  
To be my guide  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
  
To dream the dream thats over  
Before its gone  
To hold your lover here  
While your heart beats so strong  
Baby when I love you  
When everything is gone  
When Im kissing heaven  
This love is never wrong  
  
Solo  
  
I hear the singing  
I hear the shout  
The talk of meaning  
For those in doubt  
But amid all the wailing and  
The wringing hands  
Everybody thinks  
Does anyone understand  
  
Wherever you go  
Wherever you are  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
And now I am waiting for an answer  
Some kind of sign  
Looking for a love  
To be my guide  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
And now I am waiting for an answer  
Some kind of sign  
Looking for a love  
To be my guide  
cause I am crossing over  
To the other side
