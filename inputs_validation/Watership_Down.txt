Watership Down gather around  
Theres a story to be told  
Its for the young and for the old  
You might hear them in the distance  
If your ears to the ground  
  
Whisper it loud carry the sound  
Of the footsteps alone  
When theyre heading for home  
Through the raining of the dangers  
And the grayness of the dawn  
  
Chorus  
I can feel theres better days  
Well theyre coming theyre coming  
I can see them through the haze  
So can you  
  
Watership Down gather around  
Theres a story to be told  
Its for the young and for the old  
You might hear them in the distance  
If your ears to the ground  
  
Chorus  
  
Watership Down gather around  
Theres a story to be told  
Its for the young and for the old  
You might hear them in the distance  
If your ears to the ground  
  
Whisper it loud carry the sound  
Of the footsteps alone  
When theyre heading for home  
Through the raining of the dangers  
And the grayness of the dawn  
  
Chorus
