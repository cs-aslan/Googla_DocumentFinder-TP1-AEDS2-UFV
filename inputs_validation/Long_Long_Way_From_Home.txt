It was a Monday  
A day like any other day  
I left a small town  
For the Apple in decay  
It was my destiny  
Its what we needed to do  
They were telling me  
Im telling you  
  
I was inside looking outside  
The millions of faces  
But still Im alone  
Waiting hours of waiting  
Paying a penance  
I was longing for home  
Im looking out for the two of us  
I hope well be here  
When theyre through with us  
  
I was inside looking outside  
Oh the millions of faces  
But still Im alone  
Waiting hours of waiting  
I could feel the tension  
I was longing for home  
Im looking out for the two of us  
And I hope well be here  
When theyre through with us  
Im coming home  
  
Monday sad sad Monday  
Shes waiting for me  
But Im a long long way from home  
Sad sad Monday  
Shes waiting for me  
But Im a long long way from homw  
Sad sad Monday  
Ah shes waiting for me  
But Im a long long way from home
