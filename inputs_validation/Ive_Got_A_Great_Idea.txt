Ive got a great idea  
And wouldnt you like to know  
You probably cant bear it  
So I guess Ill have to share it  
I thought of it a moment ago  
  
It starts with your hand in mine  
And next comes a little stroll  
You probably wont buy it  
But Im trying to keep it quiet  
So please dont tell a soul  
  
cause if you do  
The world and you  
Will think Im crazy and give me medicine  
Theyll drag me away  
And as I go youll hear me say  
I could have been a decent match for edison  
  
Ideas are few and far between  
And good ideas are rarer still  
So listen and be wise  
Just forget the other guys  
cause my ideas no good for three  
My idea is you and me
