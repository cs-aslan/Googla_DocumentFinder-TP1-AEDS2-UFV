When theres wine in your belly  
Love rhythms on your tongue  
For you are a woman  
And each man has been too young  
  
But for me you were a lover  
Gently under your cover  
Your sheet reeks of odours  
  
Oh i came here to hold and be held for a while  
  
Ive been drifting like a dream out on the sea  
Ive been drifting in between you and me  
Everytime i think about you  
I cant remember what i said or did  
Was right or wrong you know i just dont remember  
All i wanna be is what you mean to me  
All i wanna be is what you mean to me  
  
Late last night as i dreamed in dizzy sunlight  
I thought i heard your bare feet up the stairs  
Just like a fool just like a fool  
Ive been drifting  
Like a dream out on the sea  
Ive been drifting in between what used to be
