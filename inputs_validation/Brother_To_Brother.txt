Brother to brother heart to heart  
Theres something Ive been trying to tell you  
No matter where you are  
From cradle to shining star  
Youre someone to look up to  
Brother to brother worlds apart  
One day Ill promise Ill be with you  
Always Ill love you  
Now just a memory  
A lifetime of rivalry  
I couldnt have a better friend than you  
I used to criticize the way you used to be  
The child that had the look that dreams are made of  
A window to the past looks onto everything I see  
The fire went out the flame just dies  
I couldnt have a better friend than you  
Brother to brother when we meet again  
Therell be no differences between us  
Free from the darkest night free till we see the light  
Burning ever after  
Time is a healer calming our fears  
A thousand questions left unanswered  
Oh I believe in you  
Brother of mine  
Have you ever had somebody you were close to  
Become a memory thats larger than life  
Have you ever felt theres beauty in distortion  
If faiths a crime give me a clue  
And if it is then brother its still you
