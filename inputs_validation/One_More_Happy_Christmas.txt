Hey listen Buddy have you gotta dime for a cup of coffee  
Cause my body is felling kinda cold  
And its christmas eve tonight  
  
I remember a couple years ago  
Having a good time celebrating  
With all my friends and family  
But Im all alone tonight  
  
All I want is one more happy christmas  
All all I want is one more happy christmas  
  
I rub my hands when theyre getting cold  
I sow my pants when appears a hole  
Just love that bag lady with her dog  
Well party christmas by the bonfire  
So tel me watcha hold to give me  
Cause my pants and shoes are torn apart  
Help me I know that you can  
Anything is better that nothing  
  
All I want  
  
I keep looking for the money in my pocket  
Theres always nothing there  
Something tells me one day Ill be famous  
Ill throe it in the air  
  
All I want  
  
Hey listen Buddy have you gotta dime for a cup of coffee  
Cause my body is feeling kinda cold  
And its christmas eve tonight  
Take a look at them young kids  
Shooting their stuff up in them  
Theyre hundred times worse that even I am  
All that Im asking for is what everybody needs  
  
All I want
