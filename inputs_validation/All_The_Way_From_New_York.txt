Im gonna ask you for something and it may sound like a lot  
Ive never really asked you for anything no  
Weve always lived so far apart  
  
Chorus  
Would you fly all the way from New York to see me  
Could you fly all the way to stand here next to me  
I didnt think so  
But here you are with me  
  
I was hanging on to nothing as a child  
And my brother he used to slam into walls  
Everyone called him wild  
Yes its been a while since Ive had a day  
Where I dont wish away all the fear all the fear  
Thats why its so hard to ask  
  
Chorus  
  
Thank you for coming  
Youll never know what it means ahah  
Cause no one ever cared enough about you  
How were you supposed to know what I need  
Youll never know what it means  
But thank you for coming  
  
Chorus
