Love love will keep us together  
Think of me babe whenever  
Some sweet talking guy comes along singing his song  
Dont mess around  
You got to be strong  
Just Stop cause I really love You  
Stop Ill be thinking of you  
Look in my heart and let love keep us together  
  
You you belong to me now  
Aint gonna set you free now  
When those guys start hanging around talking me down  
Hear with your heart and you wont hear a sound  
Just stop cause I really love you  
Stop Ill be thinking of you  
Look in my heart and let love keep us together  
  
Whatever young and beautiful  
Someday your looks will be gone  
When the others turn you off  
Wholl be turning you on  
  
I will I will I will I will  
Be there to share forever  
Love will keep us together  
Said it before and Ill say it again while others pretend  
Ill need you now and Ill need you then  
Stop cause I really love Ya  
Stop Ill be thinking of Ya  
Look in my heart and let love keep us together
