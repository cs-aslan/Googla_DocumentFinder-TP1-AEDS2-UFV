Youre climbing mountains Im on a hill  
Youre always running Im standing still  
You live for the moment no future no past  
I may be a fool to love by the rules and want it to last  
  
Chorus  
If you ever have forever in mind  
Ill be here and easy to find  
If your heart isnt ready to lay down with mine  
If you ever have forever in mind  
  
The music has ended still you want to dance  
I know that feeling I cant take that chance  
You live for the moment no future no past  
I may be a fool to love by the rules I want it to last  
  
Chorus
