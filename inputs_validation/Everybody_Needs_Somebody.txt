Oh everybody needs somebody baby every needs someone to love  
Anytime I see you I get crazy anytime I kiss you cant get enough  
  
Tell me is this love a burning fire  
Thats burning fast but then its gone away  
Oh tell me baby do you feel desire  
Ill give you everything Im too shy to say  
I dont want to lose you girl  
I wont let you go  
Oh I dont want to lose you girl  
My love will show  
  
Oh everybody needs somebody baby  
Everybody needs someone to love  
Anytime I see you I get crazy  
Anytime I kiss you cant get enough  
  
Oh you you are a symphony  
Oh you you are my destiny  
Girl you you are the venus of my heart  
  
Tell me babe do you find another  
Another man whos breaking your heart  
Oh tell me baby is he your new lover  
And will you say love will break apart  
Oh this is now the end of love  
I wont let you go  
Oh whyd you break this lonely heart  
Say it isnt so  
  
Oh everybody needs somebody baby  
Needs someone to love  
I get crazy  
I cant get enough  
  
Oh you you are a symphony  
Oh you you are my destiny  
Girl you you are the venus of my heart
