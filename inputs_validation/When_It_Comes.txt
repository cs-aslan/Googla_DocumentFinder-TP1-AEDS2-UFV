Its comin around again  
Theyre letting it out again again  
Its comin around again  
Theyre letting it out again again  
When it comes  
It comes abrupt  
  
When it feels it feels like trading brains with an imbecil for real  
Yes I feel empathetic about not being static  
And not buying philosophies that are sold to me at a steal  
  
Just when you thought it was safe to think  
In comes mental piracy  
What Im looking for cannot be sold to me  
I wish they all would stop trying  
Cause what I want and what I need  
Is and always will be free  
  
Its comin around again  
Theyre letting it out again again  
Its comin around again  
When it comes  
It comes unannounced  
  
And it feels like a matador is taunting me  
With his reddest red cloth and I am the bull  
Yes I feel empathetic about not being static  
And not eating the bullshit thats being fed to me no more  
Cause now Im full  
  
Just when you thought it was safe to think  
In comes mental piracy  
What I m looking for cannot be sold to me  
I wish they all would stop trying  
Cause what I want and what I need  
Is and will always be free
