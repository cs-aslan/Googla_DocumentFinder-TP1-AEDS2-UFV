With his big brown eyes he came my way  
I didnt know then what he had to say  
I could tell that he felt bad  
By the way he looked that he felt sad oh yeah  
  
Sometimes you hurt me baby I dont know why  
Ill always love you baby till the day I die  
But when you look at fellas  
Baby I get jealous  
I only live my life for you  
Anything you say Ill do  
Ill live for you Ill die for you  
Ill even climb the mountains high for you  
  
Thought right then hed break my heart  
I could feel the teardrops start  
Why didnt he know I love him so  
I could never let him go oh no  
  
Id never hurt you baby tell you why  
Im gonna love you till the day I die  
When I look at fellas  
Baby dont get jealous  
I only live my life for you anything you say Ill do  
Ill live for you Ill die for you  
Ill even climb the mountains high for you  
  
I love you just you nobody else but you  
I love you only youevery day every day just you
