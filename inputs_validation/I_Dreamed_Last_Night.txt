Oh I dreamed last night I was hearing hearing your voice  
And the things that you said well they left me left me no choice  
And you told me we had the power  
And you told me this was the hour  
That you dont know how if I could show you now  
Well I dreamed last night you were calling calling my name  
You were locked inside of you secrets calling my name  
And you told me lost was the key  
And you told me how you long to be free  
That you dont know how oh let me show you now  
Like a bird on a far distant mountain  
Like a ship on an uncharted sea  
You are lost in the arms that have found you  
Dont be afraid loves plans are made oh dont be afraid  
If theres a time and a place to begin love  
It must be now let it go set it free  
Oh I dreamed last night I was hearing hearing your voice  
Why did you say those things that have left me left me no choice  
When you told me we had the power  
Why did you tell me now was the hour  
But you dont know how oh let me show you now  
Like a bird on a far distant mountain  
Like a ship on an uncharted sea  
You are lost in the arms that have found you  
Oh dont be afraid loves plans are made dont be afraid  
If theres a time and a place to begin love  
It must be now let it go set it free  
Oh I dreamed last night I was hearing hearing your voice
