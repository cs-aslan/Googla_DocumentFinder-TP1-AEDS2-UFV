This isnt the first time  
Ive left it too late  
To get on top  
I made that mistake  
To be with someone  
Never find what you need  
We dont bail out  
And I cant sleep  
  
You left me  
Just when I needed you  
You set me back  
Just when I thought I got back  
Whistle Do do dos La la las  
Just when I thought I got back  
  
This is the last time  
I make this mistake  
Cant see the stars  
Yeah its too late  
To be with someone  
Never find what you need  
We dont bail out  
Yeah I cant sleep
