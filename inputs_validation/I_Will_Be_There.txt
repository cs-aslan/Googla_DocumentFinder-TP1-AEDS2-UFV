This is the life you saved laid out before you  
Everything that I think I have been and what I am now  
Nothing can change the way I feel about you  
Better we go on our separate ways  
Nothing is left but the endless days  
Nothing to cry but your name  
  
Dont you look back dont say a word  
I will be lonely for you I will be standing for you  
Dont you despair  
I will be there for you  
I will be there  
  
Maybe this time next year well be together  
You can wipe away all of the tears bring truth to the lies  
There was a silent dream we made a promise  
Wed be there for each other forever  
Aboard like a ship on an oceans roar  
Beating a path to your open door  
Nothing will keep me away  
  
Dont you look back dont say a word  
I will be lonely for ya I will be standing for you  
Dont you despair  
I will be there for you  
Each night I pray to God above  
You will be waiting for me you will be lonely for me  
Dont you despair  
I will be there for you  
I will be there  
  
Dont you look back dont say a word  
I will be lonely for ya I will be standing for you  
Dont you despair  
I will be there for you  
Farewell to you goodbye for me  
I will be waiting for you  
I will be lonely for you  
Dont you despair  
Cause I will be there for you  
I will be there
