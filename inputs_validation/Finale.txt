Frank butler  
The cowboys the wrestlers the tumblers the clowns  
The roustabouts that move the show at dawn  
  
Annie oakley  
The music the spotlights the people the towns  
Your baggage with the labels pasted on  
  
Frank butler  
The sawdust and the horses and the smell  
  
Annie oakley  
The towel youve taken from the last hotel  
  
Annie oakley frank butler and chorus  
Theres no business like show business  
Like no business I know  
Everything about it is appealing  
Everything the traffic will allow  
No where could you have that happy feeling  
When you arent stealing that extra bow  
  
Theres no people like show people  
They smile when they are low  
Even with a turkey that you know will fold  
You may be stranded out in the cold  
Still you wouldnt change it for a sack o gold  
Lets go on with the show  
Lets go on with the show  
  
Annie oakley and frank butler  
They say that falling in love is wonderful  
Its wonderful so they say  
And with a moon up above its wonderful  
Its wonderful so they tell me  
  
Annie oakley  
I cant recall who said it  
  
Frank butler  
I know I never read it  
I only know that falling in love is grand  
  
And to hold a girl in your arms  
Is wonderful  
  
Annie oakley  
Wonderful  
  
Annie oakley and frank butler  
In every way  
So they say
