Just excel in anger and hatred  
Do the best with what I have

Everyday Im tested  
With the worst of what you have

Youre not a bad man bad man  
You excel in cold frustration  
You know I bleed for what its worth  
Think I hear the distance comin  
Down fast on your face is gunnin  
Bloodspots in the eye give you away

When is it gonna end 4x  
  
Do it if I can  
You expect to much and I cant  
Be bothered with What you do  
Hey Whats your problem 3x  
Hey Hey Hey  
  
3 again  
  
When is it gonna end
