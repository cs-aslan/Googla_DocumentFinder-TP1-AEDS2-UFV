Down the street a baby just cried  
When he woke up all alone  
A trains leavin town and that lonesome old sound  
Is chilling me right to the bone  
  
A song is playing I can barely hear  
About a love thats gone wrong  
The freezing rain on my window pane  
Listen theyre playing my song  
  
Taps being played by a soldiers grave  
So sad it torments your soul  
Just listen to that north wind moan  
Tonight its so dark and cold  
  
Somewhere a siren cuts through the night  
Sounds like a whole worlds gone wrong  
Thunder just warned but its coming a storm  
Listen theyre playing my song
