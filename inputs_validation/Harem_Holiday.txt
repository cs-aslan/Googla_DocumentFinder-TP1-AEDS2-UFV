Im gonna pack my bags because this great big world is calling me  
Every pretty girls gonna know Im around  
Theyre gonna know Im in town on a harem holiday  
Twenty women twenty women by my side

You can bet that Juliet would have never been his girl forever

Twenty dancing girls are waiting just to call my name  
Gonna have a ball I aint gonna waste no time  
Im gonna make em all mine on a harem holiday  
If Romeo had a harem holiday  
You can bet that Juliet would have never been his girl forever  
Gonna travel gonna travel wild and free  
Im gonna pack my bags because this great big world is calling me  
Every pretty girls gonna know Im around  
Theyre gonna know Im in town on a harem holiday
