When Black Friday comes  
Ill stand down by the door  
And catch the grey men when they  
Dive from the fourteenth floor  
  
When Black Friday comes  
Ill collect everything Im owed  
And before my friends find out  
Ill be on the road  
  
When Black Friday falls you know its got to be  
Dont let it fall on me  
When Black Friday comes  
Ill fly down to Muswellbrook  
  
Gonna strike all the big red words  
From my little black book  
Gonna do just what I please  
Gonna wear no socks and shoes  
  
With nothing to do but feed  
All the kangaroos  
When Black Friday comes Ill be on that hill  
You know I will  
  
When Black Friday comes  
Im gonna dig myself a hole  
Gonna lay down in it til  
I satisfy my soul  
  
Gonna let the world pass by me  
The Archbishops gonna sanctify me  
And if he dont come across  
Im gonna let it roll  
  
When Black Friday comes  
Im gonna stake my claim  
Ill guess Ill change my name
