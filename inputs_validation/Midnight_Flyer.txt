Oo Midnight Flyer  
Engineer wont you let your whistle moan  
Oo Midnight Flyer  
I paid my dues and I feel like travlin on  
  
A runaway team of horses aint enough to make me stay  
So throw your rope on another man  
And pull him down your way  
Make him into someone who can take the place of me  
Make him every kind of fool you wanted me to be  
  
Oo Midnight Flyer  
Engineer wont you let your whistle moan  
Oo Midnight Flyer  
I paid my dues and I feel like travlin on  
Maybe Ill go to Santa Fe maybe San Antone  
Any town is where Im bound any way to get me gone  
Dont think about me never let me cross your mind  
Cept when you hear that midnight lonesome whistle whine  
  
Oo Midnight Flyer  
Engineer wont you let your whistle moan  
Oo Midnight Flyer  
I paid my dues and I feel like travlin on  
I paid my dues and I feel like travlin on
