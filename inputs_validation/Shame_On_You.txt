My friends they wash the windows and they shine in the sun  
They tell me wake up early in the morning sometime  
See what a beautiful job we done  
I say lets put on some tunes sing along do little all day  
Go sown to the riverside take off our shoes wash these sins away  
  
The river said la la la  
Shame on you  
  
I go down to Chicano city park because it makes me feel so fine  
When the weeds go down you can see up close in the dead of the winter time  
But when the summer comes everythings in bloom and you wouldnt know its
there  
The white folks like to pretend its not but their musics in the air  
  
You can hear them singing la la la  
Shame on you  
  
You can feel them dancing la la la  
Shame on you  
  
My friend Tanner she says you know me and Jesus were of the same heart  
The only thing that keeps us distant is that I keep fuckin up  
I said come on down to Chicano city park wash your blues away  
The beautiful ladies walk on by  
You know I never know what to say  
  
Theyll be singing ooh la la  
Shame on you  
  
Lets go road block trippin in the  
Middle of the night up in Gainesville town  
Therell be blue lights flashing down the long dirt road  
When they ask me to step out  
They say we be looking for illegal immigrants can we check your car  
I say you know its funny I think we were on the same boat back in 1694  
  
I said ooh la la  
Shame on you
