Today I went out on a movie call  
I saw a million nervous faces  
I knew them all  
Hollywood movie girls  
Were all wearing our one good interview dress  
The one showin our legs  
Aah were lookin our best  
Now who will be chosen for the screen test  
Its your guess  
Hollywood movie girls  
And each and every potential star  
Drives home in the night in her economy car  
Whoever thought home would be a oneroom flat  
Well as simple as that  
Hollywood movie girls  
Each morning up early to call on the phone  
Agents producers oh theyre never at home  
Like doortodoor salesmen we are selling ourselves  
Ooh nothing else  
Hollywood movie girls  
And each and every potential star  
Drives home in the night in her economy car  
Whoever thought home would be a oneroom flat  
Well as simple as that  
Hollywood movie girls  
And just about bedtime each one of us asks  
Tell me when will I make it to the bigtime at last  
Oh small parts youre offered  
Aah but those too shall pass  
Nothing lasts  
Hollywood movie girls  
Yeah and each and every potential star  
Drives home in the night in her economy car  
Whoever thought home would be a oneroom flat  
Well as simple as that  
Hollywood movie girls  
Oh star light star bright wont you wish on me tonight  
Wish I may wish I might  
Shine your light for me
