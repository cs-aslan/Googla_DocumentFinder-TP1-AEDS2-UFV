Shes a perfect 10 but she wears a 12  
Baby keep a little 2 for me  
She could be sweet 16 bustin out at the seams  
Its still love in the first degree  
  
When hes at my gate with a big fat 8  
You want to see the smile on my face  
And even at my door with a poor poor 4  
There aint no man can replace  
  
Cause we love our love  
in different sizes  
I love her body especially the lies  
Time takes its toll but not on the eyes  
Promise me this take me tonight  
  
If hes extra large well Im in charge  
I can work this thing on top  
If hes XXL well what the hell  
Every penny dont fit the slot  
  
The anorexic chicks the model 6  
They dont hold no weight with me  
Well 8 or 9 well thats just fine  
But I like to hold something I can see  
  
Cause we love our love  
in different sizes  
I love her body especially the lies  
Time takes its toll but not on the eyes  
Promise me this take me tonight  
  
Ive bought a watch to time your beauty  
But Ive had to fit a second hand  
Ive bought a calendar and every month  
Is taken up by lover man  
  
Cause we love our love  
in different sizes  
I love her body especially the lies  
Time takes its toll but not on the eyes  
Promise me this take me tonight  
  
Cause we love our love in different sizes  
I love her body especially the lies  
Time takes its toll but not on the eyes  
Promise me this take me tonight
