Plead with my saint  
Wash his hands and feet  
Find his complaints  
Make this world complete  
  
Chorus  
And this heaven that Im making  
It cant come quickly enough  
And the big wave that Im taking  
It feels like Im just waking up  
  
Find out dont think  
I cant get used to it  
And right on the brink  
I end up losing it  
  
Chorus  
  
And Ill be there  
If all of creation is kind  
And each conversation I hear  
As Im walking in through the crowd  
As if I could float through the air  
  
This Heaven  
  
This is Heaven that Im making  
This is Heaven  
  
It cant come quickly enough  
And the people that Im taking  
It cant come by quickly enough  
  
If there is Hell on Earth  
There must be Heaven too  
Both in one place  
And not a second to lose
