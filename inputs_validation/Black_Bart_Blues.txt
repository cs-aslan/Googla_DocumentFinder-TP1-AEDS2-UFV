What the fuck is that  
Hi guys are you in a band or something  
I mean it would be so cool  
If you were in a band cause youre  
Driving a big bus with band on the front of it  
Why dont you shut up and get on board will ya  
Wow I have it here you got a stereo and a microwave  
And and you got a beer  
Id like a Heineken if youve got one  
Thats real cool thats great yeah  
Would you like to see Black Bart  
Whos Black Bart  
Let me introduce you  
  
Black Barts seen it  
Black Bart knows  
Black Barts done it  
The Black Bart blues  
Suspended in suspension  
Medieval nights in Tennessee and elsewhere  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
Black Barts truckin aint what it seems  
Black Barts lookin  
Dont know where shes been  
Maybe shes an acrobat  
Spends her evenings dancing on a pole  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
Black Bart tried most anything  
Black Bart liked it but he couldnt sing  
So he asked me to tell ya  
Try it for yourself and you will see  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
What did you do that for  
Im sorry I just I guess Im not used to  
Shut up and get on with it will you  
  
Black Barts livin across the ocean now  
Black Barts lookin to come back somehow  
So if you are a dancer  
You could dance his pole in May  
Thats a maypole  
  
Black Barts coming  
Now Black Barts gone  
Black Bart did it so I wrote this song  
Whatever and however  
In and out or several at a time mmm yes  
We all got to do the Black Bart blues  
Here comes the guitar solo  
  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
Yowsa Yowsa Yowsa
