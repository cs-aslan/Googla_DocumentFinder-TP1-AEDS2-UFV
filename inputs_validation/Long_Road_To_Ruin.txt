Hey now dont make a sound  
Say have you heard the news today  
One flag was taken down  
To raise another in its place  
  
A heavy cross you bear  
A stubborn heart remains unchanged  
No home no life no love  
No stranger singing in your name  
  
Maybe the season  
The colors change in the valley skies  
Dear God Ive sealed my fate  
Running through hell  
Heaven can wait  
  
Chorus  
Long road to ruin  
There in your eyes  
Under the cold streetlights  
No tomorrow  
No deadend in sight  
  
Lets say we take this town  
No king or queen of any state  
Get up to shut it down  
Open the streets and raise the gates  
  
I know a wall to scale  
I know a field without a name  
Head on without a care  
Before its way too late  
  
Maybe the season  
The colors change in the valley skies  
Oh God Ive sealed my fate  
Running through hell  
Heaven can wait  
  
Long road to ruin  
There in your eyes  
Under the cold streetlights  
No tomorrow  
No deadends  
  
Chorus  
  
For every piece to fall in place  
Forever gone without a trace  
Your horizon takes its shape  
No turning back dont turn that page  
  
Come now Im leaving here tonight  
Come now lets leave it all behind  
Is that the price you pay  
Running through hell  
Heaven can wait  
  
Long road to ruin  
There in your eyes  
Under the cold streetlights  
No tomorrow  
No dead ends  
  
Long road to ruin  
There in your eyes  
Under the cold streetlights  
No tomorrow  
No dead ends  
  
Chorus
