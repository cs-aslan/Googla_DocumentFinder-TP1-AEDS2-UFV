Finally got a ride some old broad down from Santa Fe  
She was a real gogetter  
She drawled so sweetly I think child that thingsll get better  
Yes I read the Bible she said I want to know of you  
  
We pulled off the highway night black as a window  
Hey I think Ive got a live one  
Hey I think Ive got a live one Yeah Yeah  
I think Ive got a live one  
  
Felt like I was hit by a dieselor a greyhound bus  
She was no babysitter  
Get up sugar never thought youd be a quitter  
I opened the back door she was greedy  
  
I ran through the desert she was chasin  
No time to get dressed so I was naked  stranded in Chihuahua  
  
Alone raped and freezing  
Alone cold and sneezing  
Alone down in Mexico  
Alone
