Could it be you  
Ive been searching so hard to find  
Tell me how could I have been so blind  
You were here all the time  
You were here all the time  
Could it be you  
  
You never looked as good to me  
As you look tonight oh yeah  
Its like Ive seen you for the first time  
Through a lovers eyes  
How could it be that I never knew  
Its always been you that Ive been looking for  
  
You were always right here by my side oh yeah  
Could it be you  
Ive been searching so hard to find  
Tell me how could I have been so blind  
You were here all the time oh yeah  
Could it be you  
  
The girl Ive always had dreams about  
The one I just cant live without  
Is it so Tell me now  
Please tell me  
Could it be you  
Could you imagine what its like  
  
To always live without love  
I need to have you in my life  
I think I know that now  
My open heart will make you a part  
A part of this love Ive been keeping  
And I might just give it all to you oh  
  
Could it be you  
Ive been searching so hard to find  
Tell me how could I have been so blind  
You were here all the time  
Could it be you  
The girl Ive always had dreams about  
  
The one I just cant live without  
Is it so Tell me now  
Every girl I meet  
Though they might be sweet  
They cant compare to you  
So I search no more  
  
Cause what Ive been looking for  
I know Ive found in you  
Could it be you  
Ive been searching so hard to find  
Tell me how could I have been so blind  
You were here all the time  
  
Could it be you  
The girl Ive always had dreams about  
The one I just cant live without  
Is it so Tell me now  
Could it be you
