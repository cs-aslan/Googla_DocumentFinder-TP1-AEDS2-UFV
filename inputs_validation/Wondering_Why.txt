Im wondering why  
  
Once again Im playing  
Lies are all youre saying  
Got me wondering why  
Just wondering why  
While youre on the breaking  
Feel my spirit sinking  
Got me wondering why  
Just wondering why  
  
With all the time youre wasting  
Maybe you can just make up your mind  
  
Theres nowhere to run  
Theres nowhere to hide  
Youre driving me crazy baby  
So you better decide  
You better decide  
  
Theres nowhere  
  
What it takes to see theres something wrong  
You got me wondering why  
Just wondering why  
It was a sunny day but you brought all the rain  
You got me wondering why  
Just wondering why  
  
With all the time youre wasting  
Maybe you can just make up your mind  
  
Theres nowhere to run  
Theres nowhere to hide  
Youre driving me crazy baby  
So you better decide  
You better decide  
  
Theres nowhere to run  
So you better decide  
  
Theres nowhere to run  
  
With all the time youre wasting  
Maybe you can just make up your mind  
  
Theres nowhere to run  
Theres nowhere to hide  
Youre driving me crazy baby  
So you better decide  
  
Theres nowhere to run  
Theres nowhere to hide  
Youre driving me crazy baby  
So you better decide
