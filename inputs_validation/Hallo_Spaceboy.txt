Hallo Spaceboy youre sleepy now second time Hallo  
Your silhouette is so stationary  
Youre released but your custody calls  
And I want to be free  
  
Dont you want to be free  
Do you like girls or boys  
Its confusing these days  
But Moondust will cover you  
Cover you  
  
This chaos is killing me  
  
Chorus  
So bye bye love  
Yeah bye bye love  
Bye bye love  
Yeah bye bye love  
  
This chaos is killing me  
  
And the chaos is calling me  
  
Yeah bye bye love  
  
Chorus  
  
This chaos is killing me  
This chaos is killing me  
  
Yeah bye bye love  
Bye bye love  
Good time love  
Be sweet sweet dove  
Bye bye spaceboy  
Bye bye love  
  
Moondust will cover you
