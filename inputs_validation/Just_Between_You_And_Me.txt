Staring at each other with accusing eyes keep our voices low  
Dont act surprised  
If the word gets out yeah thats alright  
  
I know youre just looking for some sympathy  
but listen you dont know how it gets back to me  
Youre getting reckless girl but thats alright  
  
Dont you know that one cold word is going to lead to another  
and then well have nowhere to go  
  
Even if heaven and earth collide tonight  
well be all alone in a different light  
I dont care what the world cant see  
Its just between you and me  
  
I see telltale signs of a love in decline  
There should be something to say  
but we dont take the time  
and I dont understand but thats alright  
  
Now you can turn the page or you can tear me apart  
Dont make an open book out of my private heart  
You should know better now but thats alright  
  
Dont you know that one cold word is going to lead to another  
and then well have nowhere to go  
  
Even if heaven and earth collide tonight  
well be all alone in a different light  
I dont care what the world cant see  
Its just between you and me  
  
If we dont work this out we wont recover  
Well loose this soulfful love for one another  
But with all Ive heard and all Ive seen  
Im still lost in your mystery  
  
Staring at each other with accusing eyes keep our voices low  
Dont act surprised if the word gets out  
Yeah thats alright  
  
Dont you know that one cold word is going to lead to another
