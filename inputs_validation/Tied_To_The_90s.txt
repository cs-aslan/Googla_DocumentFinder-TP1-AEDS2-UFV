Were tied to the 90s  
In the middle  
Im terribly frightened  
Im takin it fast  
Takin it slow  
Theres thunder and lightning  
Its terribly frightening  
Lord knows  
Where it goes  
But I know  
That if so  
Well I want to tell you  
Were tired of the 90s  
Were tired of the 90s  
But were tied to the 90s  
Tied to the 90s  
  
Remember the 80s  
they were something  
Were worse than the 90s  
Were stuck in a path  
Where fashion is fast  
And nothin is lasting  
Its all ghetto blasting  
And Lord knows  
Where it goes  
But I know  
That if so well I want to tell you  
Were tired of the 90s  
Were tired of the 90s  
But were tied to the 90s  
Tied to the 90s  
  
Ah oh no  
Its nothing to go on  
The hifi five alive  
Thats it Im stayin in bed  
til my hair falls out  
Everythings over  
That said I like my wig  
And I hate myself  
I know its all in my head  
Were tired of the 90s x3  
But were tied to the 90s  
Oh were tied to the 90s  
Were tied to the 90s  
Were tied to the nines  
Tied to the nines  
Tied to the 90s
