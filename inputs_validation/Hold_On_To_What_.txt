Shed given everything she could give  
Twenty years of kindness made her sad  
Kindness never made enough to live  
So she sold the very last thing that she had  
As she held her hand out to him  
As he drove around the block  
He mouthed through the window just hold on  
Ive held on many years now and I havent found a lot  
Hold on hold on to what  
So hold on to what Hold on to what  
Holding on is harder when its something youve not got  
Ill need a pair of stilts if Im to ever reach the top  
So hold on Hold on to what  
  
Many years of service with a smile  
Up shit creek and down the Rhine  
Gibraltar Rock and now the Emerald Isle  
Hed shined every shoe that he could shine  
And as he lay in his own blood  
Screaming Ive been shot  
He heard the Major whisper just hold on  
Ive held on all these years now now what medal have I got  
Hold on hold on to what  
So hold on to what Hold on to what  
Holding on is harder when its something youve not got  
Ill need a pair of stilts if Im to ever reach the top  
So hold on Hold on to what  
So hold on to what Hold on to what  
  
Holding on is harder when its something youve not got  
Ill need a pair of stilts if Im to ever reach the top  
So hold on Hold on to what  
  
Sixty years and hes looking his worst  
Sitting in the park where shed died  
Running hands through his final hair  
These are the words that he cried  
To achieve the American dream  
You need a trampoline  
To achieve the counter effect  
Get that whisky down your neck  
And hold on hold on to what  
Chamberlain had his paper  
Jesus had his cross  
They held on  
We held on to what
