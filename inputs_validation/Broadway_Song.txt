Id like to sing you a Broadway song  
I hope that youll all sing along  
A little dancing and some sentiment to put your  
Mind at ease  
  
Id like to play you something low and sexy  
Look at our dancers theyre so young and pretty Hi Olga  
And when we start to groove you can hear the  
Saxophones blow  
  
Ah show business its just a wonderful thing  
All I want is to get down on my knees and sing  
  
For you  
And let the saxophones blow  
Blow baby blow  
  
Id like to sing you a Broadway song  
I hope that youll all sing along  
A little dancing and some sentiment to put your  
Mind at ease  
  
I want to bring a tear to your eye  
Awww good old Poe dont he make you cry  
Aint it great the way he writes about the  
Mysteries of life  
  
Ah show business is just a wonderful thing  
All I want is to get down on my knees and sing  
  
For you  
And let the saxophones blow  
Blow baby blow  
Go goose go
