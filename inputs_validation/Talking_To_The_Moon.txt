I know youre somewhere out there  
Somewhere far away  
I want you back  
I want you back  
My neighbors think Im crazy  
But they dont understand  
Youre all I have  
Youre all I have  
  
Chorus  
At night when the stars  
Light up my room  
I sit by myself  
Talking to the moon  
Tryin to get to you  
In hopes youre on  
The other side  
Talking to me too  
Or am I a fool  
Who sits alone  
Talking to the moon  
  
Oh  
  
Im feeling like Im famous  
The talk of the town  
They say Ive gone mad  
Yeah Ive gone mad  
But they dont know what I know  
  
Cause when the sun goes down  
someones talking back  
Yeah theyre talking back  
  
Chorus  
  
Ah ah ah  
  
Do you ever hear me calling  
Ah oh oh oh  
Ah oh oh oh  
Cause every night  
Im talking to the moon  
Still trying to get to you  
  
In hopes youre on  
The other side  
Talking to me too  
Or am I a fool  
Who sits alone  
Talking to the moon  
  
I know youre somewhere out there  
Somewhere far away
