Not so long ago my life was oh so easy  
I did what I want said what I want  
I did what I want said what I want  
Not so long ago my life was oh so easy  
I did what I want said what I want  
I did what I want and then you came  
Once in my life I found a joy like this  
One special moment captured in a kiss  
For the rest of my life I may never feel like this again again  
I dont know if Im ready I hope Im strong enough  
To be a man that someone can depend on  
I dont know if Im ready but I know Ive got enough love  
As the days go by I see that its so easy  
To do what I want say what I want  
Do what I want say what I want  
As the days go by yeah I feel that its so easy  
To do what I want say what I want do what I want  
And only once in my life I may find a joy like this  
One special moment captured by a kiss  
For the rest of my life I may never feel like this again again  
I dont know if Im ready I hope Im strong enough  
To be a man that someone can depend on  
I dont know if Im ready but I know Ive got enough love  
Ive got enough love ooh yeah Ive got enough love ooh  
And only once in your life you may feel like this  
One special moment captured in a kiss  
For the rest of your life you may never feel like this again  
I dont know if Im ready I hope Im strong enough  
To be a man that someone can depend on  
I dont know if Im ready but I know Ive got enough love
