Go swiftly  
The flags and drums can hypnotise  
When glory has faded the dream  
Is worth more than the prize  
A twisting turning flame  
And a freedom burning bright  
Knows all of the names  
And all of the games  
Of the yellow black and white  
Weve gotta have faith  
To work it out  
Faith and hope  
Without any doubt  
Give us strength to make a start  
Put a song in our hearts  
Were never gonna break down these walls  
And build a prison with a stone  
Cause you know what love is worth  
Were gonna build a heaven on earth  
Were running in the wheels of fortune  
Turning water into wine  
Were gonna take love and make it shine  
Were gonna find peace in our time  
Softly softly  
When there is lightning in the sky  
When the rivers are rising and  
Trouble rolls in on the tide  
Well keep on keeping on  
Til all the tears are dry  
Well weather the storm  
Welcome the dawn  
Of tomorrow you and I  
Weve gotta have faith  
And get it fast  
Faith and hope  
And make it last  
Give us strength  
To reach the stars  
Put a song in our hearts  
Were never gonna break down these walls  
And build a prison with a stone  
Cause you know what love is worth  
Were gonna build a heaven on earth  
Were running in the wheels of fortune  
Turning water into wine  
Were gonna take love and make it shine  
Were gonna find peace in our time  
Were raisin the dust  
Its heaven or bust  
And well see this dream come true  
Were gonna have faith faith  
The road will be long  
But theres hope hope  
To carry us on  
Well have strength strength  
Well never go wrong  
With this song in our hearts  
Were never gonna break down these walls  
And build a prison with a stone  
Cause you know what love is worth  
Were gonna build a heaven on earth  
Were running in the wheels of fortune  
Turning water into wine  
Were gonna take love and make it shine  
Were gonna find peace in our time  
At the sign sign  
Of the dove  
Is gonna shine shine  
On a wing  
And a prayer  
Well be fine  
Fine  
Fine  
Were never gonna break down these walls  
And build a prison with a stone  
Cause you know what love is worth  
Were gonna build a heaven on earth  
Were running in the wheels of fortune  
Turning water into wine  
Were gonna take love and make it shine  
Were gonna find peace in our time
