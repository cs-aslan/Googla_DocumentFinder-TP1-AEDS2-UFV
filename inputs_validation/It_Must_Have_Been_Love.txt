It must have been love  
  
  
Lay a whisper on my pillow  
Leave the winter on the ground  
I wake up lonely  
Theres air of silence  
In the bedroom and all around  
Touch me now  
I close my eyes and dream away  
  
It must have been love but its over now  
It must have been good but I lost it somehow  
It must have been love but its over now  
From the moment we touched til the time had run out  
  
Makebelieving were together  
That Im sheltered by your heart  
But in and outside  
Ive turned to water like a teardrop in your palm  
And its a hard winters day  
I dream away  
  
It must have been love but its over now  
It was all that I wanted  
Now Im living without  
It must have been love but its over now  
Its where the water flows  
Its where the wind blows
