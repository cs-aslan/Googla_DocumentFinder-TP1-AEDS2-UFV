Ive known bad women  
Ive had bad wine  
Ive had nights filled with bad dreams  
Tasted bad food and bad water  
And Ive read about bad rain  
  
Yeah I only know of one thing  
With an ironclad guarantee  
Cause I aint never seen no bad love  
Never heard about no bad love  
Ive never really seen no bad love  
Well no bad love well no bad love  
  
You know how I love music  
As long as it aint square  
To be bad music is dont move  
Too smooth no groove happening there  
  
Ive known a few bad ladies  
All of them got me hurt  
Some of them women that seemed sweet  
Complete they treat you like dirt  
  
Chorus  
But I aint never seen no bad love  
Never heard about no bad love  
I never really seen no bad love  
No bad love no bad love  
  
Ive seen a lot of bad movies  
I saw one just last night  
Aint got no action and it aint got no plot  
Thats not what I like  
  
You can even get a bad education  
But that wont get you nowhere  
But somebodys gonna say  
That school aint cool  
What fool wants to go there  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Ive had bad days and had bad nights  
But I never had me no bad love  
And a Cadillac Fleetwood with a bad ride  
But I never had me no bad love  
Ive had bad things happen to me all my life  
But I never had me no bad love  
  
Whew whew whew whew whew whew hoo  
But I never had me no bad love  
Had a Cadillac car
