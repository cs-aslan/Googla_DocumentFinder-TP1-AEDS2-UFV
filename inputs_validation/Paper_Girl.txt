Dont you call me up  
To tell me that youre lonely  
I wont make things up  
To tell you that theyre only for you  
Cause that wouldnt make you feel any different about me  
Without me  
A message to the paper girl  
Dont fall apart so easily  
Dont cry too much youll get all wet  
And that dont make much sense to me you see  
Cause that would mend my heart and I wont feel blue  
Thats not true  
I need more but its not like me to fuss  
With the problems of us  
When its likely to be in this state with me  
But here I go again  
And the paper girls gonna blow away  
And its one game that I wont play for you  
For you and me
