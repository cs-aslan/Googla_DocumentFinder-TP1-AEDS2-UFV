Heaven  
You say it could be heaven  
But I dont really know  
Lovers come and go  
When hot gets a little cold  
  
Infatuation is just the great anticipation  
Of starring in that picture show  
Lets wait until the credits roll  
When hot gets a little cold  
  
I could get carried away but not anymore  
What was it I heard you say you love me cause Im strong  
I hope that youre not wrong  
  
Heaven you say it could be heaven  
Well I dont really know  
Ill try not to let it show  
When hot gets a little cold  
When hot gets a little cold  
When hot gets a little cold
