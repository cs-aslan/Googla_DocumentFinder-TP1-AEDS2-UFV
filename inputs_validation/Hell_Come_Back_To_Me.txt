Do you hear  
What I hear  
Or can I have been deceived   
Voices singing  
Bells are ringing  
They say  
Hell come back to me  
  
Though hes gone  
In my sleep  
As if he were here with me  
Hell be back now  
I can tell now  
Youll see  
Hell come back to me  
  
Once more once more  
Tell me that hes still sure  
I know I know  
That he loves me much more  
And Ill be here waiting  
Until he comes back to me  
  
Theres one thing  
You should know  
Just how much I love him so  
Though he hurt me  
He wont desert me  
And now  
Hell come back to me  
  
Once more once more  
Tell me that hes still sure  
I know I know  
That he loves me much more  
And Ill be here waiting  
Until he comes back to me  
  
Theres one thing  
You should know  
Just how much I love him so  
Though he hurt me  
He wont desert me  
And now  
Hell come back to me  
  
So you see  
Patiently  
Ill be waiting here for his call  
Voices singing  
Church bells ringing  
To say  
Hes come back to me
