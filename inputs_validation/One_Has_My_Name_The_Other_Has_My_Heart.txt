One has my name the other has my heart  
With one Ill remain thats how my heartaches start  
One has brown eyes the others eyes are blue  
To one I am tied to the other I am true  
  
One has my love the other only me  
But what good is love to a heart that cant be free  
So Ill go on livin my life just the same  
While one has my heart the other has my name  
  
One has my love the other only me  
But what good is love to a heart that cant be free  
If I could live over my life I would change  
The one who has my heart would also have my name
