Ive been romanced and dined and danced  
Crazy nights and wild times  
But life has lost its mystery  
And love is blind cannot find me  
Im blowin away  and shadows take my love and leave  
Im blowin away  these shadows keep takin my love and leavin me  
I have cast aside my foolish pride  
Im goin down for the last time  
I have searched this earth and sailed these seas  
But love is blind cannot find me  
Im blowin away  and shadows take my love and leave  
Im blowin away  these shadows keep takin my love and leavin me  
Repeat last two lines
