Staring from my room I see them  
Holding hands wish I could be them  
Lovers doing what we use to do  
But Im stuck here alone  
Thats the way its been here lately  
Youre too busy now to save me  
Feels like you forget Im waiting for you  
  
Sometimes I wish I could just let go  
But I love you I love you  
And I believe that one day you will come around  
But can you tell me  
  
How do I always end up being the girl at the window  
Window window  
I tell myself Im not gonna wait for you whenever you go  
You go you go  
You give me your word and I always take it  
You say youll be home but you never make it  
So why do I  
Always end up that girl at the window the window  
The girl at the window  
  
I know youre working thats why youre leaving  
I will never argue your reasons  
If this means that you believe in them  
Oh time goes on and were growing apart  
Broken promises break my heart  
Please dont give me a reason to say goodbye  
  
Sometimes I wish I could just let go  
But I love you I love youAnd I believe that one day you will come around  
But can you tell me  
  
How do I always end up being the girl at the window  
Window window  
I tell myself Im not gonna wait for you whenever you go  
You go you go  
You give me your word and I always take it  
You say youll be home but you never make it  
So why do I  
Always end up that girl at the window the window  
The girl at the window  
  
How can I be what youre saying  
When you keep turning all the pages  
Am I suppose to believe your words are true  
Dont take advantage of me cause you know I wont leave you  
I make sure you know I always wanna see you  
Whoa wont you do it for me too  
  
Oh how do I always end up being the girl at the window  
Window window  
I tell myself Im not gonna wait for you whenever you go  
You go you go  
You give me your word and I always take it  
You say youll be home but you never make it  
So why do I  
Always end up that girl at the window the window  
The girl at the window
