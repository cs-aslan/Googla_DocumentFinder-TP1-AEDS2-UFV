Well I said goodbye to Rosie Rooke this morning  
Im gonna miss her bloodshot alcoholic eyes  
She wore her Sunday hat so shed impress me  
Im gonna carry her memory til the day I die  
  
Theyll move me up to Muswell Hill tomorrow  
Photographs and souvenirs are all Ive got  
Theyre gonna try and make me change my way of living  
But theyll never make me something that Im not  
  
Cause Im a Muswell Hillbilly boy  
But my heart lies in old West Virginia  
Never seen New Orleans Oklahoma Tennessee  
Still I dream of the Black Hills that I aint never seen  
  
Theyre putting us in little boxes  
No character just uniformity  
Theyre trying to build a computerized community  
But theyll never make a zombie out of me  
  
Theyll try and make me study elocution  
Because they say my accent isnt right  
They can clear the slums as part of their solution  
But theyre never gonna kill my cockney pride  
  
Cause Im a Muswell Hillbilly boy  
But my heart lies in Old West Virginia  
Though my hills are not green  
I have seen them in my dreams  
Take me back to those Black Hills  
That I have never seen
