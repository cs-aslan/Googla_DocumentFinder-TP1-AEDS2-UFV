Dont think of what we can and cant achieve  
Perfection like this cant be guaranteed  
Hearts get lost lovers leave  
Lets just see what friendship actually needs  
And if ever you do wrong Im right behind you  
If ever you may sin count me in  
If that devil doubt should come to find you  
Count on me and you dont count on him  
If luck should quit this town  
If fortune sails  
If conversation breaks down  
If love derails  
Ill be that back up call  
If all else fails  
Ill swap this bed of roses  
For a bed of nails  
I wouldnt mind being left up on that shelf  
If I hadnt actually built built the thing myself  
But since theres only you and no one else  
I dont get too wound up about my health  
And if ever shelf may fall Im right below you  
In need of DIY then Im your guy  
If lack of confidence should come to know you  
Dont let those tears you cry stop you and I  
If luck should quit this town  
If fortune sails  
If conversation breaks down  
If love derails  
Ill be that back up call  
If all else fails  
Ill swap this bed of roses  
For a bed of nails
