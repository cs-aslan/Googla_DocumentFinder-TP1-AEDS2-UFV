Im sweating again I always do  
I should probably take another pill or two  
In the mirror I see the face of Frankenstein  
And that face is mine  
I go to work at subway slicing ham chop chop  
Cut my finger off again ah damn  
I walk home tryin to dodge and hide from thugs  
They like to beat on scrubs  
I go through this all the time though I call  
J where the fuck you at  
The mall  
Did you get your ass stomped again  
No yes ha ha so  
Nobody sees what I see do they  
They just cast me aside put me away  
No friends no style no place to go  
Til I went juggalo  
  
Its all in you everybody  
Its all for you hey hey  
Its all in you come on  
Its all thats left to do  
Thats why its all in you juggalos  
Its all for you  
Its all in you  
Its all thats left to do  
Thats why its all in you juggalos  
  
Look at me now man brain dead  
I could derail a fucking train with my forehead  
I now live by the carnival dominion  
So mother fuck your opinion  
Im a looney path  
I kill pedestrians families neighbors best of friends anybody  
And if I dont kill them I keep them in my basement and drill em dead  
Just kiddin all I really did is unlock the forbidden  
I just let my fucking mind unwind  
I dont care what you think you dont innertwine  
Fuck the world fuck everybody in it  
Even the sneaker pimps girl Id fuck her in a minute  
You can live to impress and dress fresh bitch  
I dont care fuck everybody out there  
  
Riders loonies stalkers fat mans gangstas nymphos assholes  
Crackheads  
  
I smoke peace pipes with Indian war chiefs  
I steal jewels with Chinese ninja thieves  
I dress whales like guppies and crush walls  
I throw giant ice bergs like snowballs  
I surf tidal wave drink molten rock  
Ill put a fucking tornado in a headlock  
Ill go to Italy and straighten that tower  
Whatever the fuck I want with the juggalos power  
  
Its all in you juggalos  
Its all for you come on  
Its all in you hey hey hey  
Its all thats left to do  
Thats why its all in you hey hey  
Its all for you come on  
Its all in you hey  
Its all thats left to do thats why its all in you  
Psychos exconvicts cleptos whinos lions stranglas  
  
Here I go again another day  
Dealing with these mother fucking idiots  
At subway  
Its OK cause now I see behind it and I keep myself  
Reminded  
None of these nine to five robot puppets that I see are any better  
Than me mother fucker they just strugglin in the world they choose  
Im waitin on the wagons with my juggalos
