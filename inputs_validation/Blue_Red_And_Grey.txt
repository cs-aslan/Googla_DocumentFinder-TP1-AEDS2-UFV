This song was played live in Champaign il  
  
Some people seem so obsessed with the morning  
Get up early just to watch the sunrise  
Others like it more when theres fire in the sky  
Worship the sun when its high  
Some people go for those sultry evenings  
Cocktails in the blue red and grey  
But I like every minute of the day  
I dig every second  
So long as you are on my mind  
Each precious moment has its special charm  
Its all right when youre around rain or shine  
I know a crowd who only lives after midnight  
Their faces always seem so pale  
And then theres friends of mine who must have sunlight  
They say a suntan never fails  
I know I was a man who worked a night shift  
I was lucky to get a job and some pay  
Now I like every minute of the day  
I dig every second  
I could laugh in the snow and rain  
I get a buzz from being cold and wet  
The pleasure seems to balance out the pain  
And so you see that Im completely crazy  
I even shun the south of France  
The people on my hill they say Im lazy  
But when they sing I Uh  
But when they sleep I sing and dance  
I know a crowd who Or something  
Cocktails in the blue red and grey  
But I like every minute of the day  
I like every minute of the day
