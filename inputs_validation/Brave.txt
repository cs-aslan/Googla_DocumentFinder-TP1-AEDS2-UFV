Its a new day new day and its evident  
You must have been heavensent  
Sometimes we should be hesitant but Im not at all  
Just feelin more confident  
Just using my common sense  
Just trust in it Im lovin it  
  
I cant refuse an offer so benevolent  
Cant assume hes gon use me  
And after hell never call again  
Dont be afraid dont be afraid  
This is your day this is your day  
  
Chorus  
Its time to be brave  
Say Im not afraid not anymore  
I used to be cold now the temperatures changed  
It just aint the same  
Im not afraid Im not afraid  
Cus Ive become brave  
As the light of day straight into a cave  
To show me the way that I might be saved  
Now Im turning the page  
Thanks to the power of love I can love  
Because I am brave  
  
  
I am brave I am brave  
  
I heard him say this thing moving too fast for him  
Its a feelin I was straddeling  
Foolishly adamant but Its all in his eyes  
Really wish he would let me in  
Cus the same way Im scared of him  
Im scared of being hurt again  
  
Its time to let go let go of your heart  
Its time for a brand new start  
Never know we might never part  
Baby dont be afraid dont be afraid  
This is your day this is your day  
  
Chorus  
  
I wouldnt take back anything that Ive gone through no  
I pray for strength for anything that Im gonna do  
Whether joy or its pain Im still okay I Im still okay  
Im a be alright cause Im not afraid  
No I am brave brave  
  
Chorus  
  
I am brave
