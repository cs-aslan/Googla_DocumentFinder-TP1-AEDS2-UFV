Too many problems oh why am I here  
I need to be me cause youre all to clear  
And I can see theres something wrong with you  
Oh what do you expect me to do  
At least I gotta know what I want to be  
Dont come to me if you need pity  
Are you lonely you got noone  
You got your body in suspension  
Thats a problem problem problem  
The problem is you  
Eat your heart out on a plastic tray  
You dont do what you want and you fade away  
You work for me youre working ninetofive  
Its too much fun of being alive  
Im using my feet for my human machine  
You work for me living for the screen  
Are you lonely all needs catered  
You got your brains dehydrated  
  
Problem problem problem the problem is you  
Oh what what you gonna do problem problem  
Problem problem problem the problem is you  
Well what you gonna do with your problem  
The problem is you problem  
  
I aint death trip but I aint automatic  
You work for me just stay ecstatic  
Dont you give me any orders  
To people like me there is no order  
  
Bet you thought you had it all worked out  
Bet you thought you knew what I was about  
Bet you thought youd solved all your problems  
But you are the problem  
  
Problem problem problem the problem is you  
Oh what you gonna do with your problem  
Ill leave it up to you oh problem  
The problem is you you got a problem  
Oh what you gonna do  
They know a doctor gonna take you away  
They take you away and they throw away the key  
They dont want you and they dont want me  
You got a problem the problem is you  
Problem well what you gonna do  
Problem have you got a problem  
Problem well you got a problem  
  
Repeat x17  
Problem
