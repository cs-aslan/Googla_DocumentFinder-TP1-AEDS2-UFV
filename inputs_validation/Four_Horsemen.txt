Well they were given the grapes that go ripe in the sun  
That loosen the screws at the back of the tongue  
But they told no one where they had begun  
Four horsemen  
  
They were given all the foods of vanity  
And all the instant promises of immortality  
But they bit the dust screamin insanity  
Four horsemen  
  
One was over the edge one was over the cliff  
One was lickin em dry with a bloody great spliff  
When they picked up the hiker he didnt want the lift  
From the horsemen  
  
But you  
Youre not searching are you now  
Youre not looking anyhow  
Youre never gonna ride that lonely mile  
Or put yourself up on trial  
Oh you told me how your life was so bad  
An I agree that it does seem sad  
But thats the price that you gotta pay  
If youre lazing all around all day  
Four horsemen coming right through  
Four horsemen and theyre pissing by you  
They make you look like youre wearing a truss  
Four horsemen and its gonna be us  
  
Well they gave us everything for bending the mind  
And we cleaned out their pockets and we drank em blind  
Its a long way to the finish so dont get left behind  
By those horsemen  
  
And they gave us the grapes that went ripe in the sun  
That loosen the screws at the back of the tongue  
But we still told nothing bout what was to come  
Four horsemen
