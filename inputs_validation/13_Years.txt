Woke up sweating in the sun  
Sprawled across my big brothers grave  
Shaking and drunk with sleep  
I crawled to my feet and walked up into the shade  
Of a young elm tree that must have been planted since the last we came  
Vicki my mom and me cleaned the dirt  
From the plaque that says his name  
Walking to my girlfriends car  
Came back down on me  
Yeah I guess I fell to my knees  
To keep from falling facefirst into the dream  
The vision that had had me twisting out under the afternoon sky  
I didnt know it then  
But it was thirteen years to the day he died  
  
He held his hand in me  
Like brothers we walked  
Through the colorless world of an alcohol dream  
I talked for hours  
Trying the break through the silence  
That he held over me  
Then he started away turned his head  
Keep it up so you can die like me  
  
Ever since my brother odied  
Ive drifted all over from town to town to town  
Every place I go its always the same  
I keep doing junk I keep going down  
My mama got religion and my sisters gave up  
Man I just gave up too  
I just died inside  
Dont wanna die like george  
Everybody says theres things to see  
Everybodys pointing their fingers at me  
  
I woke up driving  
After another blackout from another bad drug  
I cant shake this hell that I made for myself  
For every other life I took  
See my sisters son walk the line I walked  
Hes only sixteen  
If he dont learn from my mistakes  
Hes gonna waste away  
Hes gonna die like me
