Tell me now  
Or are you teasing  
I felt the cold hard facts of life  
Five degrees from freezing  
Does it amuse you to always  
Hurt me so  
It try my best its not enough  
Should I give up and let you  
  
What more is there to take from me  
Theres nothing else to give you dear  
Theres nothing more that I can lose  
Except this heart shaped bruise  
  
It will fade  
From purple to violet  
It will fade  
Just as the day dissolves into twilight  
  
Tell me now  
Or am I only dreaming  
You said that youd be mine for life  
And now you say youre leaving  
If I could hold you once more  
Before you go  
When I approach you just lash out  
Should I give up and let you  
  
What more is there to take from me  
Theres nothing left give you dear  
Theres nothing else that I can lose  
Except this heart shaped bruise  
  
It will fade from purple to violet  
It will fade  
Shes pulling out the pin
