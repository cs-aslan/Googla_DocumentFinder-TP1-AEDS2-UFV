Live life given now  
Tomorrow can wait  
Dance all through the night  
Sleeping all day  
Stuck inside a box  
You gotta get out  
Stand up get up  
Live your life now come on  
  
Stand up get up  
Come on yeah yeah yeah  
Come on come on  
  
Chorus  
Live life given now  
Tomorrow can wait  
Dance all through the night  
Sleeping all day  
Stuck inside a box  
You gotta get out  
Stand up get up  
Live your life now come on  
  
Stand up get up  
Lets go right now  
  
People lining through this life we lead  
Never knowing what well find out  
So we living working and waiting for the day  
Therell be something thats coming to take the pain away  
And we wait for nothing inside your ways  
You gotta let that fun girl through  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes it feels  
How love indeed  
And when just floating  
Searching infinity  
infinity  
infinity  
infinity  
infinity  
  
Come on and dance here tonight  
Tomorrow can wait  
Dance all through the night  
Sleeping through day  
Stuck inside a box  
You gotta get out  
Stand up get up  
Live your life now come on
