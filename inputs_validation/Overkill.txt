Only way to feel the noise is when its good and loud  
So good I cant believe it screaming with the crowd  
Dont sweat it well get it back to you  
Dont sweat it well get it back to you  
Overkill overkill overkill  
  
On your feet you feel the beat it goes straight to your spine  
Shake your head you must be dead if it dont make you fly  
Dont sweat it well get it back to you  
Dont sweat it well get it back to you  
Overkill overkill overkill  
  
Know your bodys made to move ya feel it in your guts  
Rock n roll aint worth the name if it dont make a strut  
Dont sweat it well get it back to you  
Dont sweat it well get it back to you  
Overkill overkill overkill
