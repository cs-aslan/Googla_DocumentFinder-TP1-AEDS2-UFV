Where do you go when youve somewhere to run  
But the time isnt right and theres things to be done  
And youre trapped halfway up you dont want to go back  
So you keep going on  compromising the lack  
  
And you see the green fields as you travel on by  
And you look at the things youd forgotten to try  
And you wish you were young and you wish you were old  
For the songs always sung and the stories been told  
  
And you thought you were different but what did it mean  
For you tricked yourself trying  lifes still unseen  
As it is as it was as it always will be  
Will you find out at all what it is to be free  
  
See it never was easy to live with a head  
So I kept to the back room and I live there instead  
What comes from the frontroom is only for Friends  
I have a bay window but thats where it ends  
  
And its here I see pictures and my madness is clear  
And theres no longer logic so therefore no fear  
And Im almost dead with uncontrollable light  
Sometimes when Ive written a song  its alright
