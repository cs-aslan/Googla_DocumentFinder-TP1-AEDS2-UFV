Well if love is blind  
Then homes where the heart is  
How we ever gonna get back where we started  
From now on run with blindfolds  
Into the woods till the trees knock us out cold  
Winds shriek like drunken females  
On a hen night last bit of fun  
Till he breaks her heart in a text or an email  
She can deal with the bastard son  
  
Weve got a knife in our hearts and a fork in the road  
We see a light in the dark but its fading like hope  
Ill make a promise just to break it for the sake of it  
We think that were honest but truth is what we make it to be  
  
Well a stitch in time saves nine thats fine  
But weve all been proper stitched up this time  
Its a right old mess at a grand old time  
Right and left in front and behind  
Its Sunday Sunday another bloody Sunday  
Just a day till another bloody Monday  
Morning yawning boring snoring  
In front of the boss when you just got a warning  
  
Weve got a knife in our hearts and a fork in the road  
We see a light in the dark but its fading like hope  
Ill fall in love with you and love you can fall in love with me  
Just so theres someone else to blame when it all falls down  
When it all falls down down down  
When it all falls down down  
  
So lets get some fire in our hearts  
And a yellow brick road  
Im getting bored of the dark  
We could turn the lights on you know  
Ill make a promise and Ill keep it for the sake of it  
We could tell the truth for once see just how we take to it  
We could walk in forests and climb up every tree  
Well build our house upon the sand every day in the sea  
Ill fall in love with you and love you can fall in love with me  
Just so theres somebody else  
Just so theres somebody else  
Just so theres somebody else
