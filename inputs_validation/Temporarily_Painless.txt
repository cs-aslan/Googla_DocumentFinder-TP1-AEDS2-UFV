Verse 1  
We dont have to explain it  
The beat is way too loud  
Even though the lights faded  
I still saw you in the crowd  
When I put you in my arm  
Feel it all through me  
When you promise me nothing  
You give me everything I need  
  
PreChorus  
She comes over  
Were both not sober  
Its like were losing our minds  
We kiss like lovers  
And Cupid hovers  
Like hes just learning to fly  
And even though its dangerous  
Its temporarily painless  
Im falling for a stranger stranger  
  
Chorus  
No need to justify  
Little by little we love tonight  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
No need to justify  
All I wanna be is your friend tonight  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
I need somebody  
  
Verse 2  
Dont even know what your name is  
When I taste your skin  
I dont wanna sound shameless  
I just wanna bring your body  
Wanna push you in my place  
Either hear you scream  
You dont even have to stay  
Oh but I dont think you wanna leave  
  
PreChorus  
She comes over  
Were both not sober  
Its like were losing our minds  
We kiss like lovers  
And Cupid hovers  
Like hes just learning to fly  
And even though its dangerous  
Its temporarily painless  
Im falling for a stranger stranger  
  
Chorus  
No need to justify  
Little by little we love tonight  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
No need to justify  
All I wanna be is your friend tonight  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
I need somebody  
  
Bridge  
And even though its dangerous  
Its temporarily painless  
Im falling for a stranger stranger  
Even though its dangerous  
Its temporarily painless  
Im falling for a stranger stranger  
  
Chorus  
No need to justify  
Little by little we love tonight  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
No need to justify  
All I wanna be is your friend tonight  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too
