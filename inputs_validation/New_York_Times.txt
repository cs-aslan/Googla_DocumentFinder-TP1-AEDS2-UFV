This for all my niggas in the city  
But this shit really for Queens though  
Really for Queens though  
Big city of dreams motivated by schemes  
Gettin money regimen  
Wit my gettin money machine nah what I mean  
  
New York times  
Come listen to these New York rhymes  
A southern nigga with a New York mind  
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be Kings  
Getting to the money of sins by any means  
As I watch it all pan out try not to stand out  
Fish out of water yet an official reporter  
Up here life is a bitch I blow a kiss at her daughter  
In a city where niggas will leave you shit outta order  
So yeah you heard the news disturbing news  
Shot a brother in the head thank the lord he aint dead  
Was in a coma for months eyes aint opened them once  
My nigga visibly stressed in a mess hes smoking his blunt  
What could I say I cant relate to that  
All I do is pray for that  
This the city god told me go and make it at  
I got a date with destiny Im running late for that  
Grab a paper hey kid you gotta pay for that

They say you can win anywhere if you can win here  
And you aint been no where if you aint been here  
Hustle hard yeah it really aint a game mane  
Same places different faces on the train mane  
New York New York  
  
Hop on the F train took the express train  
Skip that local shit my vocal sick  
Thats how success came  
Once kings now we pawns in this chess game  
Wall street got black slave blood stains  
Which means we built this city  
And never got scraps while the devil got fat  
In fact reparation for niggas in desperation  
Fuck money get my kid a real education  
Blood money spills had a real revelation  
Southside make you realize theres still segregation  
Dont wanna preach Im just thinking out loud  
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking bout how  
My motive to lead my niggas to paradise  
Imagine the world free from pain  
And we no longer scared at night  
Far from the crime the blind leading the blind  
We dont make it prime time till we dyin

How I go from selling reefa and plates  
Till eating steaks with Cole and playing FIFA with Drake  
Shouldve been in the States property of the Jakes  
Now Im plotting on profits and properties on the lake  
Let me properly integrate you to it  
To show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it  
Them niggas talk a lot of shit but they aint been through it  
I done been up in everything cars you never seen  
Citys you never heard of from the streets where they murder  
Police observe us till they reach the verdict  
Kill em all fucking kill em all  
If you cant send em till the pen send em to the morgue  
Send em to the Lord fuck it send his broad  
Hundred shots through the dark but they never hit my heart nigga  
Bitch nigga take a pause  
Hundred shots through the dark you can never hit my heart
