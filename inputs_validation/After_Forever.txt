Have you ever thought about your soul  can it be saved  
Or perhaps you think that when youre dead you just stay in your grave  
Is God just a thought within your head or is he a part of you  
Is Christ just a name that you read in a book when you were in school  
  
When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool  
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope  do you think hes a
fool  
Well I have seen the truth yes Ive seen the light and Ive changed my ways  
And Ill be prepared when youre lonely and scared at the end of our days  
  
Could it be youre afraid of what your friends might say  
If they knew you believe in God above  
They should realize before they criticize  
that God is the only way to love  
  
Is your mind so small that you have to fall  
In with the pack wherever they run  
Will you still sneer when death is near  
And say they may as well worship the sun  
  
I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ  
I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced  
Will you be so sure when your day is near say you dont believe  
You had the chance but you turned it down now you cant retrieve  
  
Perhaps youll think before you say that God is dead and gone  
Open your eyes just realize that hes the one  
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate  
Or will you still jeer at all you hear Yes I think its too late
