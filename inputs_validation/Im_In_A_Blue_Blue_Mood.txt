Im in a blue blue mood  
Now that youre gone away  
Im in a blue blue mood  
Its been a lonesome day  
Im in a blue blue mood  
I miss your caress  
I reach out to hold you  
But youre not there  
Its just my blue blue mood  
  
Maybe someday yeah love will come  
And stay and things will turn  
How bright oh oh oh but for tonight  
Im in a blue blue mood  
  
Im in a blue blue mood  
Im in a blue blue mood  
Im in a blue blue mood
