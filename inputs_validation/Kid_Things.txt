Whats there that makes you want to be lonely  
Whats there to keep you sitting at home  
Hed always say no no no  
As if he wanted you to be hungry  
Well the same things youre missing  
Could get you into something else  
Better leave when to stay  
Is only nothing but being alone  
What I wanted you to know is kid things  
Seemed like nothing at all  
Kid things make it better than it was  
Kid things seemed like nothing at all  
But kid things make it better than it was  
Hey what you got that makes you want to be lonely  
Hey what you got that makes it a better way to be  
She said no no no  
I cant get any love and its a Sunday  
I said oh yeah  
What makes you think I wanted it that way  
Cause one or two more smiles from you  
And I dont need anything else  
What I wanted you to know is kid things  
Seemed like nothing at all  
Kid things make it better than it was  
Were just kids  
We spend all night on the phone  
Its a kid thing  
But I sleep better when Im not alone  
What I want right now is just some more  
Gimme more hey what you think  
Is youre not getting any younger  
What I know is that youre not really very old  
I know you wanna say no no no  
It feels much better in the summer  
Well if it isnt warm where youre sittin  
Then kitten come on in out of the cold  
Cause all I know is when Im with you  
Well I dont need anything else  
What I wanted you to know is kid things  
Seemed like nothing at all  
And kid things make it better than it was  
Were just kids  
We spend all night on the phone  
Its a kid thing  
So I sleep better when Im not alone  
Kid things seemed like nothing at all  
Kid things make it better than it was  
Were just kids just like driving a car  
Its a kid thing and the further out  
The closer in you are
