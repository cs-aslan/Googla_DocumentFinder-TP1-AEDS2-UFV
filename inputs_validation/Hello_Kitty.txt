Moms not home tonight  
So we can roll around have a pillow fight  
Like a major rager OMFG  
  
Lets all slumber party  
Like a fat kid on a pack of Smarties  
Someone chuck a cupcake at me  
  
Its time for spin the bottle  
Not gonna talk about it tomorrow  
Keep it just between you and me  
  
Lets play truth or dare now  
We can roll around in our underwear how  
Every silly kitty should be  
  
Come come Kitty Kitty  
Youre so pretty pretty  
Dont go Kitty Kitty  
Stay with me  
  
Come come Kitty Kitty  
Youre so silly silly  
Dont go Kitty Kitty  
Play with me
