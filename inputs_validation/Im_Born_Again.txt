Im born again I feel free  
No longer alone  
A bright light is shinning  
And shows me a world that I own  
I can see my way through  
I know I will walk beside you  
All those prayers of mine werent in vain  
Im born again  
Im born again I feel free  
Theres a quite different me  
No longer Im tossed like a ship  
On an unruly sea  
Ive been blessed with a love  
Thats meant for the rest of my time  
All those prayers they were not in vain  
Im born again  
Since love touched my heart right  
My life has a meaning  
I feel Im no longer drifting in space  
I believe once again that there is a tomorrow  
A brand new tomorrow I know I can face  
Im born again I feel free  
No longer alone  
A bright light is shinning  
And shows me a world that I own  
I can see my way through  
I know I will walk beside you  
All those prayers of mine werent in vain  
Im born again  
All those prayers they werent in vain  
cause Im born again
