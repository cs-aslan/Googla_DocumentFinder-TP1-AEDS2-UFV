I been ignoring this big lump in my throat  
I shouldnt be crying tears were for the weak  
The days Im stronger know what so I say  
Thats something missing  
  
Whatever it is it feels like its laughing at me through the glass of a two
sided mirror  
Whatever it is its just sitting there laughing at me  
And I just wanna scream  
  
What now I just cant figure it out  
What now I guess Ill just wait it out  
What now Ohhhh what now  
  
I found the one he changed my life  
But was it me that changed  
And he just happened to come at the right time  
Im supposed to be in love  
But Im not mugging  
  
Whatever it is it feels like its laughing at me through the glass of a two
sided mirror  
Whatever it is its just sitting there laughing at me  
And I just wanna scream  
  
What now I just cant figure it out  
What now I guess Ill just wait it out  
What now Please tell me  
What now  
  
Theres no one to call cause Im just playing games with them all  
The more I swear Im happy the more that Im feeling alone  
Cause I spent every hour just going through the motions  
I cant even get the emotions to come out  
Dry as a bone but I just wanna shout  
  
What now I just cant figure it out  
What now I guess Ill just wait it out  
What now Somebody tell me  
What now  
  
I dont know where to go  
I dont know what to feel  
I dont know how to cry  
I dont know ow ow why  
I dont know where to go  
I dont know what to feel  
I dont know how to cry  
I dont know ow ow why  
I dont know where to go  
I dont know what to feel  
I dont know how to cry  
I dont know ow ow why  
  
So what now
