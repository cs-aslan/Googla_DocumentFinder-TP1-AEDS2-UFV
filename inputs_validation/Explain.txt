Its pointless to explain why  
Theres nothing I can say  
My words would all be meaningless  
Anyway  
It seems I cant be trusted  
And I dont disagree  
What made you think I ever really  
Wanted to be  
I cant explain why  
And I dont know when  
Im ever going to want to  
See her again  
Son dont ask why I came here  
Theres nothing I can say  
I dont think Ill be staying very long  
Anyway  
Im trying to find out why  
I came here at all  
I dont think it was to see you  
After all
