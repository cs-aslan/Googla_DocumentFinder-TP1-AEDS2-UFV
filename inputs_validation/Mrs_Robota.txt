Oh everyday and just every night  
I see your face babe on my laptop screen  
Youre high and low and just between  
Oh everyday and just every night  
I send an email to the dream factory  
I asked if youre reality  
But more and more I like you more than just before  
  
Oh la da die oh la da da  
Only a vision Mrs Robota  
Oh oh oh la da die oh la da da  
Only a computer without a heart  
Oh Mrs Robota just a fantasy cant break my heart  
Mrs Robota only a fiction right from the start  
Its impossible  
  
Oh every morning when I wake up  
I push the bottom for a brand new game  
Cant live without you its a shame  
I hear your voice and I see your face  
I cant believe oh babe you blow my mind  
There is no answer I can find  
And more and more I like you more than just before
