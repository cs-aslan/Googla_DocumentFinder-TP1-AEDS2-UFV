Sweat running all over my chest chest I dont quit no

The dreams that I have in store in my mind mind and I know  
That Im makin it I gotta get mine and nobodys takin it away  
No cause hammer dont play that you try to get mine

A get you back and Ill hit with a dose of oaktown power  
And charge you by the hour Im shakin like a quake and funks  
Get devoured I choose to abuse misuse and confuse  
Competitors who think theyre makin up all the rules fools  
In the game lame and insane its a shame I gotta do this but

So roll with a guy whos physical and fit knows the time
