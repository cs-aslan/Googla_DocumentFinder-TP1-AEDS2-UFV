You left in the morning  
You left without a word  
Did you get what you came for  
Is this what I deserve  
  
Oh I know  
The silence was the loudest thing  
Ive ever heard  
Where do we stand  
What am I supposed to do  
Give me the clearest indication  
Im not alone with you  
  
Reach out your hand  
In a world I thought I knew  
I need the clearest indication  
The clearest indication from you  
  
Did we have all we wanted  
And let it slip away in time  
Like a country divided  
Fifty one to forty nine  
  
Years ago  
I suppose we just cant seem to make up our minds  
Where do we stand  
What am I supposed to do  
Give me the clearest indication Im not alone with you  
  
Reach out your hand  
In a world I thought I knew  
I need the clearest indication  
The clearest indication from you  
  
Oh times like these its hard to see  
With any kind of clarity  
Whats the point of wondering anymore  
So much I just cant figure out  
Id love to know without a doubt  
For sure for sure  
Where do we stand  
What am I supposed to do  
Give me the clearest indication Im not alone with you  
  
Reach out your hand  
In a world I thought I knew  
I need the clearest indication  
The clearest indication from you x4  
From you
