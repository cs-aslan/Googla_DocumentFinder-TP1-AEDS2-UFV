I just heard the world  
Is breaking down into bits again  
Tell me what am I to do  
You just want me to stay here  
So Im just going to stay  
the home our last resort  
I built a castle with an iron door  
Lock the window pull the shades  
The hazed out sun wont help anyway  
if the world is crumbling down  
I dont want to be alone no  
Locked up in this place  
I heard the world up late night  
Holding my breath tight  
Trying to keep my head on right  
Theres a chill in the air  
Nobody could care how youre  
Caught up in the fight of your life  
  
fear is bringing me here  
The television got me seeing unclear  
Bravery my neighbor moved away  
Cause I dont need to be courageous today  
and If that world is crumbling down  
I dont want to be alone no  
Locked up in this place  
when I heard the world up late night  
Holding my breath tight  
Trying to keep my head on right  
Theres a chill in the air  
Nobody could care how youre  
Caught up in the fight of your life  
I heard the world up late night  
Holding my breath tight  
Trying to keep my head on right  
Theres a chill in the air  
Nobody could care how youre  
Caught up in the fight of your life  
nothings gonna save me  
Im hanging from the nearest tree  
Nothings gonna save me  
Im hanging from the nearest tree  
when I heard the world up late night  
Holding my breath tight  
Trying to keep my head on right  
Theres a chill in the air  
Nobody could care how youre  
Caught up in the fight of your life  
I heard the world up late night  
Holding my breath tight  
Trying to keep my head on right  
Theres a chill in the air  
Nobody could care how were  
Caught up in the fight of your life  
  
when I heard the world of late night  
See Im holding breath tight  
Im trying to keep my head on right  
Theres a chill in the air  
Nobody could care how were  
Were caught up in the fight of our lives  
I heard the world of late night  
Holding my breath tight  
Trying to keep my head on right  
Theres a chill in the air  
Nobody could care  
Were caught up in the fight of our lives
