Im lost and confused  
Im stuck in your favorite parade  
Im choking I feel strangled  
I cant get a feeling  
Is this a game  
Im begging  
But you wont please me  
How come I bleed for this illusion  
Ive been falling for so long now  
Will I ever see that this isnt real  
  
Then it all comes into the frame  
The struggle it just isnt worth it  
We think we are the originality  
We overdo it and become just the same  
  
Im waiting for a break  
So for it seemed to be out of reach  
  
But today Im god like  
Stay away cause its my time to play  
The revenge feel my wrath  
Stay away because Im back  
Ill join the elite
