Have you talked to the man upstairs  
Cause he wants to hear from you  
Have you talked to the man upstairs  
He will always see you through  
And this trouble ever troubles you  
Now dont you run and hide  
Cause if you ever need a friend  
Hell be there by your side  
Just turn your eyes to Heaven  
And say a simple prayer  
Through the clouds of lace  
Youll see his face  
No matter when or where  
Have you talked to the man upstairs  
Cause he wants to hear from you  
Have you talked to the man upstairs  
He will always see you through  
Have you talked to the man upstairs  
He wants to hear from you  
Have you talked to the man upstairs  
Hes always see you through  
And this trouble ever troubles you  
Well dont you run and hide  
Cause if you ever need a friend  
Hell be there by your side  
If you talk to the man upstairs
