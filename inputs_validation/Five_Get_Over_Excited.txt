James Dean posters on their wall  
Five killed in the carcrash  
What a sad little end to it all  
Five killed in the carcrash  
Last seen having lots of fun  
Five dumped in a river  
Barefoot and on the run  
Five dumped in a river  
I am mad from Scandinavia  
I want a guy in the London area  
He must be crazy and Sagittarius  
Cause Im Leo and Im hilarious  
Fun fun fun

Last seen drinking Daddys own beer  
Five poisoned over dinner  
Singing Abbas Mamma Mia  
Five poisoned over dinner  
Drop dead watching Thunder birds fly  
Five get over excited  
Poster on their wall says Why  
Five get over excited  
I am guy from Camden Town  
My hair is curly but I gel it down  
My clothes are black but my bread is brown  
Im really into early Motown  
Fun fun fun

Fun fun fun  
Feigning concern a conservative pastime  
Makes you feel doubtful right from the start  
The expression she pulls is exactly like last time  
Youve got to conclude she just hasnt a heart
