I been up and down before  
Grief wont hold me any more  
Youre running out of games to play  
I dont have to live this way  
  
Thought I loved you for awhile  
You were loaded up on style  
Talk is cheap but I wont play  
I dont have to live this way  
  
No I wont play the games that youve designed  
And I wont wait to listen to your lines  
Before you speak another word  
Ill repeat it so Im heard  
Youre running out of games to play  
I dont have to live this way  
  
You wont stay another night  
Or did you want another right  
Now Ive got the eyes to see  
You get your kicks by hurting me  
  
No I wont play the games that youve designed  
And I wont wait to listen to your lines  
Before you speak another word  
Ill repeat it so Im heard  
Youre running out of games to play  
I dont have to live this way
