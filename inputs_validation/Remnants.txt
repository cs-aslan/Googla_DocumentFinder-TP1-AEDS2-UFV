Wasting your life on the sidewalk  
When you can be out on the street dodging cars  
As they go by the wind goes right through you  
  
Life on the edge of a razor  
Never knowing when youre to fall  
Sure as hell beats never gambling at all  
  
Lifes too short to just barely exist  
Wide spread mediocracy  
Will suck you up resist  
Another number on a list  
  
I dont want it you can have it  
You can try but you wont make me  
Feel the things you feel  
Ill take my chances til I find a better deal  
Ill take my chances along with all the rest  
  
The snail goes over the razor blade  
The suicide squad of lemmings parade  
To their kingdom where theyve made reservations  
  
I have no reservation  
And I dont think my seats been saved  
Ill take my chances here right
