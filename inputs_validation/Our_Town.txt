This is your town this is my place  
This is where my whole world is lived in  
Nothing much and just out of reach of all the city lights  
Its a high town its a low town  
Its get here come on you grow town  
Noone does but everyone thinks theyre gonna make it soon  
This is one place I respected  
Now I feel its really dejected  
Noone cares and the people just stare  
And a man on the box says  
Hey you dont walk away vote for me  
Youll get more pay keep working hard  
But they work slow  
  
Here it comes now Sunday morning  
Just another sleepy town yawning  
Down below everything looks just like another day  
But in the warm glow of the sunrise  
Theres a child whos searching with young eyes  
Looking round and feeling inside hes gonna fly away  
There was one time I was leaving  
But the folks around me kept grieving  
Friends said go but my dad said no  
And my mum kept saying  
Dont go dont go away  
Dont leave us youve got to stay  
Just raise them kids oh mother no  
  
No prospects just projects  
Dont try to tell me were living  
Theres no real need to try  
Cant you see this town gonna die  
  
Hail the new age its a rat cage  
Join the place for breeding dumb spieces  
All stacked up and doing whatever someone tells you to  
Burn the place down make it dead ground  
Show the people just what theyre missing  
Wake up wake up cant you believe in what Im telling you  
Theres a house where I was born in  
Now its changed without any warning  
Cranes just crash and bricks just smash  
While a billboards saying  
Lets go lets get away  
Come fly me youve weeks to pay  
When sunshine calls but I wont go  
  
This is our town
