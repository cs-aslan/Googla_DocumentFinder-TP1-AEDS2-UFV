The language of love  
Slips from my lovers tongue  
Cooler than ice cream  
And warmer than the sun  
Dumb hearts get broken  
Just like china cups  
The language of love  
Has left me broken on the rocks  
  
But theres just one thing  
Just one thing  
But theres just one thing  
And I really wanna know  
  
Whos that girl  
Running around with you  
Tell me  
Whos that girl  
Running around with you  
  
The language of love  
Has left me stony gray  
Tongue tied and twisted  
At the price Ive had to pay  
Your careless notions  
Have silenced these emotions  
Look at all the foolishness  
Your lovers talk has done
