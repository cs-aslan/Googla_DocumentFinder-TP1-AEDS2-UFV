Have you found your way around the down and out  
I know it must seem long so long  
Im still trying to keep this time from runnin out  
Head down always movin on and on and on  
I never heard this warnin  
  
Another early mornin takes me wakes me into  
If you could manage me Ill try to manage you  
But lately its all I ever do  
I felt like this on my way home  
  
Im not scared  
I pass boats and the Kingdome  
Im not scared  
Ill never tell you the secrets Im holdin  
I know these things must bore you  
I cant find another way  
Ill never tell you the secrets Im holdin  
I love this leash that holds me  
When I try to run away  
  
I felt like this on my way home  
Im not scared  
I pass boats and the Kingdome  
Im not scared  
  
I felt like this on my way home  
Im not scared  
I pass boats and the Kingdome  
Im not scared  
  
I felt like this on my way home  
Im not scared  
I pass boats and the Kingdome  
Im not scared  
  
I felt like this on my way home  
Im not scared  
I pass boats and the Kingdome  
Im not scared  
  
I felt like this on my way home  
Im not scared  
I pass boats and the Kingdome  
Im not scared  
  
I felt like this on my way home  
Im not scared  
I pass boats and the Kingdome  
Im not scared
