Heal myself a feather on my heart  
Look inside there never was a start  
Peel myself dispose of severed skin  
All subsides around me and within  
  
Theres nothing painful in this  
Theres no upheaval  
Redemption for my pathos  
All sins undone  
  
Awaiting word on whats to come  
In helpless prayers a hope lives on  
As Ive come clean Ive forgotten what I promised  
In the rays of the sun I am longing for the darkness
