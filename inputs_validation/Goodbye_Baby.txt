Dont take me to the tower  
And take my child away  
It was I who was  
The hourglass  
And the sands of time like  
Shattering glass went past me  
Like a tunnel to the sea  
  
And I who went to sleep as two  
Woke up as one now only you remain  
Youll close your eyes and travel back  
To the time when the light went fading fast  
And the words youll never never forget oh no  
As you slipped away  
  
Goodbye baby  
I hope your hearts not broken  
Dont forget me  
Yes I was outspoken  
You were with me all the time  
Ill be with you one day  
  
And I who went to sleep in tears  
Woke up in tears for all of the years  
And I who never never said goodbye  
As I slipped away  
  
Goodbye baby  
I hope your hearts not broken  
Dont forget me  
Yes I was outspoken  
You were with me all the time  
Ill be with you one day  
  
Goodbye baby  
I hope your hearts not broken  
Dont forget me  
Yes I was outspoken  
You were with me all the time  
Ill be with you one day  
  
Yes Ill be with you one day
