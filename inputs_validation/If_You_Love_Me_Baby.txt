If you leave me baby  
I dont know what Ill do  
I guess I would die sweetheart  
If I dont get a kiss from you  
  
Take out some insurance on me baby  
Take out some insurance on me baby  
Well if you ever ever say goodbye  
Im gonna go right home and die  
  
Oh if you want me baby  
Youve gotta come to me  
Mm Im just like a stump in a field  
You just cant move me  
  
Take out some insurance on me baby  
Ooh some insurance on me baby  
Well if you ever ever say goodbye  
Im gonna go right home and die  
  
Well if you want me baby  
  
Mm youve gotta come to me  
Im just like a stump in a field  
You just cant move me  
  
Take out some insurance on me baby  
Mm some insurance on me baby  
Well if you ever ever say goodbye  
Im gonna go right home and die  
  
Well if you leave me baby  
I dont know what Ill do  
I guess I would die sweetheart  
If I dont get a kiss from you  
  
Take out some insurance on me baby  
Mm some God damned insurance on me baby  
If you ever ever say goodbye  
Im gonna go right home and die
