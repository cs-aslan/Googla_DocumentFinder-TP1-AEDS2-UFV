Ballerina Girl  
You are so lovely  
With you standing there  
Im so aware  
Of how much I care for you  
  
You are more than now  
You are for always  
I can see in you  
My dreams come true  
Dont you ever go away  
  
You make me feel like  
Theres nothing I cant do  
And when I hold you  
I only want to say  
I love you  
  
Ballerina Girl  
The joy you bring me  
Every day and night  
Holding you tight  
How Ive waited for your love  
  
Sometimes Ive wondered  
If youd ever come my way  
Now that Ive finally found you  
This is where my heart will stay  
  
Im never gonna break your heart  
Never will we drift apart  
Cause all I want to do  
Is share my whole life with you  
  
Cause you make me feel like  
Theres nothing I cant do  
I guess I finally realized  
Theres nothing else like loving you  
  
Ballerina Girl  
You are so lovely  
I can see in you  
My dreams come true  
Dont you ever go away  
Ballerina Girl
