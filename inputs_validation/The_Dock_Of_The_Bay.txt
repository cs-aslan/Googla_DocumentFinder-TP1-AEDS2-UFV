Sittin in the mornin sun  
Ill be sittin when the evenin comes  
Watchin the ships roll in  
Then I watch em roll away again  
Im sittin on the dock of the bay  
Watchin the tide roll away  
Sittin on the dock of the bay  
Wastin time  
  
Left my home in Georgia  
Headed for the Frisco Bay  
I had nothin to live for  
Looks like nothins gonna come my way  
Im just sittin on the dock of the bay  
Watchin the tide roll away  
Sittin on the dock of the bay wastin time  
  
Looks like nothins gonna change  
Everything everything remains the same  
I cant do what ten people tell me to do  
So I guess Ill just remain the same  
  
Im sittin here restin my bones  
But this loneliness wont leave me alone  
Two thousand miles I roam  
Just to make this dock my home  
Im just gonna sit on the dock of the bay  
Watchin the tide roll away  
Sittin on the dock of the bay  
Wastin time
