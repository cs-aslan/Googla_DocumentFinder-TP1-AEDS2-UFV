Ive seen him plow a field of corn all day  
Thats reality  
His overalls are black with dirt  
But his face is still full of dignity  
He talks about the waether  
And he can tell you when its gonna rain  
Told me bout the flood of TwentyNine  
That washed the crops away  
  
Underneath that Alabama sky  
Grandpa told me bout the things hed seen  
Underneath that Alabama sky  
I listened to my Grandpas memories  
  
At times he mentions Grandma  
Turn his head and wipe away a tear  
Sometimes wed take her picture down  
And sit and pretend that shes still here  
Three girls and two boys he raised on love  
And simple honesty  
And when they finlly have to carry him away  
Theyll take a lot of me  
  
Underneath that Alabama sky  
Grandpa told me bout the things hed seen  
Underneath that Alabama sky  
I listened to my Grandpas memories  
  
Underneath that Alabama sky  
My Grandpa told me bout the things hed seen  
Underneath that Alabama sky  
I listened to my Grandpas memories
