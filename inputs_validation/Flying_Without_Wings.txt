Everybodys looking for that something  
One thing that makes it all complete  
You find it in the strangest places  
Places you never knew it could be  
  
Some find it in the face of their children  
Some find it in their lovers eyes  
Who can deny the joy it brings  
When you found that special thing  
Youre flying without wings  
  
Some find it sharing every morning  
Some in their solitary lives  
You find it in the words of others  
A simple line can make you laugh or cry  
  
You find it in the deepest friendship  
The kind you cherish all your life  
And when you know how much that means  
Youve found that special thing  
Youre flying without wings  
  
So impossible as they may seem  
Youve got to fight for every dream  
Cause whos to know  
Which one you let go  
Would have made you complete  
  
Well for me its waking up beside you  
To watch the sunrise on your face  
To know that I can say I love you  
In any given time or place  
Its little things that only I know  
Those are the things that make you mine  
  
And its like flying without wings  
Cause youre my special thing  
Im flying without wings  
  
And youre the place my life begins  
And youll be where it ends  
Im flying without wings  
And thats the joy you bring  
Im flying without wings
