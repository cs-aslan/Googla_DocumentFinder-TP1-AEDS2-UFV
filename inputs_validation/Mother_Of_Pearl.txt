Underworld the queen of pearls  
Catches the light thats in your eyes  
She has desires and has to get higher  
Trying to love the whole world  
Mother of pearl  
Shes a charity girl  
Giving herself away  
To some body and soul  
Paradise if you pay the price  
Inlaid with love she satisfies  
She has to pray alone everyday  
Lying in wait for the whole wide world  
Mother of pearl  
Shes a charity girl  
Giving herself away  
To some body and soul  
Black seethrough  
Dressed to kill and cast her spell  
Sequins of fire for her loves desire  
Shes drifting away from her open shell  
Mother of pearl  
Shes a charity girl  
Giving herself away  
To some body and soul
