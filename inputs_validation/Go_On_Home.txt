Your watching your watch and I know whats on your mind  
Theres someone home waiting and youre away over time  
What should be so right is as wrong as can be  
Go on home you dont belong here with me  
I love you I love you I love only you  
But the one home whos waiting he loves you too  
Hes worried and hes wondering where can you be  
Go on home you dont belong here with me  
Go on home you dont belong here with me  
Though I want you and I need you desperately  
But to hide here in the darkness is as wrong as can be  
Go on home you dont belong here with me  
Go on home you dont belong here with me
