Whats it to you  
Lets make it new  
Lets make it die make it die  
Theres nothing wrong  
Its lived to long  
And the plesure is yours and mine  
  
You conceived me now you wanna kill me  
It wont be easy hey I wanna be me  
You took me with you now Im gonna kill you  
I want my mom  
  
Whats it to you  
  
Whats it to you  
Cutting through you  
Its still alive still alive  
This thing between us  
audio clip of entire verse  
And its chewing from the inside
