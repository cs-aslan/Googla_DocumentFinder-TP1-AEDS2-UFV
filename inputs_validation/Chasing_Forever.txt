Early mornin wake up  
Gently with the Caress on your hand  
And that Kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan  
Sunshine peekin through the venitian blinds  
  
Four years and like wine you got finer with time  
I got a question if the prodda dressin and the Gucci  
All got goes and the freeze on the Lucci  
I mean real bad girl Im talking rougher than rough  
  
Do you think itd be enough if we just had us  
Dont answer quick think about it cause Im askin for real  
Golddiggers goin to hear this song drivin and crash at the wheel  
Forever is a long time so far we gettin along fine  
  
No car I ever drove no ice I ever saw  
No music I ever made aint nothin I wanted more  
We could deal with whatever together  
Sunshine all that other weather when we chasin forever  
  
Chorus  
I want to stay with you forever  
I want to spend all my life with only you  
I want to stay lets stay together  
Chasing forever with only you  
  
Chasin forever a buckwild endeavorous scene  
Should we pursue with somethin real or just chasin a dream  
Or casin the scene  
Fore I die I plan  
  
To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands  
Now as a man theres certain things Im lackin for sure  
But Im committed to growin and coming at you mature  
In the future I know it aint gonna be all good  
  
But when we feelin the hurt if we willin to work  
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind  
Though I aint no knight and my armor dont shine  
My mom said the lynch pin of love is trust  
  
An taught me monogomy is uh monogamous  
Plus for you dinner by candlelight  
Now dont commit before you sure you understand me right  
Its a race to a strange place most see never  
Its a chase we gotta make together forever  
  
Chorus  
  
Now you would think after all my heartbreaks Id be cruel  
Hiding behind my ego evil but no  
Much the contrary Im very much certain  
You searchin for joy its on the other side of hurtin  
  
Finally found a person worthy of all  
Instead of pushin me down you want to cushion my fall  
Your eyes could make the sun rise all the birds sing  
Seal it with a kiss bind it with a ring  
  
More carrats than even bugs could eat in a week  
An the ribbon in the sky close your eyes dont peek  
Ill tell you what I see in the future  
A hacienda so cute with five little kids callin you mom and callin me dad  
  
Havin more good times than JJ had  
Judging by the look in your eyes you see it  
Let no man sever welcome to forever  
  
Chorus x3
