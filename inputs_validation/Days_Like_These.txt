Somewhere back in time  
I was told by a friend of mine  
That I would meet someone like you  
Someday  
Well I always hoped it was true  
And I never stopped believing  
Youd come along as you did  
In just the perfect way  
Chorus  
Days like these  
I believe  
The worlds such a fine place to be  
After all here we are  
In love just you and me  
Let me take this time  
To thank you for  
Days like these  
You know there is no pot of gold  
At the end of our rainbow  
Theres only love  
Simply love  
Its all that we can share  
For when were old and gray  
And we look back on the days gone by  
Well see the love that we shared  
Is the love we have today  
Repeat Chorus  
Hey yeah yeah  
I want to thank you baby  
Now I cant believe  
This is happening to me  
I look in your eyes  
And its love I see  
And its more than I thought love could be  
Repeat Chorus  
Days  
Like these
