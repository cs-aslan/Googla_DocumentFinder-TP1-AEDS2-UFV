Where have you been are you still on my side  
Is that love or regret that I see in your eyes  
How many years have we played out this game  
Every time we come close the answers always the same  
  
I guess some souls get restless under the skin  
Theres a shortage by half of marrying men  
You know that I love you but I love to be free  
So tell me what do you want yeah from a gypsy like me  
  
I need a ring on my finger champagne on ice  
One man to show me the best part of life  
Is that what you want  
Yeah thats what I need  
  
A home and a family makes sense for us  
A solid foundation built out of trust  
Do you think you can find that with someone like me  
Two arms to hold you one place to be  
Are just some of the things that a woman needs  
  
Ive been shortchanged and cheated so many times  
But youre all that Ive wanted For all of my life  
Ive searched for the reasons known how Ive felt  
But what can I give you when I cant trust myself
