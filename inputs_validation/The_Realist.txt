Ride on these niggaz

Verse 1 Young Jeezy  
Super charger the same color as PJ  
yeaaaaah I got a champagne range  
Pick niggaz off I got a nightscope aim Bah  
Audio video you caught on tape  
Thats a way to get ya ass sent Upstate dayyyum  
In 9AY I took them trips down to Lauderdale  
Back and forth like Aliyah  
Chances of gettin rich is like oneinamillion  
hahaaaaa Or more like twoinabillion  
Flashin lights my minds playin tricks on me  
But the Minuteman still do tricks on me  
Swear the feds just starin at a nigga  
You know you feelin ya heart fall into ya feet  
Summertime niggaz still ridin with the heat  
Jeezy De Niro Snowman Pacino  
Real niggaz love me because I talk that lingo  
Hook Young Jeezy  
And Im the muhfuckin realist  
They lies they phonies they fakes  
These niggaz aint never sold the weight  
And Im the muhfuckin realist  
They lies they phonies they fakes  
These niggaz aint never sold the weight  
And Im the muhfuckin realist  
They lies they phonies they fakes  
These niggaz aint never touched the weight  
And Im the muhfuckin realist  
They lies they phonies they fakes  
These niggaz aint never touched the weight  
And Im the muhfuckin realist  
Verse 2 Young Jeezy  
Nowadays the GTs glock black cheaaa  
The shoes on that motherfucking 380 chrome  
Gotta be careful what you say on the phone  
Im 36 Os away  
From givin the mic up and goin back to the streets naww  
Whats the difference I still eat the same  
A nigga paranoid I still sleep the same  
You niggaz rappin bout blow like its a fad  
Nigga this is my life I aint tryna set trends  
Cause everybody knows how that brickroad ends  
Heartless maybe I need to see the Wizard  
Until then Imma make it snow blizzards  
Hook  
Verse 3 Young Jeezy  
I stay on the block and risk my life  
Day in and day out until a nigga sold out  
You niggaz playin I show you what that street shit bout  
Hit you right up with them thangs and come back with the chains  
Might cook it in the stove might cook it in the microwave  
Either way its gonna sell still weigh it on the scale  
You rappinass niggaz aint never sold no yams  
Im talkin suckafree Sundays and icedout Mondays  
Pinup Tuesdays and bodytap Wednesdays  
You was in the studio I was on the block  
In the kitchen at the spot goin hard with the blocks  
25 for the four ways choppaz by the doorways  
Hook
