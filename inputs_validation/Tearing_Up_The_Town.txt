A shimmer or a shudder a sentence or a shriek  
What other languages do we speak  
I dont know what the answer is but fair dues to you  
A local lack of wisdom never stopped your being true  
A drummer in the basement  
A rhythm  roll at each hands turn  
Finding one thing you can believe in  
Could seem like so much work  
Youve heard the cry before  
Up and away we shall go  
Tearing up the town  
Tearing up the town  
Hurry to dinner son the heat is on  
Your daddys in the oven and your mamma shes gone  
She went down to the clinic but the news was not good  
They told her it was nothing much but shed had quite enough  
The ruins of a household a loverboy who sits and stares  
No No she cried I cant take it Im gonna go out somewhere  
Youve heard the cry before  
Up and away she goes  
Shes tearing up the town  
Tearing up the town  
Tearing up the town  
Now were really with it comrades now were set  
Ben Dolans right behind us with the castanets  
It took a lot of pleading but he came here after all  
And Bens the very boy to take us right to where we want  
Hey look at them couples linking through the rainy streets  
Someplace to be in love the best therell ever be  
Oh sister sadness get yourself behind me  
Oh brother badness why must you deny me  
It doesnt matter where Ive gone  
Im on the run like everyone  
Tearing up the town  
Tearing up the town  
Were tearing up the town
