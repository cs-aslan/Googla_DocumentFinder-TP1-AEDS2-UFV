Im in a clique but I want out  
Its not the same as when I was punched  
In the old days there was enough  
The card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood  
I was in but I want out  
My mothers love is choking me  
Im sick of words that hang above my head  
What about the kid Its time the kid got free  
  
Be a part of the love club  
Everything will glow for you  
Youll get punched for the love club  
For the love club  
  
I joined the club and its all on  
There are fights for being my best friend  
And the girls get their claws out  
Theres something about hanging out with the wicked kids  
Take the pill make it too ill  
The other day I forgot my old address  
Im sitting pretty on the throne  
Theres nothing more I want  
Except to be alone  
  
Be a part of the love club  
Everything will glow for you  
Youll get punched for the love club  
For the love club  
  
Your clothes are soaked and you dont know where to go  
So drop your chin and take yourself back home  
And roll out your maps and papers  
Find out your hiding places again  
The only problem that I got with the club  
Is how youre severed from the people who watched you grow up  
When youre a member go on your great adventure again  
They will be waiting at the end  
  
Be a part of the love club  
Everything will glow for you  
Youll get punched for the love club  
For the love club
