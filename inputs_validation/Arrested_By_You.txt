What is this strange elation  
Taking my train of thought to an unknown destination  
And suddenly I dont know where I am  
But like a tremor or a spark  
Somethings happening in my heart  
  
Ive been arrested by you  
Take me in oh oh oh  
Finally captured by you by you and by you  
Take me in  
Ive been arrested by you  
Take me in oh oh oh  
Finally captured by you by you and by you  
Take me in  
  
Youve broken my concentration  
Saving me just in time from a desperate situation  
And suddenly I dont know who I am  
But my dilemmas where to start  
Somethings happening in my heart  
  
Ive been arrested by you  
Take me in oh oh oh  
Finally captured by you by you and by you  
Take me in  
Ive been arrested by you  
Take me in oh oh oh  
Finally captured by you by you and by you  
Take me in  
  
Ive been arrested by you  
Take me in oh oh oh  
Finally captured by you by you and by you  
Take me in  
Ive been arrested by you  
Take me in oh  
Finally captured by you oh oh  
Take me in  
Ive been captured captured captured captured  
Oh baby  
Oh ho  
Take me baby  
Oh oh oh oh
