Im the sky  
Cause the sky doesnt sing in my song in the wind  
I can dodge  
Both your eyes with my smile  
Cause Im singing my song  
  
Its love its mine  
Its yours its life  
Its free  
  
Its love its mine  
Its yours its life  
Its free  
  
Long ago  
I was blinded my mind couldnt see  
The worlds sorrow  
Every place that I went in the stillness  
I left people alone  
  
Its love its mine  
Its yours its life  
Its free  
  
Its love its mine  
Its yours its life  
Its free  
  
Till one day  
In the spring in the springtime I saw a good day  
And I heard as a child laughing wild  
That I heard you can grow  
  
Its love its mine  
Its yours its life  
Its free  
  
Its love its mine  
Its yours its life  
Its free  
  
When you grow  
In the springtime youll sing loudly songs in your soul  
In the air you can feel all the life  
And the force youve been weary  
  
Its love its mine  
Its yours its life  
Its free  
  
Its love its mine  
Its yours its life  
Its free  
  
Its love its mine  
Its yours its life  
Its free
