What gives you this crazy thought  
That you can talk to my woman  
Whats your claim to fame  
What gives you half a mind  
To even think her name  
Whats your claim to fame  
Whats your name  
  
Gonna give you just one more chance  
To make amends to my woman  
You got yourself to blame  
Only thing thats left to do  
Is to think real hard about what youre gonna do  
About your crazy game  
Whats your name  
  
Whats your name  
Who the hell do you think you are  
Whats your game  
Are you some Top of the Pops star  
  
What gives you this crazy thought  
That you think you can talk to my woman  
Whats your claim to fame  
What gives you half a mind  
To even think her name  
Whats your claim to fame  
Whats your name
