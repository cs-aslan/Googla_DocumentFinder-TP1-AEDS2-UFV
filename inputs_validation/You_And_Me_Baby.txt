Will you start my dreams  
Or will you end my schemes  
Or will you let me go down so low  
  
You and me baby well we got no friends  
Except for you and me baby  
This is journeys end  
And I try to hang on to all those precious smiles  
But Im tired of walking and it must be miles  
  
Every time I took you hand  
I felt so moved  
Did you feel it too  
  
You and me baby well we got no friends  
Except for you and me baby  
This is journeys end  
And I try to hang on to all those precious words  
But they dont come easy  
No I know they hurt  
You and me baby well we help each other  
And Ill be your sister if youll be my brother and  
We wont be parted  
And we will be friends  
Cause its you and me baby and  
Its journeys end  
  
Every time I took your hand  
I had a first class ticket  
To the promised land  
  
Rosebud oh rosebud  
He turned to me and wept  
A vaguely coded message  
I could never intercept  
  
You and me baby well we got no friends  
Except for you and me baby  
This is journeys end  
You and me baby well we help each other  
And Ill be your sister  
If youll be my brother
