I dont much care  
If I am the last in line to see  
Whatever that it is  
That theyre lining up to see  
You see it doesnt concern me  
  
I dont much care  
If I am the very last to know  
Whatever that it is  
That they know about oh no  
Oh no I really dont care to know  
  
Cause when it comes to Santa Claus  
And presents round the tree  
No one I know could ever get jump on me  
  
Im gonna be the first one  
Up on Christmas morning  
Im gonna be the first one  
Up on Christmas day  
  
Ive always heard that the  
Early birdie catches all the worms  
But worms aint for me no  
Theyre not my cup of tea  
And I am certainly not a birdie  
Me Id rather sleep til three  
  
Cause when it comes to Santa Claus  
And presents round the tree  
No one I know could ever get jump on me  
  
Im gonna be the first one  
Up on Christmas morning  
Im gonna be the first one  
Up on Christmas day
