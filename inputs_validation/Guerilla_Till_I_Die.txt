Guerilla till I die mama dont cry  
When they come for me when I blast  
We gon see how many of em run from me  
Guerilla till I die but I never shed a tear  
Cause they dont love a nigga here  
ZRo  
American me could it be my own  
War is out to murder me  
Im ready to kill and Im ready to die  
But have these cowards heard of me  
The rumors are real better keep your glock cocked  
Leaving em stiffer than a statue  
Ready to defend like a guerilla by any  
Means that Id murder if I have to  
Heard my homies working as an undercover  
Ready to kiss my cheek and earn your silver pieces  
Could it be that Ive seen my last supper  
Mighty Jahova please protect my spirit from the danger  
And I know you said you would strike down upon the  
With great vengeance and curious anger  
But dont attempt to poison your brother  
Was it nothing but the word of God  
That kept a nigga from taking the lives of so many others  
And Im trying to keep ways right brothers and mothers  
Im falling around a grave sight pupunk I hate you to death  
But yet I loved you so wanted you to feel my pain since 91  
So brother come with me and die slow  
I hate you to death but yet I loved you so  
Wanted you to feel my pain since 91  
So brother come with me and die slow

Verse 2  
As my life flashes before my eyes  
Visions of wicked ways keep me puzzled  
Wondering why I was introduced to a life  
Filled with drama and trouble  
And everyones always got something to say  
When I come around when I clown  
Armed a deal smile in my face  
And stab me in my back when I turn around  
And I can feel hateful eyes watching plotting to get me  
They under estimate me hate me  
But never approach cause they cant fade me  
And Ill be damned if I go softly shouldnt of crossed me  
Guerilla till I die and Ima blast when they come for me  
Please tell me is there a place where my guerillas could see refuge  
Cause it seems this time we gain one as one more elute  
Whatever the rules whatever you choose whatever you give I accept  
Just let me twist up let me smoke one for the world before my last breath  
How can I go on how can I take away my anguish  
I put a frown on my face cause now guerillas are strangers  
And nobody knows my soul so I show no fear  
Mobbing till I die cause they dont love a nigga here

ZRo  
Could it be Im too good for hell  
Heaven dont want me because I keep slippin  
Even though I got two clips I still preach  
Motherfuckers around had to be Christians  
And I got a problem I suppose but I know  
Im gon solve it with a 44 tensix on fry  
And I got 25s hollin I roll  
But they tell me to keep my head up and finish my tape  
Because its gon jam but Im losing respect my music cant hang  
Around ZRo just till we praying I really dont know  
All I can say that I dont trust nobody on this earth  
Been that away ever since my birth  
But its gotta stay thataaway till Im dying  
Innocent niggas risen up out of my business  
Is something they better do Ima hit the I cut  
When a fucker rolling rocks sold em up even  
Till I got rest gotta put it down to the bullets  
Dump a lot of bullets till the job done  
Till a nigga really want to kill myself  
Nigga shut the fuck up my record is spinning  
Im really trying to feel myself  
Gotta get em all gotta get em dead  
When Im filling the bed put a infrared to the head  
Everybody come up dead better get on or get stole on  
Nigga better get on but I just cant hold on  
Cause Im ready to kill and Im ready to die  
But next to steal living on the motherfucking edge  
Nigga dont run up because its real  
Nigga can you feel me
