What a performance tonight  
Should I react or turn off the light  
Looks like youre picking a fight  
In a blurring of wrong and right  
But how your mood changes  
Youre a devil now an angel  
Suddenly subtle and solemn and silent as a monk  
You only tell me you love me  
When youre drunk  
  
Its better than nothing  
I suppose  
Some doors have opened  
Others closed  
But I couldnt see you exposed  
To the horrors behind some of those  
Somebody said listen  
Dont you know what  
Youre missing You should be kissing him  
Instead of dissing him like a punk  
But you only tell me you love me  
When youre drunk  
But you only tell me you love me  
When youre drunk  
  
All of my friends keep asking me  
Why oh why  
Do you not say goodbye  
If you dont even try  
Youll be sunk  
Cause you only tell me you love me  
When youre drunk  
  
Whats the meaning  
When you speak with so much feeling  
Is it over when youre sober  
Am I junk  
You only tell me you love me  
When youre drunk  
But you only tell me you love me  
When youre drunk
