My heart was leaping in the sun  
My friends all say that youre the one  
Let me get this one thing very clear  
There aint enough going on down here  
  
Mainline Florida oh say  
Mainline Florida OK  
  
Her arms were open open wide  
Her invitations a changing tide  
I could remember not long ago  
We took a cruise down on Hotel Row  
  
Mainline Florida oh say  
Mainline Florida OK  
  
Her arms were open open wide  
Her invitations a changing tide  
I could remember not long ago  
We took a cruise down on old Hotel Row  
  
Mainline Florida oh say  
Mainline Florida OK
