Follow that dream I gotta follow that dream  
Keep amovin move along keep a moving  
  
Ive got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead  
Ive got to follow that dream to find the love I need  
When your heart gets restless time to move along  
When your heart gets weary time to sing a song  
  
But when a dream is calling you  
Theres just one thing that you can do  
  
Well you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead  
You gotta follow that dream to find the love you need  
Keep amovin move along keep a moving  
Got to find me someone whose heart is free  
  
Someone to look for my dream with me  
And when I find her I may find out  
Just what my dreams are all about  
  
Ive got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead  
Ive got to follow that dream to find the love I need  
Ive got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead  
Ive got to follow that dream to find the love I need  
  
Keep amovin move along  
Keep amovin move along  
Keep amovin move along
