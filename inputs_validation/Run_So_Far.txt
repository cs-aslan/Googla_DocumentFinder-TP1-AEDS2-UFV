You fly out as your smile wears thin  
I sigh knowing the mess youre in  
And you know that you cant get away  
And you know that you cant hide it from yourself  
Lonely days blue guitar  
Theres no escape can only run so far  
  
I know something I ought to say  
Stuck here trying to find a way  
And you know that you cant get away  
And you know that you cant hide it from yourself  
  
Lonely nights travelling far  
Theres no escape can only run so far  
Lonesome tears after dark  
Theres no escape can only run so far  
  
You fly out as your smile wears thin  
I sigh knowing the mess youre in  
And you know that you cant get away  
And you know that you cant hide it from yourself  
  
Lonely days blue guitar  
Theres no escape can only run so far  
Lonely nights travelling far  
Theres no way out can only run so far  
Lonesome tears after dark  
Theres no escape can only run so far
