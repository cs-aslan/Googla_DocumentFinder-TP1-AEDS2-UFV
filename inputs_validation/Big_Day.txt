Its your big day your big day  
So you want to tie the knot  
Tie it tight dont let it rot the memory of this day  
Are you deafened by the bells  
Could be heaven could be hell  
In a cell for two  
Big day come and big day go  
Life goes on after the show  
But will your love have the fire and glow  
Like on the big day  
Statistics they dont say a lot  
But can you keep what you have got forever together  
Theres a lesson to be learnt  
Many fingers have been burnt with the touch of gold  
Love can come and love can go  
What your chance is I dont know  
But if you have love then let it show like on the big day  
Youre a new recruit  
The big day  
In your wedding suit  
Theres a lesson to be learnt  
Many fingers have been burnt with the touch of gold  
Big day come and big day go  
What your chance is I dont know  
But if you have love then let it show like on the big day  
Yea youre looking fine  
Big day  
Sign on the dotted line  
Big day  
Its your wedding march today big day  
Youre the new recruit  
Big day  
In your wedding suit  
Big day  
Yea youre looking fine  
Big day  
Sign on the dotted line  
Big day  
Its your wedding march today  
Big day  
Your big day  
Big day
