We stand alone  
Warmed by the light that reflects in your eyes  
I feel inside an emotional storm  
And a heart like a sky  
This moment takes to somewhere unknown  
And what Im feeling is thrilled to the bone  
Been chasing rainbows all of my life  
Now I know that was wrong  
Ive found the gold deep in my soul  
And I want to hang on  
Just one look of encouragement  
And what I have here is heaven sent  
And hit from above  
I just crashed into love crashed into love  
And Im feeling that when powers inside  
When forces collide this cant be denied  
And now it hits me love overdrive  
I try to stand my ground but I cant contrive  
These are the days that well think that we dreamed  
For the rest of our lives  
This moment takes to somewhere unknown  
And what Im feeling is thrilled to the bone  
And hit from above  
I just crashed into love crashed into love  
And Im feeling that when powers inside  
When forces collide this cant be denied  
I just crashed into love crashed into love  
And I know that I was hit by surprise  
Between open eyes emotions arise  
And now were living the June of our lives  
In the heat of the day  
Were on the eve of experience now  
And nothing will take away  
Crashed into love  
Crashed into love  
Just one look of encouragement  
And what I have here is heaven sent  
And sent from above  
I just crashed into love crashed into love  
And Im feeling that when powers inside  
When forces collide this cant be denied  
I just crashed into love crashed into love  
And I know that I was hit by surprise  
Between open eyes emotions arise  
I just crashed into love
