Im not just something you can pick up or put down  
Entertainment value like some circus clown  
Dont give green stamps  
With my emotions  
Dont have a cut price soul  
Dont do  
Carry out feelings  
Or take away love  
Carry out feelings  
You take away love  
Carry out feelings  
You take away love  
Dont have the kind of heart  
You reap and you take away  
Keep in your cold store to use at some future date  
Dont give a refund on my emotions  
No discounting on my soul  
Dont do  
Carry out feelings  
Or take away love  
Carry out feelings  
You take away love  
Carry out feelings  
And take away love  
Im not just someone you can pick up and throw away  
Someone to join you in a recycled love affair  
Dont give green stamps with my emotions  
Dont have a cut price soul  
Dont do  
Carry out feelings  
Or take away love  
Carry out feelings  
You take away love  
Carry out feelings  
You take away love  
Carry out feelings  
You take away love
