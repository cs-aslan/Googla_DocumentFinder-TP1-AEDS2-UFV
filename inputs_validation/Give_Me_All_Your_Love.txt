When I first saw you baby  
You took my breath away  
I knew your name was Trouble  
But my heart got in the way  
I couldnt stop myself from reaching out  
I could not turn away  
  
I dont even know your name  
An I cant leave you alone  
Im running round in circles  
Like a dog without a bone  
I know the game youre playing  
But baby I just cant let go  
  
So give me all your love tonight  
Give me all your love tonight  
Ill do anything you want  
Just give me all of your loving tonight  
  
Ill work hard everyday  
To love and treat you right  
Ill rock you in the morning  
And roll you in the night  
Any way you want  
Im gonna prove my love for you  
  
So give me all your love tonight  
Give me all your love tonight  
Ill do anything you want  
Just give me all of your loving tonight tonight tonight  
  
So give me all your love tonight  
Give me all your love tonight  
Ill do anything you want  
Just give me all of your loving tonight  
  
So give me all your love tonight  
Give me all your love tonight  
Ill do anything you want  
Just give me all of your loving tonight  
  
I am blinded by your smile  
And Im crazy about your walk  
I shiver and I shake  
When I hear you baby talk  
Im a fool for your loving babe  
Give me all your loving tonight  
  
So give me all your love tonight  
Give me all your love tonight  
Ill do anything you want  
Just give me all of your loving tonight  
  
Anything you want from me  
  
So give me all your love tonight  
Give me all your love tonight  
Ill do anything you want  
Just give me all of your loving tonight tonight tonight
