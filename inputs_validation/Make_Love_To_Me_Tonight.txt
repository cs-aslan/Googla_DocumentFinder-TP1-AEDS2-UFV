When I see you standing there when I come home from work  
My whole heart just skips a beat and I become a flirt  
Weve been together many years and my love for you still grows  
But the dark clouds are gathering and our future is unknown  
  
Oh my little darling were gonna face hard times  
But right now I got one thing on my mind  
  
Chorus  
Make love to me tonight like theres no tomorrow  
You and only you can drive away my sorrow  
Hold me in your lovely arms never let me go  
Wear that sexy lingerie turn the lamp down low  
My my well work it out I know that well get through  
I may be down but Im not out as long as I got you  
  
This job of mine is on the line cause the batter is about to close  
You feel the pinch of hardship when the winter winds blow  
I wouldve borrowed from the bank but I dont think theyre listening  
Foreclosures are as common as a lying politician  
  
Oh my little darling youre the rock on which I stand  
Youre my strength and wisdom the soul behind a man  
  
Chorus x2
