Im goin back to New York city  
Times square sure will be shinin bright  
I know it sure looks pretty  
But I dont go down every night  
  
Im gonna take in Memphis  
You know the one down in Tennessee  
And if you want to boogie  
Now thats the place to be  
  
Sittin in a bar in Macon  
Drinkin something called Rebel Yells  
When I thought I heard someone ringing  
I guess shes a southern bell  
  
We just cut out of El Paso  
It just fries there in that desert sun  
And if youve ever been down there man  
Then you know why we run  
  
I got jet lag  
And livin out an overnight bag  
Time changes every day  
They do things a different way  
Back in the USA  
  
Tryin hard to make a phone call  
Long distance over seas  
Yes maam I did say Scotland  
Could you spell that again for me please  
  
You know that it just blew my mind  
Id love to go back there next trip  
I sure hope we get some time  
  
Driving down a Detroit freeway  
Just lookin at those concrete walls  
Hey but its a good town to rock n roll in  
What do you mean the police closed the god damned hall  
  
Flyin home tomorrow  
To be theres gonna be just great  
And after some time with my lady  
Im gonna be back to rock n roll in the States
