The scene was a small roadside cafe  
The waitress was sweepin the floor  
Two truckdrivers drinkin their coffee  
And two okiekids by the door  
How much are them candies they asked her  
How much have you got she replied  
Weve only a penny between us  
Thems two for a penny she lied  
Chorus  
And the daylight grew heavy with thunder  
And the smell of the rain on the wind  
Aint it just like a human  
Here comes that rainbow again  
One truckdriver called to the waitress  
After the kids went outside  
Them candies aint two for a penny  
So whats it to you she replied  
In silence they finished their coffee  
Got up and nodded godbye  
She called hey you left too much money  
So whats it to you they replied  
Chorus  
And the daylight grew heavy with thunder  
And the smell of the rain on the wind  
Aint it just like a human  
Here comes that rainbow again
