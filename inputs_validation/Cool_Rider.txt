If you really want to know  
What I want in a guy  
Well Im lookin for a dream on a mean machine  
With hell in his eyes  
I want a devil in skin tight leather  
And hes gonna be wild as the wind  
And one fine night Ill be holdin on tight  
  
To a coooool rider a coooool rider  
If hes cool enough  
He can burn me through and through  
Whhoa ohhhh  
If it takes forever  
Then Ill wait forever  
No ordinary boy  
No ordinary boy is gonna do  
I want a rider thats cool  
  
Thats the way its gonna be  
And thats the way that I feel  
I want a whole lot more than the boy next door  
I want hell on wheels  
Just give me a fine motorcycle  
With a man growin out of the seat  
And move aside cause Im gonna ride  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont want no ordinary guys  
Comin on strong to me  
They dont know what Im lookin for  
They dont know what I need  
Theyre gonna know when he gets here  
Cause the crowd will be shakin  
Ill do anything to let him know  
That Im his his for the takin  
  
I want a coooooool rider  
A cool cool cool cool rider  
I want a coooooool rider  
A cool cool cool cool rider  
I want a COOL areIDEare  
I need a COOL areIDEare  
  
Repeat
