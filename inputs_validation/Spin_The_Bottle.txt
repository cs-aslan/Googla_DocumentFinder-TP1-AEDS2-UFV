Hes a movie star only drives rented cars  
Met him in a bar said I know who you are  
Took him to my party as the games were starting  
Bottles on the ground are you ready now  
When it comes to me Im gonna be ready  
Its my turn in a minute gonna put my message in it  
Five minutes in the closet with you  
  
Hes in a bunch of movies really stupid movies  
Its not entirely his fault he cant control it all  
I am not afraid I can hardly wait  
Truth or dare I dont care tell the truth I dare you  
  
When it comes around when it comes around  
When it comes around when it comes around  
Do you feel it too what I feel for you  
If it was just us would you do what I do  
Doodoodoodoo Doodoodoodoo  
Doodoodoodoo Doodoodoodoo  
  
Everybodys watching Everybodys looking  
Shes such a sucker He dont want to fuck her  
He is gonnna kiss me if he doesnt miss me  
I am ready for it now Already on the ground  
Five minutes in the closet with you  
Oooh Five minutes in the closet with you  
  
Spin it round again X8
