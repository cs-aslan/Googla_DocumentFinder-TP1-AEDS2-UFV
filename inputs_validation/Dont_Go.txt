Chorus  
This time this time I love you  
Last time last time I hate you  
Next time next time I need you  
Baby please dont go  
  
Remember when I met you  
School dress on  
I never could forget you  
And Baby now youre gone  
  
Im goin around around today  
Just tryin to find the truth  
It doesnt really matter anyway  
When Im livin without you  
  
Chorus  
  
I said come on little darlin  
Baby dont you see  
Id never do you harmin no  
Its just you and me  
  
Im in the corner right now  
Waiting for your love  
You better make your choice now  
Before a push comes to a shove  
Yeah things seem kinda different  
It aint the way it was  
Remember what your mama said  
The bond that lies is us  
  
Chorus  
  
Im by the phone Im all alone  
Just waitin and a prayin that maybe youll call  
I gotta know right now should I stay around should I stay a while  
Should I stand here crying or baby should I fly  yeah  
  
Oh come on darlin Dont you se and dont you know  
I gotta have your lovin now now Ill never let you go  
Tryin to find that girl of mine  
Shes so far away  
And I am cryin  yeah
