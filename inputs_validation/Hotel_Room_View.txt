Above all things there must be love  
And following your deepest soul  
You look like you need some fun  
Im dying to sail into the sun  
Dreamers ask whatve I become  
  
I can see that shoreline star  
Pulling me to worlds so far  
Taking me and pulling hard  
Away from judgments own backyard  
Away from judgments own backyard  
  
Why should I change for anyone  
Why should my chains break or come undone  
And Ill sing glory hallelujah Im coming home  
Baby dont rescue me dont rescue me  
Cause Im gonna be what Im gonna be  
  
Do you hear my melodies  
Do you hear my Van Goghs cry  
Will it be my brothers purchase  
Even only when I die Even only when I die  
  
Why should I change for anyone  
Why should my chains break or come undone  
And Ill sing glory hallelujah Im coming home  
Baby dont rescue me dont rescue me  
Cause Im gonna be what Im gonna be  
  
I been up and down I been all around  
In the sky and baby on the ground  
High as the sun deep as the sea  
Rain has been falling all over me  
I want to live in harmony  
I know what I need to be free  
Baby please dont rescue me cause Im gonna be
