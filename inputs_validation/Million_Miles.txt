Right in front of your eyes  
Why cant you see me  
Cant you read all the signs  
Why cant you feel it  
  
Can we love just a little bit harder  
My hearts beating to this drum  
It hasnt even started  
But I know that its love  
  
Cause I feel like Im a million million  
Feel like Im a million miles away  
Feel like Im a million million  
Feel like Im a million miles away  
When you touch my body  
I go weak but youre so hard for me to reach  
I feel like Im a million million  
Feel like Im a million miles away miles away  
  
Feels like Im going crazy  
Cause Im always craving your touch  
My daydreams are amazin  
Oh boy youre never too much  
  
I wanna love just a little bit harder  
My hearts beating to this drum  
It hasnt even started  
But I know that its love  
  
Cause I feel like Im a million million  
Feel like Im a million miles away  
Feel like Im a million million  
Feel like Im a million miles away  
When you touch my body  
I go weak but youre so hard for me to reach  
I feel like Im a million million  
Feel like Im a million miles away miles away  
  
I feel so invisible why cant you see me  
Youre the one that I want its so clear to me  
I feel so invisible  
I feel so invisible  
I feel so  
I feel so  
I feel so  
  
I feel like Im a million million  
Feel like Im a million miles away  
Feel like Im a million million  
Feel like Im a million miles away  
When you touch my body I go weak  
But youre so hard for me to reach  
I feel like Im a million million  
Feel like Im a million miles away miles away  
  
I feel so invisible I feel a million miles away  
I feel so invisible I feel a million miles away  
  
Right in front of your eyes why cant you see me
