Shadow face A little boy out on the stage  
Oh his daddy sings and plays em another song  
Shadow face Now his daddys gone away  
And his mother says son you must carry on  
Shadow face youre much too young to take his place  
Youll be walkin in his shadow for so long for so long  
Shadow face Oh they say youre of his grace  
With your hair and beard and singin strange new songs  
  
Shadow face son you and your friends better slow down the pace  
Or youre gonna burn yourselves out before long  
Who ever told you what you could and could not do  
Oh you get so tired of bein told youre wrong  
But some of my friends are gone  
Better days hear your songs on the hit parade  
Now they tell you we were behind you all the way Yeah  
Shadow face boy dont you let it all go to waste  
Youve seen so many fall who thought they had it made  
Shadow face youre much happier these days  
Does a smile really look so out of place  
Here on shadow face right here on shadow face
