A little hating in the morning time  
a little hating come around noon  
Aint no remorse  
All that you think  
Aint no regret  
All that you do  
  
Jesus  
Hell Yeah What do we do  
Jesus  
Can you hear us screaming up above  
Lord  
I guess we were just born to lose  
  
A little hating on my TV screen  
A little hating in the news that I read  
Lay to rest a soul so kind  
Rewarding the wrong  
Feeding The Twisted Mind  
  
You Lookin At Me  
Forever hurt  
Forever bleed  
It aint black  
It aint white  
It aint wrong  
Lord knows it aint right  
  
Jesus  
Hell Yeah What do we do  
Jesus  
Can you hear us screaming up above  
Lord  
I guess we were just
