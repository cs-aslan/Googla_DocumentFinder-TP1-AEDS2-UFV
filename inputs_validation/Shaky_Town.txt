Ive witnessed those one night stands  
Must have played in a thousand bands  
But Im just here tonight tomorrow Ill be gone  
Seen folks show their blacker sides  
Seen them die just for foolish pride  
And those drivers always ask to hear that same old song  
Thats a big tenfour  
From your back door  
Just put that hammer down  
This young man feels  
Those eighteen wheels  
That keep turning round to take me down to shaky town  
Ive heard all those hard luck tales  
From all of you us males  
Ive heard you tell those lies about the love youve know  
And Ive followed those highway signs  
And Ive run down those thin white lines  
Like those drivers this old road is all I call my own  
Thats a big tenfour  
From your back door  
Just put that hammer down  
This young man feels  
Those eighteen wheels  
That keep turning round to take me down to shaky town
