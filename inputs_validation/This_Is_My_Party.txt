Fabolous  
Aint no tellin what this hip lowered do to me  
Im feelin like I can do what I want now  
Diplow immunity  
Shorty just shake your hips slow and move wit me  
Take a hit a this and sip slow and thoroughly  
Youre sneakin out on your man tiptoein to the V  
Cause I know you got him whipped though like wannabe  
Lets put on a live strip show just you and me  
But girl Im lookin at them lips though like who is he  
They aint never seen a whip clothes or jewelry  
So when I ask you want to leave the zipcode  
Say sure and be me  
  
Chorus 1 Fabolous  
But this is my party  
Stroll by if you want to  
Or yall can stay home  
But why would you want to  
  
Fabolous  
We gon party till we laid in graves  
Sweat out our doobie braids and waves  
Then scream heyheyhey yo  
That groupie made her wait  
Cause when she seen the whips and chains  
She started talking bout she ready to be made a slave cmon  
  
Chorus 2 x2  
This is my party  
So get fly if you want to  
Get high if you want to cause I know you want to  
Put your hands up as high as you want to  
And if it feels good scream heyheyhey yo  
  
Fabolous  
I dont know about yall  
But we doin it over here  
All the glasses got liquid that brewin it over here  
Cigars got somethin sticky thats glueing it over here  
Ladies movin it over there movin it over here  
I can fit a few in a Rovers rear  
We havin a good time dont ruin it overs this  
You see why we asks is to see ID  
Cause girls will do anything for some VIP access  
Me I relax this easy  
Cause Im used to ballin  
You could tell that these guys need practice  
But if it was a problem then I would confront you  
You saying over bet ya I say you want to  
But a pitcher that probably slugs pitches and talk a put  
I ride wit the top down and switch to the topup look  
Would you believe most these bitches go bop up shook  
Their asses pokin out like them pictures in pop up books  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Fabolous  
Oh yea Wes off the Richter Scale  
Hate will get you put in coffins quick as hell  
If the ladies would show it off and thick as hell  
For my hustlers knockin off them bricks as well  
And everybody up north thats sick in jail  
I probably feel yall send you all of the flicks in mail  
The Street Family speed off six SLs  
To all them chicks at Yale heyheyheyhey yo  
Shake your glasses back and forth to mix it well  
Shake your ass back and forth as quick as hell  
And just from lookin at them thighs from the front view  
Girl I know that these guys say they want you  
If I wake up in the sand clothes from yesterday  
Same hoes from yesterday  
Lightin clips to the same dro from yesterday  
Her hangovers yesterday  
You aint mistaken we in Benzs today  
But we had them Range Rovers yesterday  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Fabolous  
Heyheyhey yo  
Heyheyhey yo
