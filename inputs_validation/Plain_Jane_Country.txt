I read your letter just this morning  
The first youve wrote since youve been gone  
Youve found a good life in California  
Youve finally found yourself a home  
  
Youve bought a new car a great big red one  
With a top that rolls right down  
You must be something in San Francisco  
A dressed up painted country clown  
  
Youre fakin it well but its easy to tell  
Youre plain Jane country come to town  
The pace is too fast and youre out of your class  
Youre plain Jane country come to town  
  
You know I love you at least you ought to  
Ive loved you all of my livin days  
You got no business makin changes  
Yeah girl I love your country ways  
  
Go sell that red car catch an airplane  
And ill be waiting when you land  
Yeah get a white dress find a preacher  
Well get some rings to fit your hand  
  
Youre fakin it well but its easy to tell  
Youre plain jane country come to town  
The pace is too fast and youre out of your class  
Youre plain Jane country come to town  
Youre plain Jane country come to town  
Youre plain Jane country come to town
