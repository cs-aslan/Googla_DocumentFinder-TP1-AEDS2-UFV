Just obey the safety rules  
This is the way to cross the street now  
Look both ways direct your feet now  
Wait for the green and never cheat now  
Just dont forget the safety rules  
Hold mummys hand each time youre walkin  
Just be alert not too much talkin  
Then the policeman wont be blocking  
You must obey the safety rules  
On a busy highway  
Take my advice and do it my way  
Please avoid the danger  
Never ever talk to a stranger  
In a busy city  
Theres so much to see  
Dont go willynilly  
Heres the way to be  
This is the way to cross the street now  
Look both ways direct your feet now  
Wait for the green and never cheat now  
Just dont forget the safety rules yeah  
Hold mummys hand each time youre walkin  
Just be alert not too much talkin  
Then the policeman wont be blocking  
You must obey the safety rules  
When you hit the corner  
Wait for mum and go and join her  
Take her hand and hold it  
Now you know because youve been told it  
Cars cant always see you  
When you cross their way  
So before you sail through  
Remember what I say  
This is the way to cross the street now  
Look both ways direct your feet now  
Wait for the green and never cheat now  
Just dont forget the safety rules  
Hold mummys hand each time youre walkin  
Just be alert not too much talkin  
Then the policeman wont be blocking  
You must obey the safety rules  
Sha la la la la la la la

Sha la la la la la la la  
You must obey the safety rules  
Sha la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la  
You must obey the safety rules
