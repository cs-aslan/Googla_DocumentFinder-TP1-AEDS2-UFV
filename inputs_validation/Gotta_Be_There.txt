I wanna be where you are  
Could it be I stayed away too long  
  
I remember I said we should split  
Had a lot goin on And you werent part of it  
You tryin to reason with me I admit  
But I did  
And now Im walkin around so so sick  
And now Im thinkin for you thats a fact  
Got me missin you Like LA misses Shaq  
What I gotta do  
On my mission to get you back  
Because Im just that way without you  
Baby baby I  
  
Really didnt mean it  
When I said it Ill repeat it  
I was trippin flippin out It was nothin  
I was on a whole other level  
Now I got it all together  
I was sick but now Im better  
I was trying to push you away  
Really wanted you to stay  
Didnt know that was the case  
It was just plain crazy cause around here lately  
Been thinkin about nothing but my baby  
  
If youre in Houston Hosted in Atlanta  
I wanna be where you are  
  
Chillin in New York  
Baby I gotta be there  
Somewhere out in Puerto Rico  
Baby I gotta be there  
  
If youre in Chicago Hangin out in the MIA  
I wanna be where you are  
  
Maybe you can be in LA  
Baby I gotta be there  
I just wanna be your lady  
Baby I gotta be there  
  
I wanna be where you are  
Could it be I stayed away too long 2x  
  
Whats gone is gone  
And I wanna take it back  
Im not livin in the past  
But now I want you back  
Gotta get you gotta get you here  
I been looking for you everywhere  
Everywhere baby  
Id apologize 1000 times to you if I could prove prove  
Baby Im wrong and out of breath  
I been around the world tryin to get to you  
  
Really didnt mean it  
When I said it Ill repeat it  
I was trippin flippin out It was nothin  
I was on a whole other level  
Now I got it all together  
I was sick but now Im better  
I was trying to push you away  
Really wanted you to stay  
Didnt know that was the case  
It was just plain crazy cause around here lately  
Been thinkin about nothing but my baby  
  
If youre in Houston Hosted in Atlanta  
I wanna be where you are  
  
Chillin in New York  
Baby I gotta be there  
Somewhere out in Puerto Rico  
Baby I gotta be there  
  
If youre in Chicago Hangin out in the MIA  
I wanna be where you are  
  
Maybe you can be in LA  
Baby I gotta be there  
I just wanna be your lady  
Baby I gotta be there
