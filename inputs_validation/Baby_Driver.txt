My daddy was the family bassman  
My mamma was an engineer  
And I was born one dark gray morn  
With music coming in my ears  
In my ears  
  
Chorus  
They call me Baby Driver  
And once upon a pair of wheels  
Hit the road and Im gone ah  
Whats my number  
I wonder how your engine feels  
Ba ba ba ba  
Scoot down the road  
Whats my number  
I wonder how your engine feels  
  
My daddy was a prominent frogman  
My mammas in the Naval reserve  
When I was young I carried a gun  
But I never got the chance to serve  
I did not serve  
  
Chorus  
  
My daddy got a big promotion  
My mamma got a raise in pay  
Theres noone home were all alone  
Oh come int my room and play  
Yes we can play  
  
Im not talking about your pigtails  
But Im talking bout your sex appeal  
Hit the road and Im gone ah  
Whats my number  
  
I wonder how your engine feels  
Ba ba ba ba  
Scoot down the road  
Whats my number  
I wonder how your engine feels
