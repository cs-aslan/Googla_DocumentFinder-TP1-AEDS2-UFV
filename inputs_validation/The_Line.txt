Dry mouth push it out I can hear my heart pound a heros what Im not  
Voices scream flashes flare frozen as the people stare my crucifixion shot  
  
Friends were electric on the western side while triangles were shifting on the
floor  
Squeezing out the breath that I dont have theyre quiet now they only want
to more  
  
And you step to the line  
And you step to the line  
  
Every shot Ive taken has led me to this moment since I was four feet high  
Big D is watching I remember what he taught me dont let him see you cry  
  
And you step to the line  
And you step to the line  
  
Try to see your future from the line  
And youre clinging to the notion youll be fine  
But the circles getting smaller all the time  
Try to see your future from the line  
And youre clinging to the notion youll be fine  
But the circles getting smaller all the time  
  
Dry mouth push it out I can hear my heart pound a heros what Im not  
Voices scream flashes flare frozen as the people stare my crucifiction shot  
  
And you step to the line  
And you step to the line  
  
You try to see your future from the line  
Clinging to the notion youll be fine  
But the circles getting smaller all the time  
You try to see your future from the line  
And youre clinging to the notion youll be fine  
But the circles getting smaller all the time  
You try to see your future from the line  
Youre clinging to the notion youll be fine  
But the circles getting smaller all the time  
You try to see your future from the line  
Clinging to the notion youll be fine  
But the circles getting smaller
