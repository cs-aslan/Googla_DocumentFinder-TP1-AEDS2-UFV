Anything we should know about your change  
They put the world in a tin can  
Black market contraband  
And it hurt just a little bit when they sliced and packaged it  
In a long black trench coat  
Two hands around the throat  
Ooh you want to get it right sometimes  
  
Theres so much to be scared of  
And not much to make sense of  
How did the clowns ever get control  
If your hear can you let me know  
How can they invade it when its so complicated  
Ooh you just want to get it right sometimes  
You just want to get it right sometimes  
  
Thats how you see the world  
How many times can you say you cant believe what you learn  
Thats how you see the world dont you worry yourself  
Youre not gonna give up  
  
And theres something missing seems like theres nobody listening  
If youre running in a circle how can you be too careful  
We dont wanna be man trapped we dont wanna be shrink wrapped  
Ooh we just want to get it right sometimes  
Just want to get it right sometimes  
  
Thats how you see the world  
How many times have you heard but you cant believe a word  
Thats how you see the world but dont you worry yourself  
Cause nobody can hurt you  
  
Thats how you see the world  
Thats how you see the world
