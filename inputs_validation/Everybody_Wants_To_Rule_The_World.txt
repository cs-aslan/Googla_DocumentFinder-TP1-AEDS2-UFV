Welcome to your life theres no turning back  
Even while we sleep  
We will find you acting on your best behavior  
Turn your back on mother nature  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
Its my own desire its my own remorse  
Help me to decide  
Help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure  
Nothing ever lasts forever  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
Theres a room where the light wont find you  
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down  
When they do Ill be right behind you  
So glad weve almost made it  
So sad they had to fade it  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
I cant stand this indecision married with a lack of vision  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
Say that youll never never never never need it  
One headline why believe it  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
All for freedom and for pleasure  
Nothing ever lasts forever  
Everybody wants to rule the world
