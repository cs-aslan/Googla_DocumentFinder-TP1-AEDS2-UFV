I just cant seem to take much more of this  
Got too much hassle baby and not enough bliss  
Got to give these hangers on a miss  
cause I need some help I just dont get  
  
No one seems to understand whats up  
Whats up whats up  
So called friends come and go  
And things just dont add up  
Trying to make my way  
Through all this illusion and myth  
I dont even have no safety net  
  
Nero fiddled while Rome burnt  
Napoleon met his Waterloo  
Sampson went spare when Delilah cut his hair  
But little David slew Goliath too  
  
Im just trying to get some results  
Listen baby Im not trying to start my own cult  
Please tell me something that I dont know  
I just want to get on with the show

Youd think some program might do the trick  
Let me tell you this wall of fog  
Is just too thick  
I thought of everything but the whip  
But baby nobody on my ship is up to it  
  
Im just trying to get some results some results  
Im not trying to start my own cult no   
Just tell me something that I dont know  
I just want to get on with the show  
  
I just want to get on with the show  
Just tell me something that I dont know  
I just want to get on with the show  
And if it dont work then let it go
