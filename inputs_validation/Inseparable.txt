Call my phone  
Baby call my phone  
Baby call my phone  
I be waitin to hear your ring tone  
Call my phone  
Baby call my phone  
Baby call my phone  
I be waitin to hear your ring tone  
  
Lost without my other  
Half thought can I live with out you  
I dont want another  
Thats why Im messed up about you  
  
Cant even dream with out seeing you  
Why should I even try to breathe  
And everything is off without you  
Guess its all my fault ladies sing the blues  
  
No one could deny it  
We were flying like United  
Thought wed never be divided  
Cause the love we had inside us was  
  
Chorus  
Inseparable  
If you open this song  
And youre searching for the moment when two hearts went wrong  
Inseparable  
And jealous was your work  
Cause you swore youd never ever give it up  
Cause youd thought that yall was  
Inseparable  
Thou we stay together  
Always and forever  
But now I see that no one is  
Inseparable  
Except for us  
One of us just got to pick the phone up  
Cause I know were still  
Inseparable  
  
Got photos of us on my refrigerator  
Videos on my phone why cant I just erase them  
The first text I ever got from you still saved in my inbox  
And I read it like time after time  
  
Boy Im lost cant you look wont you please find me  
Im down to my last tick come rescue me  
See its broken my heart to the point where I dont need to have a reason
now  
Weak now cause I just aint the same with out you  
Boy I know were  
  
Chorus  
  
Its been sixteen days since I held you tight  
Balled up me and my pillow in the middle of the night  
Boy I just wish you show up and make everything alright  
So what you waiting for  
Cause both us have thought of were  
  
Chorus
