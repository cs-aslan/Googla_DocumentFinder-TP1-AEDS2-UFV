Come to my loveland wander along  
Beautiful gardens full of flowers and songs  
Come to the sunshine beaches and sand  
Heres the two bluebirds wont you come to my land  
  
The grass is mellow and the sky is blue  
My paradise is waiting here for you  
  
Oh its a tropical loveland  
Oh I want to share it with you  
Life can be funny  
Happy and sunny  
Oh in my tropical loveland  
  
Come to my loveland wander with me  
Lie with me darling in the shade of a tree  
Over the rainbow under the moon  
Thats where my land is wont you come to me soon  
  
Just take my hand Ill show you everything  
The secrets that my paradise can bring  
  
Oh its a tropical loveland  
Oh I want to share it with you  
Life can be funny  
Happy and sunny  
Oh in my tropical loveland  
  
Oh its a tropical loveland  
Oh I want to share it with you  
I want to share it with you  
Oh its a tropical loveland  
Its a tropical loveland  
Oh I want to share it with you  
Oh its a tropical loveland  
Oh I want to share it with you
