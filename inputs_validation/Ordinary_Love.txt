Ooooh yeah ohhhh uh  
  
Well its a simple thing  
A look a laugh a clover ring  
And all those little scenes dreams are made of  
And its evident that when my hopes and prayers are spent  
Well there she came and there I went  
  
Ohhh someone makes it mistifying  
Baby theres just no denying that every time we touch  
Heavenly its so divine but you know what just blows my mind  
Is the miracle of love just an ordinary love  
Just and ordinary love  
  
Its just another day  
I kiss goodbye and Im on my way  
Rushin through the maze right back to your arms  
And its difficult just a boy and just a girl  
Out on screen and around the world  
  
Ohhh someone makes it mistifying  
Baby theres just no denyingevery time we touch  
Heavenly its so divine but you know what just blows my mind  
Is the miracle of love just an ordinary love  
Just and ordinary love yeah ohhh yeah  
  
Ooooh someone makes it mistifying  
Baby theres just no denying every time we touch  
Heavenly its so divine but you know what just blows my mind  
Its the miracle of love just an ordinary love  
Just an ordinary love
