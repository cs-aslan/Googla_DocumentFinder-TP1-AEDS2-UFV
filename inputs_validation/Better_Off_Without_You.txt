Room 16 the palms motel  
Now I can rest behind that door  
My life with yous become a living hell  
Dont want to live like that no more  
And whatever it will take  
I will do to make this final break  
  
Yeah better off without you  
Better off without you  
Better off without you in my life  
  
So Ill unpack my bag  
And kick off these old shoes  
This room is a good as anyplace Ive ever been  
For lookin at the truth  
Now its all so clear to me  
What a blind man could plainly see  
  
Yeah better off without you  
Better off without you  
Better off without you in my life  
  
Oh god here comes the tears  
Im gonna stay right here  
Ill cry Ive cried before  
But I wont go back no more  
  
Looks like a change in the weather  
I can hear it start to rain  
I hope its not too long this time  
Before the sun comes out again  
But if it rains forever  
I will still be better off  
  
Yeah better off without you  
Better off without you  
Better off without you in my life
