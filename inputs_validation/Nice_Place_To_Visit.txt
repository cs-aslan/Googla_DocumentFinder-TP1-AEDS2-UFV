Not really lookin for for nothing special  
Just someplace that I can call my own  
Im growing tired of of running wild  
Its time I settled down  
Bridge  
There seems to be some lights on  
But aint nobody home  
I think I see some lights on  
But there aint nobody home  
Aint being choosy but  
Dont want no floozy  
And thats not much to ask  
  
Chorus  
Shes a nice place to visit 3x  
But I wouldnt want to live her  
Nice place to visit  
Hey is anybody home  
Seeing is believing  
But looks can be deceiving  
What you get aint always what you see  
I like what s down there  
But no one is upstairs  
I think theres bats in the belfry  
Chorus  
I dont know whats come over me  
Im blinded by the scenery  
Nice place to visit  
I dont know what Im gonna do  
Im coming back because of you  
Nice place to visit visit visit  
Bridge  
This big bad wolf knows  
Which way the wind blows  
And which little piggys house is made of brick  
Must have vacated or mislocated  
Theres just toys toys in the attic  
Chorus hey is anybody home   
Knock knock whos there  
Shes a nice place to visit 2x
