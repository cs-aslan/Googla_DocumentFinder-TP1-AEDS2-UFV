Heartaches  
You know my heart aches  
Every time I think of you  
Lonesome  
Im on my own some  
Yes I could loan some  
Tears for you  
Daybreak  
Another day break  
And I wonder  
How I got through  
You know sleepin  
Im only sleepin  
In between my weepin  
Tears for you  
  
You know that one night  
One night can be such a long night  
At midnight  
I know all the stars by name  
But its alright  
Ill get myself together  
Nothin lasts forever  
Ill just play another game  
  
Because mistakes  
Everyone makes mistakes  
Can one kiss make  
Dreams come true  
Nice try  
Ill just say goodbye  
Let someone else cry  
Tears for you  
  
Tears for you  
Tears for you  
Tears for you  
Tears for you
