Everyday we earn our meager pay  
But it takes its toll to play the happy prole  
The buy your labor try to steal your soul   
Bite the bullet hold your tongue and play the happy prole  
Paranoid and tired  quit before youre fired  
But theyve got you in the hole so you play happy prole  
You need the money so you got to play it dumb  
but if you play it long enough its just what you become  
Pay your rent pay your bills pay the doctor for your pills  
So you can work another day as life slips away
