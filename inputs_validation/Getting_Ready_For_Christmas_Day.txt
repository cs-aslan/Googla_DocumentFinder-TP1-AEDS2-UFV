From early in November to the last week of December  
I got money matters weighing me down  
Oh the music may be merry but its only temporary  
I know Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
In the days I work my day job in the nights I work my night  
But it all comes down to working mans pay  
Getting ready Im getting ready ready for Christmas Day  
  
Getting ready for Christmas Day  
And let me tell you namely the undertaker hes getting ready for your body  
Not only that the jailer hes getting ready for you  
Christmas Day Hmm And not only the jailer but the lawyer the police force  
Now getting ready for Christmas Day and I want you to bear it in mind  
  
I got a nephew in Iraq its his third time back  
But its ending up the way it began  
With the luck of a beginner hell be eating turkey dinner  
On some mountain top in Pakistan  
  
Getting ready oh were getting ready  
For the power and the glory  
And the story of  
Christmas Day  
  
Getting ready for Christmas Day  
Done made it up in your mind that Im going New York Philadelphia Chicago  
Im going on a trip getting ready for Christmas Day  
But when Christmas come nobody knows where youll be  
You might ask me I may be layin in some lonesome grave  
Getting ready for Christmas Day  
  
Getting ready oh were getting ready  
For the power and the glory and the story of the  
Christmas Day  
Yes were getting ready  
  
Getting ready ready for your prayers  
Im going and see my relatives in a distant land  
Getting ready getting ready for Christmas Day  
  
If I could tell my Mom and Dad that the things we never had  
Never mattered we were always okay  
Getting ready oh ready ready for Christmas Day  
Ready getting ready  
For the power and the glory and the story of the  
Christmas Day
