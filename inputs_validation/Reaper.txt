Verse 1  
Broke down thought that I would drown  
Hope that Ive been found fore I hit the ground  
Sun rays out the corner of my eye hey  
Saw you weeping saw you creeping  
Saw you sneaking in the shadows dawn  
I feel so strong  
Saw you out the corner of my eye  
  
PreChorus  
Dont come for me today  
Im feeling good  
Imma savor it  
Dont come for me today  
Im feeling good  
I remember when  
Reaper  
  
Chorus  
You came to take me away  
So close I was to heavens gates  
But no baby no baby not today  
Oh you tried to track me down  
You followed me like the darkest cloud  
But no baby no baby not today  
Reaper Oh reaper  
Reaper Oh no baby no baby not today  
Reaper Oh reaper  
Reaper Oh no baby no baby not today  
  
Verse 2  
So come back when Im good to go  
I got drinks to drink and men to hold  
I got good things to do with my life yeah  
Oh I wanna dance in the open breeze  
Feel the wind in my hair hear the ocean sing  
I got good things to feel in my life yeah  
  
PreChorus  
Dont come for me today  
Im feeling good  
Imma savor it  
Dont come for me today  
Im feeling good  
I remember when  
Reaper  
  
Chorus  
You came to take me away  
So close I was to heavens gates  
But no baby no baby not today  
Oh you tried to track me down  
You followed me like the darkest cloud  
But no baby no baby not today  
Reaper Oh reaper  
Reaper Oh no baby no baby not today  
Reaper Oh reaper  
Reaper Oh no baby no baby not today
