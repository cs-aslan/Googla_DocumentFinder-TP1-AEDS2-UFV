My time coming anyday dont worry about me no  
Been so long I felt this way Im in no hurry no  
Rainbows end down that highway where ocean breezes blow  
My time coming voices saying they tell me where to go  
  
Dont worry about me nah nah nah dont worry about me no  
And Im in no hurry nah nah nah I know where to go  
  
California preaching on the burning shore  
California Ill be knocking on the golden door  
Like an angel standing in a shaft of light  
Rising up to paradise I know Im gonna shine  
  
My time coming any day dont worry about me no  
Its gonna be just like they say them voices tell me so  
Seems so long I felt this way and time sure passin slow  
Still I know I lead the way they tell me where I go  
  
Dont worry about me no no no dont worry about me no  
And Im in no hurry no no no I know where to go  
  
California a prophet on the burning shore  
California Ill be knocking on the golden door  
Like an angel standing in a shaft of light  
Rising up to paradise I know Im gonna shine  
  
Youve all been asleep you would not believe me  
Them voices tellin me you will soon receive me  
Standin on the beach the sea will part before me  
Fire wheel burning in the air  
  
You will follow me and we will ride to glory way up the middle of  
The air  
  
And Ill call down thunder and speak the same and my word fills the  
Sky with flame  
And might and glory gonna be my name and men gonna light my way  
  
My time coming any day dont worry about me no  
Its gonna be just like they say them voices tell me so  
Seems so long I felt this way and time sure passin slow  
My time coming any day dont worry about me no  
  
Dont worry about me no no no dont worry about me no  
And Im in no hurry no no no dont worry about me no
