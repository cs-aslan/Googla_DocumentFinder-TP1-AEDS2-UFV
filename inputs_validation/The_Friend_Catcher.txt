I cigarette fingers  
Puff and poke  
Puff and poking the smoke  
Touches the ground  
  
  
You your lungs and your wrists  
They throb like trains  
Choo choo choo  
Its a prison of sound  
  
  
Of sound  
  
  
She by my chinny chin chin buying chilly chinchin  
Eeeoh Eeeoh  
Like a zippo smokes the way  
Hope around  
  
  
You your lungs and your wrists  
They throb like trains  
Choo choo choo  
Its a prison of sound  
  
  
A prison of sound  
  
  
She by the hair of my chinny chin chin  
Eeeoh Eeeoh Eeeoh Eeeoh  
Like a zippo smokes the way  
Hope around  
  
  
You your lungs and your wrists  
They throb like trains  
Choo choo choo  
Its a prison of sound  
  
  
I poke around
