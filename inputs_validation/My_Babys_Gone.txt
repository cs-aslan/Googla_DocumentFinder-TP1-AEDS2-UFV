Woke up this morning my babys gone  
I aint had no loving since my baby been gone  
  
I aint got nobody to stay at home with me  
I aint got nobody to stay at home with me  
I wonder bout my baby whats gonna happen to me  
  
My babys gone gone away from me  
My babys gone gone away from me  
My whole life is in misery
