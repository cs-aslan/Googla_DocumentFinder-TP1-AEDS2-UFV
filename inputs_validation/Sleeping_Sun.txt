The sun is sleeping quietly  
Once upon a century  
Wistful oceans calm and red  
Ardent caresses laid to rest  
  
For my dreams I hold my life  
For wishes I behold my night  
The truth at the end of time  
Losing faith makes a crime  
  
I wish for this nighttime  
to last for a lifetime  
The darkness around me  
Shores of a solar sea  
Oh how I wish to go down with the sun  
Sleeping  
Weeping  
With you  
  
Sorrow has a human heart  
From my god it will depart  
Id sail before a thousand moons  
Never finding where to go  
  
Two hundred twentytwo days of light  
Will be desired by a night  
A moment for the poets play  
Until theres nothing left to say  
  
I wish for this nighttime  
  
I wish for this nighttime
