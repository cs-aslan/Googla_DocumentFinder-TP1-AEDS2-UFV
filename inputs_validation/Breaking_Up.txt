Cold in this room now  
Cause you left me  
Here by myself  
Used to make love here  
Now this place feels  
Like a prison cell  
So many questions  
That we wont answered  
Not today  
Not today  
You scream at me  
I scream at you  
And we communicate  
This way  
  
Were breakin up Oh  
Were breakin up Oh  
Were breakin up  
I think its safe to say its over  
Were breakin up Oh  
Were breakin up Oh  
Were breakin up  
Please dont say its over  
  
I want to touch you  
Your body heat to me  
Is Vegas sun  
But I wont give in  
Because if I do  
That means youve won  
Pride is a leash  
I dont know  
What Im wearing it for  
Why do I do  
This is a game in which  
Both of us are keeping score  
Still we both lose  
Were fools  
  
Were breakin up Oh  
Were breakin up Oh  
Were breakin up  
I think its safe to say its over  
Were breakin up Oh  
Were breakin up Oh  
Were breakin up  
Said please dont say its over  
2x  
  
Dont say its over  
Dont say its over  
Please dont say its over  
Hey dont say its over  
Dont say its over  
Dont say its over  
Please dont say its over  
Baby please  
Dont you say its over  
Baby please  
Dont say it  
  
Were breakin up Oh  
Were breakin up Oh  
Were breakin up  
I think its safe to say its over  
Were breakin up Oh  
Were breakin up Oh  
Were breakin up  
Please dont say its over
