I heard a man who had no lungs  
He took me in and made me lunch  
He told me how Id lost my friend  
He smiled at me it was the end  
I said  
  
Im just a killer for your love  
Im just a killer for your love  
Im just a killer for your love  
Im just a killer for your love  
  
I cut my hair off in the road  
I take my coat off dropped my load  
I wipe my hands on the grass  
Cause I know that nothing ever lasts  
And I said  
  
Im just a killer for your love  
Im just a killer for your love  
Im just a killer for your love  
Im just a killer for your love
