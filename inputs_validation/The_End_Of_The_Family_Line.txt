With no complications  
Fifteen generations

Out into this seething whirl

And Im spared the pain  
Of ever saying

Im the end of the line  
The end of the family line  
The end of the line  
  
  
The decision is mine  
The end of the family line  
The end of the line  
  
  
Im the end of the line  
The end of the family line  
The end of the
