All men have secrets and here is mine  
So let it be known  
For we have been through hell and high tide  
I think I can rely on you  
And yet you start to recoil  
Heavy words are so lightly thrown  
But still Id leap in front of a flying bullet for you  
  
So what difference does it make  
So what difference does it make  
It makes none  
But now you have gone  
And you must be looking very old tonight  
  
The devil will find work for idle hands to do  
I stole and I lied and why  
Because you asked me to  
But now you make me feel so ashamed  
Because Ive only got two hands  
Well Im still fond of you ohhooh  
  
So what difference does it make  
Oh what difference does it make  
Oh it makes none  
But now you have gone  
And your prejudice wont keep you warm tonight  
  
Oh the devil will find work for idle hands to do  
I stole and then I lied  
Just because you asked me to  
But now you know the truth about me  
You wont see me anymore  
Well Im still fond of you ohhooh  
  
But no more apologies  
No more no more apologies  
Oh Im too tired  
Im so sick and tired  
And Im feeling very sick and ill today  
But Im still fond of you ohhooh  
  
Oh my sacred one  
Oh
