Baby I forgot somethin thats why I came home  
Its somethin I really need I know you thought I was gone  
No its not my gloves honey its not that cold today  
Its nothin I left behind its somethin I got to say  
I forgot to say I love you  
And something else that I missed to say how much I need you  
  
Chorus  
  
In a Crazy Crazy World Like This  
Its easy to feel all alone  
You give me the strength I need to exist  
Just hold me and dont let me go  
In a Crazy Crazy World Like This  
  
Sometimes I dont know lately what will ease the pain  
On every corner of the street sometimes its all too insane  
Baby you just got somethin thats why I came home  
Its somethin I really need an now we can be alone  
  
I just had to say I love you and something else that I missed  
To say how much I need you  
  
Chorus  
  
Its easy to fear the unknown  
I always know when fate gives a twist  
Youll be there to soften the blow  
  
In a Crazy Crazy World Like This  Ooh Ooh  
You give me the strength I need to exist  
Just hold me and dont let me go  
  
In a Crazy Crazy World Like This  
Its easy to feel all alone  
I always know when fate gives a twist  
Youll be there to soften the blow  
  
In a Crazy Crazy World Like This  Ooh Ooh  
You give me the strength I need to exist  
Just hold me and dont let me go  
  
In a Crazy Crazy World Like This  
When all my defenses are low  
I always know when fate gives a twist  
Youll be there to soften the blow  
In a Crazy Crazy World Like This
