Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm  
Or a lion through a busy street bazarre  
There are many things Id love to turn you on to  
But somehow I feel theyre safer where they are  
  
Yes theres a man I know  
With no expression  
Hes got none at all  
Yes theres a man that I know  
With no expression darling  
Hes got none at all  
  
Well some people are inbound with infatuation  
And some others spill depression as the law  
From ones mother getting at no imagination  
So beware then maybe sin is at your door  
  
Yes theres a man that I know  
With no expression  
Hes got none at all  
Yes theres a man I know  
With no expression  
Hes got none at all  
  
But you may never never  
See this man laughing  
Come to think of it  
Ive never seen him cry  
But he might be sitting  
And you hear him singing  
And by and by hell stop and sigh  
Before his voice would even begin to speak  
And hed just cry  
  
Yes theres a man I know  
With no expression darling  
Hes got none at all  
Yes Theres a man that I know  
With no expression  
Hes got none at all
