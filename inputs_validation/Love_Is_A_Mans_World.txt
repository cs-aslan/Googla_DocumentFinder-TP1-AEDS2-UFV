Dont you know that the girl left a long time ago  
And I find that she took half the blood that I own  
And it pains me to think about wasting way the years  
So Ill just wash this dirty whiskey glass with my tears  
  
Love is a mans world  
Love is a mans world  
Love is a mans world  
  
Its a crime the way weve been treatin each other  
And a maze in between the real me and the lover  
Im tired of believing that I lost all my senses  
I never though my imaginary dream would be so expensive  
  
Love is a mans world  
Love is a mans world  
Love is a mans world  
  
Love is a mans world etc fade
