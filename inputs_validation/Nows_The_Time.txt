Nows the time to say that were through  
Nows the time because Im through with you  
You treated me so bad  
What a time I had  
With you oh yeah times are bad times are bad  
  
I recall the times that used to be  
We went out together happily  
Then he came along  
I knew that it was wrong  
To treat me so oh yeah times are bad times are bad  
  
I miss the times  
I feel so blue Without you my heart  
Its just runaway  
  
Nows the time to say that were through  
Nows the time because Im through with you  
You treated me so bad  
What a time I had  
With you oh yeah times are bad times are bad  
  
  
I recall the times that used to be  
We went out together happily  
Then he came along  
I knew that it was wrong  
To treat me so oh yeah times are bad times are bad
