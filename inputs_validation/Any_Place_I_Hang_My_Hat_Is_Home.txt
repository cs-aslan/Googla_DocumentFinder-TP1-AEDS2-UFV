Free and easy  
Thats my style  
Howdydo me  
Watch me smile  
  
But farethewell me  
After a while  
Cause I gotta roam  
And any place I hang my hat is home  
  
Sweetenin water  
Cherry wine  
Thank you kindly  
Suits me fine  
  
Kansas city even Carolina  
Thats my honeycomb  
Cause any place I hang my hat is home  
Birds roostin in a tree  
  
Pick up and go  
And the goin proves  
Thats how it oughta to be  
Pick up too when the spirit moves me  
  
Cross the river  
Round the bend  
Howdy stranger  
So long friend  
  
Theres a voice in the lonesome wind  
Keeps a whispering roam  
Im going where a welcome mat is  
No matter where that is  
  
Cause any place I hang my hat is home
