If I could smoke a cigarette right now I would  
Rip out of my skin commit the sins oh I could  
If I could break a heart and throw it all away for just one night  
My conscience wouldnt care if I just went ahead and wrecked my life  
  
I want to be destructive  
Trash everything in site  
Beat the Devil at his game  
Abuse myself all night  
I want to bitch the world out  
One loud aching scream  
Dont want anybody wanting anything from me  
  
Im sick of being perfect with your perfect little smile  
Pick a fight with danger be a stranger to myself for a while  
I want to come unraveled and have it out with my soul  
Im tired of all the voices telling me which way to go  
I wish youd silence your opinion  
Thats the last thing that I want to know  
  
I want to be destructive  
Trash everything in site  
Beat the Devil at his game  
Abuse myself all night  
I want to bitch the world out  
One loud aching scream  
Dont want anybody wanting anything from me  
  
Ill fell better when Im sane  
But now I want to feel no pain  
Im really sick of thinking  
I just want to be destructive  
  
I want to be destructive  
Trash everything in site  
Beat the Devil at his game  
Abuse myself all night  
I want to bitch the world out  
One loud aching scream  
Dont want anybody wanting anything from me
