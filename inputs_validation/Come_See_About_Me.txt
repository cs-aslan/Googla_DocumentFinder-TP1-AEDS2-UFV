Somebody listen Im a voice in the distance cryin  
Come see about me  
I am a stranger in a world filled with anger  
Come see about me  
Im gettin weary tryin to carry this load all by myself  
Im bone tired and fallin cant you hear me callin  
I need somebodys help  
  
I am a young man growin wild across this land  
Come see about me  
Im fourscore and twenty and I aint got anybody  
Come see about me  
Im somebodys children alone and forsaken a wave  
Thats lost at sea  
Im right here behind you Im all around you  
So slow down  
Turn around and you will see  
  
Im your mother your sister and your brother  
Come see about me  
I am a baby my mother aint no lady  
Come see about me  
I am your maker the giver and the taker  
Come see about me
