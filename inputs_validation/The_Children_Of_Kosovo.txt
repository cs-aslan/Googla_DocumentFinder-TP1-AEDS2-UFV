I belive someones out therewhos gonna help me givea nameless  
Child loving and care  
I belive you are out thereyoure gonna help me give the  
Children tender loving care  
  
So much hate has turned  
To vengeance  
All the laughter has turned  
To crying  
While the mothers losetheir children  
From war to war  
  
I am hungry and Im cold andi have no one to hold formy mother and my father
are  
Dead and gone  
Where do I belong  
  
Chorus  
This children of Kosovo  
Are crying for a helping handthe children of Kosovo  
Are dreaming of a peaceful land  
  
They have beaten my  
Older brother  
They have torn away my sister  
Im afraid I want revenge  
Is there no other way  
  
Lets hold our hands tightly together  
And think as one foreveryou and I can make achange for a better world  
No more warchorus
