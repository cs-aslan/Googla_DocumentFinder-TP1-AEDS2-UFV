Love this time of year  
It seems to bring us near  
I wish Christmas was every day  
Theres somethin about those lights  
On that tree at night  
Feelin you girl next to me  
  
Oh baby baby the way we kiss  
Under the mistletoe  
A laugh like little children  
Makin angels in the snow  
Well its in your eyes  
And in your smile it shows  
That this very special time of year  
It seems to set your heart a glow  
Oh sing it with me baby  
  
Chorus  
Oh its Christmas you know its Christmas  
And its our favorite time of year  
Bells will be ringin  
Our hearts are singin  
Well Im glad its Christmas time once again  
  
The citys lit up bright  
On this starry night  
But theres somethin left to do  
Go home and light a fire  
Tell me your hearts desire  
Wrap me up take me away  
  
Oh when Im with you darlin  
Theres so much love that I want to share  
I know you feel it too  
Theres magic in the air  
And in this sweet sweet memories  
We share together  
Theyre gonna last us now  
Now and for ever  
For ever and ever  
  
Chorus
