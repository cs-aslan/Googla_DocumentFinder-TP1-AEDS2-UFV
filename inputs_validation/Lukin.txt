Drive down the street cant find the keys to my own fucking home  
I take a walk so I can curse my ass for being dumb  
I make a right after the arches stinking grease and bone  
Stop at the supermarket people stare like Im a dog  
Ive been goin to LukinsI gotta spot that Lukins  
I knocked the door at Lukinsopened the fridge  
Now I know life is worth  
I find the key but I return to find an open door  
So fucking freezin they jump out the car everybody wants some  
I find my wife I call the cops this days works never done  
The last I heard that freak was purchasing a fucking gun
