I listen to the Trumpet of Jesus  
While the world hears a different sound  
I march to the drumbeat of God Almighty  
While the others just wander around  
Im a member of the Holy Ghost traveling band  
Were moving on up to a better land  
I hear the voice of the Supernatural singing  
Like only those who know Him can  
  
Verse 1  
One sweet sound makes  
A whole world of difference  
When the world seems indifferent to you  
His Melody of love calls you to be great  
When marking time was all you thought you could do  
So if youve been playing all your days by ear  
Never knowing what your song was to be  
Then pull up a chair let down your hair  
And take a few lessons from me  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2  
A spiritual fanfare has a sound all its own  
At the birth of a lasting song  
Its been two thousand years since Jesus was born  
And still the celebration goes on  
If you feel the need to get your life in tune  
Cause youre tired of the derdge every day  
Then turn yourself around  
Put your feet on the ground  
And just hear what I have to say  
  
Chorus
