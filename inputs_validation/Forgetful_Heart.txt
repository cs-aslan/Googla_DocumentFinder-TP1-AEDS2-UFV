Forgetful heart  
Lost your power of recall  
Every little detail  
You dont remember at all  
The times we knew  
Who would remember better than you  
  
Forgetful heart  
We laughed and had a good time you and I  
Its been so long  
Now youre content to let the days go by  
When you were there  
You were the answer to my prayer  
  
Forgetful heart  
We loved with all the love that life can give  
What can I say  
Without you its so hard to live  
Cant take much more  
Why cant we love like we did before  
  
Forgetful heart  
Like a walking shadow in my brain  
All night long  
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain  
The door has closed forevermore  
If indeed there ever was a door
