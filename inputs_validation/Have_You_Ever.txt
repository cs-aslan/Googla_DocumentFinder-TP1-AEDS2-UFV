Chorus  
Have you ever loved somebody so much  
It makes you cry  
Have you ever needed something so bad  
You cant sleep at night  
Have you ever tried to find the words  
But they dont come out right  
Have you ever  
  
Have you ever  
  
Have you ever been in love  
Been in love so bad  
Youd do anything  
To make them understand  
Have you ever had someone  
Steal your heart away  
Youd give anything  
To make them feel the same  
Have you ever searched for words  
To get you in their heart  
But you dont know what to say  
And you dont know where to start  
  
Chorus  
  
Have you ever found the one  
Youve dreamed of all your life  
Youd do just about anything  
To look into their eyes  
Have you finally found the one  
  
Youve given your heart to  
Only to find that one  
Wont give their heart to you  
Have you ever closed your eyes and  
Dreamed that they were there  
  
And all you can do is wait  
For that day when they will care  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
What do I gotta do to get you in my arms baby  
What do I gotta say to get to your heart  
To make you understand  
How I need you next to me  
Gotta get you in my world  
Cause baby I cant sleep  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Have you ever
