Tell me what is on your mind  
Help me cause Id like to know  
What the hell is going on  
Never thought Id sing this song  
  
Lets not get started with the he said she said  
Sometimes it just doesnt go on as planned  
Lets not get started with the he said she said  
Sometimes it just doesnt go on as planned  
  
Started out so simple and innocent  
So simple and innocent so simple and innocent so simple and innocent  
Chemistry like apple and cinnamon  
Like apple and cinnamon like apple and cinnamon like apple and cinnamon  
  
I cant believe that you and me were falling out of love  
And that everybody used to be so envious of us  
Chemistry like apple and cinnamon  
What we had was just too good  
Good to last  
  
Happiness dont last that long  
But what we had was beautiful  
  
Lets not get started with the he said she said  
Sometimes it just doesnt go on as planned  
Lets not get started with the he said she said  
Sometimes it just doesnt go on as planned  
  
Started out so simple and innocent  
So simple and innocent so simple and innocent so simple and innocent  
  
Chemistry like apple and cinnamon  
Like apple and cinnamon like apple and cinnamon like apple and cinnamon  
  
I cant believe that you and me were falling out of love  
And that everybody used to be so envious of us  
Chemistry like apple and cinnamon  
What we had was just too good  
Good to last  
  
Please dont look at me like that oh  
Please dont look at me dont look at me like that oh  
You cant look at me like that aah  
Please dont look at me dont look at me like that oh  
  
I cant believe that you and me were falling out of love  
And that everybody used to be so envious of us  
Chemistry like apple and cinnamon  
What we had was just too good  
  
Started out so simple and innocent  
So simple and innocent so simple and innocent so simple and innocent  
  
Chemistry like apple and cinnamon  
Like apple and cinnamon like apple and cinnamon like apple and cinnamon  
  
I cant believe that you and me were falling out of love  
And that everybody used to be so envious of us  
Chemistry like apple and cinnamon  
What we had was just too good  
Good to last
