It frightens me when you come to mind  
The day you dropped in the shopping line  
And my heart beats faster when I think of all the signs all the signs  
When they carried you out your mouth was open wide  
The cat went astray and the dog did pine for days and days  
And I felt so guilty when we played you up  
When you were ill so ill  
What sticks in my mind is the sweet jar  
On the sideboard And your multicolored tea cozy  
What sticks in my mind is the dewdrop hanging off your nose  
Shriveled up and blue  
And Im getting older too  
But I dont want to die like you  
Dont want to die like you dont want to die like you
