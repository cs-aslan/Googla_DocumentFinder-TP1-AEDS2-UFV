When I think of heaven Deliver me in a blackwinged bird  
I think of flying down into a sea of pens and feathers  
and all other instruments of faith and sex and God  
In the belly of a blackwinged bird  
Dont try to feed me  
Ive been here before and I deserve a little more  
  
I belong in the service of the Queen I belong anywhere but in between  
Shes been crying Ive been thinking And I am the Rain King  
  
Mama why am I so alone  
I cant go outside  
Im scared I might not make it home  
Im alive but Im sinking in  
If theres anyone at home at your place  
Why dont you invite me in  
Dont try to bleed me  
Ive been there before and I deserve a little more  
  
I belong in the service of the Queen  
I belong anywhere but in between  
Shes been lying  
Ive been sinking  
And I am the Rain King  
  
Hey I only want the same as anyone  
Henderson is waiting for the sun  
Oh it seems night endlessly begins and ends  
After all the dreaming I come home again  
  
When I think of heaven Deliver me in a blackwinged bird  
I think of dying Lay me down in a field of flame and heather  
Render up my body into the burning heart of God in the belly of a blackwinged  
bird  
Dont try to bleed me  
Ive been here before and I deserve a little more  
  
I belong in the service of the Queen  
I belong anywhere but in between  
Shes been dying  
I been drinking and I am the Rain King
