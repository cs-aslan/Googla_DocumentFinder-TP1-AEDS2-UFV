Come now Antoine give me your hand  
I will fly you across the land  
You were nobody  
Now youre somebody  
We will search for the dream of the king  
And friends will hate us  
And you will lead us  
You cant change the plan when its made  
But we have changed it  
Chorus Die for your freedom while you can  
You can always use new blood  
Sing me Lila negation cow  
Fish will follow with eyes man  
Hand on my shoulders  
March with true soldiers  
And in fact dear the flesh is no more  
Was burnt for our savior  
Offensive behavior  
And the last whale will swim to the shore  
And the new land of danger  
Chorus
