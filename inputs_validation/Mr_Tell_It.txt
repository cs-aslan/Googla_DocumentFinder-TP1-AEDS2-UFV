Verse 1  
I got Mr Tell It up on the phone  
Disturbing peace inside my home  
Tryna tell my biz and shit so he can get inside the throne  
I guess the nigga like my song after I fucked a niggas bitch  
Im fucking niggaz all daily baby aint gotta snitch  
Strong youll never sell memoir salt dont kill a playa

Ever since the third grade still got the same waves  
Ridin and kickin shit with you

Synonyms and antonyms negatives and positives  
Frankly what Im trying to say you can tell the President  
My hoe know numbers Gotti on tip she relevant  
Chorus  
Verse 2  
Mr Tell It tell the truth is you jealous or you jes  
Overprotected dont fuck around and get no injection  
Not bout the bitch but bout the principle  
That you want to see me living life miserable  
They say bullets aint got no name money aint got no rules  
And a bitch gone do what she want to  
My street literature spit at her so quick and smooth  
She give a fuck about the hustling doubts that you went through  
So get yourself together dawg and tune in tonight  
She want to fuck with a thug Mr Tell It you too nice  
All you want to do is lick her pussy and hit her bare  
She want to fuck with a nigga that dont really care  
Yo gotti hit the bitch and Ill never call her again  
Same room same hotel next week with her friend  
So Mr Tell It I hope you linen listen  
Stay the fuck up out my business  
Chorus  
Verse 3
