Im A little tin soldier that wants to jump into the fight  
Yes you youre a look in your eye a dream passing by in the sky  
Now I dont understand  
But all I need is treat me like a man  
Cause I aint no child take me like I am  
  
Ive got to know Im in love with you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to  
Sing to you  
  
All I need is your whispered hello smiles melting from your window  
Your eyes are deeper than time sailing on that with the breeze  
So now Ive lost my way  
I need help to show me things to say  
Give me your love before love fades away  
  
Ive got to know Im in love with you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to  
Sing it to you  
  
I dont need no Compensation  
And I just got to beg you listen  
I just got to beg you  
Ive got to know Im in love with you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to  
Sing it to you watch out  
I just want some reaction  
Someone to give me satisfaction  
All Ive gotta to do is stay next to you  
Some reaction  
A little bit of satisfaction  
All Im gonna do is get next to you  
Ive got to know Im in love with you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to  
Sing it to you  
  
Ive got to know Im in love with you yes I am  
Do anything that you want me to Im gonna sing her a song  
Sing any song that you want me to right on ta you  
Sing it to you Yeah yeah

Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to
