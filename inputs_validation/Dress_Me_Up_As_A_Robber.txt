Well you can dress me up as a robber  
But I wont be in disguise  
Only love is a robber  
And he lives within your eyes  
Ooh ooh eee ooh  
  
You can dress me up as a sailor  
But Ill never run to sea  
As long as your love is available to me  
What do I do with a sea of blue  
Ooh eee ooh  
  
Dressing me up  
It doesnt make a difference  
What you want to do  
Whichever way you look at it  
Im still in love with you  
If we go on forever  
I may never make a change  
  
Dressing me up  
And if I dont convince you  
You neednt look too far  
To see that Im not lying  
Cause I love you the way you are  
And whats the point of changing  
When Im happy as I am  
  
Well you can dress me up as a soldier  
But I wouldnt know what for  
I was the one that told you he loved you  
Dont want to go to another war  
No no no
