I close my eyes  
And there in the shadows I see your light  
You come to me out of my dreams across the night  
  
You take my hand  
Though you may be so many stars away  
I know that our spirits and souls are one  
Weve circled the moon and weve touched the sun  
So here well stay  
  
For Always  
Forever  
Beyond here and on to eternity  
For Always  
Forever  
For us theres no time and no space  
No barrier love wont erase  
Wherever you go l still know in my heart you will be with me  
  
From this day on  
Im certain that Ill never be alone  
I know what my heart must have always known  
That love has a power thats all its own  
  
And For Always  
Forever  
Now we can fly  
And For Always and Always  
We will go on  
Beyond  
Goodbye  
  
For Always  
Forever  
Beyond here and on to eternity  
For Always and Ever  
Youll be a part of me  
  
And For Always  
Forever  
A thousand tomorrows may cross the sky  
And For Always and Always  
We will go on  
Beyond  
Goodbye
