Whos taking time out well take a shine out  
Were the boys we got nothing to lose  
Ive had enough now of school and stuff now  
If you aint with us then its just bad news  
  
Only you can rock me rock me  
Come on back now do it again  
Only you can rock me rock me  
Kicking out just like a hurricane  
  
We cant wait from day to day  
Cause weve got something to say  
We cant wait from day to day  
Cause weve got something to say  
  
Come on the street now on every corner  
Breaking out and were doing what we want to  
Just like a jewel shines in the night  
She burns so hot out under the street light  
  
Chorus  
  
We are here and theres no end  
We keep on coming again  
We are here and theres no end  
We just keep coming again  
  
Whos taking time out we take a shine out  
Were the boys we got nothing to lose  
Ive had enough now of school  
  
And stuff now  
If you aint with us then its just bad news  
  
Only you can rock me rock me  
Come on back now do it again  
Only you can rock me rock me  
Kicking out just like a hurricane  
  
We cant wait from day to day  
Cause weve got something to say  
We are here and theres no end  
Well keep on coming again  
  
We cant wait from day to day  
Cause weve got something to say  
We are here and theres no end  
Well keep on coming again
