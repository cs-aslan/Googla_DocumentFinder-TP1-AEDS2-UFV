Im sitting here Im lonely  
In a smokey night cafe all the guys are so happy  
Baby I can see  
Im sitting here Im lonely  
Thinking of you girl all this sweet sweet memories  
We built a better world  
When will I see you again baby let me be your man  
Tell me that you miss me my sweet baby  
I wont cry for yesterday baby come and hear me say  
Tell me do I have a chance my love  
  
I will run to you I will kiss the rain  
Make your dreams come true if I have you back again  
I will run to you everyday and night  
Give you all my heart want to have you by my side  
  
Im sitting here Im lonely  
Catch a falling star when youre there the sky is bluer  
But you are so far  
Im sitting here Im lonely  
Cant trust your pretty face maybe you were telling lies  
I saw you in this place  
When will I see you again baby let me be your man  
Tell me that you miss me my sweet baby  
I wont cry for yesterday baby come and make my day  
Tell me do I have a chance my love
