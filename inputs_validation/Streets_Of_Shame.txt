I was a long way from home on the streets of shame  
Where the women in cages play any kind of game  
Thats when I saw her and I looked into her eyes   
I dont speak the language but I sure see the merchandise  
Oh what could I say I was hot for you  
When you walk that way whats a man supposed to do  
Tell me where I draw the line let me have it one more time  
She was a sight she had a ring right through her nose  
A feeling came over me from my head right down to my toes  
Must have been the voodoo or that trickery  
Like something in a movie by rico fellini  
Oh what could I say I was hot for you  
When you walk that way whats a man supposed to do  
Tell me where I draw the line let me have it one more time  
Black halter walk the streets of shame repeat four times  
Well I think she knew by now that I was no saint  
Is this the holy cow waiting till I retain  
Left her angel lineup  I was begging her for more  
Standing on the concrete Im going to break down the door  
Oh what could I do I was hot for you  
When you walk that way whats a man supposed to do  
Tell me where I draw the line let me have it one more time  
Black halter walk the streets of shame repeat and fade
