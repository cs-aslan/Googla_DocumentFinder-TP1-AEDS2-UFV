Im going down to Rose Maries  
She never does me wrong  
She puts it to me plain as day  
And gives it to me for a song  
  
Its a wicked life but what the hell  
The stars aint falling down  
Im standing outside the Taj Mahal  
I dont see no one around  
  
Goin to Acapulco  
Goin on the run  
Goin down to see fat gut  
Goin to have some fun  
Yeah  
Goin to have some fun  
  
Now whenever I get up  
And I aint got what I see  
I just make it down to Rose Maries  
Bout a quarter after three  
  
There are worse ways of getting there  
And I aint complainin none  
If the clouds dont drop and the train dont stop  
Im bound to meet the sun  
  
Goin to Acapulco  
Goin on the run  
Goin down to see some girl  
Goin to have some fun  
Yeah  
Goin to have some fun  
  
Now if someone offers me a joke  
I just say no thanks  
I try to tell it like it is  
And keep away from pranks  
  
Well sometime you know when the well breaks down  
I just go pump on it some  
Rose Marie she likes to go to big places  
And just set there waitin for me to come  
  
Goin to Acapulco  
Goin on the run  
Goin down to see some girl  
Goin to have some fun  
Yeah  
Goin to have some fun
