Dont feel like home  
Ease a little out  
And all these words alone is nothing like a poem  
Putting in inputting in  
Dont feel like methadone  
A scratching voice all alone is nothing like your baritone  
  
Its nothing as it seems  
All that he needs is home  
The little that he sees  
Is nothing he concedes  
Its home  
  
One uninvited chromosome  
A blanket like the ozone  
  
Its nothing as it seems  
All that he needs is home  
The little that he frees is nothing he believes  
  
Saving up a sunny day  
Something maybe two tone  
Anything of his own  
A chip off the corner stone  
Whos kidding  
Rainy day  
A one way ticket headstone  
An occupation overthrown  
From a whisper through a megaphone  
  
Its nothing as it seems  
All that he needs is home  
And all that he sees is nothing he conceives  
But its home  
  
And all that he frees  
A little bittersweet is home  
Its nothing as it seems  
The little that you see is home
