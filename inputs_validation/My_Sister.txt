Hey girl its me just called to tell you hi  
Call me when you get this  
Havent talked lately so hard to find the time  
Give the boys a big kiss  
Tell them that I miss them  
By the way I miss you too  
I was thinking just today  
About how we used to play  
Barbie dolls and makeup  
Tea Parties dress up  
I remember how wed fight  
And make up and laugh all night  
Wish we were kids again  
My sister my friend  
  
Oh yeah before I forget I met someone  
I think I really like him  
I was just wondering if Im jumping the gun  
By going out on a limb  
And invite him home for Christmas  
To meet the family  
Seems like just yesterday  
You brought home oh whats his name  
He had been drinking what were you thinking  
After dinner he passed out  
We can laugh about it now  
Cause weve learned a lot since then  
My sister my friend  
  
Do you think you could come and  
See me sometime soon see me sometime soon  
We could just hang out like we used to  
  
Its late and I should go  
But I cant hang up the phone  
Until I tell you what I dont tell you enough  
Even though at times it seemed  
We were more like enemies  
Id do it all again  
My sister my friend  
  
Oh my sister my friend
