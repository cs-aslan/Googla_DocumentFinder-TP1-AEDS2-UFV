If theres a time  
When the tears should fill your eyes  
And you cant see past the shadows  
To the sun on the other side  
Dont despair  
Because there always will be someone there  
Dont lose faith  
Love wont let you lose your way because you  
  
Chorus  
Youll never stand alone  
Ill be standing by  
Ill keep you from the cold  
Ill hold you when you cry  
Ill be there to be strong  
When you cant find the strength inside  
And you youll always have a home  
In these arms of mine  
And youll never stand alone  
Love is standing by  
  
Oh yes it is yes  
If theres a day when the rain should find your heart  
And youre cold and tired and lonely  
And this world has you in the dark  
Dont be scared  
You can just reach for me  
And Ill be there  
Dont lose hope  
Love will see you through you know  
Ill be cause you  
  
Chorus  
  
Standing by to life you above  
All the hurt and pain oh yeah  
Standing by to carry you through  
All the tears and rain  
Oh reach for me  
Ill be there for you  
Reach for me babe yeah  
Ill see you through  
See Ill be the one to hold you  
The one to show you that you  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Oh love is standing by
