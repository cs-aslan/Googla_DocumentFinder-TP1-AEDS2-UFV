If this life is one act  
Why do we lay all these traps  
We put them right in our path  
When we just wanna be free  
  
I will not waste my days  
Making up all kinds of ways  
To worry about all the things  
That will not happen to me  
  
So I just let go of what I know I dont know  
And I know I only do this by  
Living in the moment  
Living my life  
Easy and breezy  
With peace in my mind  
With peace in my heart  
Peace in my soul  
Wherever Im going Im already home  
Living in the moment  
  
Im letting myself off the hook for things Ive done  
I let my past go past  
And now Im having more fun  
Im letting go of the thoughts  
That do not make me strong  
And I believe this way can be the same for everyone  
  
And if I fall asleep  
I know youll be the one wholl always remind me  
To live in the moment  
To live in my life  
Easy and breezy  
With peace in my mind  
I got peace in my heart  
Got peace in my soul  
Wherever Im going Im already home  
  
I cant walk through life facing backwards  
I have tried  
I tried more than once to just make sure  
And I was denied the future Id been searching for  
But I spun around and hurt no more  
By living in the moment  
Living my life  
Easy and breezy  
With peace in my mind  
I got peace in my heart  
Got peace in my soul  
Wherever Im going Im already home  
  
Im living in the moment  
Im living my life  
Just taking it easy  
With peace in my mind  
I got peace in my heart  
I got peace in my soul  
Oh wherever Im going Im already home  
Im living in the moment  
Im living my life  
Oh easy and breezy  
With peace in my mind  
I got peace in my heart  
I got peace in my soul  
Oh wherever Im going Im already home  
Im living in the moment
