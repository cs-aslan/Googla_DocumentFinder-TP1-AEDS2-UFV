Therell be  
No darkness tonight  
Lady our love  
Will shine  
Just put  
Your trust in my heart  
And meet me  
In paradise girl  
Youre every wonder  
In this world to me  
A treasure time  
Wont steal away  
  
Chorus  
So listen to my heart  
Lay your body  
Close to mine  
Let me fill you  
With my dreams  
I can make you  
Feel alright  
And baby  
Through the years  
Gonna love you  
More each day  
So I promise you tonight  
That youll always be  
The lady in my life  
  
Lay back  
In my tenderness  
Lets make this  
A night we wont forget  
Girl  
I need your sweet caress  
Reach out to a fantasy  
Two hearts  
In the beat of ecstasy  
Come to me girl  
  
Chorus  
  
And I will  
Keep you warm  
Through the shadows  
Of the night  
Let me touch you  
With my love  
I can make you  
Feel so right  
And baby  
Through the years  
Even when  
Were old and gray  
I will love you  
More each day  
Cause you  
Will always be  
The lady in my life  
  
Stay with me  
I want you  
To stay with me
