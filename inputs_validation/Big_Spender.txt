The minute you walked in the joint  
I could see you were a man of distinction  
A real big spender  
Good lookin so refined  
Say wouldnt you like to know  
Whats goin on in my mind  
So let me get to the point  
I dont pop my cork for every guy I see  
Hey big spender  
Spend a little time with me  
Wouldnt you like to have fun fun fun  
Hows about a few laughs laughs laughs  
I can show you a good time  
Let me show you a good time  
The minute you walked in the joint  
I could see you were a man of distinction  
A real big spender  
Good lookin so refined  
Say wouldnt you like to know  
Whats goin on in my mind  
So let me get to the point  
I dont pop my cork for every guy I see  
Hey big spender  
Hey big spender  
Hey big spender  
Spend a little time with me
