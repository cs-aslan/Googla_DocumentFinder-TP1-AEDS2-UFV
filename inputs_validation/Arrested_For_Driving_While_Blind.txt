When youre driving down the highway at night  
And youre feelin that wild turkeys bite  
Dont give Johnny Walker a ride  
Cause Jack Black is right by your side  
You might get taken to the jailhouse and find  
Youve been arrested for driving while blind  
  
Now just the other night with nothin to do  
We broke a case of proof 102  
And started itchin for that wonderful feel  
Of rollin in an automobile  
You could say we was out of our mind  
And let me tell you we were flyin while blind  
  
Then they had us up against the wall  
Hey its only blood grain alcohol  
And there aint no cause for alarm  
We aint out to do nobody no harm  
How could anyone be so unkind  
To arrest a man for drivin while blind
