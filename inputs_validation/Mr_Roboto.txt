Domo arigato misuta Robotto  
Mata au hi made  
Domo arigato misuta Robotto  
Himitsu wo shiritai  
  
Youre wondering who I ammachine or mannequin  
With parts made in Japan I am the modern man  
  
Ive got a secret Ive been hiding under my skin  
My heart is human my blood is boiling my brain IBM  
So if you see me acting strangely dont be surprised  
Im just a man who needed someone and somewhere to hide  
To keep me alive just keep me alive  
Somewhere to hide to keep me alive  
  
Im not a robot without emotions Im not what you see  
Ive come to help you with your problems so we can be free  
Im not a hero Im not a savior forget what you know  
Im just a man whose circumstances went beyond his control  
Beyond my control we all need control  
I need control we all need control  
  
I am the modern man who hides behind a mask  
So no one else can see my true identity  
  
Domo arigato Mr Roboto domo domo  
Domo arigato Mr Roboto domo domo  
Domo arigato Mr Roboto  
Domo arigato Mr Roboto  
Domo arigato Mr Roboto  
Domo arigato Mr Roboto  
  
Thank you very much Mr Roboto  
For doing the jobs nobody wants to  
And thank you very much Mr Roboto  
For helping me escape to where I needed to  
Thank you thank you thank you  
I want to thank you please thank you oh yeah  
  
The problems plain to see too much technology  
Machines to save our lives Machines dehumanize  
  
The time has come at last  
To throw away this mask  
Now everyone can see  
My true identity  
Im Kilroy Kilroy Kilroy Kilroy
