I love to see you oh my love  
I want to feel you near  
My need is deep inside  
Well Ive been rolling on  
Ive been holding on  
Id like you to know  
That its been a long long time  
Sometimes its hard to make it through the day  
Sometimes its hard to find my way  
Sometimes its hard to notice the changing days  
When your friends have all gone  
Leaving this town for another one  
The night is coming round  
I can feel the weight of coming down  
So afraid to lose this dream  
I want you to understand that Im trying to do the best I can  
Its so easy to lose my way  
Lay your head where you may find some peace  
Ive been searching for my happiness  
Dont you want to wake up and take my love  
Id be happy if youd let me know  
Should I stay or go  
Let me know  
Woke from a dream to see reflections all around me  
Of new realities  
Heavenly angels wont you guide me  
Please help me to decide the path most  
Meant for me
