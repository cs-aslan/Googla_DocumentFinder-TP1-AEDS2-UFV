My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac  
Yes she did  
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac  
She said Hey come here Daddy

Baby baby wont you hear my plea  
Cmon sugar just come on back to me  
She said Balls to you Big Daddy  
She aint never coming back  
  
Baby baby wont you hear my plea  
Oh cmon just hear my plea  
She said Balls to you Daddy  
She aint coming back to me  
  
Baby baby drove up in a Cadillac  
I said Jesus Christ Whered you get that cadillac  
She said Balls to you big Daddy  
She aint never coming back  
She aint never coming back  
She aint never coming back
