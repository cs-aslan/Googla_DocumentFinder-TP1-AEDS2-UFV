We get the sweating you can feel my heartbeat

Baby its time to switch out the way things go  
Tonights the night youll be in control  
I bought you a uniform so your could play the role  
Now heres the stethoscope  
  
Lady I know before we was going kinda cold  
The same old the same old we seem to take a toll  
Tryin to take it back take a sip all go  
And try a couple things we never did before  
Maybe you could be a freak for me at the door  
I come up to the crib you dressed ready to go  
Girl take it down low n make it clap real slow  
I never had so much fun without spending dough  
Baby you the star of the big boy show  
I love you even more now you unpredictable  
Once we in the bedroom there no telling wha we do  
So what you wanna do

I like it when your close than visible  
This condition it critical off to the bathroom  
There we go you ride better than my new convertible  
  
Yeah time for you to buss out the new red pumps  
Ima lick shots let the box spring jump  
Go ahead n play the roll Ima give you what you want  
Side to side bring it back to the front  
Dress up like the marshals on a man hunt  
Leave all my jewels cos you love it when I stunt  
Ill play any role accept being the chump  
My Jon lil girl you love it when I crunk  
Your boy told sniff Im the future of the funk  
Pretend we lil kids play tag and dry hum  
Feel my whole movie back to work just before lunch  
Thats what I want
