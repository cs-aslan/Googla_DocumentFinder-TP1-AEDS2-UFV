One more trip down  
To the lost and found  
To find your heart that the  
Quarterback punk dropped on the ground  
One more trip down  
To the lost and found  
To find your heart  
  
Left out  
The one they picked last for the big ball game  
Beat up after class  
No doubt  
Youll show them one day  
You are not the same  
You wont be the last one anymore  
  
One long walk down  
Through the hallways now  
Youre finding out  
That you dont fit in this time around  
One long walk down  
Through the hallways now  
You feel left out
