When Johnny comes marching home again  
Hurrah Hurrah  
Well give him a hearty welcome then  
Hurrah Hurrah  
The men will cheer and the boys will shout  
The ladies they will all turn out  
And well all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home  
  
The old church bell will peal with joy  
Hurrah Hurrah  
To welcome home our darling boy  
Hurrah Hurrah  
The village lads and lassies say  
With roses they will strew the way  
And well all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home  
  
Get ready for the Jubilee  
Hurrah Hurrah  
Well give the hero three times three  
Hurrah Hurrah  
The laurel wreath is ready now  
To place upon his loyal brow  
And well all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home  
  
Let love and friendship on that day  
Hurrah hurrah  
Their choicest pleasures then display  
Hurrah hurrah  
And let each one perform some part  
To fill with joy the warriors heart  
And well all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home
