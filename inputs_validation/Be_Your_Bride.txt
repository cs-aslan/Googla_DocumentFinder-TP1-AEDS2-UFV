When Im gone from here  
Will you wait for me  
When Im far from here  
Will you pray for me  
Would you care for me  
If I needed hospitality  
Would you cry for me  
If I were lying in bed  
Lying in bed dying  
  
Would you walk for me  
If I had no feet  
Would you talk for me  
If I had no speech  
Would you see for me  
If I had no sight  
Would you hear for me  
If I couldt hear  
I couldnt hear anymore  
She says  
  
Chorus  
I will be your bride  
Be there truly by your side  
I will be your bride  
I will give my fullest heart  
  
Now that I must go  
I know youll wait for me  
Theyre taking me to war  
To cease the enemy  
Heavens strength will grow  
Within you and me  
In crucial times itll show  
If were bond as one  
To make a big family  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres no limits life is long  
Theres no limits life goes on  
Theres no limits life is long  
Theres no boundaries  
cause life goes on  
  
When Im gone from here  
Will you wait for me  
When Im far from here  
Will you pray for me  
Would you care for me  
If I needed hospitality  
Would you cry for me  
If I were lying in bed  
Lying in bed dying  
She says  
  
Chorus  
Theres no limits life is long  
Theres no boundaries  
cause life goes on
