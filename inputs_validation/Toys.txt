We are the night  
Well tempt you and turn you on  
Live in our hearts  
And play with your man  
Oh these are your toys  
Hold them and theyll obey  
Blood into life  
They still become your toys  
This is your game  
In heaven in your bedroom  
Chivalrous knight  
Will save you tonight  
Theyll look for reasons again and again  
Let them go let them go let them go  
Youll have your reason again and again  
For letting them go for letting them go  
We are the night  
Well tempt you and turn you on  
Live in our hearts  
And play with your man  
Theyll look for reasons again and again  
Let them go let them go let them go  
Youll have your reasons again and again  
For letting them go for letting them go  
Oh stand by the wall  
Watch as they shoot you down  
Blood onto stone  
Theyre still your toys  
Your toys your toys
