I am wanted dead or alive  
Im wanted everywhere  
Ive got to survive  
They say I am a violent man  
Only trying to do the best I can dig it  
I am wanted dead or alive  
Fifteen states Ive got to survive  
I am wanted dead or alive  
Im a new kind of man  
Ive got to survive  
Running a long way  
I am wanted dead or alive  
Im wanted everywhere  
Ive got to survive  
Now all Im trying to do  
Is find a peaceful place  
But they say I have an outlaw face  
My Lord I have an outlaws face  
I have an outlaws face  
They say I have an outlaws face  
My my yes I have an outlaws face  
I have an outlaws face I have an outlaws face  
Oh my Lord I have an outlaws face  
Sweet God Almighty I have an outlaws face
