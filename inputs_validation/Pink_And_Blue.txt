Pretty pink baby blue

Were allwere all just babies in my veiw  
So crawl baby crawl baby

Miss lady  
You coulda been born a little later but I dont care  
So what if yo head sports a couple of gray hairs  
Same hea and actually I think its funky  
in a Claire Huxtible type of way  
Miss lady  
It looks to me like you need a little juice in ya life  
Call me when dat big old house get lonelyfied  
And Ill telleport from here to there  
You show me how its sposed to be done  
Ill make sure you have young fun  
  
Pretty pink baby blue  
Why dontwhy dontcha teach me sumthin new  
Were allwere all just babies in my veiw  
So crawl baby crawl baby

Youre so sophisticated  
Just me and miss lady  
Got me talkin like a baby  
You got me talkin like a baby that baby talk  
keep repeating until fade
