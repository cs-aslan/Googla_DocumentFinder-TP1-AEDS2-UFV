There he goes hes walkin away  
Each step he takes brings heartache my way  
She won his heart I lost him someway  
There he goes hes walkin away  
  
If I hadnt cheated and I hadnt lied  
Id be the one walkin by his side  
I love him still and I guess that it shows  
Hes walkin away there he goes  
  
Oh if I hadnt cheated and I hadnt lied  
Id be the one walkin by his side  
I love him still and I guess that it shows  
Hes walkin away there he goes
