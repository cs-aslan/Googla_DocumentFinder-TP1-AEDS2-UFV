Its okay  
Allow yourself a little hate  
Hatred is not so bad  
When directed at injustice  
You can turn the other cheek  
Just dont turn the other way  
  
Enemy of the planet  
We finally have a common hate  
A reason to forget about our differences  
And stand as a united front  
Its up to us we must expose humiliate  
American Errorists  
Well start with one  
  
The War Has Just begun  
The War Has Just begun
