Tuesdays coming my baby  
I told you Wednesday morning  
Its not too late for us  
My bags arent out the door baby  
dont you know lifes a feeling  
But without you its nothing  
Its not too late for us  
My bags arent out the door baby  
Tuesdays coming and  
Im not gonna leave you here darling  
  
Its a shame you cant hear me  
Scream my lungs out believe me  
The miles burn me up  
Im living just to watch your fire darling  
Im headed out for the road now  
The engines hold me while sleeping  
A road might take me away  
But its sure enough to bring me home baby  
Tuesdays coming  
And Im not gonna leave you here darling  
  
Tuesdays coming
