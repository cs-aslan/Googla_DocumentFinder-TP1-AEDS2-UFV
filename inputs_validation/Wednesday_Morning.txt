Wednesday morning was the last time we talked  
I guess she figured it was better if she walked  
It couldve been me just the same  
Theres no winner in this game  
Oh Wednesday morning was the last time we talked  
Wednesday evening was the first time she cried  
It couldve turned out different if Id lied  
Something deep within us all  
Sees the writing on the wall  
Oh Wednesday evening we didnt talk at all  
Ive been waiting every evening  
Wondering what Im gonna say  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday wont go away  
It couldve been me just the same  
Theres no winner in this game  
Oh Wednesday evening and nothing is the same  
Oh Ive been waiting every evening  
Wondering what Im gonna say  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday wont go away  
Wednesday morning yeah  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday wont go away  
Ive been waiting every evening  
Wondering what Im gonna say  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday wont go away yeah  
Wednesday morning yeah  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday wont go away  
Wednesday morning yeah
