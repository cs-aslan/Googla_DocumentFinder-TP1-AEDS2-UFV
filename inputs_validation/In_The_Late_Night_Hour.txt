When you see me on ya block call the police  
Let them motherfuckers no here come the beast  
Oh in the late night hour  
  
Straight out of Compton a crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube  
And Im rollin with the motherfuckin Neptunes  
When Im caught off I got a sawedoff  
A midget bitch thatll suck a niggas balls off  
You too girl if ya fuck with me  
Im gettin head in the lane doin sixty  
About to crash like Teddy Pendergrass  
Mama said a hard head make a tender ass  
To all the dogs that bark a lot  
Who dont give a fuck if its dark or not  
Well be creepin in the parking lot  
Motherfuckers dont know if I can park or not  
Cause I circle like vultures La Costa Nostra  
Bumpin all the baddest bitches like Im posed to  
Whats yo name whats yo number and ya culture  
You need nuts in yo face like a poster  
  
If you in a club nigga then shit bang  
If you on the streets nigga then shit bang  
If you on the block nigga then shit bang  
And if its what ya need boy do ya thang  
If ya in a Range Rov then shit bang  
If you in that six hundred then shit bang  
If you on that Steel Horse then shit bang  
But if its what ya need boy let it bang  
  
Fuck the police comin straight from the underground  
Fuckin pig want to act like he like me now  
In eighty six same bitch tried to lock me down  
And motherfuckers want to ask why Im cocky now  
To all the bitches that think they bootylicious  
I think they nutritious I think they do dishes  
Im makin three wishes or takin they pictures  
And spendin they riches and fuckin they bitches  
Egomaniac lil homies call me brainiac  
Ice Cubes an asshole and it aint a knack  
So take a hit of that and remember that  
Where my motherfuckin niggas and my bitches at  
In the late night hour hit the front to back  
Check the motherfuckin rims on the Cadillac  
On the ass attack can you keep it tight  
And if the head right nigga there every night  
  
This is for my niggas thats schemin for cash  
And lookin for ass In the late night hour  
This is for my people thats countin they riches  
And pickin up bitches In the late night hour  
This is for my niggas thats countin they cash  
And lookin for ass In the late night hour  
This is for my people thats schemin for riches  
And pickin up bitches In the late night hour  
So check it and everybody get naked  
This might be a nigga last record  
But respect it cause I could do it all night playa  
Im all fight playa you all spite playa  
Its all right playa a nigga might care  
But to catch me you gotta do a light year  
Ice Cube insane in the membrane  
Baby go ahead please do the damn thang  
We gonna get chu high nigga  
Our rhymes will get chu by nigga  
Tell me if I qualify nigga  
To bail in like SuperFly  
I want to get that cop that buy that drive that  
You want it too but dont know where to start at  
Fuckin with me nigga better bring his hard hat  
Nigga where ya heart at leave ya on the tarmac  
Where my top at and my nigga Mack  
Ridin shotgun with the top gun  
Dont catch a hot one soon as he spot one  
Westside Connection is a doctrine  
This aint another club song  
Or love song that whyall can fuck on  
So get the fuck on  
A nigga rich cant believe the bullshit that Im stuck on
