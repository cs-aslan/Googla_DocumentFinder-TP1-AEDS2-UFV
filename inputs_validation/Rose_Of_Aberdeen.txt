Im a rambler Im a gambler  
Im a long way from my home  
If you people dont like me  
I can make out on my own  
  
Casue its dark  
And its rainin  
And the Moon gives no light  
And my pony can hardly travel  
On this darkened road at night  
  
You know once I had a true love  
Though her age was just sixteen  
She was the flower of Belton  
And the rose of Aberdine  
  
But her parents did not like me  
And now she feels much the same  
If Im writ on in your Diary  
Well blot out my name  
  
Cause theres changes in the ocean  
And theres changes in the sea  
And theres changes in my own true love  
But there aint to changin me
