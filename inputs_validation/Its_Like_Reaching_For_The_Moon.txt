Its like reaching for the moon  
Its like reaching for the sun  
Its like reaching for the stars  
Reaching for you  
  
Youre so far above me  
How can I expect than an angel to love me  
Who is as divine as you are  
  
Its like flying without wings  
Playing fiddle without strings  
And a million other things  
No one can do  
Though my hopes are slender  
In my secret heart I pray youll surrender soon  
No its like reaching for the moon
