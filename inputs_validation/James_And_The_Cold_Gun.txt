James come on home  
Youve been gone too long baby  
We cant let our hero die alone  
We miss you day and night  
You left town to live by the rifle  
You left us to fight  
But it just aint right to take away the light  
  
Remember Genie from the casino  
Shes still awaiting in her big brass bed  
The boys from your gang are knocking whisky back  
Till they get out of hand  
And wish they were dead  
Theyre only lonely for the life they led  
With their old friend  
Oh  
James are you selling your soul to a cold gun  
  
Where lies your heart  
Its not there in the buckskin baby  
Its not there in the gin that makes you laugh long and loud  
  
Youre a coward James  
Youre running away from humanity  
Youre running out on reality  
It wont be funny when they  
Ratatat you down  
  
Remember Genie from the casino  
Shes still awaiting in her big brass bed  
The boys from your gang are knocking whisky back  
Till they get out of hand  
And wish they were dead  
Theyre only lonely for the life they led  
With their old friend  
Oh  
James are you selling your soul to a cold gun
