Chanukah is  
The festival of lights  
One day of presents  
Hell no we get the eight crazy nights  
But if you still feel like the only kid in town  
Without a Christmas tree  
I guess my first two songs didnt do it for you  
So here comes number three  
  
Ross and Phoebe from Friends  
Say the Chanukah blessing  
So does Lennys pal Squiggy and Will and Graces Debra Messing  
Melissa Gilbert and Michael Landon never mixed meat with dairy  
Maybe they should have called that show  
Little Kosher House on the Prairie  
We got Jerry Lewis  
Ben Stiller and Jack Black  
Tom Arnold converted to Judaism

Underneath the mistletoe  
But we can do it all night long
