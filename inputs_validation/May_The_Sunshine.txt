May the sun the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you  
May the sun the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you  
  
Someone woke me up again last night  
Talkin to me about my last time  
Dont tell me I know its late  
Please please lay me down a line  
Pick me up before I start to fall  
Never let your dreams grow small  
  
May the sun the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you  
May the sun the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you  
  
Talkin to my lover she was out  
It was independence day  
Dont be nervous  you can hold me tight  
Someone turned the light out on the stairs  
Was it just the wind I heard  
Just another helping hand  
  
May the sun the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you  
May the sun the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you  
  
Take me back down the yellow brick road  
Let me get my ticket to your heart  
Strangers hidin on my land  
Could it be its keepin me apart  
Give me time dont you gimme no love  
Let the sunshine in your heart  
  
May the sun the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you  
May the sun the sun shine bright  
May the sun shine bright on you
