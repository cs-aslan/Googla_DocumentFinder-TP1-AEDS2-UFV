Mr Guder  
Say Mr Guder  
May I have a moment with you  
Because there is something Ive got to say  
And please dont let it scare you away  
  
Mr Guder  
Say Mr Guder  
I have seen you go through a day  
Youre everything a robot lives for  
Walk in at nine and roll out the door at five  
  
You reflect the company image  
You maintain their rules to live by  
Shine your shoes lets keep a neat haircut  
Now that youre wearing a coat and tie  
  
Mr Guder  
Say Mr Guder  
Some day soon may realize  
You spend your life just playing a game  
Where no ones wins but everyone stays the same

Please  
Play your game  
Stay the same
