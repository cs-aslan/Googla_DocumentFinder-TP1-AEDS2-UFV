You know tomorrow Ill be out of town  
Baby before the sun goes down  
Theres an agent and hes made a bet  
That Ill be sitting on a jumbo jet  
Baby Id like to stay here  
Baby Id like to play here  
But I made a deal  
And though it dont seem real  
Just another day  
Ill be three thousand miles away  
I got to pay my dues  
You know I sing the blues  
Got to do my thing  
All I do is sing rock and roll  
  
You know tomorrow Ill be on my way  
Flying through an other day  
Places turn into a dream  
I cant remember where Ive been  
Baby Id like to stop here  
Baby Id like to drop here  
But in a month or so  
Then I will have to go  
But it does no good  
Still its in my blood  
I got to pay my dues  
You know I sing the blues  
Got to do my thing  
All I do is sing rock and roll  
  
Man must do what a man must do  
No time to sit and wait  
One day hes gonna realize  
That it is too late  
  
You know tomorrow Ill be on my own  
Flying through an other zone  
Faces turn into a dream  
I cant remember who Ive seen  
Baby Id like to lay here  
Baby Id like to stay here  
But theres an other show  
And I just have to go  
Still keep coming through  
Dont know how Ill do  
I got to pay my dues  
You know I sing the blues  
Got to do my thing  
All I do is sing rock and roll
