All veils and misty  
Streets of blue  
Almond looks  
That chill divine  
Some silken moment  
Goes on forever  
And were leaving broken hearts behind  
  
Chorus  
Mystify  
Mystify me  
Mystify  
Mystify me  
  
I need perfection  
Some twisted selection  
That tangles me  
To keep me alive  
  
In all that exists  
None have your beauty  
I see your face  
I will survive  
  
Chorus  
  
Eternally wild with the power  
To make every moment come alive  
All those stars that shine upon you  
Will kiss you every night  
  
All veils and misty  
Streets of blue  
Almond looks  
That chill divine  
Some silken moment  
Goes on forever  
And were leaving  
Yeah were leaving broken hearts behind  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre eternally wild with the power  
To make every moment come alive  
All those stars that shine upon you  
And theyll kiss you every night  
  
Chorus  
  
Mystify  
Mystify me  
Mystify
