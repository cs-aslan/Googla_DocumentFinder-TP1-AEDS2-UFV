Drop on by when the sun goes down  
We can talk or just hang around  
Shoot the breeze tell me what you found  
On your search for some common ground  
  
Think of me when the moon is high  
Counting stars in the clear night sky  
Think of me when the moon is blue  
Sitting here just thinking of you  
  
Ive been here and Ive been there  
Its the same most everywhere  
Were all trying to get away  
Live to fight another day  
  
In my dreams I will follow you  
Any place that you want me to  
Tomorrow waits on the other side  
Patiently for the sun to rise  
Dont go now cant you stay a while  
Light my night with your loving smile  
Once you were gone but now your home  
I couldnt bear being all alone  
  
Ive been here and Ive been there  
Its the same most everywhere  
  
Ive been here and Ive been there  
Its the same most everywhere  
Were all trying to get away  
Live to fight another day 2x
