Standing in the valley of indecision  
Trying to make some sense out of  
A strange condition that we see  
Ive gotta find a way out cause  
Nobody would listen  
So I turn my back and now Im  
On my way  
  
Chorus  
Breaking out Im on my way  
Breaking out  
Breaking out Im on my way  
Breaking out  
  
I hear the things thy tell me but  
I dont believe it  
Gotta find a place where I can  
Breathe and just be me  
Gonna shake up the world  
Into a new position  
Now Im letting you know that  
I am on my way  
  
Chorus  
  
I cant stop this feeling deep  
Inside of me  
Now I finally see the reason  
Why  
In my heart I know its not  
Some fantasy  
When I lift my eyes up to the  
Sky  
  
Its a brand new day but it  
Seems like an old one  
People playing games but its  
No game I want to play  
They tried to hand me the dice  
But I know they were loaded  
So I turned my back and now  
Im on my way  
  
Chorus
