I buy the nicest things from a super market store  
Vitamin land and marzipan and I know just what theyre all for  
Ive organized my useless life in a way Ive never done before  
Even visit the dentist now  
  
But Ive got no time for silly chitter chatter  
Im on my way  
Cause while my bloods still warm and my mind doesnt matter  
Im hoping to stay  
Cause Ive got a thing about seeing my grandson grow old  
  
I just cant wait to see that city on the moon  
With air conditioned gardens thatll play your favorite tune  
Ill see my feet upon that street if its the last thing that Ill do  
Even sweep the roads to be there  
  
But Ive got no time for silly chitter chatter  
Im on my way  
Cause while my bloods still warm and my mind doesnt matter  
Im hoping to stay  
Cause Ive got a thing about seeing my grandson grow old
