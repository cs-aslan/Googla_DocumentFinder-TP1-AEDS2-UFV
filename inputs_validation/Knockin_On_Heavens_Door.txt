Mama take this badge off of me  
I cant use it anymore  
Its gettin dark too dark for me to see  
I feel like Im knockin on heavens door  
  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
  
Mama put my guns in the ground  
I cant shoot them anymore  
That long black cloud is comin down  
I feel like Im knockin on heavens door  
  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door  
Knock knock knockin on heavens door
