Midnight rush with a pen in my hand  
Dink in link in sandscript with a fan  
Remembering me before it began  
Sometimes I felt so def in a jam  
But the ones who loved me told me to stop  
Like home girl cant catch shit if it drops  
A superwoman chick you know that I am  
Some shit dont fly by me in a man  
  
Cause I do not accept any less  
Than someone just as real as fabulous  
  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Wont sign away my life to  
Someone whose got the flavor  
But dont have no follow through  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Wont sign no monkey papers  
I dont do funny business  
Not interested in fakers  
  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
  
Got something really shiny to start  
Want me to sign there on your range rover heart  
Ive heard it before  
Yeah the dinners were nice  
Till your diamond words melted into some ice  
  
You should been rapping to the beat of my song Mr California  
Paper gangsta and Im lookin for love not an  
Not an empty page full of stuff that means nothing but  
Youve been played  
  
Cause I do not accept any less  
Than someone just as real as fabulous  
  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Wont sign away my life to  
Someone whose got the flavor  
But dont have no follow through  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Wont sign no monkey papers  
I dont do funny business  
Not interested in fakers  
  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Wont sign away my life to  
Someone whose got the flavor  
But dont have no follow through  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Wont sign no monkey papers  
I dont do funny business  
Not interested in fakers  
  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Wont sign away my life to  
Someone whose got the flavor  
But dont have no follow through  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Wont sign no monkey papers  
I dont do funny business  
Not interested in fakers  
  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Dont want no paper gangsta  
Dont want no paper gangsta
