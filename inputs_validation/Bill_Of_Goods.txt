Try to convince you that you cant live without one  
Hey look around man everybodys got one  
So hurry up get your dollar bills together  
Theyre going to try and get you something even better  
  
Youre not so sure but you heard its great  
You get there first so you wont be late  
Everybody else will have to wait in line  
  
I overestimated you  
You knew that I probably would  
Were so predictable  
Weve been sold a bill of goods  
  
You want a choice want to make your own decisions  
You want to make up the rules and the provisions  
  
And everything is going to be so great  
When youre the latest keeper at the gate  
Everybody else will have to wait in line
