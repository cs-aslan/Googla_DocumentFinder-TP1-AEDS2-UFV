Im goin to California  
To live in the summer sun  
The streets are made of silver  
Im like a rabbit on the run  
Philidelphia freedom  
Well its not like you have heard no no no  
This city of brotherly love  
Is full of pain and hurt  
  
Im goin to California  
To find my pot of gold  
Corruption on every corner  
Hustlers sellin sweets  
Baby is home cryin  
While her mom is on the streets  
Everybodys dyin  
Have you heard the news today  
A woman in north Phili is mournin  
A bullet took another son away  
  
Im goin to California  
Im goin far far far away  
  
Goin to California yes  
To resurect my soul  
The sun is always shinin shinin  
Or atleast thats what Im told  
Im goin to California  
Theres a better life for me yes  
Goin to California  
Ill write and tell you what I see  
Im goin to California  
Somebody say a prayer for me
