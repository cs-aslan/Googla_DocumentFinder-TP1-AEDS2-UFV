You swear youve had enough youre ready to give up  
On that little lie they call love then out of the blue clear sky  
Fallin right into your hands like rain on the desert sand  
Its the last thing you had planned out of the blue clear sky  
  
Here she comes a walkin talkin true love  
Sayin I been lookin for you love  
Surprise your new love has arrived  
Out of the blue clear sky  
  
Aint love a funny thing one day youre givin up the dream  
And the next youre pickin out a ring out of the blue clear sky  
  
Here she comes a walkin talkin true love  
Sayin I been lookin for you love  
Surprise your new love has arrived  
Out of the blue clear sky
