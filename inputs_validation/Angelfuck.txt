Little Angelfuck  
Its a shame that luck is the only thing  
Did you like the fun  
Did you like the times that I promised you  
  
Open wounds on your brow  
Little angel in red  
She isnt loving you anymore  
  
Little Angelfuck  
I see you going down on a fireplug  
Little Angelfuck  
Size for everyone  
  
Let those bastards believe  
Dry your eyes and well leave  
She isnt loving you anymore  
  
Little Angelfuck  
I see you going down on a fireplug  
Oh little Angelfuck  
Size for everyone  
  
Let those bastards believe  
Dry your eyes and well leave  
She isnt loving you anymore
