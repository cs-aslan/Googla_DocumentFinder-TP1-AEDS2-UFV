Forever and ever  
my spirit will soar  
journey without end  
you mortal fools  
keep fighting your wars  
but you cannot win  
like the sky  
Im perpetual  
Ill never die  
dont come and tell me  
your life is so rough  
nothing for nothing  
no walls in this world  
will heed you enough  
Ill get what i want  
like the sky  
Im perpetual  
Ill never die  
your gods may come and go  
eons may pass  
but in the end i know  
I shall forever last  
never die
