Fetch down the fiddle rosin up the bow dont play me nothing on the radio  
Dont make me remember the Alamo Im feeling like a little bit of Cotton Eyed
Joe  
No raging Cajun crawfish stew fat batter coming in a Lumalamalu  
Boy howdy and howdy damn do something like fine setting eyes on you  
Let me come down I wont never go back up again oh hold me down  
Let me come home I wont never go away no more oh let me come down  
  
In a younger day back in Tennessee the muddy Mississippi used to call to me  
Float on a river and set yourself free  
Run from the farm and the family tree run from the runaway boy  
  
So Ive been all the places that I ever want to be Ive seen all the people
that I ever want to see  
Im sick and tired of being lonely and free Im ready today for whats
waiting on me  
Im gonna give up believing I was born to run stop acting like a man that
gets shot from a gun  
Im putting down roots I want to soak up sun and stay right here until my
days are done  
Let me back down I will never go up again Hold me down tie me on down  
Let me go home I will never go away no more oh let me come home oh let me
go down  
  
Indecipherable grunting
