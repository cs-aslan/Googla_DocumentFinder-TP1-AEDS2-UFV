I can tell by your face  
That youre looking to find a place  
To settle your mind  
And reveal who you are  
And you shouldnt be shy  
For Im not gonna try  
To hurt you or heal you or steal your star  
Open your eyes  
Get up off your chair  
Theres so much to do in the sunlight  
Give up your secrets  
Let down your hair  
And sit with me here by the firelight  
Why think all about  
Whos gonna win out  
Well make up our story as we go along  
Theres so little time  
For us to try to rhyme  
And so many highways to travel upon  
Open your eyes  
Get up off your chair  
Theres so much to do in the sunlight  
Give up your secrets and let down your hair  
And sit with me here by the firelight
