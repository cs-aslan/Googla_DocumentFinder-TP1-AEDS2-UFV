Another New York waltz at four am  
In the canyons lost at night  
The citys just a jail for me full of high rise prison walls  
And Im riding through this darkness  
cause I know theres life within  
And Im searching through the shadows  
Just to find that light again  
  
Keep driving keep driving  
Let the meter run  
Keep driving keep driving  
Oh the nights not really done  
  
Keep driving  
  
And Im hanging on a memory and I feel it in the air  
Im a prisoner of these lonely streets  
But I know Ill find you there  
And oh Lord you look so pretty  
But you can see it in my eyes  
And just before my tear will fall oh you smile and get inside  
It seems so real until the light turns green  
  
Dont wake me up dont ruin this dream dont take me from my scene  
  
Keep driving keep driving  
Keep driving keep driving  
I cant go home dont take me home I cant go home alone  
  
They dont tell you when the music stops  
Or how the movie ends  
Is it too late once the feelings gone  
To back it up and start it all again  
  
Oh Lord you look so pretty  
And you can see it in my eyes  
And just before that tear will fall oh you smile and get inside  
  
Keep driving keep driving driving  
  
I cant go home dont take me home I cant go home alone  
  
Keep driving let the meter run  
keep driving dont take me home  
  
Keep driving ooh the nights still young  
  
Keep driving I gotta find someone  
keep driving I gotta find someone  
Keep driving I gotta find someone  
keep driving I gotta find someone  
Keep driving ooh find someone  
keep driving I gotta find someone  
Keep driving find someone  
keep driving find someone  
Keep driving keep driving keep driving keep driving keep driving
