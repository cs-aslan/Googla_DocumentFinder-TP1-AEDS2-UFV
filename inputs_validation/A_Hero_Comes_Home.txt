Out of the mist of history  
Hell come again  
Sailing on ships across the sea  
To a wounded Nation  
  
Signs of a saviour  
Like fire on the water  
Its what we prayed for  
One of our own  
  
Just wait  
Though wide he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home  
He goes where no one has gone  
But always  
A hero comes home  
  
Deep in the heart of darkness sparks  
A dream of light  
Surrounded by hopelessness  
He finds the will to fight  
  
Theres no surrender  
Always remember  
It doesnt end here  
Were not alone  
  
Just wait  
Though wide he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home  
He goes where no one has gone  
But always  
A hero comes home  
  
And he will come back on the crimson tide  
Dead or alive  
And even though we know the bridge has burned  
He will return  
He will return  
  
Just wait  
Though wide he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home  
He knows of places unknown  
Always  
A hero comes home  
  
Someday theyll carve in stone  
The hero comes home  
  
He goes and comes back alone  
But always  
A hero comes home  
  
Just wait  
Though wide he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home
