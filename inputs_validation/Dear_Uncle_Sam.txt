Dear Uncle Sam I know youre a busy man  
And tonight I write to you through tears with a trembling hand  
My darling answered when he got that call from you  
You said you really need him but you dont need him like I do  
Dont misunderstand I know hes fighting for our land  
I really love my country but I also love my man  
He proudly wears the colors of the old red white and blue  
While I wear a heartache since he left me for you  
 trumpet   
Dear Uncle Sam I just got your telegram  
And I cant believe that this is me shaking like I am  
For it said Im sorry to inform you
