  
Oh here I sit with my first glass of whiskey  
Wondering where I went wrong  
How I wish she was still right here with me  
I long to hear all those old country songs  
  
Like old Hank Williams when hed sing about lonesome  
And Hag about misery and gin  
If the jukebox would play Patsys Crazy  
Then I could let this new heartache begin  
  
The band just quit and the lovers are leaving  
And the bartender said its closing time  
Oh I wonder if shes having trouble sleeping  
And if those songs keep on runnin through her mind  
  
Like Crazy Arms and A11  
The Lovers Blues were Together Again  
Why baby why must you and I Fall To Pieces  
Its time to let this new heartache begin  
Why baby why must you and I Fall To Pieces  
Its time to let this new heartache begin
