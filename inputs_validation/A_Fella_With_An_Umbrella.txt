Im just a fella a fella with an umbrella  
Looking for a girl who saved her love for a rainy day  
Im just a fella a fella with an umbrella  
Glad to see the skies of blue have turned into skies of gray  
Raindrops have brought us together  
And thats what I long to see  
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a break for me  
So Ill be the fella that fella with an umbrella  
If youll be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day  
Oh the raindrops have brought us together  
And thats what I long to see  
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a big break for me  
So Ill be the fella the kid with the small umbrella  
If youll be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day  
If you will be the girl the girl who saved her love for a rainy day
