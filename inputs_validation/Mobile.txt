Went back home again  
This sucks gotta pack up and leave again  
Say goodbye to all my friends  
Cant say when Ill be there again  
Its time now to turn around  
Turn my back on  
Everything turn my back on everything  
  
Chorus  
Everythings changing when I turn around all out of my control Im a mobile  
Everythings changing when I turn around all out of my control Im a mobile  
  
Start back at this life  
Stretch myself back into the vibe  
Im waking up to say Ive tried  
Instead of waking up to another TV GUIDE  
Its time now to turn around  
Turn and walk on this crazy ground oh oh oh  
  
Chorus  
Everythings changing when I turn around all out of my control Im a mobile  
Everythings changing out of what I know everywhere I go Im a mobile  
Im a mobile  
  
Hanging from the ceiling lifes a mobile spinning round  
With mixed feelings crazy and wild  
Sometimes I want to scream out loud  
  
Everythings changing  
Everywhere I go  
All out of my control  
Everythings changing  
Everywhere I go out of what I know  
  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
Chorus  
Everythings changing when I turn around all out of my control Im a mobile  
Everythings changing out of what I know everywhere I go Im a mobile  
Im a mobile
