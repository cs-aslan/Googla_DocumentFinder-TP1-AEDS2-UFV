Ill be home this Christmas  
This time for sure  
To have and hold you baby  
Hold you in my arms  
  
Ill be home this Christmas  
This time for sure  
Ill be there to comfort you  
Hold you for ever more  
  
Lovin you so tenderly  
Oh just you wait and see  
My heart will be for ever more  
Yours till eternity  
  
Ill be home this Christmas  
For sure this time  
Youre everything I dreaming of  
Ill be home this Christmas time  
  
Ill be home this Christmas  
This time for sure  
To have and hold you baby  
Forever this Christmas time  
  
Youre everything I dreaming of  
Ill be home this Christmas time  
Forever this Christmas time  
Ill be home this Christmas time
