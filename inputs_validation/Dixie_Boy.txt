I was raised in the shadows of an old cotton mill  
Back when believin was the style  
Small town heaven and a bigeyed boy  
Made sweet music for a while  
My daddy worked hard down at the factory  
Nights he went to GI school  
He didnt know nothin bout the silver spoon  
But he lived by the golden rule  
  
Summer nights he was gone me and mama stayed home  
Out on the front porch swing  
Wishin on the stars in the southern sky  
And sometimes we used to sing  
  
We were leaning leaning on  
The everlasting arms of love  
Livin all those simple joys  
This Dixie boy is made of  
  
Got my real education from the TV station  
And good ole boys down at the park  
The say Hey Willie and those rockabillies  
Made their way into my heart  
  
I remember the old folks sittin round talkin  
On laidback Sunday afternoons  
They said them young folks sure got a hard road  
Oh theyre growin up too soon  
  
Now I know they were right and as I sit here tonight  
Out on the front porch swing  
The stars are shinin in my young boys eyes  
Just like they did for me  
  
We are leaning leaning on  
The everlasting arms of love  
Livin all those simple joys  
This Dixie boy is made of  
  
We are leaning leaning on  
The everlasting arms of love  
Livin all those simple joys  
This Dixie boy is made of
