Lost On The River Dark Is The Night  
Just Like The Blind Praying For Site  
Drifting Alone Heart Filled With Fright  
Im lost On The River The River Of Life  
Once Dear I Thought I Knew The Way  
That Was Before Old Sad Yesterday  
Words That You Said Cut Like A Knife  
Im Lost On The River The River Of Life  
Out On This River Where Sorrows Free  
Thinking Of You How My Heart Pleads  
Tomorrow Youll Be Another Mans Wife  
Im Lost On The River The River Of Life
