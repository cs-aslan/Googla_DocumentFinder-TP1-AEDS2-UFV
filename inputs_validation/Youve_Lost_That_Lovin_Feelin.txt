You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips  
And theres no tenderness like before in your fingertips  
Youre trying hard not to show it baby  
But baby baby I know it  
  
Youve lost that lovin feelin  
Woah that lovin feelin  
Youve lost that lovin feelin  
Now its gone gone gone woah  
  
Now theres no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you  
And now youre starting to criticise everything I do  
It makes me just feel like crying baby  
Cause baby something beautifuls dyin  
  
You lost that lovin feelin  
Woah that lovin feelin  
Youve lost that lovin feelin  
Now its gone gone gone woah  
  
Baby baby Id get down on my knees for you  
If you would only love me like you used to do  
We had a love a love a love you dont find everyday  
So dont dont dont dont let it slip away  
  
Baby baby baby baby  
I beg you please please please please  
I need your love need your love  
I need your love need your love  
Just bring it on back bring it on back  
Just bring it on back bring it on back  
  
Bring back that lovin feelin  
Woah that lovin feelin  
Bring back that lovin feelin  
Now its gone gone gone woah  
  
Bring back that lovin feelin  
Woah that lovin feelin  
Bring back that lovin feelin  
Now its gone gone gone  
And I cant go on woah
