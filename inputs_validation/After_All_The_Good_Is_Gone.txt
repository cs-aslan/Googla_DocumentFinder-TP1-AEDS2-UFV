Today I got a letter from someone  
Just a friend we knew some time ago  
And as I read between the lines  
I began to realize  
  
He didnt know Id lost you  
A long long time ago  
Oh I just cant make it any longer  
Everything I do is always wrong  
  
Im just living a lie  
And theres no use in trying  
To keep hanging on  
After all the good is gone  
  
Lord I wish that I could die  
And theres no use in trying  
To keep hanging on  
After all the good is gone
