Pharrell  
we do this in our sleep niggaz  
Yessir  
  
Snoop  
U eva been in love b4  
Let me holla at u mann  
U know its hard for a playa to admit that sumtimes  
But Im a spit that sumtimes  
U know wat Im sayin  
Ay p give it to em one time nephew  
  
Pharrell nd Charlie  
Theres sumthin bout this girl  
From around my way  
Ever try to hold back ur feelings  
But it just wouldnt stay  
But when I finally found the words to say  
I wanted to run away  
Simply run away  
  
Pharrell  
U can try to run and hide  
It wont make a difference  
U can lie to urself  
Of the reason  
Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention  
That ur in love with the girl  
  
Yessir thats her  
But it wasnt like that back wen I met her  
The lavish life from all the do spun  
Before the RR had the hitchhike thumb  
Her friends didnt like niggaz like us but i  
Arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed  
Spiderweb sex musta got caught up  
But theres more to it  
I remember once  
Sayin lets shit on the peons  
Lets go ta vegas nd watch celine dion  
Make em say wat we on  
U say no like u was doin it for eons  
Fuck it Ill just hum and let the watch give off the neons  
Wen it rains it pours  
I laughs to myself wen I change the score  
U said my sex was a lot but my brain gave u more  
And sumn bout how ya ex was a toy  
I guess he played games  
Theres only diamond dice here  
Not tryin ta justify  
But wen ya shut ya eye u can touch the sky  
U in trouble ma  
And u should pray about speed  
But if this bout u  
Wat that say about me

Snoop  
See Im a crip in dark blue chucks  
And I does wat I does  
Yea I might say cuz  
Its really weird cuz a nigga got love  
Snoop Doggs a crip and the girl was a blood what  
She told me that her babydaddy was a thug  
Now it is wat it is and it was how it was  
Im hollin lil mama like wat  
Money mo stacked tryin ta get my gs back  
All these memories breed seeds of a rhythm rhyme pleaser  
Laid back while we sippin on a breeza  
Fresh 4pack sittin in the freeza  
Aint that kadeeja I heard she was a Skeeza  
She used ta hit them licks wit the Beezas  
Wen I seen her wit the homies I was like JESUS  
Its been a lil min since I seen her  
Hope her man dont run up cuz ill have to pull the neena
