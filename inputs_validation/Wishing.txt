Standing outside your door  
I look crazy to the world  
I have been to this place before  
The right guy for the wrong girl  
  
I wish that I could wake up from a dream that I just dont wanna believe  
Down sitting here waiting for you  
And I know you are walking away from me  
I dont wanna say the words that everyone seems to know  
I put you in that room with me  
Wipe away where I go  
  
I wish I could wake up from a dream that I just dont wanna believe  
That I gave a beautiful freak like you power and control all over me  
  
Please dont leave me  
Please dont go  
I dont wanna be alone  
  
Wishing dont count for much  
When that thing you want is gone  
I refuse to believe in luck  
Now when it comes to my luck  
  
I wish I could wake up from a dream that I just dont wanna believe  
That all the bad things Ive done in my life are coming back to torture me  
  
Please dont leave me  
Baby please dont go  
I dont wanna be alone  
Please dont leave me  
Baby please dont go  
I dont know how to be alone  
  
One two three  
  
You walked into my life like you walked into a crowd  
Obsessed on how you obsessed on me  
I wish that I could see what you saw in me  
All the things you said you liked so much  
And other things you say you hate  
Yeah and now all I wanna do is start over again  
And all I wanna do is try to make you wanna stay  
  
Im sorry to sound so lame  
But you left it way too late  
Youre telling what I need to say  
That will make you wanna stay  
  
Please dont leave me  
Please dont go please dont go  
Please dont tell me that I stand up for you to go  
Please dont leave me  
Please dont go please dont go  
Please dont tell me that its tearing for you to go  
  
I dont know how to be alone  
I dont know how to be alone  
I dont know how to be alone  
  
Ooh please dont be cruel  
Please dont do to me the horrible things that I did to you
