Hey  
Just when you think you are the shit  
Well you look down and your fly is unzipped  
Thats when you take a moment to say  
Well sometimes Im so totally unhip  
  
Just when the great ones inspire you  
To throw caution to the wind  
Thats when the mirror mirror on the wall says  
Babe you better throw your towel in  
  
Chorus  
All that I dont know  
Paralyzes me  
But somehow I keep going on  
Just settling for this mediocrity  
And I wonder if God is trying to make a fool out of me  
Repeat  
  
There are legends who die  
And Ive never even heard their songs  
And there are heroes of a generation  
Whose poetry is not on my shelf  
And my soliloquies would make Shakespeare  
Turn over in his grave  
And voyagers would forbid me  
To join in their crusade  
  
Chorus  
  
I wish I could fight against Ali and win  
I wish I could write with Joni Mitchells pen  
Sail the Atlantic on a paddle boat  
I wish I could smile like Bobby de Niro  
I wish that the lotto was the number of my telephone  
I wish I could sing a duet with Bono  
Cause I dont want to sound like  
Anyone else you know  
  
I just want to take you under my spell  
Excuse me for saying  
What I know down deep is my sin  
But maybe Ill fool everybody into thinking  
I know just what I am doing  
  
Chorus
