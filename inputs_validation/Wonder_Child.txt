This child he means the world to me  
There is no more enchanted  
A child can take this place of ruin  
And magically enhance it  
I see him in a golden room  
With the book of life before him  
Strange instruments upon his charts  
And the crystal glow inside him  
Hes your Wonder Child  
And my dreams come true  
Youve searched all your life  
I see him now flying over the universe  
This child will build a violin  
One will follow the travelers love  
Another will the bow apply  
To reach the one above  
I see her in a golden room  
With the moon and stars above her  
Her simple smile is Heavens gate  
Shes your Wonder Child  
And my dreams come true  
Youve searched all your life  
I see her now flying over the universe  
Your Wonder Child  
And my dreams come true  
Youve searched all your life  
I see them now flying over the universe
