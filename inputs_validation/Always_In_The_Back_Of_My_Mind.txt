Ooh youre always in the back of my mind ooh  
Nothing ever changes oh I wish to God it did  
Just another drink and youll be gone  
Oh its two am raining again  
I saw you making faces in the river  
Only me down by the quay  
Just a sad reflection that I give you  
I thought time would burn it  
Burn it down to the ground  
Just another breeze and youll be strong  
Oh Im driving home all on my own  
Just a passenger in all that we lost  
Satisfy oh Lord dont deny  
I see your face in the everything thats near cause  
Ooh you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh I have all the memories the winter of eightytwo  
When down upon the ice you saw me melt  
Oh its two am raining again  
I saw you making faces in the river  
Only me down by the quay  
Just a sad reflection that I give you  
Ooh you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh washed up on the rocks again  
Oh dont you know that its so damn hot  
And the things you do  
I wont ever learn ooh I wont ever learn  
Oh washed up on the rocks again  
Oh dont you know that its so damn hot  
And the things you do  
I wont ever learn I wont ever learn  
Ooh I wont ever learn I wont ever learn  
Ooh you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh you were always in the back of my mind  
In the back of mind  
Youre in the back of mind  
In the back of mind
