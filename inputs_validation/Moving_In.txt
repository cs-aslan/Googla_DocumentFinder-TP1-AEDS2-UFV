Im thinking bout moving in  
Commit myself to you forget where Ive been  
Im thinking thinking bout moving in  
Im thinking bout making my stand  
And I know I could do it  
If you give me your hand  
Im thinking bout making my stand  
Making my stand  
You changed my world  
And you stood in my doorway  
You changed my life  
When you stepped into my mind  
Used to think that there was no future before me  
Now you say that I can leave my past behind  
Now you say that I can leave my past behind  
Behind  
Dont understand why you do what you do  
You keep giving your love  
We give nothing to you  
You keep giving your love  
We give nothing to you  
Used to think that there was no future before me  
Now you say that I can leave my past behind  
Now you say that I can leave my past behind  
Behind  
Dont understand why you do what you do  
You keep giving your love  
We give nothing to you  
You keep giving your love  
We give nothing to you  
  
Here I am thinking bout moving in  
Making my stand  
Here I am thinking bout moving in  
Making my stand
