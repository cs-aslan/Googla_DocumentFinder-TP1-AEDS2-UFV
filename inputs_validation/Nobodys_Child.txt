Im nobodys child Im nobodys child Im like a flower just growing wild  
Theres no mommys kisses and no daddys smiles  
Nobody wants me Im nobodys child  
I was slowly passin an orphans home one day  
  
And stop there for a moment just to watch the children play  
Alone a boy was standin and when I asked him why  
He turned his eyes that couldnt see and he began to cry  
People come for children and take them for their own  
  
But they all seem to pass me by and leave me all alone  
I know theyd like to take me but when they see that Im blind  
They always take some other child and Im left behind  
Im nobodys child  
  
No mothers arms to hold me or soothe me when I cry  
Sometimes it gets so lonely here I wish I could die  
I walk the streets of heaven where all the blinds can see  
And just like for the other kids thered be a home for me  
No mommys kisses and no daddys smiles nobody wants me Im nobodys child
