Something in me dark and sticky  
All the time its getting strong  
No way of dealing with this feeling  
I cant go on like this too long  
  
Repeat x2  
This time youve gone too far  
This time youve gone too far  
This time youve gone too far  
I told you I told you I told you I told you  
  
Dont talk back just drive the car  
Shut your mouth I know what you are  
Dont say nothing keep your hands on the wheel  
Dont turn around this is for real  
  
Digging in the dirt  
Stay with me I need support  
Im digging in the dirt  
Find the places I got hurt  
Open up the places I got hurt  
  
The more I look the more I find  
As I close on in I get so blind  
I feel it in my head I feel it in my toes  
I feel it in my sex thats the place it goes  
  
Repeat x2  
This time youve gone too far  
This time youve gone too far  
This time youve gone too far  
I told you I told you I told you I told you  
  
Dont talk back just drive the car  
Shut your mouth I know what you are  
Dont say nothing keep your hands on the wheel  
Dont turn around this is for real  
  
Digging in the dirt  
Stay with me I need support  
Im digging in the dirt  
Find the places I got hurt  
Open up the places I got hurt  
  
Digging in the dirt  
Stay with me I need support  
Im digging in the dirt  
Find the places I got hurt  
Open up the places I got hurt  
I got hurt  
  
Digging in the dirt to find the places we got hurt  
Digging in the dirt to find the places we got hurt  
Digging in the dirt to find the places we got hurt  
Digging in the dirt to find the places we got hurt
