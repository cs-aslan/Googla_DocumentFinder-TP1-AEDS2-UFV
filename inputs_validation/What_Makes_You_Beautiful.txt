Youre insecure  
Dont know what for  
Youre turning heads when you walk through the door  
Dont need makeup to cover up  
Being the way that you are is enough  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it  
Everyone else but you  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed  
But when you smile at the ground it aint hard to tell  
You dont know oh oh  
You dont know youre beautiful  
If only you saw what I can see  
Youll understand why I want you so desperately  
Right now Im looking at you and I cant believe  
You dont know oh oh  
You dont know youre beautiful oh oh  
Thats what makes you beautiful  
  
So come on you got it wrong  
To prove Im right I put it in a song  
I dont know why youre being shy  
And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it  
Everyone else but you  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed  
But when you smile at the ground it aint hard to tell  
You dont know oh oh  
You dont know youre beautiful  
If only you saw what I can see  
Youll understand why I want you so desperately  
Right now Im looking at you and I cant believe  
You dont know oh oh  
You dont know youre beautiful oh oh  
Thats what makes you beautiful  
  
Na na na na na na na  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed  
But when you smile at the ground it aint hard to tell  
You dont know oh oh  
You dont know youre beautiful  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed  
But when you smile at the ground it aint hard to tell  
You dont know oh oh  
You dont know youre beautiful  
If only you saw what I can see  
Youll understand why I want you so desperately  
Right now Im looking at you and I cant believe  
You dont know oh oh  
You dont know youre beautiful oh oh  
You dont know youre beautiful oh oh  
Thats what makes you beautiful
