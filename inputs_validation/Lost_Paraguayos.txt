Darling I hate to tell you but I think Im catching a cold  
Put another chair on the fire bring the bottle over here  
I feel Im getting old  
I like your laugh and a hot romance  
And your ornry sense of humor  
But if it rains again like it did today  
Im gonna have to leave a little bit sooner  
  
Got to get me some South America sun  
  
Honey dont even ask me if you can come along  
Down at the border you need to be older  
And you sure dont look like my daughter  
Your ridiculous age start a state outrage  
And Ill end up in a Mexican jail  
Darling please dont cry you know I wouldnt tell you no lie  
  
Look over there  
Oh my God dont look now  
But it appears to be raining again  
Get upstairs pack my book of prayers  
Honey hurry Im catching pneumonia  
I gotta move while Im in the mood  
Or Ill disappear into that wall  
Darling please dont curse  
It really couldnt be any worse  
Say Im a sun fanatic but its dark in your attic  
And your cat sleeps on my head  
  
I know Im not a football star  
But I want to little better than that  
So Im much obliged for the pure white ride  
And a cup of tea every morning  
Ill say goodbye look your man in the eye  
You know I wouldnt tell you no lie  
  
So after all Ill see you in the fall  
On a brand new day brand new way  
Goodbye honey goodbye honey  
Goodbye honey it aint funny  
Goodbye honey I know it aint funny
