I cant read and I cant write down  
I dont know a book from countdown  
I dont care which shadow gets me  
All Ive got is someones face  
Money goes to money heaven  
Bodies go to body hell  
I just cough and catch the chase  
Switch the channel watch the police car  
I cant read shit anymore  
I just sit back and ignore  
Cause I just cant get it right cant get it right  
I cant read shit I cant read shit  
When you see a famous smile  
No matter where you run your mile  
To be right in that photograph  
Andy wheres my fifteen minutes fifteen yeah  
I cant read shit anymore  
I just cant read shit anymore  
No matter I just cant get it right  
I cant read shit I cant read shit no no
