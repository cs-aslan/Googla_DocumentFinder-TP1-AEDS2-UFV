For all those times you stood by me  
For all the truth that you made me see  
For all the joy you brought to my life  
For all the wrong that you made right  
For every dream you made come true  
For all the love I found in you  
  
Ill be forever thankful baby  
Youre the one who held me up  
Never let me fall youre the one  
Who saw me through through it all  
  
You were my strength when I was weak  
You were my voice when I couldnt speak  
You were my eyes when I couldnt see  
You saw the best there was in me  
  
Lifted me up when I couldnt reach  
You gave me faith cause you believed  
Im everything I am  
Because you loved me  
  
You gave me wings and made me fly  
You touched my hand I could touch the sky  
I lost my faith you gave it back to me  
You said no star was out of reach  
You stood by me and I stood tall  
I had your love I had it all  
  
Im grateful for each day you gave me  
Maybe I dont know that much  
But I know this much is true  
I was blessed because I was loved by you  
  
You were my strength when I was weak  
You were my voice when I couldnt speak  
You were my eyes when I couldnt see  
You saw the best there was in me  
  
Lifted me up when I couldnt reach  
You gave me faith cause you believed  
Im everything I am  
Because you loved me  
  
You were always there for me the tender wind that carried me  
The light in the dark shining your love into my life  
Youve been my inspiration through the lies you were the truth  
My world is a better place because of you  
  
You were my strength when I was weak  
You were my voice when I couldnt speak  
You were my eyes when I couldnt see  
You saw the best there was in me  
  
Lifted me up when I couldnt reach  
You gave me faith cause you believed  
Im everything I am  
Because you loved me  
  
You were my strength when I was weak  
You were my voice when I couldnt speak  
You were my eyes when I couldnt see  
You saw the best there was in me  
  
Lifted me up when I couldnt reach  
You gave me faith cause you believed  
Im everything I am  
Because you loved me  
Im everything I am  
Because you loved me
