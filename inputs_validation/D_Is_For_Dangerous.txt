A is for all I want  
B is for battling  
C is for cant you stay longer  
Cause I want you so maddeningly  
E is for no escape  
Cause I dont wanna leave you  
F is for falling too fast  
With no parachute oh  
  
And whos gonna save me now oh  
  
Chorus  
Youve taken me under  
Youve stolen my thunder  
And I think Im all out of fire  
Want you to win  
All that I ever was  
Is burning in this lust  
Your love is a weapon  
And its turning me to dust  
D is for dangerous 2x  
  
G for get out of here  
Its really too much  
H is for how do I leave  
When Im addicted to your love  
I is for insane  
It smells like danger  
J is for jump off the ship  
Or the storm will take you  
  
And whos gonna save me now oh  
  
Chorus  
Youve taken me under  
Youve stolen my thunder  
And I think Im all out of fire  
Want you to win  
All that I ever was  
Is burning in this lust  
Your love is a weapon  
And its turning me to dust  
D is for dangerous 4x  
  
K is for killing me  
L is for I cant leave  
Oh cause Ill never make it  
If Im not living on the edge  
And for the rest  
Lets just forget  
Cause I never want out of this  
  
Repeat Chorus
