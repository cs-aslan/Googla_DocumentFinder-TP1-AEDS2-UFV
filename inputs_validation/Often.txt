I usually love sleeping all alone  
This time around bring your friend with you  
But we aint really going to sleep at all  
You aint gonna catch me with them sneak pictures  
In my city Im a young god  
That pussy kill be so vicious  
My god why she in my pockets  
Get me redder than the devil til I go nauseous  
  
Hook  
Ask me if I do this every day I said Often  
Ask how many times she rode the wave Not so often  
Bitches down to do it either way often  
Baby I can make that pussy rain often  
Often often girl I do this often  
Make that pussy poppin do it how I want it  
Often often girl I do this often  
Make that pussy poppin do it how I want it  
Often  
  
Infatuated by the fame status  
She wanna ride inside the GClass Grain matted  
I come around she leave that nigga like he aint matter  
That girl been drinkin all day need to change bladder  
Shes just happy that the crews back in town  
Shes bout to go downtown for a whole hour  
If I had her you can have her man it dont matter  
Im never sour Im just smokin somethin much louder  
  
Ask me if I do this every day I said Often  
Ask how many times she rode the wave Not so often  
Bitches down to do it either way often  
Baby I can make that pussy rain often  
Often often girl I do this often  
Make that pussy poppin do it how I want it  
Often often girl I do this often  
Make that pussy poppin do it how I want it

Oooh the suns risin up  
The nights almost up  
The nights almost done  
But I see your eyes  
You wanna go again  
Girl Ill go again  
Girl Ill go again  
  
Ask me if I do this every day I said Often  
Ask how many times she rode the wave Not so often  
Bitches down to do it either way often  
Baby I can make that pussy rain often  
Often often girl I do this often  
Make that pussy poppin do it how I want it  
Often often girl I do this often  
Make that pussy poppin do it how I want it
