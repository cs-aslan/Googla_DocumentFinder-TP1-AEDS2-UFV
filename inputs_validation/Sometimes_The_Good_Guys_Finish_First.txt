SyouseeseeESS  
Thats the way we spell success  
Will we get it the answers yes  
SyouseeseeESS  
Small town boy so clean he squeaks  
Dressed and polished for the big time dreams  
Got a letter from his ma and a boyish grin  
Close his eyes one minute and itll lead him to the win Yeah  
You know theres nothin like heaven that wont get you back  
To you get your ass in gear and your mind on track  
When wheels start turnin things start to fall into place  
Youll be surprised what you can do and some talents all it takes  
Yeah  
Chorus  
Sometimes The Good Guys Finish First  
Sometimes your best is all it takes  
You know that Sometimes The Good Guys Finish First  
Sometimes The Good Guys Finish First  
Back on logic turn your head around  
Use the front door and avoid the crowds  
Theyll be tryin to tell you that it cant be done  
Cause the big boys on their own gave us half the fun hey hey  
Repeat Chorus Twice  
The Good Guys the Good Guys the Good Guys Finish First  
Chorus  
Sometimes The Good Guys Finish First  
Walkin a straight line in reverse  
You know that Sometimes The Good Guys Finish First  
Sometimes The Good Guys Finish First  
Chorus
