Go west young man the signs all seem to say theres San Diego Frisco or LA  
Leave that cold cold woman far behind warm yourself in that California
sunshine  
Go west young man become a movie star or anything except the fool you are  
Expose the lonely corners of your mind to a little dad of that California
sunshine  
  
I need a change Ive headed up to here shes just playing game thats very
clear  
But her play mate will soon be hard to find cause Ill be in that California
sunshine  
  
They say those California girls are fine they know how to really walk your
mind  
Well one of you get ready cause youre mine Im headin for that California
sunshine  
I need a change Ive headed  
  
Baby Ill be in that California sunshine
