Oh Lord  
  
Ride over backwards  
Ride over backwards  
Ride over backwards  
Ride over backwards  
  
I was just a little girl  
Amaking my own way  
16 years or more I had  
Nothing left to say  
  
I raised myself up almost  
Lived on poboys too  
New Orleans aint a place to live  
If you never been to school  
  
And I said  
Ride over backwards  
Slide over backwards  
Ride over backwards  
Let me ride  
  
People gotta tell you  
Slide over backwards  
Slide over backwards  
Ride over backwards  
Let me ride  
  
Daddy was a working man  
He worked since he was 5  
He dropped his wings on my train one day  
And never learned to fly  
  
I wonder what it takes to be  
Someone who knows why  
The earth aint round  
Unless you can  
Teach yourself to fly  
  
And I said  
Ride over backwards  
Slide over backwards  
Slide over backwards  
Let me ride  
  
People gotta tell you  
Slide over backwards  
Slide over backwards  
Sometimes you gotta be free  
Slide over backwards  
Let me ride  
  
Some days in a lifetime you gotta be strong  
Some days in lifetime you gotta be brave  
Dig on your knees sometimes  
Sometimes you even gotta pray  
  
Lord what it is what it is  
  
Sometimes I feel like Im going down going down  
Going down for the very last time  
Oh dont know what it is dont know what it is  
Sometimes I feel like going down  
  
Deep in my heart I pray  
Ride over backwards
