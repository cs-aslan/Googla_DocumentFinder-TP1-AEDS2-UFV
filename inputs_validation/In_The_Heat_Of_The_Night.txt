In the heat of the night when you know it aint right  
But you do what you want to do  
You do what you feel no one can feel like you  
Out in the summertime city aint it a pity  
Theres so much to tie you down  
Youre leaving tonight to somewhere you cant be found  
While down at the edge of town  
At a pool hall where they all hang around  
You hear them talkin about the girls they knew  
And talk about what theyre gonna do  
Then you ask yourself is this where you belong  
Is it right or is it wrong  
Does it matter whats right in the heat of the night  
  
Out in the streets tonight under the neon lights  
Youre searchin for something new  
But nothin is real and no one can feel like you  
They say that eagles fly in this red hot sky  
But were they just passin through  
Or did they look down and see what you found was true  
  
But still in the back of your mind  
Youve got somethin to believe in but theres so much to find  
As the bright lights dim and the night closes in  
You thought everything is ending but its yet to begin  
And you aint seen nothing yet  
But what you see youll never forget and youll say  
  
Why oh why  
Did it take you so long to want something more  
Why oh why  
Did you never get off on this before  
Why oh why  
Well here it is the love youve been waitin for  
Why oh why  
Standin in front of you like an open door  
  
And then you ask yourself is this where you belong  
Is it right or is it wrong  
Does it matter whats right in the heat of the night  
  
In the heat of the night when you know it aint right  
But you do what you want to do  
You do what you feel cause no one can feel like you
