Its one am  
And hes still not in  
You wonder when enoughs enough  
Cause this aint new  
But what do you do  
When you cant help who you love  
  
So you drive to town  
And you ask around  
Scared of what youre thinking of  
Has he been hurt  
Has be been with her  
Cause you cant help who you love  
  
You hear the voices calling  
As you walk among the fallen and betrayed  
And you know its gonna break you  
Still you follow where it takes you anyway  
Cause you aint got no say  
Its a long ride home  
When youre all alone  
Cause you cant help who you love  
  
You hear the voices calling  
As you walk among the fallen and betrayed  
And you know its gonna break you  
Still you follow where it takes you anyway  
Cause you aint got no say  
You should leave  
But I believe  
You cant help who you love  
  
You cant help who you love
