Well take the chance we will again  
Its our dream and you will see well go hand in hand  
  
I know were here but I feel were not alone  
Millions of people are waiting in their homes  
See all the winners and losers theyre always in our hearts  
Oh everybodys waiting waiting for a start  
  
Well take the chance well win again  
I know my dream it will come true  
Well take the chance dont lose the game  
Its a game for me and you  
Well take the chance well win again  
I know were going hand in hand  
Well take the chance and we are friends  
For a game that never ends  
  
I know were high and were low and just between  
Were feeling the fire of hearts like a dream  
Were living in deep emotion were fighting with our hearts  
Oh everybodys waiting waiting for a start
