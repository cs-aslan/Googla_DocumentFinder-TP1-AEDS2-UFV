Verse 1  
  
Sitting by myself in my cell of loneliness  
Im caught up in a worldwind  
Like a little girl in a doggie pin  
Scratch a calender on the wall just counting down the days  
That Id head on back that way Sayin  
  
Chorus  
  
All I wanna doall I wanna do  
Make it home to you  
Get it on with you  
All I wanna doall I wanna do  
Make it home to you  
Get it on with you  
  
Verse 2  
  
Now sometimes we can be so selfish baby  
In our own little world  
And sometimes we have to go blind to see  
That its both of our worlds  
And I refuse to be somewhere in a lounge  
With my drunk head hangin down Sayin All  
  
Chorus  
  
All I wanna dooooooooh  
Make it home to you  
Get it on with you  
All I wanna dois make it home babe  
Make it home to you  
Get it on with you
