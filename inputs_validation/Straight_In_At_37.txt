Why dont you sing I need you baby  
Cause it rhymes with crazy and it rhymes with maybe  
It rhymes with lady and much much more  
And it doesnt rhyme with the f word  
  
Well Simon le Bon stayed round my house before  
And he was sick on the plants and he was sick on the floor  
And he wouldnt go home until hed sung his song  
With a backing harmony from Paul Young  
  
Shell we dance again  
In our special way  
With our trousers round  
our knees  
  
Why dont your video have dancing girls  
With hips that curve and lips that curl  
Legs are where the heartbeat starts  
Its low in neckline and high in charts  
  
But its the partially clothed for the partially sighted  
Behind over matter keeps the crowds delighted  
We want Rambo in a rara skirt  
Nastassia Kinski in a Brazilian shirt
