Wake up man its late but not too late  
Its six oclock like everyday  
  
Get your things run and forget the rain  
Take power pills dont miss your train  
  
And youd like to be another  
A different guy and a better lover  
For your love for your life check your way  
And you like the rock n roller  
A different life and whiskey Cola  
But dont be low keep your own style  
And catch your train  
  
Dont be lazy man and work off your ass  
Hes the boss youve gotta do what he says  
  
Catch your train run and forget those ways  
Keep it cool its not too late  
  
And youd like to be another  
A different guy and a better lover  
For your love for your life check your way  
And you like the rock n roller  
A different life and whiskey Cola  
But dont be low keep your own style  
And catch your train
