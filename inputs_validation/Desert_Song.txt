This is my prayer in the desert  
And all thats within me feels dry  
This is my prayer in the hunger in me  
My God is a God who provides  
  
And this is my prayer in the fire  
In weakness or trial or pain  
There is a faith proved  
Of more worth than gold  
So refine me Lord through the flames  
  
Chorus  
And I will bring praise  
I will bring praise  
No weapon forged against me shall remain  
  
I will rejoice  
I will declare  
God is my victory and He is here  
  
And this is my prayer in the battle  
And triumph is still on its way  
I am a conqueror and coheir with Christ  
So firm on His promise Ill stand  
  
All of my life  
In every season  
You are still God  
I have a reason to sing  
I have a reason to worship  
  
This is my prayer in the harvest  
When favor and providence flow  
I know Im filled to be emptied again  
The seed Ive received I will sow
