I have got you under my skin  
Ive got you deep in the heart of me  
  
So deep in my heart  
Youre nearly a part of me  
Ive got you under my skin  
  
I have tried so not to give in  
I have said to myself this affair  
Never gonna go somewhere  
  
But why should I try to resist  
When baby I know so well  
That Ive got you under my skin  
  
I would sacrifice anything  
Come what might  
For the sake of holding you near  
In spite of a warning voice  
That comes in the night  
It repeats and it shouts in my ear  
  
Dont you know blueeyes  
You never can win  
Use your mentality  
Wake up to reality  
  
But each time I do  
Just the thought of you  
Makes me stop before I begin  
  
Cause Ive got you under my skin  
Id sacrifice anything  
Come what might  
For the sake of having you near  
In spite of a warning voice  
That comes in the night  
It repeats and it shouts in my ear  
  
Dont you know you old fool  
You never can win  
Use your mentality  
Wake up to reality  
  
But each time that I do  
Just the thought of you  
Makes me stop before I begin  
  
Cause Ive got you under my skin  
And I love you when youre under my skin
