BG  
Niggas be hating cause BG got it  
On top of the line only got it but I ride it  
From the hummer to the rover to the project  
B and C Lex truck nothing in my click aint hey  
Everybody here was fucked when they heard bout the deal  
Cash money hot boyz sound for thirty mill  
Already was straight but we living larger  
Already was balling but now we balling harder  
Bet you bitches cant stay clean  
Cause my wrist stay flossed off  
Niggas hate me cause all day Im flossed off  
Ghetto lady in my dog bay Mercedes  
Niggas find out they got whole got fuck it then they cave me  
Thats how it go it aint my fault  
I got mega cheese  
Walk that walk talk that talk

Papers chase so footy get my grind on  
I look through it cause I made that song gets it shine on  
  
Chorus  
My click be sizziling hot steaming  
Bouncing rules diamonds hot beaming  
Me and my click be sizziling hot steaming  
Stepping throught niggas diamond hot beaming  
Me and my click be sizziling hot beaming  
Rep out niggas diamonds hot beaming  
  
Lil Wayne  
What what what  
Ima flosser baby  
Baller baby  
A fifteen year old shot caller baby  
Im raised in the hood  
In a all black call  
Down Mercedes cool  
Got your wife at my house and she naked too  
And all my niggas all around us saying shake it boo  
Go ahead do what you do  
Its weezing darling off that heezing darling  
I surrounded by the ice it got me freezing darling  
Its plain and simple  
My change and its natural  
Now Wayne will pimp yall  
Got game from beatrall  
Trying to see six numbers  
At the Grammy awards with six hummers  
Me the Grammy award with six womans  
Nigga stop at the gas station for six rubbers  
Put it together  
This is the night for you to get under the cheddar  
Dont try to end it or you wouldnt get better  
  
Chorus  
  
Lil Wayne  
Here I come star rapper  
I get the fast money  
Short cute hot boy  
And rap for cash money  
Stand out the roof of my car and flash honeys  
Take your girl to the mall and spend a gee like its nothing  
If you lay on the floor  
Open up the spot  
Take off her draws  
Let me see the cot  
Dont stop  
Lil Weez lil weez and nothing nice  
But yet to my Jesus Christ  
Nothing but ice  
When they see me at night  
Behind Cristal see night  
Snatch your wife  
Run up in there with the K why  
Its all mine  
Ever since I was born Wayne  
Nigga get out of line I get dirty like John Wayne  
I bought something to floss it  
Whatever come with it  
Now dont shoot us unless they have a drum with it  
At first they werent with it  
But then I was choking  
I got em all paying attention like they owe it  
What  
  
Chorus
