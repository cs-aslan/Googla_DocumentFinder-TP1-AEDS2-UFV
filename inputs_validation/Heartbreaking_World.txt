The saddest thing Ive ever seen  
Was a starving face on my TV screen  
The desperate face that I saw  
Had my disbelief hanging from my jaw  
Our harvest could be shared around  
Instead its buried in the ground  
The saddest thing Ive ever seen  
Was a football fan dying for his team  
The toughest thing I have ever known  
Was a soldier boy who never made it home  
Its fiction live before our eyes  
It leaves me cold and my heart cries  
  
The greatest thing Ive ever seen  
Was a newborn child looking up at me  
The greatest sound Ive ever heard  
Was a babys cry in this wicked world  
The innocence of that cry  
Leaves me cold and my heart cries  
  
Its a heartbreaking world if you want it to be  
Its a heartbreaking world if you want it to be  
Its a heartbreaking world if you want it to be  
And youre the one that breaks it for me
