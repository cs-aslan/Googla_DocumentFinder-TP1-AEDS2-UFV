Would you like to swing on a star  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a mule  
  
A mule is an animal with long funny ears  
He kicks up at anything he hears  
His back is brawny and his brain is weak  
Hes just plain stupid with a stubborn streak  
And by the way if you hate to go to school  
You may grow up to be a mule  
  
Or would you like to swing on a star  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a pig  
  
A pig is an animal with dirt on his face  
His shoes are a terrible disgrace  
Hes got no manners when he eats his food  
Hes fat and lazy and extremely rude  
But if you dont care a feather or a fig  
You may grow up to be a pig  
  
Instrumentalfirst 3 lines of chorus  
Or would you rather be a fish  
  
A fish wont do anything but swim in a brook  
He cant write his name or read a book  
To fool all the people is his only thought  
Though hes slippery he still gets caught  
But then if that sort of life is what you wish  
You may grow up to be a fish  
  
And all the monkeys arent in a zoo  
Every day you meet quite a few  
So you see its all up to you  
You can be better than you are  
  
You could be swingin on a star
