If this is a ghetto Im in it with you  
If its just a prison Im locked in it too  
I tried to leave you but after all that we had said  
I went to pieces when I should have shouted and screamed  
instead  
So sorry I said  
Your powers of persuasion those quizzical eyes  
Have tired and tied me with innocent guile  
I would have walked out and after all the tears we shed  
I should have stalked out gone and painted the town bright  
red  
But instead  
So sorry I said  
How tough it gets dont talk to me about it  
To pay off your debts I worked on overtime  
And you say you never believed in luck  
If you need a reason consider me mad  
An old retainer loyal and sad  
I bought my freedom but after all that we had shared  
I couldnt leave you think of the skins Id have to shed  
instead  
So sorry I said  
So sorry I said  
So sorry I said
