In the early mornin rain  
With a dollar in my hand  
And an achin in my heart  
And my pockets full of sand  
  
Im a long way from home  
And I miss my loved one so  
In the early mornin rain  
With no place to go  
  
Out on runway number nine  
Big 707 set to roll  
But Im stuck here on the ground  
Where the pavement never grows  
  
The liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
Well there she goes my friend  
Shes movin out at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wings on high  
Shes away and westward bound  
High above the clouds shell fly  
  
Where the mornin rain dont fall  
And the sun always shines  
Shell be flyin oer my home  
In about three hours time  
  
This old airports got me down  
Aint no earthly good to me  
Cause Im stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be  
  
You cant hop a jet plane  
The way you can a freight train  
So Ill just be on my way  
In the early mornin rain  
  
You cant hop a jet plane  
The way you can a freight train  
So Ill just be on my way  
In the early mornin rain
