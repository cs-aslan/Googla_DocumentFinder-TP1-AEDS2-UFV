Friday night seventeen  
Got my hands on the wheel  
But my mind is on Jeen  
Her silhouette  
I cant forget  
Im gonna ask her yet  
My brothers truck my Sunday slacks  
Ive been working all week  
And Ive got five bucks for gas  
And just for luck  
My grandfathers flask  
Its gonna take some nerve to ask  
Dance Dance with me one more time  
One more time  
Dance Dance with me one more time  
Before the band is done  
Before your Daddy comes  
Dance Dance with me one more time  
Shes the apple of his eye  
And theres no way in hell  
Hell let her out of his sight  
Therell be trouble  
Maybe a fight  
If he knew what I had in mind  
I see it now as plain as day  
A church and a chaplain  
On our wedding day  
Dressed in white  
She looks so fine  
You never know she just might  
Im gonna have to ask her tonight
