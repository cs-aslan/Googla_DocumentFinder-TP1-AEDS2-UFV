We need to talk about the way youve been behaving  
We need to talk about the Christmas lights in your clothes  
We need to talk about the stranger in the kitchen  
We need to talk about the scissors and the silver foil  
I thank God  
Youre so fabulously  
Odd  
  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Is so right for me  
So right for me  
  
We need to talk about the wedding cake and the wetsuit  
We need to talk about the policeman down the hall  
Youre truly strange  
But it wouldnt do for us all to be the same  
  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Is so right for me  
Just right for me  
  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Is so right for me  
So right  
  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Is so right for me
