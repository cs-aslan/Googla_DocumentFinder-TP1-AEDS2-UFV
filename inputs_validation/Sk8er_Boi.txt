He was a boy  
She was a girl  
Can I make it any more obvious  
He was a punk  
  
She did ballet  
What more can I say  
He wanted her  
Shed never tell secretly she wanted him as well  
  
But all of her friends  
Stuck up their nose  
They had a problem with his baggy clothes  
  
He was a skater boy  
She said see you later boy  
He wasnt good enough for her  
She had a pretty face  
But her head was up in space  
She needed to come back down to earth  
  
Five years from now  
She sits at home  
Feeding the baby shes all alone  
She turns on tv  
  
Guess who she sees  
Skater boy rockin up MTV  
She calls up her friends  
They already know  
  
And theyve all got  
Tickets to see his show  
She tags along  
Stands in the crowd  
Looks up at the man that she turned down  
  
He was a skater boy  
She said see you later boy  
He wasnt good enough for her  
Now hes a super star  
Slamming on his guitar  
Does your pretty face see what hes worth  
  
He was a skater boy

Sorry girl but you missed out  
Well tough luck that boys mine now  
We are more than just good friends  
This is how the story ends  
  
Too bad that you couldnt see  
See the man that boy could be  
There is more that meets the eye  
I see the soul that is inside  
  
Hes just a boy  
And Im just a girl  
Can I make it any more obvious  
We are in love  
Havent you heard  
How we rock each others world  
  
Im with the skater boy  
I said see you later boy  
Ill be back stage after the show  
Ill be at the studio  
Singing the song we wrote  
About a girl you used to know
