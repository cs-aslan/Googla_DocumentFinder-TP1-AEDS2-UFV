Show me a heart thats got no passion  
Ill show you a heart thats got no life  
Show me a man that doesnt give his heart  
Ill show you man that tells you lies  
Oh you can try to run but theres nowhere to hide  
Love is stronger than your lies  
Oh and oh you can deny it all you want  
But love will win its just a matter of time  
  
You know you cant run from love  
You know you know  
You know you cant run  
Aint nowhere to hide  
You know you cant run you know  
You know you know  
You know you cant run  
Love is stronger than your lies  
  
Show me a heart thats not committed  
Ill show you a man that doesnt try  
Show me a heart that doesnt die for love  
Ill show you an empty man inside  
Oh you can run but you wont find no place to hide  
Love dont want your heart to die  
Oh and oh you can deny love all you want  
But love is strong and wont be denied
