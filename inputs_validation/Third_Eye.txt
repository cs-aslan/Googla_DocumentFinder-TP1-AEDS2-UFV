Dreaming of that face again  
Its bright and blue and shimmering  
Grinning wide  
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes  
On my back and tumbling  
Down that hole and back again  
Rising up  
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye  
In out in out in out  
A childs rhyme stuck in my head  
It said that life is but a dream  
Ive spent so many years in question  
To find Ive known this all along  
So good to see you  
Ive missed you so much  
So glad its over  
Ive missed you so much  
Came out to watch you play  
Why are you running  
Shrouding all the ground around me  
Is this holy crow above me  
Black as holes within a memory  
And blue as our new second sun  
I stick my hand into his shadow  
To pull the pieces from the sand  
Which I attempt to reassemble  
To see just who I might have been  
I do not recognize the vessel  
But the eyes seem so familiar  
Like phosphorescent desert buttons  
Singing one familiar song  
So good to see you  
Ive missed you so much  
So glad its over  
Ive missed you so much  
Came out to watch you play  
Why are you running away  
Prying open my third eye  
So good to see you once again  
I thought that you were hiding  
And you thought that I had run away  
Chasing the tail of dogma  
I opened my eye and there we were  
So good to see you once again  
I thought that you were hiding from me  
And you thought that I had run away  
Chasing a trail of smoke and reason  
Prying open my third eye
