Clowns caress you  
Figures undress your fear  
Induced to crime beyond emotion  
Shedding tears as big as the ocean  
  
Dont say you didnt hear us callin  
Ooh ooh youll be sorry in the mornin  
When we tell you  
Mama had tears in her eyes  
Shes the only one who never cries  
  
Thats the way we destroy a baby  
Shut it out shut it out  
Thats the way we destroy a baby  
Shut it out of your mind  
Thats the way thats the way  
  
If I address you  
And you see me in the shadows fallin  
Call caress me  
Hey I woke up on my own this mornin  
  
Dont say you didnt hear us callin  
Ooh ooh youll be sorry in the mornin  
When we tell you  
Mama had tears in her eyes  
Shes the only one who never lies  
  
Thats the way we destroy a baby  
Shut it out shut it out  
Thats the way we destroy a baby  
Shut it out of your mind  
Thats the way thats the way
