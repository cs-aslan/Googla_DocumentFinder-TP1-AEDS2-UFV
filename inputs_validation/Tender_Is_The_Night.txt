Between the darkness on the street  
And the houses filling up with light  
Between the stillness in my heart  
And the roar of the approaching night  
Somebodys calling after somebody  
Somebody turns the corner out of sight  
Looking for somebody  
Somewhere in the night  
Tender is the night  
When you hold your baby tight  
Tender are the motions tender is the night  
Between a life that we expected  
And the way its always been  
I cant walk back in again  
After the way we fight  
When just outside there are people laughing  
Living lives we used to lead  
Chasing down the love they need  
Somewhere in the night  
Tender is the night  
And the benediction of the neon light  
Tender are the hunters tender is the night  
Youre gonna want me tonight  
When youre ready to surrender  
Forget about whos right  
When youre ready to remember  
Its another world at night  
When youre ready to be tender  
Tender tender tender  
And in the hard light of an angry sun  
No one remembers what was said or done  
Tender are the words they choose  
You win I win we lose  
Tender  
Tender is the night  
Tender  
The benediction of the neon light  
Tender  
Tender are the hunters  
Tender is the night  
When they hold each other tight  
Tender  
Tender are the undercover  
Tender  
The stranger and the secret lover  
Tender  
Tender are the motions  
Tender is the night  
When you hold your baby tight  
Tender tender tender
