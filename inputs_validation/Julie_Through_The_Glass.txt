Julie through the glass  
Lookin up at me  
Youve just got to be  
The sweetest thing Ive ever seen  
  
Julie through the glass  
Just born a day ago  
And who knows where youve been  
And where youre gonna go  
  
We want you to love the world  
To know it well and play a part  
And well help you to learn to love yourself  
Cause thats where loving really starts  
  
Julie through the glass  
Im looking forward to  
Doing things with you  
For many years to come
