I want to change to rearrange  
What is going on  
I need to change I need to play  
Like a five year old  
  
I cant detach from the past and all of the pain  
I need to learn start from scratch begin again  
  
Chorus  
Throw away yesterday  
Today is a brand new day  
Throw away yesterday  
Today is a brand new day  
  
So Im going to eat one hundred sweets  
I dont care if I get fat  
And Im going to speak one I wont censor me  
I know I can take nothing back  
  
And Im going to jump I will unburden  
I cannot go too deep  
I will not run from bad things Ive done  
Theyre things Ill try not to repeat  
  
Chorus  
  
Welcome to  
The church of whats happening now  
Head straight through  
It costs nothing but change  
  
Chorus x3  
  
Today yes today  
And today is a brand new day  
Throw away yesterday  
Cause today is a brand new day
