Scratch the ice  
Let the telephone ring  
Sense of time is a powerful thing  
And we love to laugh  
Love to cry  
Half alive  
We love to  
Go slow when were dancing for rain  
Dry skin flakes where theres ice in the vein  
And we love to cry  
Half alive  
  
Is this the start of the breakdown  
  
Scratch the earth  
Dig the burial ground  
Sense of time wont be easily found  
And ten out of ten  
For the ones who defend  
Pretend too  
Breakdown is a final demand  
We stand firm with our heads in our hands  
As we love to to cry  
Half alive  
  
Is this the start of the breakdown  
I cant understand you  
Is this the start of the breakdown
