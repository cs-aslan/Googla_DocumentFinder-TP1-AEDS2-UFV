A white house a white room  
The program of today  
Lights on switch on  
Your eyes are far away  
The map represents you  
And the tape is your voice  
Follow all along you  
Till you recognize the choice  
  
I take pictures  
Photographic pictures  
  
Bright light  
Dark room  
Bright light  
Dark room  
  
I said Id write a letter  
But I never got the time  
And Im looking to the day  
I mesmerize the light  
  
The years I spend just thinking  
Of a moment we both knew  
A second boss looking into  
It seems it cant be true
