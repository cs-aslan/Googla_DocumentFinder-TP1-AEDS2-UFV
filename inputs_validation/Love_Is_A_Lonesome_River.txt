On a street in some big city lives the girl I love so well  
She left me for another now theres nothing much to tell  
As I try to fit my life in a different mode I find  
That love is a lonesome river running through the lonesome mind  
I took a plane to back when I was just a child that played  
Time sure changed this old town oh its not the same today  
As I try to meet old friends none do I find  
Cause love is a lonesome river running through the lonesome mind  
  
Theres trees along this river that are overgrown with pines  
Theres pools along this river where the sun will never shine  
As I look into my heart and count my loss I find  
That love is a lonesome river running through the lonesome mind  
Yes love is a lonesome river running through the lonesome mind
