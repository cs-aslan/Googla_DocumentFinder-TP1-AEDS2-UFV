Let me put it this way doll  
And I know its getting late  
I can tell from the planes of your face  
That youre from out of state  
But here in the willows now heres the deal  
Tomorrows for squares tonights for real  
  
Drop me off in Groovetime  
Do you hear the slang of ages  
Show me how its done  
  
Now did you say you were from the Netherlands  
Or was that Netherworld  
If you grew up in Amsterdam  
Then Im the Duke of Earl  
These tabs look iffy you say theyre good  
Lets roll with the homeys  knock on wood  
  
Drop me off in Groovetime  
Soothe me with the Slang of Ages  
Show me where I turn  
  
Are you all part of the Dreaming  
Or the end of my life so far  
Or something half way in between  
You oughta know  
Hey whered she go  
  
Damn she skipped dimensions  
Was it something that I said  
Or something I was thinking  
When she opened up my head  
Let me make it right baby never mind how  
Theres a crazy little place I know called Be There Now  
  
Drop me off in Groovetime  
Do you hear the slang of ages  
Show me how its done  
Drop me off in Groovetime  
Soothe me with the slang of ages  
This is where I turn
