She stands in the doorway  
In the pale moon shine  
When she looks at me every part of me  
Brings my soul back to life  
  
Eyes like a rainbow  
They cut right through  
Oh Im lost in time  
All through my mind  
Im in love what can I do  
  
Sweet love child  
  
I shiver I shiver and shake  
Its been a long long time  
When she touches me every part of me  
Just comes back alive  
  
She rides like the wind  
On a summers night  
And she gives and takes  
In the love she makes  
Sweet Love Child  
  
She makes everything so right  
  
My sweet love child  
  
By the light of the morning  
Like an angels sigh  
I can feel her breath  
Lying next to me  
With the world locked outside  
  
I can feel  
A taste so sweet  
And she gives me love  
All the precious love  
It makes my life so complete  
  
So sweet
