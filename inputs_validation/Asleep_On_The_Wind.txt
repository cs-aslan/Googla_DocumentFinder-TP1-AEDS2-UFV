Love is a glass of wine  
Its balanced on the siderail of a ship  
Across the sea as midnight comes it may not last till daylight comes  
And the trip is long  
And the waves are strong  
But then again it might be up there forever  
Ive heard of birds that never touch the land  
But sleep on the wind  
And if Im touched by someones careless hand  
Asleep on the wind  
Our lives might last until the journeys end  
Alive  
Alive  
  
Our lives are just bubbles of time  
Theyre rainbowcolored and shining in the sun  
They drift above the treetops now  
In danger that the breeze drops somehow  
And darling thats all it would take  
Yet we threaten not to break  
Then again we could be up here forever  
Ive heard of birds that never touch the land  
But sleep on the wind  
And Im untouched by someones careless hand  
Asleep on the wind  
Our lives might last until the love begins  
  
So stay alive and let me try as hard as you do  
To stay alive please let me be as much alive as you  
Alive  
Alive  
Alive
