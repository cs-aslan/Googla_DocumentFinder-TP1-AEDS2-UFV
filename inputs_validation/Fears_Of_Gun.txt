Gun wears his alcoholism well  
Finger in Bottle and swingin it still  
From Bed to Sink and back again  
Clock is crawlin round the same  
Hes bustin Clock he hates its face  
Just sittin and talkin to Heart and ticks  
Talkin back to Clock in slow and studied kicks  
The fears of Gun are the fears of everyone  
  
Fingers down the throat of love  
Fingers down the throat of love  
Fingers down the throat of love  
Love Love  
  
Gun does the waltz around the room  
Collecting Table and Chairs and Sofa and so on and so on  
Gun wears his best blue suit now lets take to the sky  
Well go dancin and eatin it up  
Get a bottle and push it on down  
And lets just beat it up  
Transistor radio plays an overwhelmingly sad and lonely song  
Saying Where she gone Where she gone   
The fears of Gun are the fears of everyone  
  
Fingers down the throat of love  
Fingers down the throat of love  
Fingers down the throat of love  
Love Love
