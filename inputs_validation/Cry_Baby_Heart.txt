Id say that I dont worry  
And our parting brought no pain  
Id say that Id be happy  
If wed never meet again  
  
About the time I get em fooled  
And think Im really smart  
I realize that I cant hide  
My cryin baby heart  
  
Cry baby heart  
I wished you were at home  
So I could really laugh and say  
Im better off alone  
  
But like an actor cannot play  
I fumble through my part  
I realize that I cant hide  
My cry baby heart
