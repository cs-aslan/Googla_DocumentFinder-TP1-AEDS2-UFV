Everybodys asking why he couldnt adjust  
Adjust to what a dream that bust  
  
They took a cleancut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
Thats what they did  
  
They said whats up is down they said what isnt is  
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his  
  
They took a cleancut kid  
And they made him a killer  
Thats what they did  
  
He was on the basketball team he was in the marching band  
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand  
  
They took a cleancut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
Thats what they did  
  
They said Listen boy youre just a pup  
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up  
  
They gave him dope to smoke drinks and pills  
A jeep to drive blood to spill  
  
They said Congratulation you got what it takes  
They sent him back into the race without any brakes  
  
They took a cleancut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
Thats what they did  
  
He bought the American Dream but put it in doubt  
Only game he could play was Russian Roulette  
  
He drank CocaCola he was eating Wonder Bread  
He ate Burger Kings he was well fed  
  
He went to Hollywood to see Peter OToole  
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove in a pool  
  
They took a cleancut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
Thats what they did  
  
He couldve sold insurance owned a restaurant or bar  
He couldve been an accountant or a tennis star  
  
He was wearing boxing gloves took a dive one day  
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay  
  
His mama walks the floor his daddy weeps and moans  
They gotta sleep together in a home they dont own  
  
They took a cleancut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
Thats what they did  
  
Everybodys asking why he didnt adjust  
All he wanted was somebody to trust  
  
They took his head and turned it inside out  
He never did know what it was all about  
  
He had a steady job he joined the choir  
He never did plan to walk the high wire  
  
They took a cleancut kid  
And they made a killer out of him Thats what they did
