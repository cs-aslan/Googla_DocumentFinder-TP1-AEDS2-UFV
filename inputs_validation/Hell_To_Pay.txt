Hey Mister we want you to know  
We think youve taken this about as far as it can go  
Its about to blow  
You got nowhere to run  
Why dont you sit back and watch the show  
You used to drop your little darlin off at Sunday school  
Family values while youre gettin some behind the pool  
Shes nobodys fool  
So dont be actin surprised when your daughter  
Wants it bad as you  
You jack up the rent you call in a loan  
Clear your intent is to screw em out of all they own  
Throw the dog a bone  
Well youll be cryin for mercy when  
Your karma calls you on the phone  
Well you know times are hard  
Aint it a bitch but  
The Japanese are makin you twitch  
All your investments are turnin sour  
It kinda spoils your happy hour  
Look around were comin your way  
Its a wonder to us how you ever thought  
Youd get away what you say  
Well the way it looks from here  
You wont have to wait  
The way it looks from here  
No need to hesitate  
Have a party celebrate  
The way it looks from here  
You wont have to wait for hell to pay
