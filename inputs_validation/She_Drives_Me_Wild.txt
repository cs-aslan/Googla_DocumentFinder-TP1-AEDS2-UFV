Shes got the look  
Shes so fine  
And you know damn well  
The girl will be mine  
She got the breaks  
Shes a scene  
And you know damn well  
She gives it to me  
  
Black jeans  
And a turtleneck sweater  
I know the girl is fakin  
Cause Ive seen her look better  
She composition  
She statistical fact  
Got it ready for the willing  
Got it kickin at the back  
  
She got the look  
Shes got the look  
Wanna know better  
Shes got the look  
Shes got the look  
Shes driving me wild  
Shes got the look  
Wanna know better  
Shes got the look  
Shes got the look  
Shes driving me wild  
  
Come to the place shoktacy  
And you know damn well  
You know what I mean  
Hot in the face  
One and 3  
Like a pleasure trip  
Like youve never seen  
  
Satin lace  
And a paisley cut top  
The girl is waisting over  
And she knows shes just hot  
She got position  
She got just what it takes  
Got a mojo in her pocket  
Got it ready just in case  
  
Shes got the look  
Shes got the look  
Wanna know better

Shes got the look  
Shes driving me wild  
That girls my baby  
Shes got the look  
Wanna know better  
Shes got the look  
Shes driving me wild  
  
Please no kick back  
I cant take it  
Youre driving me wild  
I might not make it  
You got me looking like buckwheat  
Oh hair pulled  
Every which way but neat  
Far from Medusa  
But you look so deadly  
Your walk is soft  
Still I hear the medley  
Oh shiver me timber  
But I do cramp my style  
She drives me wild  
  
Shes got the look  
Shes got the look  
Shes got the look  
Shes got the look  
Wanna know better  
Shes got the look  
Shes got the look  
Shes driving me wild  
That girls my baby  
Shes got the look  
Wanna know better  
Shes got the look  
Shes driving me wild
