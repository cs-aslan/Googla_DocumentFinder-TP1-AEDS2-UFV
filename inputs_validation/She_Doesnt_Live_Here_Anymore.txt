We grew up together  
weve been here forever  
Barefoot in the summer  
cold in stormy weather  
She taught me all there is  
like magic and love  
lots of forgotten words  
  
But now  
she doesnt live here anymore  
Shes off and shes gone  
she doesnt live here anymore  
Im sorry thats all there is to it  
Im sorry thats all  
  
She dressed just like a painter  
a female street Picasso and I  
I will remember the heaven in her laughter  
And the scent of her sweet perfume  
when we made love under an August moon  
  
But now  
she doesnt live here anymore  
Shes off and shes gone  
she doesnt live here anymore  
Im sorry thats all there is to it  
Im sorry thats all  
  
But now she doesnt live here anymore  
Shes off and shes gone  
she doesnt live here anymore  
Shes gone since long so long  
she doesnt live here anymore  
She took off and left home  
She doesnt live here anymore  
Im sorry thats all there is to it  
Im sorry thats all  
Thats all
