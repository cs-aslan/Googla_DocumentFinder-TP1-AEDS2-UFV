The colours I see looking in your eyes  
Colours of the universe in the way they shine  
Everythings so surreal when youre close to me  
My soul just finds it hard we were meant to be  
  
Oh theres only ever so many hours in the day  
Theres only so many notes that you can play  
But when Im with you  
Time is never ending with the music that we make  
  
You are my harmony  
Viewpoint to my melody  
You mean everything to me  
Oh you my harmony  
  
The heavens are smiling every time we kiss  
And nothing ever came so close to heaven as this  
  
You are my harmony  
Viewpoint to my melody  
You mean everything to me  
Oh you my harmony  
  
And it makes my heart sing  
Ooh its the best thing  
When I am with you  
  
Harmony  
Viewpoint to my melody  
You mean everything to me  
Oh you my harmony  
Harmony  
Viewpoint to my melody  
You mean everything to me  
Oh you my harmony  
Harmony  
Viewpoint to my melody  
You mean everything to me  
Oh you my harmony
