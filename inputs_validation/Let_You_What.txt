Interlude  
Thank you Youre welcome  
Huh all right  
Where to sir  
Take us home   
Wait a minute I didnt say I was coming home with you  
Well I mean you didnt necessarily say you wasnt  
Stop tryna be cute  
Im just saying I want you its clear that you want me  
Conceded  
Confident theres a difference And to deny our impulses is to deny the very
thing that makes us human  
Spare me the game Its clear that you want it the question is do you
deserve it  
I can show you so much better than I can tell you that is if I let you  
Let you what  
Take you there
