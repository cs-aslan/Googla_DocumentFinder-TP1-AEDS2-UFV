I feel like Im a hopeless romantic  
I cant help falling in love  
I fiend for love  
I want it I crave it  
I just cant get enough  
  
Take me away  
I wear my heart on my sleeve  
Always let love take the lead  
I may be a little naive yeah  
  
You know Im drunk on love  
Drunk on love  
Nothing can sober me up  
Its all that I need yeah  
  
Ive been let down  
But never been tainted  
So I stay thirsty for more  
No I wont hold back  
No drop is wasted  
I let love run its course  
  
Take me away  
I wear my heart on my sleeve  
Always let love take the lead  
I may be a little naive yeah  
  
You know Im drunk on love  
Drunk on love  
Nothing can sober me up  
You know Im drunk on love  
Drunk drunk on love  
Nothing can sober me up  
Its all that I need  
  
Im so intoxicated  
I love the way you taste on my lips  
When we kiss  
You got me so addicted  
So much I cant resist  
Falling into your arms  
  
Take me away  
I wear my heart on my sleeve  
Always let love take the lead  
I may be a little naive yeah  
  
You know Im drunk on love  
Drunk on love  
Nothing can sober me up  
You know Im drunk on love  
Drunk drunk on love  
Nothing can sober me up  
  
Its all that I need  
Its all that I need  
Its all that I need
