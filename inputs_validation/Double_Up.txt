Alright now that we got that out of the way lets double up  
Its your boyfriend  
Look here were in the club  
Youre trying to decide whether youre gonna leave with me  
But you dont know cause you got your girl with you  
Bring her wit you  
Bring her wit you  
I got a place she can stay at my crib  
Lets go  
  
Step up out the club with a dizzy head  
I got two chicks both got dizzy legs  
Im bout to double up  
You know Im bout to double up  
Pop off in that Phantom with the doors suicide  
I got a freak in the front and a freak in the back  
Im bout to double up  
And you know Im bout to double up  
Double up  
  
I fall though the spot  
Kellz on the prowl  
I see these honies and they dancing all wild  
All up on each other windin real freaky  
Im plottin how Im gonna take em home with me  
Maybe her cousin maybe her girlfriend  
I just wanna get em both up out of here  
Fast as I can on them dubs to the crib  
Start off in my game room  
Pop a little bub  
Then have em dance for me like they danced in the club  
Ooh they so freaky and both of em horny  
Shots of tequila puff some dro and now they ready  
Her girl holla out were best friends  
And then I holla out yall look like twins  
Aint no competition yall a couple of tens  
And then they say Kellz tell us what cha wanna do  
Well Im about to double up with you and you  
  
Chorus  
Step up out the club with a dizzy head  
I got two chicks both got dizzy legs  
Im bout to double up One on each arm  
You know Im bout to double up I keep one on each arm  
Pop off in that Phantom with the doors suicide  
I got a freak in the front and a freak in the back  
Im bout to double up One on each arm  
And you know Im bout to double up I keep one on each arm  
Double up  
  
Pimpin dont stop when I walk up in the club  
See a girl with a girl and try and get a group hug  
Get em to the hotel  
Get some group love  
Her Her me man I just cant get enough  
All up in my tub  
Steady poppin bub  
Who is she to you and she replied First cuz  
Man I could tell they so naughty naughty  
The way they took me down like a forty forty  
One in the bed and one in the chair  
One massage my toes while one braid my hair  
  
In the private spot like two of these playas  
In the car lot like two of these playas  
Hatas saying damn how he doin this playa  
Doublin up for me is like routine playa

Mix em up like Im a deala  
Man threes company bitch call me Jack Tripper  
  
Chorus  
  
Snoop Dogg  
Im back up in the VIP  
In a cloud of smoke  
Be poundin surrounded by all my folks  
Give me another shot  
Damn the music loud

Grip slip slide by the dance floor  
Baby grab me by my hand say she wanna dance oh Oh

Sho nuff it must be cuz now she freakin me out

Kiss me kiss her now kiss each other
