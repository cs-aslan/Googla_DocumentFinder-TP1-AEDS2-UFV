Im reaching out to touch you  
In the middle of the night  
And I dont know if Ive been sleeping  
But I hold my pillow tight  
Are you real or are you  
My imagination playing games  
I cant set you free  
Youll always be my eternal flame  
  
Your dreamy eyes  
They just wont say goodbye  
Well it must be my fate  
Cause I just cant escape  
And the passion never dies  
Oh dreamy eyes  
No matter how I try  
I just cant reach you dreamy eyes  
  
Your dreamy eyes  
They just wont say goodbye  
Well it must be my fate  
Cause I just cant escape  
And the passion never dies  
Oh dreamy eyes  
No matter how I try  
I just cant reach you dreamy eyes  
  
Youre a vision of tomorrow  
And a ghost from yesterday  
And Ill be trying not to let you  
Take my breath away  
Youre a summer breeze that comes and goes  
But somehow lingers on  
Tell me how can I forget you  
If youre never really gone  
What do I have to do  
To get that close to you  
And your your dreamy eyes  
Oh I try so hard to release you  
I just keep seeing your dreamy eyes  
  
Your dreamy eyes  
They just wont say goodbye  
Well it must be my fate  
Cause I just cant escape  
And the passion never dies  
Oh dreamy eyes  
No matter how I try  
I just cant reach you dreamy eyes
