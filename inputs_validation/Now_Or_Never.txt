I watch the morning dawn upon your skin  
A splinter in the light  
It caught and frayed the very heart of us  
Its been hiding there inside for all this time  
How a sure thing winds up just like this  
Clockwork silence only knows  
  
Chorus  
And its no ones fault  
Theres no black and white  
Only you and me  
On this endless night  
And as the hours run away  
With another life  
Oh darling cant you see its now or never  
Its now or never  
  
Sweeping eggshells still at 3 am  
Were trying far too hard  
The tattered thought balloons above our heads  
Sinking in the weight of all we need to say  
Whys and what ifs have since long played out  
Left us short on happy endings  
  
Chorus  
  
Its now or never  
Its now or never  
  
You know that theres so much more  
And its no ones fault  
Theres no black and white  
Only you and me  
On our final night  
And as the hours run away  
With another life  
Oh darling cant you see its now or never  
Its now or never
