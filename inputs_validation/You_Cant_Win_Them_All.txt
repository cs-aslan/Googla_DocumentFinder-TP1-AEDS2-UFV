You cant win them all  
Cause sometimes you fall flat on your face on the floor  
You cant win them all  
Its no good at all if you feel that your life is a bore  
  
Youve got to hang loose to keep from the noose  
And youve got to learn to use your brain  
Youve got to live right and keep to the right  
Then youre free if you dont go insane  
  
Ive seen a lot of people  
Theyve all blown it out  
You cant win them all is what they all shout  
Youve got to keep tryin  
Got to stand up a gain  
You cant lose them all babe  
Cause one day youll win  
  
Youve got to have taste or life is a waste  
And you dont ever tune yourself in  
Youve got to keep on or theyll get you my son  
And they know that you just cant win
