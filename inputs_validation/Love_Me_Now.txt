Verse 1  
Pulling me further further than Ive been before  
Making me stronger shaking me right to the core

Never heard it from above the world isnt ours  
But I know whats in my heart if you aint mine Ill be torn apart

Verse 2  
Something inside us knows theres nothing guaranteed  
Yeah girl I dont need you to tell me that youll never leave no  
When weve done all that we could to turn darkness into light turn evil to
good  
Even when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love it could all fall
apart
