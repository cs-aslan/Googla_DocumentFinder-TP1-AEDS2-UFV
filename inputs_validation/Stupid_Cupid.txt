My Fine feathered friend with your cute little pranks  
I would like to express my thanks  
I trusted you implicitly  
But What a doublecrosser you turned out to be  
  
Stupid Cupid Youre a real mean guy  
Id like to clip your wings so you cant fly  
Im in love and its a crying shame  
and I know that youre the one to blame  
Hey Hey Set me Free  
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me  
  
I cant do my homework and I cant think straight  
I meet her every morning bout half past eight  
Im acting like a lovesick fool  
Youve even got me carrying your books to school  
Hey Hey Set me Free  
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me  
  
You messed me up for good right from the very start  
Hey now go play Robin Hood with somebody elses heart  
You got me jumping like a crazy clown  
and I dont feature what your putting down  
Well since I kissed her loving lips of wine  
the thing that bothers me is that I like it fine  
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me  
Hey Hey set me free  
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me  
  
You got me jumping like a crazy clown

Hey since I kissed her loving lips of wine  
the thing that bothers me is that I like it fine  
Hey Hey set me free  
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me
