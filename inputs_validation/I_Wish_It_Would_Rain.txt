How you doin Annaheim I dont know what else to call ya  
If I knew all your names Id call ya your bloody names  
Heres one that we did when we was here  
Were many of you here last night  
  
Alright well I changed me shirt anyway  
No I havent changed me trousers  
  
Sunshine blue skies please go away  
My love has found another gone away  
Withered up my future my life is filled with gloom  
Day after day I stay locked up in my room  
I know to you it might sound strange  
But I wish it would rain  
  
Curse so badly I dont want to go outside  
Everyone knows that a man aint supposed to cry  
Listen Ive got to cry cause crying sheds the pain  
To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain  
I wish it would rain  
  
Let it rain  
  
Looking down at my tear stained face pressed against the window pane  
But I search the sky desperately for rain  
Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops no one will ever know  
When Im crying crying when I go outside  
To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain  
I wish it would rain  
  
Let it rain  
Like that number unverified
