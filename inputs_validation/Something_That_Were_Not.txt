I shoulda known when I got you alone  
That you were way too into me to know  
This isnt love boy this aint even close  
But you always think were something that were not  
And now you call me every single night  
I only answer cause Im too polite  
We happened once or maybe it was twice  
Yeah you always make it hard for me to stop  
But you always think were something that were not  
  
Hey  
  
You wanna be more than just friends  
I cant go through this again  
Stop trying get inside my head  
Dont wanna do more than hookup  
Its getting stupid cause  
I shoulda known but I forgot  
That you think were something that were not  
  
Hey  
  
I hear youre telling every one you know  
That Im the one like you cant let me go  
And you just keep on blowing up my phone  
Cause you never seem to know when you should stop  
Dont introduce me to any of your friends  
Delete my number dont call me again  
We had some fun but now its gonna end  
But you always made it hard for me to stop  
Now you always think were something that were not  
  
Hey  
  
You wanna be more than just friends  
I cant go through this again  
Stop trying get inside my head  
Dont wanna do more than hookup  
Its getting stupid cause  
I shoulda known but I forgot  
That you think were something that were not
