You are my hurt locker lover  
Keep me walking on a wire  
Dont know when youll blow  
So I tip toe through your triggered mine  
You fight me but Im on your side  
Defeated now retreating  
  
Why you trying to make me your enemy  
All I really need is a little peace  
I just wanna be your lover  
Oh this is not a competition  
So baby why the ammunition  
I dont wanna be the last one standing  
  
Choose your battles babe  
Then you win the war  
Stop digging your own grave  
Theres so much to live for  
  
Choose your battles babe  
Cause Im not fighting anymore  
I am not fighting anymore  
  
I try to pick off your red flags  
But dancing up on broken glass  
Your mind games hit like glue names  
Your course just like the Kennedys  
But you somehow get me on my knees defeated  
Not retreated  
  
Why you trying to make me your enemy  
All I really need is a little peace  
I just wanna be your lover  
Oh this is not a competition  
So baby why the ammunition  
I dont wanna be the last one standing  
  
Choose your battles babe  
Then you win the war  
Stop digging your own grave  
Within so much to live for  
  
Choose your battles babe  
Cause Im not fighting anymore no  
I am not fighting anymore  
  
If you wanna go then go  
If you wanna stay then stay  
Cause I dont wanna fight no more baby  
I am not fighting anymore  
If you wanna go then go  
If you wanna stay then stay  
I dont wanna fight no more  
Anyway I am not fighting anymore  
  
If you wanna go then go  
If you wanna stay then stay  
Cause I dont wanna fight no more baby  
  
If you wanna go then go choose your battle babe  
If you wanna stay then stay then you win the war  
Cause I dont wanna fight no more baby stop digging your own grave  
  
If you wanna go then go choose your battle babe  
If you wanna stay then stay then you win the war  
Cause I dont wanna fight no more baby
