A close up of your soul is printed in your eyes  
I know Ive lost control Im getting close to paradise  
Who knows to what Im holding on  
So many ways it can go wrong  
And all my heart needs to know is it time to let go  
  
My heart is where you are Ill always trust in what you do  
Your love will take me far Ill only see the best in you  
But what if you feel like movin on  
Leaving before the night is gone  
All my heart needs to know is it time to let go  
Oh thats all my heart needs to know  
  
Dont let me fly on the wings of a lie  
Dont you take me down easy  
Dont let me guess if your eyes speak goodbyes  
Heaven seems to be a place not meant for me  
  
Its quiet round my heart theres no need for empty words  
Just let me go my way and leave before the silence hurts  
Theres always one more chance to take  
Theres always one more heart to break  
All my heart needs to know is it time to let go  
Is it time  
All my heart needs to know  
  
Dont let me fly on the wings of a lie  
Dont you take me down easy  
Dont lead me on if tonight means goodbye  
Dont let me be the last to know  
  
Woo  
  
Someones grip is always stronger  
Someone cares just a little bit more  
Im holdin on a little longer  
Just a little just a little bit more  
  
Dont let me fly on the wings of a lie  
Dont you take me down easy  
Dont lead me on if tonight means goodbye  
Dont let me guess if your eyes mean good thoughts  
  
Oh baby dont let me fly  
Dont let me fly  
Dont let me down easy
