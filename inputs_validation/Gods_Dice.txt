Its out of my hands making all hands meet  
Stumble as its crumbling out of reach  
Its in the cards of destiny  
Your sanity in tow  
Designate my luck  
Resignate  
  
This power has no roots to guide no role  
Trust me rusted minds refuse to go  
Unwillingness its meaningless  
To walk away in vain  
Designate my will  
Designate my will  
Resignate  
  
My will is crashing synapses flashing slow  
Days like frame by frame where do they go  
Yeah why fight Forget it  
Cant I spend it after I go  
  
Roll them high  
Throw them again  
All Gods dice  
  
Monkey driven call this living ha ha ha  
Too much thought its overwrought a hole  
Minding yours whats mine not yours  
Will finish us off  
Designate my life  
Designate a view  
Designate my will my will my will I will  
Resignate my god
