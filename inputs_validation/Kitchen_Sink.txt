Verse 1  
Nobody thinks what I think  
Nobody dreams when they blink  
Think things on the brink of blasphemy Im my own shrink  
Think things are after me Im my catastrophe  
Im a kitchen sink  
You dont know what that means  
Because a kitchen sink to you  
Is not a kitchen sink to me  
Okay friend  
  
Verse 2  
Are you searching for purpose  
Then write something yeah it might be worthless  
Then paint something then it might be wordless  
Pointless curses nonsense verses  
Youll see purpose start to surface  
No one else is dealing with your demons  
Meaning may be defeating them  
Could be the beginning of your meaning friend  
  
Chorus  
Go away x4  
Leave me alone x7  
  
Verse 3  
Nobody thinks what you think no one  
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction  
They will play a game and say they know what youre going through  
And then try to come up with a narcistic way to say  
They dont know you  
And neither do I so  
Heres a prime example of a standup guy who  
Hates what he believes and loves it at the same time  
Heres my brother and his head screwed up but thats alright  
  
Verse 4  
Time gains momentum the moment when Im living in em  
Im winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after  
A rebeginning moments mending memories  
Pretending enemies are friend of me sending me straight to bending me  
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man  
Copy and paste caught me and copy better rhymes bother me  
The better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet Ill battle with em battle  
Better I am Gambling man better bet I am a gambling man I am  
  
Chorus  
Go away x4  
Leave me alone x5  
  
Dont leave me alone
