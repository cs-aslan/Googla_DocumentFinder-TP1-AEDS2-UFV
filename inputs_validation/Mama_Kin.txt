It aint easy livin like a gypsy  
Tell ya honey how it feels  
Ive been dreamin floatin down stream  
And losin touch with all thats real  
Whole lotta lover keepin undercover  
Never knowin where you beenOo yeah  
Youve been fadin always out paradin  
Keep in touch with mama kin  
  
You always got your tail on the wag  
Spittin fire from your mouth  
Just like a dragon  
You act like a perpetual drag  
You better check it out  
Cause someday soon  
Youll have to climb back on the wagon  
  
It aint easy livin like you want to  
Its so hard to find piece of mind  
Yes it is  
The way I see it  
You got to say sheeit  
But dont forget to drop me a line  
  
Bald as an egg at eighteen  
And workin for daddys such a drag  
You still stuff your mouth  
With his beans  
You better check it out or someday soon  
Youll have to climb back on the wagon  
  
Keep in touch with mama kin  
Tell her where you gone and been  
Livin out your fantasy  
Sleepin late and smokin tea  
Keep in touch with mama kin  
Tell her where you gone and been  
Livin out your fantasy  
Sleepin late and suckin me oh no  
  
It aint easy livin like you want to  
Its so hard to find piece of mind  
Yes it is  
The way I see it  
You got to say sheeit  
But dont forget to drop me a line  
  
Bald as an egg at eighteen  
And workin for daddys just a drag  
You still stuff your mouth  
With his beans  
You better check it out or someday soon  
Youll have to climb back on the wagon  
  
Keep in touch with mama kin  
Tell her where you gone and been  
Livin out your fantasy  
Sleepin late and smokin tea  
Keep in touch with mama kin  
Tell her where you gone and been  
Livin out your fantasy  
Sleepin late and suckin me
