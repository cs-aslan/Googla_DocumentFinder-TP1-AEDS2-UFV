I would like to visit you for a while  
Get away and out of this city  
Maybe I shouldnt have called but  
Someone had to be the first to break  
We can go sit on your back porch  
Relax  
Talk about anything  
It dont matter  
Ill be courageous if you can pretend  
That youve forgiven me  
  
Because I dont know you anymore  
I dont recognize this place  
The picture frames have changed  
And so has your name  
We dont talk much anymore  
We keep running from the pain  
But what I wouldnt give to see your face again  
  
Springtime in the city  
Always such a relief from winter freeze  
The snow was more lonely than cold if you know what I mean  
Everyones got an agenda  
Dont stop keep that chin up youll be alright  
Can you believe what a year its been  
Are you still the same  
Has your opinion changed  
  
Because I dont know you anymore  
I dont recognize this place  
The picture frames have changed  
And so has your name  
We dont talk much anymore  
We keep running from the pain  
But what I wouldnt give to see your face again  
  
I know I let you down  
Again and again  
I know I never really treated you right  
Ive paid the price  
Im still paying for it every day  
  
So maybe I shouldnt have called  
Was it too soon to tell  
Oh what the hell  
It doesnt really matter  
How do you redefine something that never really had a name  
Has your opinion changed  
  
Because I dont know you anymore  
I dont recognize this place  
The picture frames have changed  
And so has your name  
We dont talk much anymore  
We keep running from the pain  
But what I wouldnt give to see your face again  
  
I see your face  
I see your face
