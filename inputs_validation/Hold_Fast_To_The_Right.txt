Come and sit by the side of your mother my boy  
You have only a moment I know  
And stay while I give you this parting advice  
It is all that I have to bestow  
  
Hold fast to the right hold fast to the right  
Wherever your footsteps may roam  
Oh for sake not the the way of salvation my boy  
That youve learned from your mother at home  
  
In your satchel youll find theres a Bible my boy  
Its the book of all others the best  
It will teach you to live and prepare you to die  
And will take to the gates of the blest  
  
Hold fast to the right hold fast to the right  
  
Hold fast to the right hold fast to the right  
Oh hold fast to the right
