Dancing with the devil round the fire  
Messed your mammas bed for a little more magic  
Make you wanna run around naked  
Cause you know it looks go on you  
  
But you aint ever had my cornbread  
A little bit of heaven and a little bit of aw yeah  
Cut it down the middle  
Open wide and jump right in  
  
Oh God said I give you love  
And I wanna jump off but the dark is enough  
Yes I messed one up and I got shoot up  
But the joy is steeped in sin  
  
The old man he come runnin round here  
Looking for the sinner who took his baby  
Im gonna tell you that it was me  
And the joy was steeped in sin  
  
The souls inside my soul before you  
All the innocence that running fire  
All inside my darkness lover lie  
All the innocence that makes you wise  
  
Dancing with the devil round the fire  
Messed your mammas bed for a little more magic  
Make you wanna run around naked  
Cause you know it looks go on you  
  
But you aint ever had my cornbread  
A little bit of heaven and a little bit of uh uh  
Cut it down the middle  
Open wide and jump right in  
  
Oh no more were taking a chance  
And when I get caught  
Oh my baby running out of town  
Cause it makes me mad  
The joy is steeped in sin  
  
Preacher man said to watch your fall  
But behind that curtain  
See us getting it on  
Oh give him what he wants  
Children calls drop  
Steeped in sin  
  
The songs inside my soul because of you  
All the innocence that makes me wild  
Oh the fire thats burning a little more lets jump on the bed  
Its all inside our heads  
Golden love again  
The love that we would make too bitter  
What case you tell me friend  
Is love that do pretend  
That one is better than the other  
  
Dancing with the devil  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh  
  
Dancing with the devil round the fire  
Messed your mammas bed for a little more magic  
Make you wanna run around naked  
Cause you know it looks go on you  
  
But you aint ever had my cornbread  
A little bit of heaven and a little bit of uh uh  
Cut it down the middle  
Open wide and jump right in

All the minutes that will make you right
