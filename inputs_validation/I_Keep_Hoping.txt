As I gather my thoughts  
With the pieces of my heart  
How long is forever  
Im not afraid and I wont be torn apart  
Weve had our time together  
Ill start again at any cost  
Ive learned a lot from losing you  
But Ive got nothing if Im lost  
And I keep hoping  
And I still believe in love  
If I wait long enough  
I know Ill be strong enough  
I keep hoping  
I believe in faith and trust  
Im gonna find a way  
There are better days still ahead of us  
I keep hoping  
  
Now this candle burns low  
It wont last through the night  
But Ive found peace  
And I know its all right  
I try to understand  
Whats been missing in my life  
Between the darkness and the daylight  
  
No Im not expecting miracles  
Ive got my doubts like any other one  
Ive learned a lot from losing you  
But Ive got nothing if Im lost  
  
And I keep hoping  
And I still believe in love  
If I wait long enough  
I know Ill be strong enough  
I keep hoping  
I believe in faith and trust  
Im gonna find a way  
There are better days still ahead of us  
I keep hoping I keep hoping  
I keep hoping and praying baby  
And I still believe in love
