The sun is peaking  
The sun is peering across the bay  
I am walking  
Sucking stale air on this fine day  
Lady squeaking  
Lady she shuffles ten feet in front  
Her pants are squeaking  
Her pants are squeaking as she does  
Ill sit him down  
Ill sit him down  
The sun is peaking  
The sun is peering across the bay  
I am walking  
Sucking stale air on this fine day  
Ill sit him down  
Ill sit him down  
Would you let me know  
Would you let me go  
Would you let me know  
Would you let me go  
Here dont fly away now  
Would you let me know  
Would you let me go  
Would you let me know  
Would you let me go  
Here dont fly away now
