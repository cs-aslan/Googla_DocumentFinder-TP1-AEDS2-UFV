It was just like every other morning  
The sun was shining  
It was storming  
They had words over breakfast  
And he said something reckless  
Just a solitary slip of the tongue  
Another womans name and it was done  
  
Chorus  
Once youve heard the truth  
Stared it in the face  
Once youve got the proof  
There aint no hiding place  
Its like thunder crashing down  
Or a freight train running through you  
No you wont forget the sound  
Once youve heard the truth  
  
She threw her wedding ring  
And it rolled across the floor  
She didnt say a thing  
But he heard that slamming door  
  
Chorus  
  
No you wont forget the sound  
Once youve heard the truth  
It was just like every other morning  
The sun was shining  
It was storming
