Take a look at unselected cases  
Youll find love has been wrecked  
By both sides compromising  
Amounting to a disastrous effect  
  
You hear stories of old  
Of princes bold  
With riches untold  
Happy souls  
Casting it all aside  
To take some bride  
To have the girl of their dreams  
At their side  
But not me  
I couldnt do that  
Not me  
Im not like that  
  
I couldnt sacrifice  
Anything at all  
To love  
  
I really like you  
Im attracted to you  
The way you move  
The things you do  
Ill probably burn in hell  
For saying this  
But Im really in heaven  
Whenever we kiss  
But Oh no  
You wont change me  
You can try  
For an eternity  
  
I wouldnt sacrifice  
Anything at all  
To love  
  
Now Ive got things to do  
You have too  
And Ive got to be me  
Youve got to be you  
So take my hand  
And feel these lips  
And lets savour a kiss  
Like wed savour a sip  
Of vintage wine  
One more time  
Lets surrender  
To this love divine  
  
But we wont sacrifice  
Anything at all  
To love
