So whatcha doin tonight  
Have you heard that the worlds gone crazy  
Young Americans listen when I say theres people puttin us down  
I know theyre sayin that weve gone lazy  
To tell you the truth weve all seen better days  
Dont need no fast buck lame duck profits for fun  
Quick trick plans take the money and run  
We need long term slow burn getting it done  
And some straight talking hard working son of a gun  
Whatcha doin tonight I got faith in our generation  
Lets stick together and futurize our attitudes  
I aint lookin to fight but I know with determination  
We can challenge the schemers who cheat all the rules  
  
Come on take pride be wise spottin the fools  
No more big shots crackpots bending the rules  
A fair shot here for me and for you  
Knowing that we cant lose  
  
And well be rockin in Paradise  
Rockin the Paradise tonight  
Rockin in Paradise  
Rockin the Paradise tonight  
Tonight tonight
