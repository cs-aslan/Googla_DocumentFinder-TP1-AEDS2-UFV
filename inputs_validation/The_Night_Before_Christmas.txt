Children carry through the streets  
A brightly painted star  
Angels gather round the hearth  
Strumming on guitars  
Men of great renown and faith  
Say prayers on boulevards  
Its the night before christmas  
  
But you dont have to be an angel  
To sing harmony  
You dont have to be a child  
To love the mystery mystery  
And you dont have to be a wise man  
On bended knee  
The heart of this christmas is in you and me  
  
the night before christmas  
the night before christmas  
  
If your hearts been longing  
Youve been afraid to try  
Sorrows kept you company  
And the dance has passed by  
Ill lift you up and blaze with you  
Across the moonlit sky  
On the night before christmas  
  
cause you dont have to be an angel  
To sing harmony  
You dont have to be a child  
To love the mystery mystery  
And you dont have to be a wise man  
On bended knee  
The heart of this christmas is in you and me  
  
The heart of this christmas is in you and me  
the night before christmas  
the night the night before christmas  
the night the night before christmas  
the night the night before christmas  
the night before christmas  
the night the night before christmas  
the night before christmas  
the night the night before christmas  
the night la la la la
