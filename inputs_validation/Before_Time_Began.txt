The daylight fades and the stars comes out  
But theres never much to talk about  
Another day goes rushing by and here we are just wondering why  
We have to belong with a sense of purpose  
Thats all we need without them were worthless  
Ah weve come so far hm but then again  
All we see is more of the same  
Its getting crowded here we agree no doubt  
Oh dear brother whats it all about  
  
Hey you over there why dont you throw down your spear  
We all need some help right now  
Where are we going from here  
The way things are working out  
It wont be too long before we have to move  
Better start thinking about it  
While theres still time to choose  
  
Every day of my life I discover  
Someone murdering my sisters and brothers  
In the name of some god or another  
What do you know  
  
For the first precious few its time to go  
What might have been well never know  
All those bad ideas became the law  
Oh yes weve forgotten what were looking for  
All of you angels its time to gather your wings  
Leave it all behind you wont need any of those things  
Were going on through the darkness hand in hand  
To step into the future  
Before time began  
  
And for those who remain with your chosen gods  
May your prayers be answered
