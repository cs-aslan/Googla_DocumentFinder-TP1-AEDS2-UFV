Oh Yes  
  
I wanna be the reason you smile after you wipe your tears  
The reason you have the courage to confront your fears  
The reason theres two carrots in each of your ears  
I spurge with the paper ma I dont care  
How ya like the pumps boots jeeps and coops  
Make celebrities 50 fall off never  
Whats mine is yours and whats yours is mine  
So when I shine you shine  
Cmon the finest Champaign we can toast to life  
Crab table in Vegas you can toss the dice  
Dont let your friends get ya confused said 50 bad news  
I need ya in my life girl your too much to loose  
  
Its funny cause for a while  
I walked around with a smile but  
Deep inside I could hear voices telling me this aint right  
Dont you know its not for you  
I always knew what I had to do  
But its hard to get away  
Because I love you I just tried to stay  
  
I used to say I couldnt do it but I did it  
After telling everybody that I wasnt with it  
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it  
And I know inside Ima be alright  
I used to say I couldnt do it but I did it  
After telling everybody that I wasnt with it  
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it  
And that voice inside says Im gonna be alright  
  
Friends of mine say to me  
They say you got control over me  
Youre not alone I played my part  
I saw the way you were from the start  
Could I expect so much from you  
You had a girl when I first met you  
Did the best that you could do  
Now I realize I cant change you  
  
I used to say I couldnt do it but I did it  
After telling everybody that I wasnt with it  
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it  
And I know inside Ima be alright  
I used to say I couldnt do it but I did it  
After telling everybody that I wasnt with it  
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it  
And that voice inside says Im gonna be alright  
  
Said I wouldnt walk away  
Some days I want to stay  
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay  
Never thought it would be true  
Me livin without you  
But now its time for me to make that move  
  
Now when I tell ya what my wishes are you dont respect it  
When I smile at ya you dont smile back to reconnect it  
You aint been gone long but I already miss you  
I need you next to me so I can hug you and kiss you  
All the talkin on the phone all the time we share  
How could you fix your mouth to say I dont care  
I had plans for us to buy ice together  
Engagement rings and things and share life together  
Now when your friends tell ya 50 called youre like whatever  
Do you think we were wrong for each other from the start  
Or was it my actions that made us fall apart  
Just want you to know youll always have a place in my heart  
  
I used to say I couldnt do it but I did it  
After telling everybody that I wasnt with it  
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it  
And I know inside Ima be alright  
I used to say I couldnt do it but I did it  
After telling everybody that I wasnt with it  
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it  
And that voice inside says Im gonna be alright  
  
Oh no be alright  
Oh no says Im gonna be alright  
  
I used to say I couldnt do it but I did it  
After telling everybody that I wasnt with it  
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it  
And I know inside Ima be alright  
I used to say I couldnt do it but I did it  
After telling everybody that I wasnt with it  
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it  
And that voice inside says Im gonna be alright
