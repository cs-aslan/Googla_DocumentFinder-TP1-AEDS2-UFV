If I never think about her Ill never miss her at all  
Never wonder what shes doing never give her a call  
Never see her again and Ill be free as a bird  
But the trouble with never is never never works  
  
If I never bring her flowers Ill never see her smile  
If I never try to kiss her shell never drive me wild  
And Ill never feel the need to say those three little words  
But the trouble with never is never never works  
  
I know how to stay care free  
Let no one get a hold on me  
But I cant keep my hands off her  
Theres somethin different bout this girl  
  
If I never let me love her Ill never settle down  
And Ill never put roots in this God forsaken town  
And Ill never say I do or step foot in a church  
But the trouble with never is never never works  
  
I know how to stay care free  
Let no one put a hold on me  
But I cant keep my hands off her  
Theres somethin different bout this girl  
  
If I never think about her Ill never miss her at all  
Never wonder what shes doing never give her a call  
Never see her again and Ill be free as a bird  
But the trouble with never is never never works  
Yeah the trouble with never is never never works  
At least not with her oh no
