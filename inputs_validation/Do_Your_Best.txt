Dont you know you better watch this man  
Better look him in the eye  
See if he returns your look or if he  
Tries to stay a little shy  
Maybe soon youll get involved again  
Better best beware  
You may expose this man for what he is  
And prove he just doesnt care  
  
And I believe in the things that I said  
And the prosecution rests  
But if youre gonna try and defend this man  
I said you better do your doggone best  
  
Hes been consistent for quite a few years  
Said he always acts the same  
Check the record of the things that hes done  
And youll know the nature of his game
