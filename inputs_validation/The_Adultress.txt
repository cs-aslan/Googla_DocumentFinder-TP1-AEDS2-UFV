Im the adulteress  
But I didnt want to be and Im convenient  
And I make good tea  
I stand accused  
Of the worst crime in history  
Thats my mystery  
Im the adulteress  
  
I go to the park  
With a bag of crumbs for the birds  
Thats where we meet without words  
He takes my hand  
And stares into the wood  
Theres nothing to understand  
Its understood  
Im the adulteress  
  
Look at the fool  
Made up to go out  
Shes desperate and lonely  
But shes puttin it about  
Look at the spinster  
Comin down off the shelf  
Shes in love and she hates herself  
  
Dont try to stop me  
Dont get in my way  
Its too late  
Ive made my play  
Does misery love company  
Ill be in the bar  
Youll find me
