Good golly said little miss molly  
When she was rockin in the house of blue light  
Tutti frutti was oh so rooty  
When she was rockin to the east and west  
Lucille was oh so real  
When she didnt do her daddies will  
Come on baby drive me crazy do it do it  
  
Im a speed king you go to hear me sing  
Im a speed king see me fly  
  
Saturday night and I just got paid  
Gonna fool about aint gonna save  
Some people gonna rock some people gonna roll  
Gonna have a party to save my soul  
Hard headed woman and a soft hearted man  
They been causing trouble since it all began  
Take a little rice take a little beans  
Gonna rock and roll down to New Orleans
