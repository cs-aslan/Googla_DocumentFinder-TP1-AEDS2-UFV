Goodbye Time  
Its your life  
You say you need a change  
Dont all the dreams weve seen come true  
  
Mean anything  
You say its different now  
And you keep staring at the door  
How can you walk away  
Dont I matter anymore  
  
Chorus  
If being free  
Is worth what you leave behind  
And if its too late  
For love to change your mind  
Then its goodbye time  
  
If we had known  
Our love would come to this  
We could have saved our hearts  
The hurt of wasted years  
  
Well its been fun  
What else can I say  
If the feelings gone  
Words wont stop you anyway  
  
Chorus
