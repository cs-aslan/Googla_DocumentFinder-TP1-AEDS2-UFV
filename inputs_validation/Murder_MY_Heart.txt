Dont wanna let this moment slip away  
Cause II have something that I really need to say  
And its killing me inside  
I think that you dont understand  
How II would give you all I have and all I am  
Till the end of time  
  
You got me defenseless intoxicated senseless  
You cut me so deeply I must confess  
  
Baby I cant breath when my arms around you  
Baby it kills me cause now that I found you  
Your love is like a weapon girl I cant live without you  
Youre so beautiful its tearing me apart  
You murder my heart oh  
You murder my heart oh girl  
  
I need to catch my breathe with you sometimes  
Cause II get dizzy when your bodys touching mine  
Girl youre killing me inside  
The way you move is much too sexy baby  
So II surrender to your hands your lips your taste  
And Im telling you tonight  
  
You got me defenseless intoxicated senseless  
You cut me so deeply I must confess

Baby it kills me cause now that I found you  
Your love is like a weapon girl I cant live without you  
Youre so beautiful its tearing me apart  
You murder my heart oh

And the way youve been slaying my heart
