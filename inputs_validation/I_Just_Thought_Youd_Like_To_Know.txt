I just thought youd like to know  
Since youd made your plans to go  
Its gonna hurt me so to see you go  
But I hope you find another love and hell be good to you  
But still and yet I cant forget the things we used to do  
  
I just thought I tell you this  
I love you since that first sweet kiss  
Its gonna hurt to miss your tender kiss  
But I hope you get to do the things you say you wanna do  
But still and yet I cant forget the happiness we knew  
  
I just thought youd like to know how much youve hurt my pride  
I just thought youd like to know how much my heart has cried over you  
But darling you could never see the misery you caused for me  
So I will tell you so cause I just thought that youd like to know
