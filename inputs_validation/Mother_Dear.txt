Lonely feelings in the city  
One room flat with crumbling walls  
Sirens play a distant melody  
Neon shadows paint the halls  
  
In the thirteen months Ive spent here  
With my manuscript and rhymes  
Ive paid in cash for foolish pleasures  
Mother dear youd call them crimes  
  
Raise the roof  
Light the lite  
Mother dear Im returning tonight  
Now I see  
Your concern  
Mother dear how you taught me to learn  
  
I been a Roman for survival  
Showing two sides of my face  
I need the comfort of your wisdom  
Im coming home to your embrace  
  
If by chance I pass before you  
Dont discount my gratitude  
Youre responsible for me here  
And of course my attitude  
  
Raise the roof  
Light the lite  
Mother dear Im returning tonight  
Now I see  
Your concern  
Mother dear how you taught me to learn  
  
Stayin up half the night  
Wonderin if what Im doin is right  
Raise the roof  
Light the lite  
Mother dear Im returning tonight
