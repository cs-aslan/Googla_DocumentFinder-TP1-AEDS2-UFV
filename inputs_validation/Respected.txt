Here in the dark the shadows they haunt me  
Here in the shade oh the bright lights they blind me  
Yesterday is gone time for moving on  
Heres a brand new start gonna base it on my heart  
Its another day Ive got to find a better way  
Wont you help me  
Failing that  
If you have to go  
Its all up to me I know  
I just wanna change my world but from the inside  
I just wanna live my life  
And make this place make this time  
For all our lives to be respected  
Here in the cold light of day this vision  
Paints a different world a world of the heart  
And I want to live there  
Ive been on the run from all the people Ive become  
I want to shed this skin and start it all again  
I want to draw a line in the sand for one last time  
Will you help me  
Failing that  
If you have to go  
Its all up to me I know  
I just wanna change my world but from the inside  
I just wanna live my life  
With some hope and to do whats right  
I just wanna change this world  
And make this place make this time  
For all our lives to be respected  
I just wanna change my world  
Change my world ooh  
I just wanna live my life and to do whats right  
I just wanna live my life and to do whats right  
I just wanna change this world  
I just wanna change this world from the inside  
I just wanna live my life  
Just wanna live my life
