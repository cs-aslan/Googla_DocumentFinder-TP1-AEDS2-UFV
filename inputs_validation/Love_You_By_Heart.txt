The lies that you tell will leave you alone  
Theyll keep you down  
theyll catch you and trip you up  
Keep you hangin around  
  
The habit is old you dont need it anymore  
Go on and kiss it goodbye  
Cause you got me and I can see  
Who you really are  
I want to show you my heart  
I want to know you by heart  
And love you by heart  
  
Im right here beside you  
theres nobody else to set you straight  
To shake you to let you know  
That its still not too late  
I want to show you my heart  
I want to know you by heart  
And love you by heart  
  
Dont make up stories  
I know you by your eyes  
I think I know whats inside  
  
The streets youve been on  
Will leave you out in the cold  
But you know I care  
And years from now  
Well both look down from the top of the stairs  
Here Ive shown you my heart  
I want to know you by heart  
And love you by heart
