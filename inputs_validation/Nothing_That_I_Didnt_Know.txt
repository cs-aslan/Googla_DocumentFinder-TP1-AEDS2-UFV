Did you hear what happened to Jenny Drew  
I couldnt believe it but its true  
Twentysix and now shes dead  
I wish that I could have died instead  
  
Did you hear what happened to Jenny Drew  
Did you see how thin and pale she grew  
So much suffering could not hide  
Endless heartache til she died  
  
Did you hear what happened to Jenny Drew  
Strike me dead for making it true  
Strike me dead for letting it go  
Nothing that I didnt know  
  
Did you hear what happened to Jenny Drew  
I couldnt believe it but its true  
Twentysix and now shes dead  
I wish that I could have died instead
