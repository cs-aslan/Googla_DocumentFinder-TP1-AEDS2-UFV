We are anything but unremarkable  
We found things that we have given up on  
We were two peas in a pod  
Oh yeah  
  
Pleasing me seven good deeds  
Im a man of strengths a man indeed  
We found things we had given up upon  
  
Now that you have gone  
I know it wont be long  
You will be waiting for me  
Faithfully  
Baby  
  
Now Im taking your love from above  
Youre never gonna leave me  
I will carry you on for so long  
Your love is never gonna leave me  
  
Now Im taking your love from above youre here  
And youre never gonna leave me  
I will carry you on for so long  
Your love is never gonna leave me  
  
Youre never gonna leave me  
  
You touched my heart and then gave me yours  
I was so afraid I tried to ignore all the butterflies  
Taking me over  
  
We are anything but unremarkable  
We found things that we have given up on  
We found love  
  
  
Now that you have gone  
I know it wont be long  
You will be waiting for me  
Faithfully  
Baby  
  
Now Im taking your love from above youre here  
And youre never gonna leave me  
I will carry you on for so long  
Your love is never gonna leave me  
  
Now Im taking your love from above youre here  
And youre never gonna leave me  
I will carry you on for so long  
Your love is never gonna leave me  
  
Your love is never gonna leave me  
Your love is never gonna leave me  
  
Now that you have gone  
I know it wont be long  
You will be waiting for me  
Faithfully  
Baby  
  
Now Im taking your love from above youre here  
And youre never gonna leave me  
I will carry you on for so long  
Your love is never gonna leave me  
  
Now Im taking your love from above youre here  
And youre never gonna leave me  
I will carry you on for so long  
Your love is never gonna leave me
