Baby I feel guilty theres no reason why  
Oh baby cause I promised you love will never lie  
Oh I send a wish to heaven  
I cant stand the pain inside  
This moment tells a story  
And Im stronger than my pride  
  
It was the night when the sky rained fire  
when the sky rained fire  
It was the night when the stars begin to fall  
It was the night when I lost my hearts desire  
It was the night babywhen I missed your call  
  
Music is the answerbaby if you cry  
Cant you tell me where love goes when it dies  
And I knew its all or nothing  
It was not a love affair  
Lay your cards here on the table  
If you need me Ill be there
