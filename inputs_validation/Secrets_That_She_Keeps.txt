I move all right  
I got the wheels going round  
Making ways in the night  
Yea were movin all right  
  
Wipin the rain from the ground  
And the pale from the sky  
But something happens in his heart  
When the morning comes  
  
The secrets that she keeps away from me  
The tears on the pillow  
She dont want me to see  
Well every little thing she does is for me  
  
But somebody new is breaking us in two  
Hes the kind of love  
That makes a whirl in your mind  
Like the tide and the time  
  
With just a little bit osoul  
He fights to find peace of mind  
In these shattering eyes  
But something happens in his heart  
  
When the morning comes  
The secrets that she keeps away from me  
The secrets that she keeps away from me  
The love of you and me
