19 is not the age of reason  
I didnt have a reason  
For setting you free  
  
Ive seen  
A lot of love go sour  
But thats not our love  
Ysee the problem was  
  
I was only 19  
  
Yeah I was only 19  
I finished up with high school  
Headed to a state school  
Wandered into you  
  
Big screen  
Kissing in a movie  
God you move me around  
We got seriously down  
  
But I was only 19  
  
All I ever wanted to do  
Was lie around in bed with you  
  
I was only 19  
I was only 19  
  
Ive seen  
A lot of love go bad now  
But thats not how our affair  
Would have wound up I swear  
  
But I was only 19  
  
All I ever wanted to do  
Is lie around in bed with you  
  
I was only 19  
I was only 19
