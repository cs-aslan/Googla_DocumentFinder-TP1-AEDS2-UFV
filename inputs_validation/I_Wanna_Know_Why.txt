Kickin down the road  
Feelin mighty slowed  
With the likes of you  
Gettin mighty spaced  
Never had a taste  
Of what youre goin through  
I cant bitch  
Went from rags to riches  
Then to ragtime screamin the blues  
I want to know why  
Everybodys good intention  
Try to make a fool out of me  
I want to know why  
Everybodys good intention  
Gotta make a fool  
Gotta make a fool  
Try to make a fool out of me  
Swing low  
Sweet cherry o  
When a strange love showed me the way  
Ya see more  
Cant keep a score  
When the whores comin on for the play  
E Poe  
Eatin crow  
Wonder if he knowed that the raven was mad  
Time passed  
And words lost the last  
Of the best thing he ever had  
Oh play rough  
Cant get enough  
So they try to make a fool out of me lordy  
Aint foolin me  
Ya aint ghoulin me  
Aint foolin me  
Ya aint ghoulin me
