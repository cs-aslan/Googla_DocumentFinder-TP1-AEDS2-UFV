Its of a gentleman soldier  
As sentry he did stand  
He saluted a fair maiden  
By a waiving of his hand  
So then he boldly kissed her  
And he passed it off as a joke  
He drilled her up in the sentry box  
Wrapped up in a soldiers cloak  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away  
  
All night they tossed and tumbled  
Till the daylight did appear  
The soldier rose put on his clothes  
Saying fare you well my dear  
For the drums they are a beating  
And the fifes they so sweetly play  
If it werent for that polly my dear  
With you Id gladly stay  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away  
  
Now come you gentleman soldier  
Wont you marry me  
Oh no my dearest polly  
Such things can never be  
For Ive a wife already  
Children i have three  
Two wives are allowed in the army  
But ones too many for me  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away  
  
If anyone comes a courting you  
You can treat them to a glass  
If anyone comes a courting you  
You can say youre a country lass  
You neednt ever tell them  
Nor pass it off as a joke  
That you got drilled in a sentry box  
Wrapped up in a soldiers cloak  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away  
  
Oh its come my gentleman soldier  
Why didnt you tell me so my parents will be angry  
When this they come to know when nine months had been and gone  
The poor girl she brought shame  
She had a little militia boy  
And she didnt know his name  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away
