I cant fool myself I dont want nobody else to ever love me  
You are my shining star my guiding light my love fantasy  
Theres not a minute hour day or night that I dont love you  
Youre at the top of my list cause Im always thinking of ya  
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you  
How I spent my day dreamin plannin how to say I love you  
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in  
Thats when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in  
  
Oh my love a thousand kisses from you  
Is never too much I just dont wanna stop  
Oh my love a million days in your arms  
Is never too much I just dont wanna stop  
Never too much never too much  
Never too much never too much  
  
Woke up today looked at your picture just to get me started  
I called you up but you werent there and I was broken hearted  
Hung up the phone cant be too late the boss is so demandin  
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standin  
Who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar  
Id rather be with you cause you make my heart scream and holler  
Love is a gamble and Im so glad that I am winnin  
Weve come a long way and yet this is only the beginning  
  
Oh my love a thousand kisses from you  
Is never too much I just dont wanna stop  
Oh my love a million days in your arms  
Is never too much I just dont wanna stop  
Oh my love a thousand kisses from you is never  
A thousand kisses from you  
A thousand kisses from you is never to much
