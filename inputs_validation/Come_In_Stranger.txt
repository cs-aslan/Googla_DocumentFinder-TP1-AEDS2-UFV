She said come in stranger  
Its good to have you home  
I hurried through cause I knew it was you  
When I saw your dog waggin his tail  
Honey why didnt you let me know by mail  
Youve been gone so long  
She said come in stranger  
  
I know youre weary from all your miles  
Just sit right there in your easy chair  
And tell me all about the places youve been  
How long itll be before you leave again  
I hope its a long long while  
She said come in stranger  
  
Everything round home is fine  
Ive watched and Ive waited for you to get back  
And I missed you all the time  
She said come in stranger  
  
Oh how I need you when youre gone  
I walk the floor and I watch the door  
And when I lie awake and wonder where you can be  
Id give anything to have you here with me  
I get so lonesome all alone  
She said come in stranger  
  
And wont you listen to my plea  
Stay long enough so that the one I love  
Is not a stranger to me
