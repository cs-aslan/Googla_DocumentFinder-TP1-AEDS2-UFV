In the valley of the shadows Im waiting  
For mother and the other ones I love  
So know Ill always love you  
Until we meet above  
  
In the battle of the bottle Im an innocent  
And the breaking of glass Im lost  
In the shadow of a downtown overpass  
My last I did exhaust  
  
No no no mother should ever have to lose a son  
No no no mother especially not such a handsome one  
  
In the middle of the meadow Im waiting  
For mother and the other ones I love  
Theres no good why this came to pass  
Theres only just because  
  
No no no mother should ever have to lose a son  
No no no mother especially such a handsome one
