1st verse  
Im not that kind of guy that likes to start trouble no  
But if you push me too far you never know what I might do  
I got a black cat bone and a magic hand yes I do  
Anf if you dont watch out Im going to put a spell on you  
  
Chorus  
Cause Im a Dead Dead End Kid  
I got nothing to lose  
Im a Dead Dead End Kid  
I like breaking the rules  
  
2nd verse  
Meet me at Midnight if you like to live dangerously  
Ive got some friends down here I really think you should meet  
Oooh if youre looking for action Im going to take you there  
Cause theres nothing in this world nothing I wouldnt dare  
  
Chorus  
Cause Im a Dead Dead End Kid  
I got nothing to lose  
Im a Dead Dead End Kid  
I like breaking the rules  
  
Bridge  
I got a one way ticket on a sinking ship  
And Im going straight to hell  
Dead End Kid yeah
