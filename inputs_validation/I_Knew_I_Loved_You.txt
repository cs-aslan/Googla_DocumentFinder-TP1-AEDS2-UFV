Maybe its intuition  
But some things you just dont question  
Like in your eyes I see my future in an instant  
And there it goes  
I think I found my best friend  
I know that it might sound  
More than a little crazy  
But I believe  
  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I think I dreamed you into life  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I have been waiting all my life  
  
Theres just no rhyme or reason  
Only the sense of completion  
And in your eyes I see  
The missing pieces Im searching for  
I think Ive found my way home  
I know that it might sound  
More than a little crazy  
But I believe  
  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I think I dreamed you into life  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I have been waiting all my life  
  
A thousand angels dance around you  
I am complete now that Ive found you  
  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I think I dreamed you into life  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I have been waiting all my life  
  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I think I dreamed you into life  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I have been waiting all my life
