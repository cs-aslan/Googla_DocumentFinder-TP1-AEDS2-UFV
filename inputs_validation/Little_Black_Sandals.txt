Im being dragged down down by the hand  
The hand of a golden giant man  
Hes crushing my knuckles  
Splitting my skin he says he will  
If only Id ask it of him  
  
He says  
Girl its your call  
You wanna fly  
You wanna fall  
So I shout  
I wanna get away from you  
As fast as I can  
I tell my feet to move it  
I hope they have a plan  
  
Chorus  
These little black sandals  
Are walking me away  
These little black sandals  
Are heading the right way  
These little black sandals  
Are walking me away  
These little black sandals  
Saved my life today  
  
So now Im free  
Free  
From the big bad giant  
  
Who was stalking me  
Thank you feet for guiding me  
Im glad somehow I got brains down there at least  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes Im tempted  
Sometimes I am  
I would be lying if I said I didnt miss that giant man  
He was the line between pleasure and pain  
But me and the feet have some years to reclaim  
  
Chorus
