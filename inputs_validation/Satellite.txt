If a world divides  
From the bittersweetness love provides  
I will redefine my place within this union  
If a word is a lie  
And the better me cant show its side  
I will try to find my way to higher ground  
  
Oh theres a million stories  
And a million ways to get there from here  
  
Baby Im gonna put your skin on mine  
Be inside you all my life  
And if you let your heart open up your mind  
Theres a whole new world on the other side  
Im gonna be your satellite  
Ill hang over your world at night  
And I can hear you sleep beneath the candlelight  
I can see your dreams like they were mine  
  
When I I hear you scream I hear you cry  
It makes me realize that I am only human  
If the world relies on the balance between love and pride  
Then Ill abandon all my pride and bring you love  
  
Oh theres a million reasons  
And a million ways to get to your heart  
  
Baby Im gonna make you step outside  
The corners of your world and find  
That if you let your heart open up your mind  
Theres a whole new world on the other side  
Im gonna be your satellite  
Ill hang over your world at night  
And I can hear you sleep beneath the candlelight  
I can see your dreams like they were mine  
  
Baby Im gonna put your skin on mine  
Be inside you all my life  
And if you let your heart open up your mind  
Theres a whole new world on the other side  
Im gonna be your satellite  
Ill hang over your world at night  
And I can hear you sleep beneath the candlelight  
I can see your dreams like they were mine
