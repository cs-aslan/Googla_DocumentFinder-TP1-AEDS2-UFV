The flame that we kindled hasnt dwindled at all  
It just keeps burning burning burning it wont cool off  
Your smile is the gold that leads it  
Your kiss is the coal that feeds it  
  
And keeps me yearning yearning it wont cool off  
And when a cloudy day begins to storm up  
Well pity those who find it hard to warm up  
Weve got a lovely furnace going for us glowing for us  
  
Burning burning and it wont cool off  
And when a cloudy day begins to storm up  
Well pity those who find it hard to warm up  
Cause we got a knocked out furnace going for us glowing for us  
  
Burning burning and it wont cool off  
Burning burning and it wont cool off
