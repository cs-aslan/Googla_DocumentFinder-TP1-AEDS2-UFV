Dont slam the door on your way out  
Dont leave without saying goodbye  
Another long distance night alone  
You leave me wanting always leave me wanting more  
Last word today coming home to stay  
Wouldnt that be nice for a while  
  
But now my takeout food is growing cold  
And the candles burned a hole in the floor  
And Im still waiting for the ring of the phone  
  
Im all alone  
Its just another rainy night without you  
Guess Ill leave a light on for you  
Its just another rainy night without you  
  
Listen theres a foghorn blowing  
From the coast tonight  
Remember making love in the rain  
Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound  
Raindrops taste like tears without the pain  
Im not much without you cant leave  
If I wanted to maybe thats why you stay around  
  
But tonight Ill sit here tending the fire  
And pace the floor one hundred times in an hour  
And check the voicemail for a message youve called  
  
Im all alone  
Its just another rainy night without you  
Waiting by the phone alone  
Its just another rainy night without you  
Guess Ill leave a light on for you  
  
I know Ive said it before  
Hate the sound of the closing door  
And your footsteps walking away  
  
But now my takeout food is growing cold  
And the candles burned a hole in the floor  
And Im still waiting for the ring of the phone  
Im all alone  
Its just another rainy night without you  
Waiting by the phone alone  
And its another rainy night without you  
Guess Ill leave a light on for you  
  
Its just another rainy night another rainy night  
Another rainy night without you
