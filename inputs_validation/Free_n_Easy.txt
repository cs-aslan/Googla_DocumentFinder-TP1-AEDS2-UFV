Aint it strange  
That when youre lonely  
And your friends theyre not around  
So you make your big decision  
Get your feet back on the ground  
  
When youre down  
And no one wants you  
And you wonder who you are  
When your friends  
They dont desert you  
When you make it youre a star  
  
But Im gonna stay  
Free and easy  
I know just what I am  
Im gonna be free and easy  
  
Well Ive been through  
All the heartaches  
And Ive been through all the pain  
But when youre up and riding high  
Everybody stakes their claim  
  
Im gonna be free and easy  
I know just what I am  
Im gonna be free and easy  
  
Im gonna be free and easy  
I know just who I am  
Im gonna be free and easy
