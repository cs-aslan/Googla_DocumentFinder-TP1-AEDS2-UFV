Count backwards 5 4 3 2 1  
Before you get too heated and turned on  
This guy  
You should have learned your lesson all them times before  
Youve been bruisedyouve been broken  
Then theres my mind saying think before you go  
Through that doorit could lead you nowhere  
This guy  
Has got you all romanticcrazy in your head  
Do you think Id listenno I dont care  
  
Bridge  
cause I cant focus I cant stop  
You got me spinning roundroundroundround  
Like a record  
I cant focusits too hot  
Inside  
Youll never get to Heaven if youre scared of getting high  
  
Chorusx2  
Boyboy let me keep freaking around  
I want to get down  
Im a red blooded woman  
Whats the point in hanging round  
Dont want to keep turning it down  
When this girl wants to rock with you  
  
My conscience sayingget down off this dream  
Its too dangerous and deadly  
This guy  
Has got you talking round in circles cant you see  
All for the sake of sexy  
Youre loving it  
Then theres my sense saying stop before you fall  
I dont want to pick you up again  
This guy  
Has got you all romanticcrazier each day  
Do you think Id listentheres no way
