When december comes  
Then well take the kids to mamas  
They can make snow angels in the yard  
Like a christmas card  
Well decorate the tree  
Put an angel high above us  
Like we always do  
At christmas  
On and on it goes  
Every year new memories to share  
And for all we know  
We will all of us be there  
When the autumn leaves have gone to gold  
And swallows know decembers calling  
Ill be flying home a thousand times  
In all my sweetest dreams  
I can see the glow in your eyes  
As we sit by the fire  
Like lovers we knew long ago  
While we watch our angels in the snow  
When december comes  
  
Well be trying to remember  
Where we packed our woolen winter clothes  
Only heaven knows  
When december comes  
Well be hanging pine and holly  
Singing all the songs we sing at christmas  
Home is ever near  
Hearts return no matter what we do  
And love  
Will build a bridge  
And I will always be there with you  
When the autumn leaves have gone to gold  
And swallows know  
Decembers calling  
Ill be flying home a thousand times  
If only my dreams  
And I see the glow in your eyes  
As we sit by the fire  
Like lovers we knew long ago  
While we watch our angels in the snow
