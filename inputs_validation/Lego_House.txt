Im gonna pick up the pieces  
And build a Lego house  
When things go wrong we can knock it down  
  
My three words have two meanings  
Theres one thing on my mind its all for you  
  
And its dark in a cold December but Ive got ya to keep me warm  
And if youre broken Ill mend ya  
And keep you sheltered from the storm thats raging on now  
  
Im out of touch Im out of love  
Ill pick you up when youre getting down  
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now  
  
Im out of sight Im out of mind  
Ill do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now  
  
Im gonna paint you by numbers and color you in  
If things go right we can frame it and put you on a wall  
  
And its so hard to say it but Ive been here before  
And Ill surrender up my heart and swap it for yours  
  
Im out of touch Im out of love  
Ill pick you up when youre getting down  
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now  
  
Im out of sight Im out of mind Ill do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now  
  
Dont hold me down  
I think my braces are breaking and its more than I can take  
  
And if its dark in a cold December but Ive got ya to keep me warm  
And if youre broken Ill mend ya  
And keep you sheltered from the storm thats raging on now  
  
Im out of touch Im out of love  
Ill pick you up when youre getting down  
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now  
  
Im out of sight Im out of mind  
Ill do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now  
  
Im out of touch Im out of love  
Ill pick you up when youre getting down  
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
