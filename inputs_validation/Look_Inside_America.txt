Good morning lethargy  
Drink pepsi its good for energy  
The baths on smoke in the bedroom  
Sore throat and on my neck a nasty bruise  
And where it came from well I dont know  
But we played last night it was a good show  
  
Got the play out second rate chat show  
Its a nation wide deal so we gotta go  
Chap from the company says it will be alright  
Got an add on KRO  
And theres an instore tonight  
Well I built things up  
And then I let them go  
Got to get time share on the radio  
  
Look inside America shes alright shes alright  
Sitting out the distance  
But Im not trying to make her mine  
Looking for America  
With its kooky nights and suicide  
Where the TV says its alright  
Coz everybodys hung up on something or other  
  
Steppin off in 20 so the driver says  
I should sleep tonight  
But I think Ill watch videos instead  
Annie Hall leaves New York in the end  
Press rewind and Woody gets her back again  
And the whole world could have passed through me  
But I dont know if it means much to me  
  
Look inside America  
Shes alright shes alright  
Sitting out the distance  
But Im not trying to make her mine  
Im looking for America  
With its kooky nights and suicide  
Where the TV says its alright  
Coz everybodys strung out on something or other  
  
And the whole world  
Could have passed through me  
But I dont know if it means much to me
