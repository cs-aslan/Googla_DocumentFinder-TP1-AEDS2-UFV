Verse 1  
What can you buy with the ultimate sacrifice  
If you dont believe in the afterlife  
Oh I still grieve rememberin what you were like  
Now what good is a dream when the dreamer dies  
  
PreChorus  
Some are better than good  
Greater than great  
Some are misunderstood  
And they get told to wait by  
  
Chorus  
All of the greatest  
The greatest of all  
Were chasing their fading star  
Wholl be the latest  
The latest to fall  
Were marching into the dark  
  
Verse 2  
What if your like was just in the day to day  
And after youre gone the world stays the same  
Why should you love what youre gonna lose anyway  
Oh Ive imagined one hundred ways  
  
PreChorus  
Some are just no good  
Some will let it just fade  
Some are misunderstood  
Well just have to wait cause  
  
Chorus  
All of the greatest  
The greatest of all  
Were chasing their fading star  
Wholl be the latest  
The latest to fall  
Were marching into the dark  
  
Bridge  
Oh Heaven knows where we are  
Chasing the fading stars  
Heaven knows where we are  
Motioning to the dark  
  
PreChorus  
Some are better than good  
And greater than great  
Some are misunderstood  
They get told to wait  
Some are just no good  
Some will let it just fade  
Some are misunderstood  
Well just have to wait cause  
  
Chorus  
All of the greatest  
The greatest of all  
Were chasing their fading star  
Wanna know who  
Wholl be the latest  
The latest to fall  
Were marching into the dark  
I wanna go marching into the dark  
All of the greatest  
The greatest of all  
Were chasing their fading star  
Were chasing their fading star  
Wholl be the latest  
Latest to fall  
Marching into the dark
