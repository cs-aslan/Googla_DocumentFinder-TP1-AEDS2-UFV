Intro  
  
Wouldve came back for you  
I just needed time  
To do what I had to do  
Caught in the life  
I cant let it go  
Whether thats right  
I wont ever know  
  
Hope you forgive me  
Never meant wrong  
Tried to be patient  
It waited to long  
But I wouldve came back  
But I wouldve came back for you  
Wouldve came back  
Wouldve came back  
  
Verse 1  
  
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta  
Who just had his linen suit dry cleaned  
Bitches whats up witcha  
I hate callin the women butches but the bitches love it  
I took some sence and made a nickle of it  
Im urgin all daughters to kiss they mothers  
With those lips that all that lipstick covers  
Youre never too groen up to miss and hug her  
And girls countin on me to be there like missin rubers  
Im on some Marvin Gaye shit a bunch of distant lovers  
This aint the life that Im used to  
Reintroduced to people Ive been intoduced to  
Did you forget me  
Or are you took scared to tell me that you met me and fear that I wont  
Remember  
I wish you could still accept me for me  
I miss Memphis Tennessee my cousins my dad  
The simplistic beauty that all them southerners had  
Im half way across the world with dozens of bags  
Feelin like all four members of Color Me Badd  
In one nigga amazin shit  
I got that Courtney Love for ya that crazy shit  
Ion drink every bottle I own  
I be agin shit  
And I got them wedding ring flows that engaging shit  
Which one of yall got fleets on your key chains  
The seats to these Heat games  
I think that you stare at yourself and you see things  
La familia Ive been inducted and instucted  
To stunt on these niggas we dont really fuck with  
Fuck is up  
Havin lunch and debatin Ferrari prices  
23 and goin through a midlife crisis  
But tust me I still deliver like a midwife  
And no Im not syin Im the nicest  
I just live life like it  
Uh It a certain type of man to teach  
To be far from hood  
But to understand the streets  
I never threw away that paper with my grammy speech  
Because I havent hit the pinnacles I plan to reach  
Yeah You gotta own it if you want it  
Kisses her on the body  
She tells me live in the moment  
And baby I never forget none of that  
Girl I told you I was comin back  
  
Chorus  
  
Wouldve came back for you  
I just needed time  
To do what I had to do  
Caught in the life  
I cant let it go  
Whether thats right  
I wont ever know  
  
Hope you forgive me  
Never meant wrong  
Tried to be patient  
It waited to long  
But I wouldve came back  
But I wouldve came back for you  
Wouldve came back  
Wouldve came back
