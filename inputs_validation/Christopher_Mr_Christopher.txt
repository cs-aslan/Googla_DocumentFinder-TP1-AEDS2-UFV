I remember Christopher  
such a man  
so brave and tall  
  
he took the baby Jesus  
in his arms  
across the waterfall  
  
people cried hes holy  
hes a saint not a man  
all at once it was written  
in the book of the land  
  
Christopher Mr Christopher  
why wont they leave you alone  
Christopher Mr Christopher  
why wont they leave you alone  
  
there was Mary Margaret  
a Christian lady  
dressed in black  
  
she believed St Christopher  
helped her find  
a way back  
  
she told him all her secrets  
and the dreams of her years  
so when they took that saint away  
all thats left were her tears  
  
Mary cried theyre crazy  
the world is changing too fast  
it was then she discovered  
that her faith couldnt last  
  
Christopher Mr Christopher  
why wont they leave you alone  
Christopher Mr Christopher  
why wont they leave you alone  
  
Christopher Mr Christopher  
why wont they leave you alone  
Christopher Mr Christopher  
why wont they leave you alone
