Original by The Turtles  written by Warron Zevon   
  
You can try to please me  
But it wont be easy  
Stone walls surround me  
Im surprised that you even found me  
Chorus  
And you dont stand an outside chance  
you dont stand an outside chance  
You dont stand an outside chance  
But you can try  
Whatever you do girl  
You know you cant get through girl  
Cant bring me down  
Hang me up or even hang around  
repeat chorus  
I know you think youll get me  
Im only flesh and bone  
But you may as well forget me  
Cause my heart is stone  
You better leave me alone  
Stand an outside chance
