Well now meet me in the bottom  
Bring me my running shoes  
Yeah now meet me in the bottom  
Bring me my running shoes  
When I come out the window  
Im gonna have time to lose  
  
When you see me streakin by  
Please dont believe  
When you see me streakin by  
Please dont believe  
When you see me coming baby  
You know my life is at stake  
  
Yeah now I hope youll see me  
When I come streakin by  
Well I hope youll see me  
When I come streakin by  
She got a bad old man you know  
And Im too young to die
