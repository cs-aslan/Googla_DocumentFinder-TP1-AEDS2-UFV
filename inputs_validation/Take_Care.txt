I Ive waited all my life  
To step out from the light  
And see the shadows fading  
You youve always stood so tall  
Ive never thought youd fall  
  
But now its you thats fading  
PreChorus  
I know that inside youre delicate  
But you say that  
You dont need someone to take care of you but  
Chorus  
I I I take care of you you you  
Take care of  
I I I take care of you you you  
Take care of you  
Oh oh oh so you want theres no need to want  
Stand up face to face the stage  
Up high but well reach higher  
I will tell the soul if you cry  
I can hold you why youre crying now  
PreChorus  
I know that inside youre delicate  
But you say that  
You dont need someone to take care of you but  
Chorus  
I I I take care of you you you  
Take care of  
I I I take care of you you you  
Take care of you  
Take care of you  
I know that inside youre delicate  
And I I take care of you you you  
Take care of  
Baby baby baby  
I I I take care of you you you  
Take care of you  
Take care of you
