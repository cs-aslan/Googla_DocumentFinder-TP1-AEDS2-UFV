In the corner by the DJ unit  
The flag of beauty my eyes salute it  
She likes love  
By luck or labour  
She likes love  
But not for favour  cant hold on  
She keeps her lips on the straw shes sucking  
Looks up to me but her eyes see nothing  
Loves her stare  
The steps to her heart  
Loves the climb  
The bite not her bark  
I pour the milk into the cats saucer  
Im John Wayne as Im walking towards her  
Shed like to dance  
But not this minute  
Shes the fish Id love to fillet  
I draw first with a stammer of verbal  
We dance like pigeons forever in circle  
She likes to dance  
Her cocktails shaken  
She likes love  
And its temptation  
  
The lights flash green  
My envy lights up  
The lights just flash  
And I feel tied up  
Loves for sale  
And I am sold on  
But theres no way  
That I can hold on  
I cant hold on
