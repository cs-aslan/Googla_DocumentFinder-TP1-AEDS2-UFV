Dont want to chill dont want to sit  
Dont want to hear no chippy shit  
Dont tell me Ive closed my mind  
  
Dont want to groove dont want to dig  
Dont want to spend the day naked  
Dont like my music country fried  
  
Hes got a tye dyed Rancid shirt  
Wears his Birkenstocks to work  
Is he a jerk No Just confused  
Jeff dont wear regular shoes  
  
Fat Mike I gotta let you know  
Its not the tunes its their live show  
And all the people you get to meet  
Plenty of good vibes and decent drugs  
Stinky people give you hugs  
Walk around in your bare feet  
  
Hes got a tye dyed Rancid shirt  
Wears his Birkenstocks to work  
Is he a jerk No Just confused  
Jeff dont wear regular shoes  
Jeff dont wear regular shoes
