Now we cant lose fo sho  
Yall niggaz wanna know what we did this is what we did nigga  
  
Extended the family worldwide recruited a couple comrades  
I was a chosen one due to my chrome gats  
Bad ass lil nigga wit a trash bag now I gotta confess it  
Every day arrested  
  
Niggaz wanna test this to get at the hoes  
So even mamma stay invested damn thats cold  
Bitches seventeen years old round 100 kilos  
Half of yall pickin pot out your nose with Afros  
  
Rollin with the big boys soakin up game  
And well be back seat with the Cartier frames  
The easier it got nigga the harder it came  
But I stayed in the game thats the heart in this mayne  
  
Therell be hell on earth if I stay in the game  
Talk about kickin up dirt like the broncos plane  
Call me the macho man when it comes to dirty ways  
A hatos man feel crime dont pay  
  
All my life I visualized me handlin mine  
And fuck waitin cause God aint promising time  
So now Im drawin a line before I get too far behind  
Lord if Im lyin strike me down on time  
  
All my life I visualized me handlin mine  
And fuck waitin cause God aint promising time  
So now Im drawin a line before I get too far behind

Cause theres only so much heat that my hand can stand

Dont get to height or this glockll click back

Ridin high Sheaf and dodo like Im in Cali

Interstate from my way down to Atlanta comes from a scanna  
Just crossed the Tennessee line  
All my life I visualized me handlin mine  
  
Its all for one and one for all nigga  
  
All my life I visualized me handlin mine  
And fuck waitin cause God aint promising time  
So now Im drawin a line before I get too far behind  
Lord if Im lyin strike me down on time
