You know you love your man  
Two hundred miles an hour  
Drinking up the fumes  
And youre never more alive  
When you feel his power  
You gotta have it today  
Cause a woman gets hot  
Youre racing for the man in the cloak  
Ah youre living your life on fire  
You see but its out of bounds company  
  
Chorus  
Fast company  
I with the lights heart beats  
Dancing to the music  
Lord I just burst into fire  
No wonder I cant sleep  
I got a feeling today  
I wanna get all hot  
All my dreams explodes with a shot  
Lord Id be living  
My life on the Caribbean Sea  
But its out of bounds company  
  
Fast company  
You see youre on the way to come  
You say youre one your way to go  
Baby the hearts speaking paradise  
But you  Help me  
Get your big life  
Fast company  
  
Chorus  
  
Fast company  
You see youre on the way to come  
You say youre one your way to go  
Baby the hearts speaking paradise with me  
Fast Company
