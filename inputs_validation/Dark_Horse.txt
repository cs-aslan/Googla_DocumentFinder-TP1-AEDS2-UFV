I knew you were  
You were gonna come to me  
And here you are  
But you better choose carefully  
Cause I am capable of anything  
Of anything and everything  
  
Make me your Aphrodite  
Make me your one and only  
But dont make me your enemy your enemy your enemy  
  
So you wanna play with magic  
Boy you should know whatcha falling for  
Baby do you dare to do this  
Cause Im coming atcha like a dark horse  
  
Are you ready for ready for  
A perfect storm a perfect storm  
Cause once youre mine once youre mine  
Theres no going back  
  
Mark my words  
This love will make you levitate  
Like a bird  
Like a bird without a cage  
But down to earth  
If you choose to walk away dont walk away  
  
Its in the palm of your hand now baby  
Its a yes or no no maybe  
So just be sure before you give it up to me  
Up to me give it up to me  
  
So you wanna play with magic  
Boy you should know whatcha falling for  
Baby do you dare to do this  
Cause Im coming atcha like a dark horse  
  
Are you ready for ready for  
A perfect storm a perfect storm  
Cause once youre mine once youre mine  
Theres no going back  
  
Shes a beast  
I call her Karma  
She eat your heart out  
Like Jeffrey Dahmer  
Be careful  
Try not to lead her on  
Shawtys heart was on steroids  
Cause her love was so strong  
  
You may fall in love  
When you meet her  
If you get the chance you better keep her  
She swears by it but if you break her heart  
She turn cold as a freezerfreezer  
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor  
She can be my Sleeping Beauty  
Im gon put her in a coma  
  
Woo Damn I think I love her  
Shawty so bad  
Im sprung and I dont care  
She got me like a roller coaster  
Turn the bedroom into a fair  
Her love is like a drug  
I was tryna hit it and quit it  
But lil mama so dope  
I messed around and got addicted  
  
So you wanna play with magic  
Boy you should know whatcha falling for  
Baby do you dare to do this  
Cause Im coming atcha like a dark horse  
  
Are you ready for ready for  
A perfect storm a perfect storm  
Cause once youre mine once youre mine  
Theres no going back
