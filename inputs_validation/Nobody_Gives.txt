I cant understand why everybodys quarreling  
Nobody gives in case they lose face  
And everybodys guilty and everybodys innocent  
And the fact of it is nobody gives any more  
Its the same throughout all history  
Nobody gives unless they receive  
And nobody trusts or is willing to believe  
And nobody gives or is willing to concede  
Back in nineteen hundred and twentyfive  
There were thousands of people struggling to survive  
There was hunger unemployment and poverty  
Then in 1926 they decided to be free  
So they all went on strike and  
The workers told the unions who blamed it on the government  
The politicians blamed it on the strikers and the militants  
Everybodys guilty and everybodys innocent  
But the fact of it is nobody gives any more  
Back in nineteen hundred and thirtynine  
There were scores of German military waiting in a line  
And the Fatherland wanted what the world wouldnt give  
And then Hitler decided he could take what was his  
So they all went to war and said  
Kill all the leftwing intellectuals  
Annihilate the Jews and wipe out their race  
Eliminate the weak because theyre ineffectual  
And the fact of it is nobody gives any more  
Im only sitting here watching it all go on  
And listening to both sides  
Yeah why cant we talk it out  
Why cant we sort it out  
Well work it out if we try  
Why cant we sit down and work out a compromise  
Why not negotiate and try to be civilised  
Ill tell you why because nobody gives a damn  
Nobody listens and no one will understand  
Yet Im wondering sitting here wondering  
And listening to both sides  
Why cant we work it out  
Why cant we sort it out  
Well work it out if we try  
Why cant we sit down and work out a compromise  
Why not negotiate and try to be civilized  
Ill tell you why because nobody gives a damn  
Nobody listens and no one will understand  
Yet Im wondering sitting here wondering  
Yet Im wondering sitting here wondering  
Listening to both sides  
Nobody gives nobody gives nobody gives  
The workers told the unions who blamed it on the government  
The politicians blamed it on the strikers and the militants  
Everybodys guilty and everybodys innocent  
Nobody gives Nobody gives a damn any more  
The politicians unions workers and the militants  
The fact of it is nobody gives any more
