Hark listen here he comes  
Hark listen here he comes  
Turning spinning Catherine wheeling  
For ever changing  
Theres no beginning  
Speeding through a charcoal sky  
Observe the truth we cannot hide  
  
Traveling eternity road  
What will you find there  
Carrying your heavy load  
Searching to find a piece of mind  
  
Youll see us all around  
Youll see us all around  
Turning spinning Catherine wheeling  
For ever changing  
Theres no beginning  
Youre so very far from home  
And so very much alone  
  
Traveling eternity road  
What will you find there  
Carrying your heavy load  
Searching to find a piece of mind  
  
Traveling eternity road  
What will you find there  
Carrying your heavy load  
Searching to find a piece of mind
