Weird world weird world  
Hey hey hey  
  
Theres silence over the city but its so noisy  
There is reason for looking up but Im feeling down  
You see Ive got to catch a plane wont buy a ticket  
Cause its hard to stop when youre spinning around  
  
Its a weird world dont you know it  
Its a weird world and it wont slow down  
Its a weird world no matter how you roll it  
  
Hey hey hey  
Sweet baby  
Theres a way just stand up and fight it  
Hey hey hey  
Never give up and dont let it wear out your love  
Its a weird world yea  
  
Sent a message to a GI in the desert  
Said thank you man for bringing another dawn  
Back here its her and me and were having our first baby  
Hes out there taking them on  
  
Its a weird world and I know you know it  
Its a weird world and it wont slow down  
Its a weird world no matter how you roll it  
  
Hey hey hey  
Sweet baby  
Theres a way just stand up and fight it  
Hey hey hey  
Never give up and dont let it wear out your love  
  
Im closing my eyes but Im starting to see  
While hes looking at you shes looking at me  
The only thing he does is just keep me away from you  
Cause youre part of this place  
But if I die dont let them take away your beautiful smile  
Take away your beautiful smile  
Take away your beautiful smile  
  
Hey hey hey  
Sweet baby  
Theres a way just stand up and fight it  
Hey hey hey sweet baby  
Theres a way for you to decide it  
Hey hey hey  
Never give up and dont let it wear out your love  
  
Hey hey hey  
Its a weird world dont you know it  
Hey hey hey  
Its a weird world dont you know it  
Hey hey hey  
Its a weird world dont you know it  
Hey hey hey
