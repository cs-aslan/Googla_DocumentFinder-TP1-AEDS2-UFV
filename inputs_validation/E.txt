E is for the comfort  
You give to me  
E is for the peace I feel inside  
E is for the good times  
That go against the bad times  
E is for the world you gave us  
And left us here behind  
They say  
Tell me whats so wrong with E  
Thats what I hear them say  
Tell me whats so wrong with E  
Thats what I hear them say  
Lets talk about it  
E is for the reason  
To live through urban grey  
E is for the warm glow  
That takes the fear away  
Show us what is better  
Why dont you stand inside  
these shoes  
Oh live with me each Monday  
Lets see what you would do  
Which world do you live in  
Which world did you choose  
Hiding the tears thats all  
No win  
No lose  
They say  
Tell me whats so wrong with E  
Thats what I hear them say  
Tell me whats so wrong with E  
Thats what I hear them say  
Lets talk about it
