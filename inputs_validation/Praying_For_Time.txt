These are the days of the open hand  
They will not be the last  
Look around now  
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers  
  
This is the year of the hungry man  
Whose place is in the past  
Hand in hand with ignorance  
And legitimate excuses  
  
The rich declare themselves poor  
And most of us are not sure  
If we have too much  
But well take our chances  
Because gods stopped keeping score  
I guess somewhere along the way  
He must have let us alt out to play  
Turned his back and all gods children  
Crept out the back door  
  
And its hard to love theres so much to hate  
Hanging on to hope  
When there is no hope to speak of  
And the wounded skies above say its much too late  
Well maybe we should all be praying for time  
  
These are the days of the empty hand  
Oh you hold on to what you can  
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year  
  
This is the year of the guilty man  
Your television takes a stand  
And you find that what was over there is over here  
  
So you scream from behind your door  
Say whats mine is mine and not yours  
I may have too much but ill take my chances  
Because gods stopped keeping score  
And you cling to the things they sold you  
Did you cover your eyes when they told you  
  
That he cant come back  
Beacuse he has no children to come back for  
  
Its hard to love theres so much to hate  
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of  
And the wounded skies above say its much too late  
So maybe we should all be praying for time
