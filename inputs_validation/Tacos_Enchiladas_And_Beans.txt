From the snowcapped mountains to the coral shores  
Youre the only one my heart adores  
Youve only got three competitors  
Tacos enchiladas and beans  
  
From the Mississippi to the Amazon  
Theres not much we dont agree upon  
Wish we could get together on  
Tacos enchiladas and beans  
  
Love em dozens of em  
I consume them by the score  
And when Im through what do I do  
I stamp and holler for more  
  
You can have the fourth position on my list  
Must admit your kisses would be missed  
But how in the world could I exist  
Without tacos enchiladas and beans  
  
Repeat from the top  
They make me kind of sick  
But I love them
