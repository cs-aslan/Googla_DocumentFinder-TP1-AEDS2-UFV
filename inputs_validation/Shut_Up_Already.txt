Affection not dissection  
Meat is murder  
Animals are for petting  
Oh shut the fuck up already  
  
Im tired of you whining  
About poor little animals dying  
And the food they are supplying  
Because if a big animal had the chance  
It wouldnt take another glance  
It would eat you up  
  
Affection not dissection  
Meat is murder  
Animals are for petting  
Oh shut your trap already  
  
I dont want to listen  
And Im tired of your bitchin  
About whats in my kitchen  
Because if a big animal had the chance  
It wouldnt take another glance  
It will eat you up
