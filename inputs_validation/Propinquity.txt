Ive known for a long time  
The kind of girl you are  
And a smile that covers teardrops  
The way your head yields to your heart  
Of things youve kept inside  
That most girls couldnt bear  
Well Ive known you for a long time  
But Ive just begun to care  
Yes Ive known of all the heartaches  
And Ive known of all the pain  
Ive seen you when the the sun shines  
And Ive seen you when it rains  
Ive seen you make a look of love  
From just an icy stare  
Well Ive known you for a long time  
But Ive just begun to care  
I know Ive been blind  
To not have loved you all this time  
To not have loved you all this time  
But the image of you wasnt clear  
I guess Ive been standing too near  
Its taken me a while  
But I have finally found  
What you are to me  
And thats what really counts  
And what you are to me  
Is something we can share  
Well Ive known you for a long time  
But Ive just begun to care  
Yes Ive known you for a long time  
But Ive just begun to care
