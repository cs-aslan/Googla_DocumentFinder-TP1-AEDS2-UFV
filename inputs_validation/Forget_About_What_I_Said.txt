We used to tear it down  
But now we just exist  
The things that I did wrong  
Ill bet youve got a list  
  
Now I know how you remember  
And those moments that you choose  
Will define me as a traitor  
Stealing everything you lose  
  
Forget about what I said  
The lights are gone and the partys over  
Forget about what I said  
Forget about what I said  
Im older now and I know you hear me  
Forget about what I said  
  
Youll stay up late tonight  
Youll turn off your phone  
Well you were selfish too  
But you were never all alone  
In those ugly pink apartments  
With the hustlers and the kids  
Mapping out some retribution  
Do we have to go through this  
  
Forget about what I said  
The lights are gone and the partys over  
Forget about what I said  
Forget about what I said  
Im older now and I know you hear me  
Forget about what I said  
  
All of the stars are wandering around tonight  
We used to try them on  
And sometimes I hear you  
The galaxy sings your song  
And tonight I sing along  
  
Forget about what I said  
The lights are gone and the partys over  
Forget about what I said  
Forget about what I said  
Im older now and I know you hear me  
Forget about what I said  
  
Forget about what I said  
The lights are gone and the partys over  
Forget about what I said  
Forget about what I said  
Im older now and I know you hear me  
Forget about what I said  
  
Forget about what I said  
The lights are gone and the partys over  
Forget about what I said  
Forget about what I said  
Im older now and I know you hear me  
Forget about what I said
