Wahwah  
Youve given me a wahwah  
And Im thinking of you  
And all the things that we used to do  
Wahwah wahwah  
Wahwah  
You made me such a big star  
Being there at the right time  
Cheaper than a dime  
Wahwah youve given me your  
Wahwah wahwah  
Oh you dont see me crying  
Oh you dont hear me sighing  
Wahwah  
I dont need no wahwah  
And I know how sweet life can be  
If I keep myself free wahwah  
I dont need no wahwah  
Oh you dont see me crying  
Hey baby you dont hear me sighing  
Oh no no no no  
Wahwah  
Now I dont need no wahwahs  
And I know how sweet life can be  
If I keep myself free of wahwah  
I dont need no wahwah  
Wahwah wahwah wahwah  
Wahwah wahwah wahwah  
Wahwah wahwah
