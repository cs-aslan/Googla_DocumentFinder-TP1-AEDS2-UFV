You cant control me tell me what to do  
Chained in mediocrity so I can be like you  
Im not a statue not part of a machine  
Im sick and tired of the whole routine  
Calculate your future computerize your past  
Instant replay if its gone too fast  
Take away my freedom take away my home  
Im only human but it might no show  
Im not made of stone  
  
Im a freedom fighter I got something to say  
Im a freedom fighter get out of my way  
Hide behind your politics hide behind your rules  
Tell me Im a man but you treat me like a fool  
Its the same old story with a different name  
You give us all a number and nothing changes  
Out in the winter of a world upon its knees  
Everyone is watching but noone sees  
You cant take my freedom you know it is my right  
If you try and stop me Im gonna fight  
With all of my might  
  
Im a freedom fighter and Im taking command  
Im a freedom fighter and Im making a stand  
  
Fighting for breath as the world gathers speed  
Times running out for the things that I need  
  
Im a freedom fighter I gotta make a stand  
Im a freedom fighter yeah Thats what I am  
Im a freedom fighter I cant take it no more  
Im a freedom fighter no no more  
Im a freedom fighter but Im not afraid  
Im a freedom fighter get out of my way
