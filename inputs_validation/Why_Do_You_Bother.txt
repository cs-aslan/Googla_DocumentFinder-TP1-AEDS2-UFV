Why hold on  
Your hands are getting sore  
You must be scared of something  
From the time before well  
Were here again  
How long who knows  
Its not your right to tell me  
Where this trip will go  
Pull away  
Youre dying today  
You could enjoy it  
If you could take your feelings with you  
But put your mind on me  
And suck my energy  
And see the speed gets higher  
I see you hold on tighter  
  
But just fatigue  
Is all your face will show  
Its weary from the stress  
Getting delirious  
I didnt want this race  
We cant keep up this pace  
We dont want to get well  
We want to go to hell  
We want an urban dream  
The fucking urban scream  
This time was mine to borrow  
Ill pay for it tomorrow  
Youll pay for it today  
And as we drive away  
Ill make my pleasure greater  
Push the accelerator  
  
and down we go
