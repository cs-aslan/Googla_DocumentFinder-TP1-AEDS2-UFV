Mad trees and bitches in dungarees  
The city under seas kitchen 100 degrees  
I love that summer breeze Ill stand in it until it freeze  
Im from another breed them sss southern gs  
I sip phemetrazine I lean I stand tall  
Im mean Im mad raw Im coming like fastball  
Steeerike Yup so get it right  
Nigga one of my snipletsll end your whole life  
You aint nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife  
In a fork Im a pig myself I eat schwork  
So be smart and play your own part  
If you dont love yourself Ill make you see your own heart  
And we dont like the narcs stay away from the cell  
Hey Ima shoot it out if Im facing the ail  
Yea so tell your girl to come and make me rich  
Weezy Baby nigga 9 to 5 10 to 6  
  
All night I cant sleep I toss and turn  
Got my hand on my pistol when will these motherfuckers learn  
Watch it I aint going out without a fight  
Im with whatever and I aint going out without a fight  
Im with whatever and I aint going out without a fight  
Im with whatever Itd be your life before my life  
At night I cant sleep I toss and turn  
Got my hand on my pistol when will these motherfuckers learn  
  
Verse 2 Juelz Santana  
Its showdown time throwdown time  
Same doff four pound time  
Clack Clack go get yours Ill go get mine  
Check it man Im wit whatever  
Goodness gracious the paper  
Where the cash at Where the stash at  
Ill blow that ass back for fronting on a nigga like me  
You got nothing on a nigga like me youll see  
Im on the grind from sun up to sun down  
If Im lying may lightning come down and strike me right now  
Ill turn a dollar to a twenty to a fifty to a hundred  
Keep it coming til Im full on my stomach  
Im stuck in my ways Im stuck puffing my hase  
Hand on my pistol front of it sprays  
Im stuck living the life of a ghetto nigga  
Trying to get rid of the life alright  
  
All night I cant sleep I toss and turn  
Got my hand on my pistol when will these motherfuckers learn  
Watch it I aint going out without a fight  
Im with whatever and I aint going out without a fight  
Im with whatever and I aint going out without a fight  
Im with whatever Itd be your life before my life  
At night I cant sleep I toss and turn  
Got my hand on my pistol when will these motherfuckers learn
