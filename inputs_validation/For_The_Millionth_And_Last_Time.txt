For the millionth and the last time  
Darling let me hold you tight  
One more kiss and then I promise  
I will say my last goodnight  
  
Though your lips are so inviting  
And I know Ill wanna stay  
Give me one more kiss to dream on  
And Ill be on my way  
  
It seems a million or so kisses ago  
We said goodnight at your door  
I didnt get far cause here we are  
And Im still begging for more  
  
Whilst the millionth and the last time  
Slowly disappears from sight  
For the millionth and the last time  
Let me kiss you goodnight  
  
It seems a million or so kisses ago  
We said goodnight at your door  
I didnt get far cause here we are  
And Im still begging for more  
  
Whilst the millionth and the last time  
Slowly disappears from sight  
For the millionth and the last time  
Let me kiss you goodnight  
Let me kiss you goodnight  
Let me kiss you goodnight
