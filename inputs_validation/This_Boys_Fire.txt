I believe in never let my strip get hotter  
Than something I can get out of  
One that heats up on me  
I told em this would be a once time dance  
Meaning one time chance  
After I said that oh  
Thats when he got close to me  
All the other music stopped but the violin  
Conversation one dance sip a bottle of the best  
Now Im asking myself what has he done to me  
  
This cant turn into love no  
The rose petals were all in the air  
Just might need that firetruck  
To come and get me  
  
Chorus  
Dip me in water  
Cause this boys fire  
Its got a hold of me  
Cant say I dont want it  
Cause he really put it on me  
In a way that I dont know  
If Im going or coming  
Dip me in water  
Cause this boys fire  
Its got a hold of me  
Didnt have to know from your body  
Put it on me  
Not just physically but mentally andale on me  
  
Gotta call a cab  
If I dont need gonna have me  
With every young stunna in the hood wanna have me  
Uh so much of him I couldnt surrender  
Cause I know where this could end up  
And with that right now I cant play  
I know I drive him loco  
But thats just the way  
You make a mamas hips go  
  
This cant turn into love no  
The rose petals were all in the air  
Just might need that firetruck  
To come and get me  
  
Chorus
