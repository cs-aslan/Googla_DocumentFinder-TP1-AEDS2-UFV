Some people call me the space cowboy  
Some call me the gangster love  
And some people call me Maurice  
Cause I speak of the competence of love  
Well people talkin about me baby  
They say Im doing wrong Im doing wrong  
Dont you worry dont you worry dont you worry dirty mama  
Cause Im right here right here right here right here headin home  
  
Im a picker Im a grinner Im a lover and Im a sinner  
I play my music in the sun  
Im a joker Im a smoker Im a midnight toker  
I get my lovin on the run  
  
You sheltered me from harm  
Kept me warm kept me warm  
You gave my love to me  
Set me free set me free  
The finest years I ever knew  
Were all the years I had with you  
  
People talking about me baby  
They say Im doing Im doing Im doing you all wrong  
Dont you worry dont you worry mama  
Right here right here right home  
  
Is there someone you know  
Youre lovin them so  
But taken them all for granted  
You may lose them one day  
Someone takes them away  
And they dont hear the words you long to say  
  
Im a picker Im a grinner Im a lover a sinner  
I play my music in the sun I play my music in the sun  
Im a joker a smoker and Im a midnight toker  
She dont wanna hurt no one  
  
Some people call me the space cowboy  
Some call the gangster love  
And some people call me Maurice  
Cause I speak the competence of love  
I speak the competence  
Cause I speak of love once again
