Sexual harassment  nuclear reactors  
Natural disasters from here to LA  
Drug importers  
New World Order  
Wars over borders  
Murder on the subway  
  
The social classes  high rise of taxes  
Diplomats are passive with a promise again  
  
Talk of recession  people in depression  
Dow Jones bank loans the Japanese yen  
  
Chorus 1  
I wait for Kingdom come  
When love will be here to stay  
It will change us everyone  
Someday someday  
  
Violence in the movies  
Driveby shootings  
Rioting and looting  
With the boys in the hood  
  
Cults and religions  
Deadly premonitions  
Fiery oppositions  
Evil battling good  
  
AIDS awareness  
Temporary marriage  
Prolife prochoice  
Roe v Wade  
  
Ethics and the media  
Tabloid TV  
The Kennedy Conspiracy  
The Trial of OJ  
  
Chorus 2  
I wait for Kingdom come  
When love will be here to stay  
It will change us everyone  
Someday someday  
There peace will make a stand  
and the anger will fall away  
Well see the lion with the lamb  
Someday someday someday  
  
Chorus 2
