Hummed intro  
  
The harbor lights were shining  
The moon was at its high  
The captain said Thank God were home  
Weve drunk the barrels dry  
The mizzen mast was shaken  
And the lanterns all burned low  
Id never thought wed make it  
But weve twenty leagues to go  
So blow you southern trades  
And guide me safely to the shore  
Ill never ever gonna sail  
The seven seas no more  
  
CHORUS  
I dont want to miss the sand in my hair  
The roll of the tide and the salt in the air  
Deep inside its true  
Im a home lovin man  
Comin on home to you  
I dont want to miss the wind in my eyes  
The shimmerin light when the seagull flies  
Lo Ive traveled far  
Im a home loving man  
Home is where you are  
  
The crowd upon the quayside  
Their faces long and drawn  
Are suddenly awakened  
As we sail in on the dawn  
The wives the sons the lovers  
Who never gave up hope  
All breathe a sigh together  
As they reach to catch the rope  
  
God bless you southern trades  
You got me safely back this time  
Oh youll never have the need again  
To save this soul of mine  
  
CHORUS  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
Yes I dont want to miss the sand in my hair  
The roll of the tides and the salt in the air  
Deep inside its true  
Im a home lovin man  
Comin on home to you  
  
FADE
