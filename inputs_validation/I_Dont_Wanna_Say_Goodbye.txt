I dont want to say goodbye  
I dont want to be alone  
I give you one more chance to say how much you want me back  
Oh Ill give you one more chance to say that this time it will last until  
That death will do us part  
  
So we can find peace in our hearts  
Oh I give you one more chance to say youre sorry  
And that you love me cause  
  
Chorus  
I dont want to be alone  
I dont want to be apart again  
I dont want to say goodbye again  
I dont want a broken heart  
I dont want to be hurt again  
I dont want to say goodbyeagain  
  
I give you one more chance to prove that youre the one for me  
I give you one more chance but this time you will have to  
Work hard for a man with dignity  
Youll have to earn my trust you see  
I give you one more chance to say youre sorry  
And that you love me  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Do you understand  
All the pain you caused  
When you cheated on me  
Baby  
So swear to god  
And promise me  
That it will never ever  
Happen again  
Cause I still love you  
  
Chorus x2
