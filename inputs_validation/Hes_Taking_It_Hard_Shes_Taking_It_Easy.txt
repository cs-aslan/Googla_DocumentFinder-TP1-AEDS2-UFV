Hes taking it hard shes taking it easy  
Shes living it up and hes living it down  
Hes walking the floor looking for answers  
Shes out on the floor all over town  
  
Aint that the way that love goes when love goes to pieces  
Aint that the truth when you find out youre living a lie  
Aint love the reason we both took a chance on each other  
Aint it each other we both swore we wanted to try  
  
Hes taking it hard shes taking it easy  
Shes drying her eyes but his are still wet  
He wishes he could just hold her until she remembers  
She wishes she could find someone to make her forget  
Hes taking it hard shes taking it easy
