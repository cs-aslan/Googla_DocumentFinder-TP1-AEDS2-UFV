Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor  
And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure  
He had a thing about a quarter to four  
And he just couldnt handle any more  
Hes got his own big dipper so he wont be needing your big dipper  
Hes got his own big dipper and he wont be needing yours  
  
So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him  
And you took him down to the fairground after some action  
And by around about a quarter to six  
You found a different way to get your kicks  
Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks  
Big dipper  
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks  
  
He hadnt been too keen at the start  
Now he seems to have a change of heart  
Hes got his own big dipper  
Only now hes not so sure big dipper  
Hes got his own big dipper  
But theres always room for more  
  
Everybodys got a song to sing  
Everybodys got to do their thing big dipper big dipper  
  
And at around about a quarter to ten  
You got up and did it all again  
Hes got his own big dipper and now he knows just what its for  
Big dipper  
Hes got his own big dipper but hes got his eye on yours  
  
Another ride another tune  
Another crazy afternoon  
Another reason for squeezing your big dipper
