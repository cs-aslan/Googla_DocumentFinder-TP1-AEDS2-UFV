In the justle and grind workin nine to nine  
Losin my mind watchin Father Time  
Its the same ole same this ball and chain  
With only one day to ease my pain  
Cause Mondays just a bitch  
Tuesdays such a bother  
Wednesdays like watchin dead flowers grow  
Thursday aint for shit  
Fridays getting hotter  
But on Saturday night you know  
We let it rock  
And keep the drinks pourin  
We let it roll  
Until the early morning  
Were underpaid but we still give tanks and praise  
God bless Saturday  
They tell me Im livin the American dream  
Just workin for the man  
But fifty two hours in a stamping plant  
Sometimes I dont understand  
Cause Mondays just a bitch  
Tuesdays such a bother  
Wednesdays like watchin dead flowers grow  
Thursday aint for shit  
Fridays getting hotter  
But on Saturday night you know  
We let it rock  
And keep the drinks pourin  
We let it roll  
Until the early morning  
Were underpaid but we still give thanks and praise  
God bless Saturday
