Two hearts  
Throwing off sparks  
Young and in love with  
Our freedom  
Moonlight  
Those soft southern nights  
We were both ripe to fall  
  
I was  
Out on my own  
Playing for all who  
Would listen  
You were  
As free as a bird  
Flying from nest to nest  
  
But somewhere our eyes met  
And our hands reached out  
And we felt a kindred spirit  
And as our faces touched  
I could feel the fire  
And needed so to just  
Be near it  
  
Oh lord  
Those moments we soared  
Borne on the wings of  
Our passion  
It seemed then  
Like theyd never end  
But times like that  
Always must  
  
cause then one day I flew  
Far away from you  
I never knew how Id regret it  
My sweet magnolia belle  
You know Ive loved you well  
Even if I never said it  
  
Magnolia now I see  
That freedom isnt free  
And loves the only true  
Redeemer  
And when this journeys  
Through  
Ill be coming back for you  
If youll have this  
Foolish dreamer  
  
I spend  
A night now and then  
Passing through town on  
My travels  
But someday  
Im gonna come back to stay  
Magnolia Im coming home
