Catch the elevator from the penthouse suite  
And take it down to the casino  
The God almighty sound of money moving round  
Can be heard all the way to Reno  
  
Chorus  
  
Well its midnight and Im not famous yet  
Trying to win it all with one more bet  
Nothing can stop my thirtytwo hop  
Or my ten dollar yoyoyo  
Its midnight and Im just getting ready to go  
Lester Polyester signs another marker  
Like the high rollers do  
Seven come eleven  
His brand new baby needs Gucci shoes  
Well its midnight and shes not famous yet  
  
Trying to break the bank with one more bet  
Nothing can stop my thirtytwo hop  
Or my ten dollar yoyoyo  
Its midnight and Lesters getting ready to roll  
  
Theyre paging someone we know  
Lester hits a Keno  
Hes not leaving yet  
Vacuum cleaners humming lounge act still is strumming  
Its their twenty fourth set  
Well its midnight and theyre not famous yet  
Trying to win with one last bet  
Nothing can stop my thirtytwo hop  
Or my ten dollar yoyoyo  
Its midnight got nowhere to go
