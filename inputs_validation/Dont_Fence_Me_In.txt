Oh give me land lots of land under starry skies above dont fence me in  
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love dont fence me in  
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze  
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees  
Send me out forever but I ask you please dont fence me in  
Just turn me loose let me straddle my old saddle underneath the western skies  
On my cayuse let me wander over yonder till I see the mountains rise  
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences  
Gaze at the moon until I lose my senses  
Cant look at hubbles and I cant stand fences dont fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose  
Dont fence me in dont fence me in
