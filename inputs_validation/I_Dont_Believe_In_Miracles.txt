I walk along the road and past your door  
Then I remember things you said  
I know in time we couldve been so much more  
But if you wanna come back home go right ahead  
But I dont believe in miracles  
I dont believe in miracles  
But I thought you might show your face  
Or have the grace to tell me where you are  
I believe I was your game your ball your ball  
If you tossed me up then I would fall  
And so youve won again ah you win them all  
But I believe Id run to you if you should call  
But I dont believe in miracles dont believe in miracles  
I dont believe in miracles dont believe in miracles  
But I thought you might show your face  
Or have the grace to tell me where you are tell me where you are  
I believe that somewhere theres someone  
Whos gonna light the way when things go wrong  
The bullet that shot me down came from your gun  
The words that turned me round were from your song  
But I dont believe in miracles dont believe in miracles  
I dont believe in miracles dont believe in miracles  
But I thought you might show your face  
Or have the grace to tell me where you are tell me where you are  
But I dont believe in miracles dont believe in miracles  
I dont believe in miracles dont believe in miracles  
But I thought you might show your face  
Or have the grace to tell me where you are
