Johnny saw her riding on a street car named Desire his fate was sealed  
She could see him coming like a hundred other liars it was no big deal  
Rosa had a lover on the shady side of town Tito he was king of the streets  
She was his possession like a jewel on his crown Johnny better run better
run  
Chorus  
Better hide your heart better hold on tight  
Say your prayers cause theres trouble tonight  
When pride and love battle with desire  
Better hide your heart cause youre playing with fire  
  
The ride was over but the story doesnt end he took her heart  
She looked him in the eye and said they couldnt meet again  
You could see the trouble start  
The word went out that Rosas messin with someone it was on the street  
Tito looked for Johnny with a vengeance and a gun  
Johnny better run better run  
  
Chorus  
  
Johnnys holdin Rosa on a rooftop in the night as time stood still  
They couldnt hear him coming til he had them both in sight  
You could feel a chill  
A shot ran out like thunder and the blood was on her hands with nothing won  
When someone lies dying lovers finally understand  
  
Chorus
