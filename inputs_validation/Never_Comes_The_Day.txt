Work away today work away tomorrow  
Never comes the day for my love and me  
I feel her gently sighing as the evening slips away  
If only you knew whats inside of me now  
You wouldnt want to know me somehow  
But  
You will love me tonight  
We alone will be alright  
In the end  
  
Give just a little bit more  
Take a little bit less  
From each other tonight  
Admit what youre feeling  
And see whats in front of you  
Its never out of your sight  
You know its true  
We all know that its true  
  
Work away today think about tomorrow  
Never comes the day for my love and me  
I feel her gently sighing as the evening slips away  
If only you knew whats inside of me now  
You wouldnt want to know me somehow  
But  
You will love me tonight  
We alone will be alright  
In the end  
  
Give just a little bit more  
Take a little bit less  
From each other tonight  
Admit what youre feeling  
And see whats in front of you  
Its never out of your sight  
You know its true  
We all know that its true
