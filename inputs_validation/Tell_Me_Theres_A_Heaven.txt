The little girl she said to me  
What are these things that I can see  
Each night when I come home from school  
And mama calls me in for tea  
  
Oh every night a baby dies  
And every night a mama cries  
What makes those men do what they do  
To make that person black and blue  
  
Grandpa says their happy now  
They sit with God in paradise  
With angels wings and still somehow  
It makes me feel like ice  
  
Tell me theres a heaven  
Tell me that its true  
Tell me theres a reason  
Why Im seeing what I do  
  
Tell me theres a heaven  
Where all those people go  
Tell me theyre all happy now  
Papa tell me that its so  
  
So do I tell her that its true  
That theres a place for me and you  
Where hungry children smile and say  
We wouldnt have no other way  
  
That every painful crack of bones  
Is a step along the way  
Every wrong done is a game plan  
To that great and joyful day  
  
And Im looking at the father and the son  
And Im looking at the mother and the daughter  
And Im watching them in tears of pain  
And Im watching them suffer  
  
Dont tell that little girl  
Tell me  
Tell me theres a heaven  
Tell me that its true  
Tell me theres a reason  
Why Im seeing what I do  
  
Tell me theres a heaven  
Where all those people go  
Tell me theyre all happy now  
Papa tell me that its so
