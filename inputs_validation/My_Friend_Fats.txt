My friend Fats hes a hell of a guy  
Let me tell you why  
Hes the epitome of neighborly  
  
My friend Fats hes a hell of a guy  
Let me tell yall why  
He drips personality  
  
My friend Fats hes a heck of a Joe  
You should watch him go  
Bopping in the band shine  
With a bota bag of fried wine  
  
My friend Fats hes a hell of a guy  
Let me tell you why  
Hes lowbrow nobility  
  
My friend Fats hes a jovial sort  
When hes holding court  
The anecdotes go round  
And the lager goes down  
  
My friend Fats hes a hell of a guy  
And just as long as hes high  
He has no anxiety  
About his chemical dependencies  
  
Fats has no concerns  
About the candle that burns  
Both ends simultaneous  
Both ends simultaneous  
  
My friend Fats hes a hell of a guy  
Let me tell yall why  
Not much for punctuality  
But heck on debauchery  
  
Fats hes a hell of a man  
Cant yall understand  
Him taunting his mortality  
Hes unnerved by sobriety
