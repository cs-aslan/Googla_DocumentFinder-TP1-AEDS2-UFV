I know its over cause I dont keep you satisfied anymore  
  
But before you move along let me sing you the last love song  
  
Tomorrow when Ill wake what will take the place  
  
Of smiles on your face and black hair against white lace  
  
And I wonder if Ill be thinking of our early morning love  
  
All the sweet things that youd say thats brighten up my darkest day  
  
And tomorrow night what do use the chest to take the place of your breast  
  
Breast against my chest oh how Ill miss your tenderness but theres no use to
cryin  
  
Cause loves a grown up game a little pleasure then a lot of pain  
  
First we call each other bad names then what we have was never quite the same  
  
I wish I could find eyes that wont cry lips that wont lie and love that
wont die  
  
Hmm hmm hmm hm and a love that wont die
