Whenever Im with you  
Something inside starts burning  
And Im filled with fire  
  
Stop this its got a hold on me  
I said this aint the way its supposed to be  
  
Its like a heatwave burning in my heart  
Its like a heatwave  
I cant keep from crying  
Heatwave  
Tearing me apart  
  
Whenever he calls my name  
Sounds so soft sweet and plain  
I feel this burning pain  
This high blood pressures got a hold on me  
Is this the way loves supposed to be  
  
Its like a heatwave burning in my heart  
Its like a heatwave  
I cant keep from crying  
Heatwave  
Tearing me apart  
  
Ooh ooh heatwave  
Ooh ooh heatwave  
Ah ah ah ah  
  
So Im starin into space  
Tears all over my face  
I cant explain it  
Dont understand it  
I aint never felt like this before  
  
Well that funny feeling has me amazed  
I dont know what to do  
My heads in a haze  
I got the heatwave
