Youre a single mom with three kids and just as many jobs  
Your candle burns at both ends but you cant make it stop  
Your a farmer on a John Deer honest work for little pay  
Now throw that thing in park its time to play  
  
Chorus  
Like its midnight in Vegas  
Mardi Gras in New Orleans  
New Years Eve in New York City  
You know what I mean  
Its like lovers in Paris Sunset Strip in LA  
Doesnt matter where you are  
Well its alright its alright to play  
  
Oh yes it is  
  
Where there aint no drugs or doctors  
Who can get you what you need  
Ive got the magic potion  
And it doesnt cost a thing  
Yeah youve seen some hard times  
Life just works out that way  
When your smack dab in the middle  
You gotta play  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey hey  
  
Like a kiss in the moonlight  
Barefoot walks on the beach  
Like sipping Champagne straight from a bottle  
You know what I mean  
  
Chorus  
  
Its alright to play its alright its alright its alright to play yeah its
alright  
Come on come on come on  
Its alright to play its alright to play its alright its alright its
alright to play  
Its alright to play yeah its alright to play its alright its alright its
alright to play  
Yeah its alright to play its alright to play yeah its alright its alright

Well its alright its alright well its alright alright to play
