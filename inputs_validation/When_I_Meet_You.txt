There I was an empty piece of a shell  
Just mindin my own world  
Without even knowin  
What love and life were all about  
  
Then you came  
You brought me out of the shell  
You gave the world to me  
And before I knew  
There I was so in love with you  
  
You gave me a reason for my being  
And I love what Im feelin  
You gave me a meaning to my life  
Yes Ive gone beyond existing  
And it all began when I met you  
  
I love the touch of your hair  
And when I look in your eyes  
I just know I know Im on to something good  
And Im sure my love for you will endure  
Your love will light up my world  
And take all my cares away  
With the aching part of me  
  
You gave me a reason for my being  
And I love what Im feelin  
You gave me a meaning to my life  
Yes Ive gone beyond existing  
And it all began when I met you  
  
You taught me how to love  
You showed me how tomorrow and today  
My life is diffrent from the yesterday  
And you you taught me how to love  
And darling I will always cherish you  
Today tomorrow and forever  
  
And Im sure when evening comes around  
I know well be making love like never before  
My love who could ask for more  
  
You gave me a reason for my being  
And I love what Im feelin  
You gave me a meaning to my life  
Yes Ive gone beyond existing  
And it all began when I met you  
When I met you  
  
You gave me a reason for my being  
And I love what Im feelin  
You gave me a meaning to my life  
Yes Ive gone beyond existing  
And it all began when I met you  
When I met you  
When I met you
