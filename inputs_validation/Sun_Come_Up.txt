Sun come up in the morning  
Blues round my head  
Ive got a troubled mind and plenty of time to roam  
As I walk this crooked highway  
Never knowin where to go  
You know the only life I know is bein on the road  
  
Ive got holes in my shoes that I fill with paper  
When the suns out they dry  
And when it rains well they get wet but I dont cry  
  
Because the sun dont know no difference  
Between a rich man and a bum  
And the only life I know is movin round the sky  
  
See him grin down at you people  
I guess you dont know what his laughters from  
But if you spend enough time on the road  
Maybe youd find out  
Because the sun goes round in an endless circle  
Never knowin the reason why  
Still theres something in the path that it traces round the sky  
Its like a circle with no ending  
But its a race we all must run  
And its the same bein a rich man or a bum
