I work my fingers to the bone  
Just trying to keep up with the Jones  
You call me on the telephone  
Say baby hurry hurry home  
  
Pour me a little splash of red  
You look like you could raise the dead  
Have you got something on your mind  
Come on girl were wasting time  
  
Chorus  
Just let your body do the talking  
Dont let the words get in the way  
Yeah I can tell the way youre walking  
That you got nothing left to say  
  
Aint gonna watch the evening news  
Cause I dont care whos shooting who  
Youre putting on my favorite shoes  
About to do that thing you do  
  
Ah lets do it all night long  
Cause in the morning Ill be gone  
If everything works out all right  
Same place same time tomorrow night  
  
Chorus  
  
Aint got nothin to say  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah I can tell the way youre walking  
That you got nothing left to say  
Nothin baby
