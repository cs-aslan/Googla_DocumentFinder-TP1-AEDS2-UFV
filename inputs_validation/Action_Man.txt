Willie said he was the mostest horse  
A  desert mamas boy  
Running in first neither crowned nor cursed  
He tears away like a child takes his toy  
  
Side by side souls of kind different world  
Hearts of gold limbs of steel ManOfWar  
  
Oh place your bets boys get up get in time  
Burn the bolts you aint seen nothin yet  
Maybe back at that old Kentucky home  
That it was luck hell catch him if he can  
  
Fire inside blaze of glory space in time  
Heart of gold limbs of steel ManOfWar  
  
Oh Saratoga  
Ooo play your favorite  
Odds are more than one hundred  
Oh Willie said  
Ooo Saratoga  
  
Nowhere nowhere to run  
 gonna take the highest prize  
Were hardly funnin now little children  
Hes workin it now never never look back  
  
Fire inside blaze of glory space in time  
Heart of gold limbs of steel ManOfWar  
  
Side by side souls of kind different world  
Hearts of gold limbs of steel ManOfWar
