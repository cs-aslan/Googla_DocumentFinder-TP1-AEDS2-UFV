My heart fell to the floor  
The night you broke the news  
Said you couldnt feel it anymore  
Those words that rolled off your tongue  
Tore my world in two  
As you turned and walked on out the door  
Ive been trying to get over you  
And get on with my life  
But the more I do without you  
The more I realize  
  
I cant love you any less no matter how I try  
You left me with a feeling that just wont seem to die  
And its killing me knowing Ill never hold you like before  
I dont love you any less  
You dont love me anymore  
  
Well girl I hope you never feel  
The way I feel tonight  
Its a hopeless kind of pain  
Well Im not even comin close  
To gettin over you  
Feels like its never gonna end  
So why do I keep hangin on  
And wastin my time  
Wish I could let you go  
But this old heart of mine  
  
Cant love you any less no matter how I try  
You left me with a feeling that just wont seem to die  
And its killing me knowing Ill never hold you like before  
I dont love you any less  
You dont love me anymore  
  
Girl I dont love you any less  
You dont love me anymore
