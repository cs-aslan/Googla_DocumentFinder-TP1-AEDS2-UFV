Though our paths in life have parted  
You no longer care for me  
But when youre happy with another  
Wont you sometimes think of me  
  
When the evenin sun is sinking  
Down behind the trees  
And the moon is slowly rising  
Wont you sometimes think of me  
  
Ill always keep your picture  
It means so much to me  
And every night Ill pray dear  
That youll sometimes think of me  
  
Think of days that are gone dear  
Days we could recall  
If you would only try dear  
But still you blame me for all  
  
When the evenin sun is sinking  
Down behind the trees  
And the moon is slowly rising  
Wont you sometimes think of me  
  
All I can says I tried dear  
But you wouldnt let it be  
So if youre ever sad and lonely  
Wont you sometimes think of me  
  
When the evenin sun is sinking  
Down behind the trees  
And the moon is slowly rising  
Wont you sometimes think of me
