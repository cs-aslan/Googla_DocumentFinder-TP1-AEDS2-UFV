I want to break free with my heart  
With my soul with my hands  
Ill do it all with my hands  
With my theres a way  
Oh theres a way  
Oh theres a way  
Life is hardand beautiful  
Thats why I wanna break free  
When its hard I break the ice  
When its nice it burns fire  
Oh burning fire  
Oh burning fire  
I was gone and I was dreaming  
That nobody liked me anymore  
All alone and under the water I knew  
My heart was still there  
I want to dance free till I fly  
With my soul with my hands  
I wont stop smiling for my treasure  
Family and me  
Oh burning fire
