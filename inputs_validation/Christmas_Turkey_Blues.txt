Hey kid why the long face  
Is it cause Santa Clause is flying right over your place  
Youve been a bad kid all year  
So quit you snivellin sucker and wipe up them tears  
You dont deserve a damn thing  
Youre not even cute and your attitude stinks  
It must suck to be you  
Nobody likes you so what can you do  
You think you got problems kid you think you got strife  
But come each December do you fear for your life  
Im your turkey so your troubles are small  
Im stuffed on your table Im a tasty butterball  
Ive got the christmas turkey blues  
If you got your necked ripped out then youd have them too  
Ive got the christmas turkey blues  
You chase me and waste and baste me and taste me and drown me in gravy too  
You sir you look like heck  
Didnt you get your Christmas bonus cheque  
Or maybe your woman left you  
Ripped your heart right out of your chest and spat on it too  
Is that why youre wreaking of gin  
You look dishevelled and theres drool on your chin  
You thought that this love would laugh  
But she said Merry Christmas baby and she booted your ass  
Well thats tough for you mister too bad about your ordeal  
How about getting stuffed in the wintertime see how you feel  
I dont get to yank no bones or make me a wish  
It wont be long til Im just some scraps on a dish  
Ive got the christmas turkey blues  
If your butt was stuffed and roasted then youd have then too  
Ive got the christmas turkey blues  
You chase me and waste and baste me and taste me and drown me in gravy too
