Ray Park  
For many long years Ive played a lone hand  
I rode my horse in many strange lands  
Until one day I stopped for awhile  
For two blue eyes and a sunny smile  
So howl away you old coyote  
I hear your sad and lonesome song  
Youre calling me back to old Montana  
Back to those hills where I belong  
One day I rode away from home  
Im a traveling back and it wont be long  
Ill see you again in a little while  
Youre my darling sweet my welcome smile  
So howl away you old coyote  
I hear your sad and lonesome song  
Youre calling me back to old Montana  
Back to those hills where I belong  
So howl away you old coyote  
I hear your sad and lonesome song  
Youre calling me back to old Montana  
Back to those hills where I belong
