Im gonna paper all my walls with your love letters  
And invite you over some night  
Im gonna read you every line where you promised to be mine  
And show you all the vows you made in black and white  
But if you think youre fooling me with your love love letters  
Well baby now its time you knew the score  
Im gonna find somebody new to write me love letters  
And paper them all over yours  
  
Im gonna paper all my walls with your love letters  
And invite you over some night  
Im gonna read you every line where you promised to be mine  
And show you all the vows you made in black and white  
But if you think youre fooling me with your love love letters  
Well baby now its time you knew the score  
Im gonna find somebody new to write me love letters  
And paper them all over yours  
All over yours
