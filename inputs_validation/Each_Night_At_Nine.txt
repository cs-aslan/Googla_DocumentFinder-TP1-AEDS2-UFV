A thousand miles dear  
A thousand more across the water  
Across the shore  
Ill say a prayer dear  
For yours and mine  
Please think of me dear  
Each night at nine  
  
I hold your picture  
Close to my heart  
It takes your place dear  
While were apart  
Helps remind me  
That youre still mine  
To feel your nearness  
Each night at nine  
  
The bugles playing  
Out go the lights  
Even its lonely these army nights  
Go tell kids Im doing fine  
Give them my love dear  
Each night at nine  
A thousand miles dear  
A thousand more across the water  
Across the shore  
Ill say a prayer dear  
For yours and mine  
Please think of me dear  
Each night at nine
