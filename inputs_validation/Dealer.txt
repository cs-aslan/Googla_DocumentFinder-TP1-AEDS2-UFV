If you fool around  
With the dealer  
Remember soon  
Youll have to pay  
Hell creep behind you  
Like a hunter  
Just to steal your soul away  
I dont want no one  
Messing with my woman  
But just the same  
I dont see nobody  
Fooling with you  
If youre snowblind  
Madonna can hold you  
But if you dont understand  
There is nothing she can do for you  
  
Running from the dealer  
Trying to save your soul  
  
I can feel the fire  
Coming from inside you  
I know what its like  
cause Ive been burned before  
Aint no mercy  
In the hunger but  
Youre a fool to yourself  
cause your dealer keeps you begging for more  
  
Running from the dealer  
Trying to save your soul  
  
In the beginning all you wanted  
Was the calm before the storm  
If the bluebird plays the eagle  
He finds his song will turn to stone  
Dealer
