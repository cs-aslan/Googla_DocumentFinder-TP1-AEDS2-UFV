Sittin in the porch swing  
Listenin to the light rain  
Beatin on the tin roof  
Baby just ame and you  
Rockin with the rhythm of the rain  
  
Slide on over  
Baby hold me closer  
Movin to and fro  
Just swayin like a slow freight train  
Rockin with the rhythm of the rain  
  
So let the breeze keep blowin  
Rockin with the rhythm of the rain thats fallin  
Night birds are singin the crickets are callin  
Oh my heart will never be the same  
Keep the sweet feelin flowin  
Whisper in my ear baby  
Ooh feels so fine  
Nights like this come once in a lifetime  
Me and my baby rockin with the rhythm of the rain  
  
Oh baby hold me tight  
Sayheyhey you love me  
Thats all I want to hear tonight  
  
Sittin in the porch swing  
Listenin to the light rain  
Beatin on the tin roof  
Baby just me and you  
Rockin with the rhythm of the rain  
  
Slide on over  
Baby hold me closer  
Movin to and fro  
Just swayin like a slow freight train  
Rockin with the rhythm of the rain  
  
So let the breeze keep blowin  
Rockin with the rhythm of the rain thats fallin  
Night birds are singin the crickets are callin  
Oh my heart will never be the same  
Keep the sweet feelin flowin  
Whisper in my ear baby  
Ooh feels so fine  
Nights like this come once in a lifetime  
Me and my baby rockin with the rhythm of the rain  
  
Me and my baby rockin with the rhythm of the rain
