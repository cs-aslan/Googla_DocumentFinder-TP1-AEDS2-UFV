Dolly Parton  
Bartender wont you pour me a very strong drink  
Just keep it coming till I dont have to think  
And point out some cowboy that might want to dance  
And make sure I get home if you see that I cant  
You see I loved him he left me for a girl half my age  
I relate to each sad song that ole jukebox has played  
I listen to Haggard ole Hank and George Jones  
But why dont more women sing honky tonk songs  
Why dont more women sing honkytonk songs  
About the heartaches and the tough breaks  
And the men thats done em wrong  
There are others just like me that are hurtin to the bone  
So why dont more women sing honkytonk songs  
Why dont more women sing honky tonk songs  
Honky tonk angels are just queens without thrones  
Judge not lest you be judged who can cast the first stone  
Why dont more women sing honkytonk songs  
Bartender wont you pour me a very strong drink  
Just keep it coming till I dont have to think  
And point out some cowboy that might want to dance  
And make sure I get home if you see that I cant  
All you lonely women sing  
Why dont more women sing honky tonk songs  
About the heartaches and the tough breaks  
And all the men thats done us wrong  
Theres a whole lotta women I know would sing along  
So why dont more women sing honky tonk songs  
Why dont more women sing honky tonk songs
