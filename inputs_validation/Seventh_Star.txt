Theres a vision in the sands  
Rising from the ancient past  
Crying let my spirit go  
Lead my burning soul to rest  
  
Hear the sound of distant ages  
Its the call of the seventh star  
  
Theres no shelter from the heat  
Theres no mercy from this land  
Hear a thousand chanting souls  
Waiting judgment from gods hand  
  
Hear the sound of distant ages  
Its the call of the seventh star  
Hear the sound of fallen angels  
Its the call of the seventh star  
  
The pyramids will fall  
Turn to dust before the sun  
And the star will rise again  
Until destiny is done  
  
Hear the sound of distant ages  
Its the call of the seventh star  
Hear the sound of fallen angels  
Its the call of the seventh star
