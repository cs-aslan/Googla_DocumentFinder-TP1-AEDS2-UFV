Take my hand take a breath  
Pull me close and take one step  
Keep your eyes locked on mine  
And let the music be your guide  
  
Wont you promise me  
Now wont you promise me  
That youll never forget  
Well keep dancing  
To keep dancing  
Wherever we go next  
  
Its like catching lightning the chances of finding  
Someone like you  
Its one in a million the chances of feeling  
The way we do  
  
And with every step together  
We just keep on getting better  
So can I have this dance  
Can I have this dance  
Can I have this dance  
  
Take my hand Ill take the lead  
And every turn will be safe with me  
Dont be afraid afraid to fall  
You know Ill catch you through it all  
  
And you cant keep us apart  
Even a thousand miles cant keep us apart  
Cause my heart is wherever you are  
  
Its like catching lightening the chances of finding  
Someone like you  
Its one in a million the chances of feeling  
The way we do  
  
And with every step together  
We just keep on getting better  
So can I have this dance  
Can I have this dance  
Can I have this dance  
  
Oh no mountains too high and no oceans too wide  
Cause together or not our dance wont stop  
Let it rain let it pour what we have is worth fighting for  
You know I believe that we were meant to be Oh  
  
Its like catching lightening the chances of finding  
Someone like you  
Its one in a million the chances of feeling  
The way we do  
  
And with every step together  
We just keep on getting better  
So can I have this dance  
Can I have this dance  
Can I have this dance  
Can I have this dance  
Can I have this dance
