Once again we found ourselves to be lost  
Holding hands while straying from the path in the forest dark  
Arent you happy to see me crawl serpentine towards the sun to you  
  
Chorus  
Lift the lid of your hearts casket in the arms of rain  
Well drift along this river of sadness til we feel no pain  
Baby its the hail Marys for the secrets youve kept from me  
Hail Marys for tomorrows dream  
In the arms of rain we are free  
  
Again I fought myself and lost  
Come bite the apple and Ill coil around your heart  
Im so happy to see you weep along  
In these arms you belong  
  
Chorus  
  
Ave Maria weve tried  
Ave Maria weve cried  
Ave Maria weve died  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Its the end of a road hold me  
Its the end of a road and were free
