All your twobit psychiatrists are giving you electro shock  
They say they let you live at home with mom and dad  
Instead of mental hospital  
But every time you tried to read a book  
You couldnt get to page 17  
Cause you forgot where you were  
So you couldnt even read  
Dont you know theyre gonna kill your sons  
Dont you know theyre gonna kill kill your sons  
Theyre gonna kill kill your sons  
Until they run run run run run run run run away  
  
Mom informed me on the phone  
She didnt know what to do about dad  
Took an axe and broke the table  
Arent you glad youre married  
And sister she got married on the island  
And her husband takes the train  
Hes big and hes fat and he doesnt even have a brain  
Theyre gonna kill your sons  
Dont you know theyre gonna kill kill your sons  
Dont you know theyre gonna kill kill your sons  
Until they run away  
  
Creedmore treated me very good  
But Paine Whitney was even better  
And when I flipped on PHC  
I was so sad I didnt even get a letter  
All of the drugs that we took it really was lots of fun  
But when they shoot you up with thorizene on crystal smoke  
You choke like a son of a gun  
Dont you know theyre gonna kill your sons  
Dont you know theyre gonna kill kill your sons  
Theyre gonna kill kill your sons  
Until they run run run run run run run run away
