Babys born on a bathroom floor  
Her mother prays that itll never cry  
But nothings wrong youve got your prom dress on  
When they ask youll say it isnt mine  
You know theyre gonna know you lied  
  
Why the hell dont you throw yourself away  
You know theyre gonna burn it down  
Wash my hands of this  
You notice how god aint even helping you out  
Wash my hands of this  
You notice how God aint even helping you  
Why the hell dont you throw yourself away  
You know theyre gonna burn it down  
  
So keep the way you feel anonymous  
And hide it all until the day you die  
Your secrets safe at least you thought it was  
But you can only keep it for a little while  
And now youre terrified  
  
Why the hell dont you throw yourself away  
You know theyre gonna burn it down  
Wash my hands of this  
You notice how God aint even helping you out  
Wash my hands of this  
You notice how God aint even helping you  
Why the hell dont you throw yourself away  
You know theyre gonna burn it down  
  
Babys born on a bathroom floor

But nothings wrong youve got your prom dress on  
When they ask youll say it isnt mine  
You know theyre gonna know you lied  
  
And damn you for thinking we will never know  
And damn you for thinking we would never mind  
Only reason that you made it this far  
You never asked him but you never tried  
  
Why the hell dont you throw yourself away  
Why the hell dont you blow yourself away  
You know theyre gonna burn it down  
Wash my hands of this  
You notice how God aint even helping you out  
Wash my hands of this  
You notice how God aint even helping you  
Why the hell dont you blow yourself away  
You know theyre gonna burn it down
