Blue trail of sorrow  
Lies upon the ground  
And I get so lonely  
Since you let me down  
Well I used to be so happy  
Walkin on these streets  
Now theres just sadness  
Everywhere I meet  
Start walkin baby walk all over town  
Sweet tears of sadness fallin down  
Keep lookin baby and I wont be around  
Blue trail of sorrow on the ground  
Now when I had a dollar  
Youd stick right by me  
Now Ive got nothin  
But blues for company  
Well I think Ill leave tomorrow  
Im tired of this old town  
But it wont be hard to find me  
If you look down on the ground  
Start walkin baby walk all over town  
Sweet tears of sadness fallin down  
Keep lookin baby and I wont be around  
Blue trail of sorrow on the ground
