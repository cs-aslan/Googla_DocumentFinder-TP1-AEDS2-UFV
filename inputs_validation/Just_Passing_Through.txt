Soldiers of fortune lost in the wind  
No destinations and nothing to win  
Keep your head above the water you get dirty and mean  
Scrubbing forever and you never come clean  
  
A life that is easy a dream that comes true  
Flowers for someone but they sure aint for me  
Your rooms filled with soft light safe and secure  
Mine is the dark night and nothings for sure  
  
Were just passing trough  
  
A life that is easy a dream to be free  
Flowers for someone but they sure aint for you  
And they sure aint for me  
  
Were just passing trough
