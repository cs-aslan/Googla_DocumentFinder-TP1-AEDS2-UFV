My girls a liar  
But Ill stand beside her  
Shes all Ive got  
And I dont want to be alone  
  
My girl dont see me  
When shes with my friends  
Shes all Ive got  
And I dont want to be alone  
  
No there is no other one  
No there is no other one  
I cant have any other one  
Though I would  
Now I never could with one  
  
All of the drugs she does  
Scare me real good  
Shes got a tattoo  
And two pet snakes  
But nobody knows me like her  
Nobody knows her like me  
Were all weve got  
And we dont want to be alone
