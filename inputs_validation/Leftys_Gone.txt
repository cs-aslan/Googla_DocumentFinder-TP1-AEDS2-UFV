A jukebox introduced us when the sixties were still young  
If Youve Got the Money Honey got my nickels one by one  
I tried to imitate that song  
Its not right but Leftys gone  
  
Always Late breaks my heart  
In every song he sang I played the part  
I heard he was sad and lived alone  
Its not right but Leftys gone  
  
He played the fair in Dallas one year  
In the cold October rain  
Most folks stayed home and warm  
But he sang just the same  
I caught a chill before I got home  
Its not right but Leftys gone  
  
Always Late breaks my heart  
In every song he sang I played the part  
I heard he was sad and lived alone  
Its not right but Leftys gone  
  
It dont seem like he was around that long  
Its not right but Leftys gone
