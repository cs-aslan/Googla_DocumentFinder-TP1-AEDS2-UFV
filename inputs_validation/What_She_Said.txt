What she said   
How come someone hasnt noticed  
That Im dead  
And decided to bury me  
God knows Im ready

What she said was sad  
But then all the rejection shes had  
To pretend to be happy  
Could only be idiocy

What she said was not for the job or  
Lover that she never had  
Oh  
No no no  
  
What she read  
All heady books  
Shed sit and prophesise  
It took a tattooed boy from  
Birkenhead  
To really really open her eyes

And I need to cling to something
