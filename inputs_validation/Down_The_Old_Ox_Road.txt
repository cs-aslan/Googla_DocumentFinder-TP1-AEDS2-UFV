Theres a famous thoroughfare  
Ive heard collegiates say  
Im not referring to Piccadilly  
Its not 42nd Street  
  
Its not the rue de la Paix  
Nor is it Market Street in Philly  
Ask most any college Romeo  
To complete your education you must go  
  
Down the old ox road  
Though youll never find where it is  
By looking in maps  
With a little investigation youll discover perhaps  
  
That this old traditions not a place  
But just a proposition called  
The old ox road  
The old ox road  
  
Ox road could be any romantic spot  
A country highway or a moonlit yacht  
It could be in the parlor  
When the lights are burning low  
  
It could be in the movie  
In the very last row  
  
Down the old ox road  
In the magic of the moonlight  
You are filled with delight  
While the leaves that flutter oer you  
  
Whisper lover tonight  
Why keep waiting and debating  
When you know its time for mating  
  
On the old ox road  
On the old ox road
