Im far away from home out on the dashing foam  
Just how far I have traveled Ill never know  
Sometimes I feel so blue and I long for home and you  
But I must stay and fight the foe  
  
So Im sending you red roses to tell you my love is true  
And I send them so you will know dear that Im always thinking of you  
Enclosed you will find my heart dear so treat it with tender care  
And every time you look inside dear youll find my love is there  
  
May each petal be a memory of the happiness we knew  
Each thorn may tell a story of the heartache that Ive been through  
So Im sending you red roses although were oceans apart  
And remember when they fade dear that youll always have my heart
