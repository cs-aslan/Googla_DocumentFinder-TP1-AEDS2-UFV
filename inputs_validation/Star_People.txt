Star people  
Counting your money till you soul turns green  
Star people  
Counting the cost of your desire to be seen  
  
I do not count myself among you  
I may be living in a dream  
Its just seem to many of you  
Cant help but hope  
Theres a difference between you and me  
  
Youre a star  
Im talking to you  
Youre a star  
  
Maybe your mama gave you up boy  
Its the same old same old  
Maybe your daddy didnt love you enough girl  
  
Star people  
Never forget your secret safe with me  
Just look at all wonderful people  
Trying to forget they had to pay for what you see  
  
Its a dream  
With a nightmare stuck in the middle  
But where would you be  
Without all of that attention  
Youd die  
Id die  
Wed die wouldnt we  
Well wouldnt we  
  
Big big star  
Should go far  
  
Talk about your mother  
Talk about your father  
Talk about the people  
Who have made you what you are  
Talk about your teacher  
The bully boy who beat you  
Talk about the people who have paid  
For that new sports car  
  
Did you get off on a bad foot baby  
Do you have a little tale to tell  
Is that why youre a star  
Is that what makes a star  
Nothing comes for nothing baby  
That fame and fortunes heaven sent  
And who gives a fuck about your problems darling  
When you can pay the rent  
  
How much is enough
