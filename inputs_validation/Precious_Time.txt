I dont want to argue about who is the victim  
Cause maybe we both got burned  
I dont want to talk about who is the traitor  
Cause both of our loyalties turned  
I dont want to fight about who is the liar  
Cause theres too many ways to lie  
I dont want to hear about who is the winner  
Cause we both know its a tie  
Cut it out drop it count me out baby stop it  
Life is too short so why waste precious time  
Life is too short so why waste precious time  
  
You were on a liquid diet you were sure you had to try it  
And you lost all your pounds  
The doctors on vacation so you took the medication  
And wound up in lost and found  
So we took a trip to Paris  
Cause you swore that it would scare us out of our swift decline  
All that I remember bout those days in that September  
Is the merci and the wine  
  
Cut it out drop it count me out  baby stop it  
Life is too short so why waste precious time  
Life is too short so why waste  
Precious time precious time precious time  
Oh precious time  
Life is too short so why waste precious time  
  
You talk on the telephone long distance to new york or Rome  
Some would say you got it made  
Your home is like a fortress no one comes in but the florist  
The gardener and the maid  
You call me on the telephone you say you feel so alone  
Too tired to get dressed and get out  
First youre happy then youre sad  
Somehow you always hang up mad  
Excuse me if I shout  
  
Cut it out drop it count me out baby stop it  
Life is too short so why waste precious time  
Life is too short so why waste precious time  
Life is too short so why waste precious time  
Precious time precious time oh precious time  
Life is too short so why waste precious time
