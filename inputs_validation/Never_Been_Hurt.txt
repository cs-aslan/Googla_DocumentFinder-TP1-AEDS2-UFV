I felt picture perfect  
On and off a shelf to a broken frame of mind a broken frame of mind  
It comes back and haunts me  
A bullet undercover it fooled me every time it fooled me every time  
  
But even if I lose it all  
Ive got so much left to give I wont give up no no  
My hearts on the frontline Im not afraid  
  
I will love you  
Like Ive never been hurt  
Run through fire for you  
Like Ive never been burned  
Im gonna risk it all like Ive never lost  
Gonna give it all Ive got  
I will love you  
I will love like Ive never been hurt never been hurt  
  
You set fire to ashes  
You fought through the darkness and brought me back to life you brought me
back to life  
  
So even if I lose it all  
I got so much left to give I wont give up no no  
My hearts on the frontline Im not afraid  
  
I will love you  
Like Ive never been hurt  
Run through fire for you  
Like Ive never been burned  
Im gonna risk it all like Ive never lost  
Gonna give it all Ive got  
I will love you  
I will love like Ive never been hurt never been hurt  
  
I will love you and forever  
I will love you like I never  
Like I never heard goodbye  
Like I never heard a lie  
Like Im falling into love for the first time  
Yeah  
  
I will love you  
Like Ive never been hurt  
Run through fire for you  
Like Ive never been burned  
Im gonna risk it all like Ive never lost  
Gonna give it all Ive got  
I will love you  
I will love like Ive never been hurt never been hurt
