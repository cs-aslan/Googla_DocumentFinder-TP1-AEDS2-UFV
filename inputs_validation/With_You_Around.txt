Do you remember when I said you where my only one  
We were running underneath the California sun  
Well now I look at you and youre still more than I can take  
Youre like a slow song starting to accelerate  
And all my life I looked for you  
For arms that I can fall into  
  
All I can think about is you and me driving with the Saves The Day record on  
We were singing til until our voices were gone  
And I was falling hard you were barely hanging on  
And now I want to chase forever down  
With you around  
  
You are making movies in your head when you fall asleep  
Havin nightmares dreaming that Im gonna leave  
I know youve always been afraid of ending up alone  
Somebody hurt you now youre waiting on a dial tone  
But Im right here so dont get blue  
Its not just you I need this too  
  
All I can think about is you and me driving with the Saves The Day record on  
We were singing until our voices were gone  
And I was falling hard you were barely hanging on  
And now I want to chase forever down  
With you around  
  
We were running underneath the California sun  
We were underneath the California sun  
  
All I can think about is you and me driving with the Saves The Day record on  
We were singing til our voices were gone  
And I was falling hard you were barely hanging on  
We put a record on kept singing until our voices were gone  
And I was falling hard you were barely hanging on  
And now I want to chase forever down  
We were riding underneath the California Sun  
I just want to chase forever down  
With you around
