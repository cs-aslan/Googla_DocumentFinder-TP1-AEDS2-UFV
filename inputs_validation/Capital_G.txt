I pushed the button and elected him to office and  
He pushed the button and he dropped the bomb  
You pushed the button and could watch it on the television  
Those motherfuckers didnt last too long  
  
Im sick of hearing bout the have and havenots  
Have some personal accountability  
The biggest problem with the way that we are doing things is  
The more we let you have the less that Ill be keeping for me  
  
Well I used to stand for something  
Now Im on my hands and knees  
Turning in my god for this one  
And he signs his name with a capital G  
  
Dont give a shit about the temperature in Guatemala  
Dont really see what all the fuss is about  
Aint gonna worry about no future generations  
And Im sure somebodys gonna figure it out  
  
Dont try to tell me that some power can corrupt a person  
You havent had enough to know what its like  
Youre only angry cause you wish you were in my position  
Now nod your head because you know that Im right all right  
  
Well I used to stand for something  
But forgot what that could be  
Theres a lot of me inside you  
Maybe youre afraid to see  
  
Well I used to stand for something  
Now Im on my hands and knees  
Turning in my god for this one  
And he signs his name with a capital G  
  
Well I used to stand for something  
But forgot what that could be  
Theres a lot of me inside you  
Maybe youre afraid to see  
  
Well I used to stand for something  
Now Im on my hands and knees  
Turning in my god for this one  
And he signs his name with a capital G
