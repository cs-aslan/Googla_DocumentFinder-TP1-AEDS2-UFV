Chorus  
I cant seem to get you off my mind  
Turn on the station but Im still facing you and  
Everbody seem to lost their mind  
Its hard to handle so I change the channel on the  
Radio cause internet killed the radio star  
Radio and YouTube killed the video star  
Hit the radio  
We can make a make a video  
Now Im a star  
Hit the radio  
We can make a make a video  
Now Im a star  
  
Picture me rollin Pac its funny how time has changed  
Everybodys a critic now its all a debate on the internet wave  
It used to be you and Biggie Chili Peppers Give It Away  
Now we got ten yearolds sitting back in a chair like those were the days  
And though it seems so amazing to me that the labels lost the touch  
And Im in the AM flipping through the AM like I lost my crutch limpin  
Cause I cant walk straight if I cant turn it up sippin  
I need some Gin and Juice Snoop Dogg I brought my cup  
Whats up ah ha okay shut up  
Cause I think we had enough of radios and lunch with the love bugs  
Well let me give you a big hug  
Bag of mushrooms here take some drugs  
And play some group home or something  
And shit goodie mobs sould food is bumpin rewind  
  
Chorus  
  
Youll never hear Black Star cause the program director is mostly deaf  
And youll never hear triple six cause we live in the midst of the Bible Belt  
But thats when the light is filled so let it shine  
Let em rhyme let em hustle let em grind  
Nothing wrong with the truth sometimes  
Sometimes the truth is dark but the darkness sparks the truest art  
And you didnt even know you a window till a tornado blew it apart  
If Eric Clapton could sing about cocaine then theres no harm  
Then I can write about guns I can rap about girls  
I can sing about money and cars  
Not that my money is large  
Lets talk about broke is a joke  
Lets talk about gettin evicted everything owned thrown out on the road  
And maybe that there goes gold  
Shit maybe its platinum sold  
But they dont want to see the green leaves from pirates gold  
Oh no hold up rewind  
  
Chorus  
  
Pick up the change pick up the change  
Ride in a Chevy cause Im sick of the Range  
Catfish Billy come pick up the name  
Come inside if your sick of the rain  
Turn the radio off and dont complain  
Its all a replay its all the same  
Got one drag on a runaway train  
On a one way street better pick your lane  
  
Yeah but you could let me pick your brain  
And we could be that Rolling Stone  
Mix em up with Janis Joplin  
Let em harmonize like Bone  
Or we could just leave it alone  
Let it take on a life of its own  
Or we could be that World Class Wreckin Cru  
Tell em to turn the lights back on  
Cmon  
  
Chorus
