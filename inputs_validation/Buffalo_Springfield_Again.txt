Used to play in a rock n roll band  
But they broke up  
We were young and we were wild  
It ate us up  
Now Im not saying who was right or wrong  
  
Looking out on a big green lawn  
Girls and boys  
Playing in the afternoon sun  
And lifes a joy  
I heard an old song playing on a radio  
  
Buffalo Springfield again  
  
Like to see those guys again  
And give it a shot  
Maybe now we can show the world  
What we got  
But Id just like to play for the fun we had  
  
Buffalo Springfield again  
  
Buffalo Springfield again
