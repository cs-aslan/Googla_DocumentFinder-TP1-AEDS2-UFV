I dont have plans and schemes  
And I dont have hopes and dreams  
I I I dont have anything  
Since I dont have you  
  
And I dont have fond desires  
And I dont have happy hours  
I dont have anything  
Since I dont have you  
  
Happiness and I guess  
I never will again  
When you walked out on me  
In walked ol misery  
And shes been here since then  
  
Yeah were fucked  
  
I dont have love to share  
And I dont have one who cares  
I I I I dont have anything  
Since I dont have you  
  
You you you oh oh  
You you you oh oh  
You you you oh oh  
You you you oh oh  
You you oh yeah
