Arent you the girl who used to call me names  
Arent you the girl who used to play at games  
Werent you the one who said shed never fall  
Now youre the one whos cryin not so tall  
Oh I know what its like  
Its happened many times to me  
Oh do you ache inside  
Do your eyes want a cry  
Do you want me back again  
Yes youre the one  
Shall I throw you a crumb  
Shall I come and pass you by  
Would that make you want to try  
Shall I come and kiss your lips  
Would that make your rain slip  
Shall I come and dry your eyes  
Will that make you realize  
Oh I know what its like  
Its happened many times to me  
Oh do you ache inside  
Do your eyes want a cry  
Do you want me back again  
Arent you the girl who used to call me names  
Arent you the girl who used to play at games  
Werent you the one who used to run and hide  
Now youre the one whos cryin way inside  
Oh I know what its like  
Its happened many times to me  
Oh do you ache inside  
Do your eyes want a cry  
Do you want me back again
