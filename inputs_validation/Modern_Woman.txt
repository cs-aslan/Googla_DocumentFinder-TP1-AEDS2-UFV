You see her sitting with her coffee and her paper  
With her high top sneakers of Italian design  
With a long cool stare she aggravates the tension  
Makes up her face while she makes up her mind  
  
Now youre in trouble maybe shes an intellectual  
What if she figures out youre not very smart  
Or maybe shes the quiet type whos into heavy metal  
Boy you got to get it settled  
Cause shes breaking your heart  
  
Dont try to put on an act  
You cant do that to a modern woman  
And youre an old fashioned man  
She understands the things youre doin  
Shes a modern woman  
  
She looks sleek and she seems so professional  
Shes got a lot of confidence its easy to see  
You want to make a move  
But you feel so inferior  
Cause under that exterior  
Is someone whos free  
  
Shes got style and shes got her own money  
So shes not another honey you can quickly disarm  
Shes got the eyes that make you realize  
She wont be hypnotized by your usual charm  
  
Youve got your plan of attack  
That wont attract the modern woman  
And youre an old fashioned man  
She understands the things youre doin  
Shes a modern woman  
  
Time goes by and youre sharing an apartment  
She says she loves you but she doesnt know why  
In the morning she leaves you with your coffee and your paper  
Its a strange situation for an old fashioned guy  
  
But times have changed  
Things are not the same baby  
You overcame such a bad attitude  
Rock and roll just used to be for kicks  
And nowadays its politics  
And after 1986 what else could we do  
  
You got to learn to relax  
And face the facts of modern woman  
And youre an old fashioned man  
She understands the things youre doin  
Shes a modern woman
