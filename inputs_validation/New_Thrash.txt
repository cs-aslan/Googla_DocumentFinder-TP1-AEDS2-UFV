I got so much trouble on my mind  
That it feels just like Im always sleeping with the enemy  
But I know the real world always gets the last word  
And thats why you gotta kick reality  
So dont tease me and try to say I should care  
I might as well go out for mine  
Cause everybodys going out for theirs  
  
So dont tell me about a fake drug war  
Go cut education programs more  
The people will one day learn and rise  
Cause not everyone is out to score  
  
People always ask me why people are all fucked up  
At every corner liquor store
