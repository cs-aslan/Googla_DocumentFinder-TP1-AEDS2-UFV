Full moon light is calling me  
My kigndom lies within  
The mystic soul and lions heart  
Brought by the talisman  
The ecstasy of battle takes me  
Where the falcons fly  
Immortal youth was granted me  
I will never die  
  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
Born to teach them all to heel  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
  
Pounded by the hammers  
Of the giants of the world  
I can see in darkness  
Im the overlord  
Single combat I await  
My shadow brings them fear  
The spikes upon my chariot  
Will grind them when theyre near  
  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
Born to teach them all to heel  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
  
I am an outcast on the path of no return  
Punisher and swordsman  
I was born to burn  
Black Wind always follows  
Where my black horse rides  
Fires in my soul  
Steel is on my side  
  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
Born to teach them all to heel  
Born of Black wind fire and steel
