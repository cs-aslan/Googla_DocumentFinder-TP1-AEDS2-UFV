Step right up march push  
Crawl right up on your knees  
Please greed feed no time to hesitate  
I want a little bit I want a piece of it I think hes losing it  
I want to watch it come down  
Dont like the look of it dont like the taste of it dont like the  
Smell of it  
I want to watch it come down  
All the pigs are all lined up  
I give you all that you want  
Take the skin and peel it back  
Now doesnt that make you feel better  
Shove it up inside surprise lies  
Stains like the blood on your teeth  
Bite chew suck away the tender parts  
I want to break it up I want to smash it up I want to fuck it up  
I want to watch it come down  
Maybe afraid of it lets discredit it lets pick away at it  
I want to watch it come down  
Now doesnt that make you feel better  
The pigs have won tonight  
Now they can all sleep soundly  
And everything is all right
