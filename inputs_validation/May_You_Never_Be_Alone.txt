May you never be alone like me  
Like a bird thats lost its mate in flight  
Im alone and oh so blue tonight  
Like a piece of driftwood on the sea  
May you never be alone like me  
I believed the lies you told to me  
When you whispered dear I worship Thee  
Now here am I alone and blue  
All because I loved no one but you  
In the Bible Gods own words to say  
For every wrong someday youll pay  
Now I pray the Lord to set me free  
May you never be alone like me  
May you never be alone like me
