Treasures in the jars of clay  
Let the light shine out of darkness  
Fallen down but not destroyed  
Its just another trial by fire  
  
In my song Ill send a prayer  
Do you know me do you hear me  
Where the will to face this shame  
Its just another trial by fire  
  
Hello Mr Moon  
Can I have some time with you  
Trouble keep me runnin  
You can see it comin  
I know who shines down on you  
  
Hello Mr Moon  
Ive come back to talk to you  
All my life Im runnin  
From the love thats comin  
Saving grace please pull me through  
  
In my doubt I cant believe  
Like a wave tossed where the wind blows  
Tears of faith temper my soul  
Just another trial by fire  
Just another trial by fire
