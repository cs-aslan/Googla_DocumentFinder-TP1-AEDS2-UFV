Don Wayne  
He walked into the bar and parked his lanky frame upon a tall bar stool  
With a long soft southern drawl said Ill just have a glass of anything thats
cool  
A barroom girl with wise and knowing eyes slowly looked me up and down  
And she said I wonder how on earth that country bumpkin found his way to town  
And she said hello country bumpkin hows the frost out on the pumpkin  
Ive seen some sights but man youre somethin  
Whered you come from country bumpkin  
  
Just a short year later in a bed of joy filled tears and death like pain  
Into this wondrous world of many wonders another wonder came  
That same womans face was wrapped up in a raptured look of love and
tenderness  
As I marveled at the soft and warm and cuddly boy child feeding at her breast  
And she said hello country bumpkin fresh as frost out on the pumpkins  
Ive seen some sights but babe youre somethin mommy loves her country
bumpkin  
  
Forty years of hard work later in a simple quiet and peaceful country place  
The heavy hand of time had not erased the raptured wonder from my womans face  
She was lying on her death bed knowing fully well her race was nearly run  
Byt she softly smiled and looked into the sad eyes of her husband and her son  
And I said so long country bumpkins the frost is gone now from the pumpkins  
Ive seem some sights and lifes been somethin see you later country bumpkins  
See you later country bumpkins
