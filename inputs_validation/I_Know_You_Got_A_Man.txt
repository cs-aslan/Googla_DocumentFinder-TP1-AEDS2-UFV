Chorus  
I know you got a man man man  
But tell me what your man man man  
Got to do with me me me  
Uh oh uh oh oh

I know you got a girl girl girl  
But tell me what your girl girl girl  
Got to do with me me me  
Uh oh uh oh oh

Listen  
I know you got a man but your man aint Luda  
So please dont let him fool ya  
Cos the nigga dont really know how to do ya  
Whos your daddy rolling all up in the caddy  
Sun roof top with the diamond in the back  
Coming to get some of the bomb in the sack  
Like a bomb in Iraq Ima come and attack  
Every inch of your body after the after party  
And then on to the hotel lobby riding me like a Ducatti  
Faster than a Bugatti  
Im like whoa Kimosabe  
Good golly shorty a freak or she been practicing Pilates  
Im probably just stripping tongue skskipping like a track broke  
But if she think Im fronting just wait til she see my back stroke  
Haa I be your side piece but whats our future plans  
Cause I be on ya like damn  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey ok ok so thats your mans and em  
I aint tellin you to cancel him  
Do do your thing look shorty I gotta respect your answer em  
Them theres your boyfriend I just wanna be your toy friend  
Your other other man  
Not not your lololover man undercover man  
How many rubber mans would it take for you  
Lil mama to be apart of my plan  
What do you need in advance  
I can see both of us showing in France  
I can look back at your thong in my hand  
Louis Vuitton no more Donna Karen  
Couple of stacks so what is you saying  
Like Denzel Washington My Man  
I dont wanna hear no mo more bout him  
What it gotta do with me you grown ass woman  
Im a grown ass man so we both know a lot about the birds and the bees  
Hold on shorty lets conversate conjugate constipate  
Get stuck on each other you coming up outta your lingerie hey  
I know you got a man  
  
Chorus  
  
Nada nada not a damn thing  
He wouldnt know what to do if he tried it  
And I aint hating you need some room to breathe and  
I can be your ventilation  
You need a lil lovin just a lil stimulation  
A hug a lil kissing and then a lil penetration  
Give it to you like you never had it before  
And you aint never gon think about his ass again  
Lips hips eyes thighs here Im gon have to give that ass a ten  
And they can get a five even though one of them kinda fine  
But aint none of them got nothing on you you  
So lets go somewhere to dine and sip some expensive wine  
Later on tell me what we gon do do  
We gon bump and we gon grind so good it should be a crime  
And next time tell your friends to come too too  
  
Chorus
