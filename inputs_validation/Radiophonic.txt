In the air  
In the air  
  
The night was long  
Now the crowd has gone  
Theres sunlight on my bed  
Feels like a radiophonic  
Workshops  
Beaming straight into my head  
It could make you weep  
I cant get to sleep  
Theres ringing in my ears  
Like a radiophonic workshop  
Orchestrating all my  
Stupid fears  
  
Chorus  
Radiophonic  
I think Im in love  
Radiophonic  
I think Im in love  
  
My skin is itching  
Im totally twitching  
With the pounding in my head  
Like a dub subsonic beatbox  
Booming bass under the bed  
My hands are shaking  
My mind is aching  
With a feeling deep inside  
That youve been staring  
Sending signals  
Every time our paths collide  
  
Chorus  
  
Think Im in love  
  
Chorus  
  
In the air  
In the air
