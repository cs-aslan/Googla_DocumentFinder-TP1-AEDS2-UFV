On the phone its 4am  
And Im still talkin to my friend  
Talkin bout anything  
Just to hear his voice would bring  
Happiness inside of me  
He has such a nice personality  
He tells me things that are good  
Makes me feel like how a woman should  
  
But Im just not too sure  
If hes into me  
But Im definitely feelin him  
  
Hes making me crazy  
Dont you know youre making me crazy  
Just one kiss from you would make  
Would make me so happy  
Would make me so complete baby  
Youre makin me go crazy  
  
When hes near I talk to him  
But he acts like were not even friends  
I wonder why he acts this way  
Theres just one thing  
Nothing else to say  
  
Thats why Im not too sure  
If hes into me  
But Im definitely feelin him  
  
Hes making me crazy  
Dont you know youre making me crazy  
Just one kiss from you would make  
Would make me so happy  
Would make me so complete baby  
Youre making me go crazy  
  
When were alone at home  
Talkin on the phone  
Youre so nice to me  
And all this time you got me questioning  
Are you leading me on youre leading me on  
  
You got me crazy  
Dont you know youre making me crazy  
Just one kiss from you would make  
Would make me so happy  
Would make me so complete baby  
Youre makin me go crazy
