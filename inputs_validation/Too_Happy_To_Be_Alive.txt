Were still breathin  
This cant be love  
Baby were tryin  
Shed a few tears more  
And we keep on waiting  
Just to get caught  
And we know this is exactly what we want  
  
We fear for the best and hope for the worst  
Too happy to be alive  
When love lies blessed and love lies cursed  
x2  
  
Now we feel it comin  
Peircing our hearts  
Fingers crossed and were praying  
Nothing goes wrong  
And its finally happenin  
Just a knock on our door  
Our hearts are beatin  
Oh its just begun  
  
Chorusx2  
  
  
We fear for the best and hope for the worst  
Too happy to be alive  
When love lies blessed and love lies cursed  
Too happy to be alive  
We fear for the best and hope for the worst  
Too happy to be alive  
When love lies blessed and love lies cursed  
Too happy to be alive  
Oh we fear for the best  
Too happy to be alive  
When love lies blessed and love lies cursed  
Too happy to be alive  
Too happy too happy were too happy to be alive  
Too happy too happy were too happy to be alive  
Too happy too happy CAUSE were too happy to be alive oh my love  
So
