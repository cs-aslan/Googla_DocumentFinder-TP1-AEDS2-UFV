Call yourself a family man  
Talking bout the families plan  
To bring the sweet talk deep and down  
Works better than an average pick up line  
You put your woman out to pasture  
On the promises you gave her last year  
Peace and love is on your head  
And the grass is greener playing round  
Your family seed is what you spread  
Chorus  
Buddy my friend  
Who you think you fooling  
Buddy my friend  
And what about your woman  
Buddy my friend  
Who you think you fooling  
Buddy my friend  
  
I dont care what you do  
But theres a hypocrite that lives in you  
Cause if your woman gave her love  
In the same way that you do  
Youd feel away  
You know you would  
  
Chorus  
  
Buddy my friend  
Treat her that way  
And youll be XD soon  
Buddy XD soon
