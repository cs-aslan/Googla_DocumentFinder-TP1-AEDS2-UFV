Youre as soft as the rose  
Youre as sweet as the honey  
Youre as warm as the bright morning sun  
Youre as cool as the breeze on the last days of April  
Youre as fine as fine can be  
  
Youre like time is to space  
Youre like faith is to trustin  
Youre like blue is to feelin unkind  
Youre like joy is for love  
Youre like dreams are for chasin  
Youre as fine as fine can be  
  
And when I am gone my thoughts are all with you  
Youre my little angel you see  
Youre as bright as the moon  
Youre as light as a feather  
Youre as fine as fine can be  
  
Like the rain is for the crops  
Youre like food for my thoughts  
Youre like true is for knowin whats not  
Youre like leaves are for trees  
Youre like bees are for buzzin  
Youre as fine as fine can be  
  
Youre as bright as the moon  
Youre as light as a feather  
Youre as fine as fine can be
