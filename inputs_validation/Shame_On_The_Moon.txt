Until youve been beside a man  
You dont know what he wants  
You dont know if he cries at night  
You dont know if he dont  
Where nothing comes easy old nightmares are real  
Until youve been beside a man  
You dont know how he feels  
  
But once inside a womans heart  
A man must keep his head  
Heaven opens up the door  
Where angels fear to tread  
Some men go crazy some men go slow  
Some men go just where they want  
Some men never go  
  
But oh blame it on midnight  
Ooh shame on the moon  
  
Everywhere is all around  
Comfort in the crowd  
Stangers faces all round  
Laughing right out loud  
Hey watch where youre goin step light on old toes  
Until youve been beside a man  
You dont know who he knows  
  
But oh blame it on midnight  
Ooh shame on the moon  
Oh blame it on midnight  
Ooh shame on the moon
