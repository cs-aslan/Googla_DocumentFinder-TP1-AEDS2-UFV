Our love is unconditional  
We knew it from the start  
I can see it in your eyes  
You can feel it from my heart  
  
From here on after  
Lets stay the way we are right now  
And share all the love and laughter  
That a lifetime will allow  
  
Chorus  
I cross my heart  
And promise to  
Give all Ive got to give  
To make all your dreams come true  
In all the world  
Youll never find  
A love as true as mine  
  
You will always be the miracle  
That makes my life complete  
And as long as theres a breath in me  
Ill make yours just as sweet  
  
As we look into the future  
Its as far as we can see  
So lets make each tomorrow  
Be the best that it can be  
  
Chorus  
  
And if along the way we find a day  
It starts to storm  
Youve got the promise of my love  
To keep you warm  
  
In all the world  
Youll never find  
A love as true as mine  
A love as true as mine
