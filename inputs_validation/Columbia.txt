There we were now here we are  
All this confusion nothings the same to me  
  
But I cant tell you the way I feel  
Because the way I feel is oh so new to me  
No I cant sell you the way I feel  
Because the way I feel is oh so new to me  
  
What I heard is not what I hear  
I can see the signs but theyre not very clear  
What I heard is not what I hear  
I can see the signs but theyre not very clear
