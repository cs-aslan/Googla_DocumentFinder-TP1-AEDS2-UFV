Dont that bring you down down down Repeat x4  
  
Dont give yourself away  
Dont live your life that way  
Of course hes gonna say  
Anything you want  
Hell leave quicker than he came  
Now youve got yourself to blame  
Dont put yourself back in the fire again  
  
Its the same damn thing youre so quick to believe  
And do it over and over again  
And its the same mistakes that Im watching you make  
And do it over and over again  
  
So before they bring you down  
you gotta stand for something or youll fall for anything  
Til you fall for anything til you fall for  
You gotta stand for something or youll fall for anything  
Til you fall for anything til you fall for  
  
Dont that bring you down down down x4  
  
Oh

Dont wait til your heart bleeds  
Love wasnt built for speed  
Listen to me girl  
He keeps fucking with your head tryin to get you into bed  
And in the morning youll just hate yourself  
  
Its the same damn thing youre so quick to believe  
And do it over nd over again  
And its the same mistakes that Im watching you make  
And do it over and over and over again  
  
Before they bring you down
