Billie Holiday  
  
Lord I love my man tell the world I do  
I love my man tell the world I do  
But when he mistreats me  
Makes me feel so blue  
  
My man wouldnt give me no breakfast  
Wouldnt give me no dinner  
Fought about my supper and put me outdoors  
Had the dark clay make black spots on my clothes  
I didnt have so many  
But I had a long long way to go  
  
Some men like me talkin happy  
Some calls it snappy  
Some call me honey  
Others think I got money  
Some tell me baby youre built for speed  
Now if you put that all together  
Makes me everthing a good man needs
