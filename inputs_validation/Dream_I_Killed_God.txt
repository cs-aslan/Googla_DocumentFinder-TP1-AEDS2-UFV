Dream I killed God and woke up  
Dream I killed God and woke up  
Hes begging please please please  
no dont  
  
Dream I killed God and woke up  
Time dries time dries my mind  
Oh Ill survive no one can save us  
Talk to myself talk to my soul  
  
I want you to follow  
Yes follow  
Its only Its only a dream only  
  
Dream I killed God and woke up  
He was lying bleeding and wishing  
  
Its passing  
Its passing  
Dream I killed god  
Dream I killed god  
Is he dead  
And then I dreamt of him
