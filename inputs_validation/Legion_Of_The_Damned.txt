Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
  
Deprived of our lives pushed into war  
Our fearless leader lies  
hes rotten to the core  
As per instruction  
march through no mans land  
Machines of destruction  
combat hand to hand  
  
Marching over frozen water  
soon reaching the front  
Into the merciless slaughter  
on the human hunt  
  
Battling the enemy that we dont know  
Were strangers in a strange land  
Losing it all we are sinking so low  
Were the Legion of the Damned  
  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Soldier without faith fight fire with fire  
  
Dont know why we hate so well die trying  
This is madness without end  
are we men or fools  
Theres no honor to defend  
we obey insane rules  
  
Mortars blowing us to pieces  
hell is breaking loose  
Minds all sick full of diseased  
no one sees the truth  
Marching over frozen water  
soon reaching the front  
Into the merciless slaughter  
on the human hunt  
  
Battling the enemy that we dont know  
Were strangers in a strange land  
Losing it all we are sinking so low  
Were the Legion of the Damned  
  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
Legion Of The Damned  
  
When its said and done therell be no victory  
Theyre blocking out the sun  
all thats left is misery  
  
Marching over frozen water  
soon reaching the front  
Into the merciless slaughter  
on the human hunt  
  
Battling the enemy that we dont know  
Were strangers in a strange land  
Losing it all we are sinking so low  
Were the Legion of the Damned  
Battling the enemy that we dont know  
Were strangers in a strange land  
Losing it all we are sinking so low  
Were the Legion of the Damned
