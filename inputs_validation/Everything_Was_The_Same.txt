Yeah everything everything was the same  
  
Im old enough to know better young enough to not give a fuck  
Rather hold my head high and die then live and duck  
I gotta set it off Jada Queen and Vivica  
The last chick was scared to get that money I cant live like her  
Got no problem with you niggas get it how you live it bro  
Its a cold world these mean streets will shiver you  
All I asks is for the same respect that I be giving you  
If not my boy will put the beats on you Karen Civil you  
That boy be on his shoot first never mind the trivia  
My advice dont mess with his man word to Nivea  
We go back to when we got that white from Bolivia  
We was candy shopping before 50 and Olivia  
Thats when you would go uptown cause you had to re there  
Everybody broke back then you had to repair  
Drug dealing was cool back then you had to beware  
That was the 90s yall wouldnt get it you had to be there  
Thats why Im glad to be here some of us never made it  
Its hard to get off the ground yall think I just levitated  
Yall think it was all love and nobody ever hated  
Yall think cause I never stated I never been devastated  
All yall see is sun shining think I was never shaded  
Yall think these calendar models is all that I ever dated  
Nigga nothing was the same HOT 97 played it  
Every day they made it that I stayed with 57 played it  
Cant trust nobody the crib is heavy gated  
You ask why I tell them even heavens gated  
You know why Cause when you good the devil hate it  
And even if you heavy weighted people want you feather weighted  
Attention I never paid it me and this clever lady  
She brains do some things then we lay together faded  
And while I chill loaded up a steel  
Just wishing a nigga would but knowing a nigga will  
But for real nigga good is how you feel  
But soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will  
Still I dont owe these niggas nothing put that in a nigga will  
  
Damned if you do them if you dont dont dont dont  
They dont have a hand on your head of what youre doing now  
Youre damned if you do them if you dont  
People sit around and judge you anyway  
Dont dont dont
