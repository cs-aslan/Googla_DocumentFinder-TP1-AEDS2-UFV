Another day another chance to get it right  
Circumstances sabotage me in spite of what I try  
No matter what I do  
Theres always something keeping me away from you  
  
Id do anything to see your sweet smile  
An Id go anywhere to be with you for just awhile  
Isnt it funny how some things are meant to be  
There is no future here for you and me  
At this time at this time at this time  
  
Now Im a girl who believes in destiny  
But I suppose I should face reality  
The timings wrong theres just too many obstacles  
To get together now would be impossible  
  
And what if fate has already played its hand  
And theres no future left in the plan  
What if this is what lies in store  
It only makes me want you even more  
  
Id do anything to see your sweet smile  
An Id go anywhere to be with you for just awhile  
Isnt it funny how some things are meant to be  
There is no future here for you and me  
At this time at this time at this time  
  
Id do anything to see your sweet smile  
An Id go anywhere to be with you for just awhile  
Isnt it funny how some things are meant to be  
There is no future here for you and me  
At this time at this time at this time  
  
Butterflies and moon beams are fragile things  
I guess thats the way it is with love too  
Sometimes it just doesnt work out  
  
Id do anything to see your sweet smile  
An Id go anywhere to be with you for just awhile  
Isnt it funny how some things are meant to be  
There is no future here for you and me  
At this time at this time at this time
