Cant bow for a rule  
Cause Im nobodys fool  
No puppet on a string when what counts is to win  
Sometimes I might be rude  
Acting in my mood  
Im trying to be straight  
Cause I dont want to be late  
Theres nothing you can say to make  
Me feel worse than I do how are you  
You cant buy my freedom  
Keep me locked in your cell  
Sad how we waste our energy  
When all our days are few makes me blue  
Were two of a kind me and you  
I guess that Ill see you in hell  
Who is my friend  
Who will remain  
Seems like I always stand alone in the end  
Nobody lasts until the end  
Theres nothing you can say to make  
Me feel worse than I do how are you  
You cant buy my freedom  
Keep me locked in your cell  
Sad how we waste our energy  
When all our days are few makes me blue  
You cant buy my life and freedom  
Its more than just buy and sell  
You cant keep me locked in your cell  
I guess that Ill see you in hell  
See you in hell
