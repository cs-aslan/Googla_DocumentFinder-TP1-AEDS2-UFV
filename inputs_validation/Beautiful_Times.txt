A spark soaring down through the pouring rain  
And restoring life to the lighthouse  
A slow motion wave on the ocean stirs  
My emotion up like a rain cloud  
  
When did the sky turn black  
And when will the light come back  
  
A cab driver turned to sky diver  
Then to survivor dying to break down  
A blood brother surrogate mother  
Huggin each other cryin their eyes out  
  
When did the sky turn black  
And when will the light come back  
Im ecstatic like a drug addict  
Locked in the attic strung out and spellbound  
  
I fought all through the night  
Oh oh but I made it alive  
The suns startin to rise  
Oh oh these are beautiful times  
  
This fight of my life is so hard  
So hard so hard  
But Im gonna survive  
Oh oh these are beautiful times  
  
Lindsey Stirling solo  
  
A bad feeling burned through the ceiling  
Leaving my healing hard with a new scar  
A dead fire rose and rose higher  
Like a vampire up from the graveyard  
  
When did the sky turn black  
And when will the light come back  
We all suffer but we recover  
Just to discover life where we all are  
  
I fought all through the night  
Oh oh but I made it alive  
The suns startin to rise  
Oh oh these are beautiful times  
  
This fight of my life is so hard  
So hard so hard  
But Im gonna survive  
Oh oh these are beautiful times  
  
This fight of my life is so hard  
So hard so hard  
But Im gonna survive  
Oh oh these are beautiful times  
  
My hearts burning bad and its turning black  
But Im learning how to be stronger  
And sincerely I love your dearly  
Oh but Im clearly destined to wander
