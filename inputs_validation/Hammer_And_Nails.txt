You take a hammer you get some nails you build a home  
Find a woman put that woman in that little home  
But without love true true love in that home  
Yes without love that little home just aint a home  
You cheat a little you leave your baby all alone  
You bend the nails you walk the boards in that little home  
cause without love true true love in that home  
Yes without love that little home cant be a home  
Yes without love in that home  
There aint a hammer big enough  
So when your nights of fun are through  
Dont be surprised to find yourself there all alone  
cause without love true true love in that home  
Yeh without love that little home just cant be a home  
Yeh without love that little home just cant be a home
