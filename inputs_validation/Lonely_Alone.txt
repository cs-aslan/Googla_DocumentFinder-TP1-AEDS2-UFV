Reese Wilson  
  
I could stop right here turn this car around  
Walk back through the door put my suitcase down  
Tell you Im sorry and things would be alright I know  
But it all comes down to the lesser of the two  
Alone by myself or alone with you  
And if I have to be lonely Id rather be lonely alone  
  
CHORUS  
Id rather miss someone out on this highway  
Than someone whos sittin just three feet away  
And Id rather be fightin some old memories  
than to wonder if you ever really love me  
  
I could keep going on like I have all along  
Telling myself that theres nothin wrong  
But if I have to be lonely Id rather be lonely alone  
  
Repeat CHORUS  
  
I dont know what Ill do I dont know where Ill go  
Theres a lot Im not sure of but  
one thing I know If I have to be lonely  
Id rather be lonely alone If I have to be lonely Id  
rather be lonely alone
