Theres a shadow hanging over the valley  
A total eclipse of the moon  
Closing up the gates of the city  
The wind it plays a wild tune  
Dont you put a lock on your window  
Dont you put the bar on your door  
Dont you cry for the rain in the sky  
Youve seen the storm before  
  
Yea now whats the matter with you baby  
Baby whats the matter now  
Whats the matter your running in the shadows  
Every time you hear the wild man yell  
Come on tell me whats the matter with you baby  
Baby whats the matter now  
Whats the matter your running in the shadows  
Every time you hear the wild man yell  
  
Now lightnings going to strike at midnight  
Thunder going to shake the ground  
Dont you flinch dont give a inch  
Just a let the flood come down  
  
Come on tell me whats the matter with you baby  
Baby whats the matter now  
Whats the matter your running in the shadows  
Every time you hear the wild man yell  
Come on tell me whats the matter with you baby  
Baby whats the matter now  
Whats the matter your running in the shadows  
Every time you hear the wildman yell
