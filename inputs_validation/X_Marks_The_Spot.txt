So I reach for it  
Stare in the darkness stare in the doom  
My heart ba boom ba boom boom  
  
Stare in the darkness and the defeat  
Come along when Im finding no peace  
And I know and I know and I know  
I know Im unlocked  
  
And I know and I know and I know  
I know what you got  
  
So I put my hands up to the sky  
Feeling life got a rocket ship that I wanna ride  
Put my hands up to the sky and its alright  
Wherever you are Ill find that treasure  
  
So I race for it  
Wherever you are Ill find that treasure  
So I race for it  
  
Stare in the darkness stare in the doom  
You make my heart ba boom ba boom boom  
  
Superhero masterpiece  
Been innocent but a sinner in me  
  
And I know and I know and I know  
I know Im in love  
And I know and I know and I know  
I know when Im lost  
  
I just put my hands up to the sky  
Im feeling life got a rocket ship that I wanna ride  
Put my hands up to the sky feeling inside  
Wherever you are Ill find that treasure  
  
Put my hands up to the sky feeling alright  
I got a rocket eyes on the prize  
Put my hands up to the sky Im gonna fly  
Wherever you are Ill find that treasure  
  
So I race for it  
Wherever you are Ill find that treasure  
So I race for it  
  
Wherever you are Ill find that treasure  
So I race for it  
And I know and I know and I know  
Know what I got  
  
X marks the spot  
  
Put my hands up to the sky feeling life  
I got a rocket ship that I wanna ride  
Put my hands up to the sky feeling inside  
Wherever you are Ill find that treasure  
  
Put my hands up to the sky feeling alright  
I got a rocket eyes on the prize  
Put my hands up to the sky Im gonna fly  
Wherever you are Ill find that treasure
