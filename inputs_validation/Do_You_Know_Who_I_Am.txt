Do you know who I am  
Have you have any idea who I am  
Yes its been quite a while  
And its so good to see you again  
  
Its so dark in this place  
That I cant see your face  
May believe Oh I see  
Does he know who I am  
And what once was between you and me  
  
Do you know how I tried  
Have you any idea how I tried  
Not to keep you in sight  
Do you know darling how much I cried  
  
I remember you said  
That you had to forget about me and be free  
Do you know who I am or have you forgot about me  
  
Do you think theres a chance  
You and I could start over again  
Is there a prayer you still pray  
Or has it just been too long and were through  
Well what about you and him  
Oh hes only a friend  
Well I see theres still a chance for me  
  
Well maybe some other time in some other place  
With our love in your heart and a smile on your face  
You will know who I am  
When that time comes youll know who I am  
  
You will know who I am  
When that time comes youll know who I am  
You will know who I am  
When that time comes youll know who I am
