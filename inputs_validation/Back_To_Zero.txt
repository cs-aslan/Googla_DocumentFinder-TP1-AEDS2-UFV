Back to zero  
So you want to blow us all to pieces  
Go meet your maker head hung down  
And give him all your explanations  
Go ahead throw down  
Back to zero back to nothing  
Straight to meltdown back to zero  
Thats where were heading  
  
Its a monkey living on my back  
I can feel my spine begin to crack  
Im looking to the future  
I keep on glancing back  
I prefer to rot  
I dont want to pop  
  
I think Ill head back to the jungle alright  
Dont want to see no big bad rumble too fright  
Back to zero thats where were going  
Back to nothing right now right now  
No heroes No more heroes  
Back to meltdown  
Thats where Im going back to zero  
  
My whole life is hanging on a thread  
Im the fly inside the spiders web  
Im looking to the future  
I keep on glancing back  
I prefer to rot  
I dont want to pop  
  
I worry about my great grandchildren  
Living ten miles beneath the ground  
I worry about their whole existence  
The whole damn things in doubt  
Back to zero thats where were going  
Back to nothing thats where were heading  
Straight to meltdown thats where were going  
Back to zero right now right now  
  
Were going nowhere  
Right now right now  
Back to zero thats where were heading  
Back to zero
