Rebel base rebel base  
Ahh yeah party people life in the place to be  
From the Civic Center in Boston Massachusetts  
The world famous Ultramagnetic MCs comin hard  
Word up  
Rockin for a standing room only crowd  
Of fiftyfive million eightthousand nine  
Rebel base rebel base  
Like this  
  
I got a radio small and yet portable  
Comfortable with the sound in audio  
Kickin high hats just tickin  
Spicy lyrics and words finger lickin good  
But you know I could  
Beat on steel break tons of wood down with a funky sound  
Square mixer the record is round  
And turning for the million Im earning  
Shock the rhythm and just keep learning  
  
This that is supposed to  
Grab your ear and have it move close  
To the speakers so you hear me clearly  
Im out yes to damage severely  
Youre very far and not yet nearly  
Expressing them but youre messing them up  
Your bummy rhymes Im dressing them up  
For the battle win like a snake Im rattlin  
The red ball with the wooden piece paddlin  
MCs stop the perpetrating  
And step off release the mic and Break North  
North North North  
  
Its like that yall  
Word  
Its like that yall  
Feel it  
  
Im like a merchandise a customized item  
Computer rapper for ducks who wanna bite em  
Stand back watch the man recite em  
It took a minute a second for me to write em  
And type em and hype em and psych em up  
Change my rhythm before I get stuck  
In an altitude beyond my own level  
I smack rappers and send em to the devil  
  
On a bus return em to dust  
I start infections reduce em to pus  
Im on that scanner and brains I blow out  
To old bones and skulls I throw out  
To the backyard and yes the wackyard  
You need a pipe theres the old crackyard  
Your last stop it has to be the graveyard  
Peakin Ced Gee Im speakin  
I smell smoke my tonsils are leakin  
Words in the right direction  
Add the beats with the lyrics perfection  
Stompin the bass and highs break north  
  
Word up Word  feel it  
  
Well Im rocks like a chain to a link  
I wear black while suckers wear pink  
Now think about my capital law  
I break domes and speak in the raw  
Im iller a South Bronx killer  
I chop rappers and throw em in the river  
Tastin as I swallow your liver  
Heres your brain for your girl I can give her  
Messages clues from a murderer  
And if shes ugly I never even heard of her  
  
Telling bugging detectives  
I wear a bag four contraceptives  
And aluminum wrapped in all foil  
I play a game slick to be oil  
For the other roaches MCs I boil  
And roast mega degrees  
I swarm around with a thousand of bees  
Absorb earth and the honey from trees  
Im the King Bee my girls the Queen Bee  
And when youre stung you never even seen me  
Vanish Kool Keith here to damage break north  
North north north  
  
Word up  
Like that yall its like that yall  
Its like that yall its like that yall  
Its like that yall its like that yall  
Its like that yall its like that yall  
  
Yeah yall better be ready for some guerilla warfare  
  
Rebel base  
Biggs Wedge lets close it up  
Biggs Wedge lets close it up  
Were goin in were goin in full throttle  
that oughta keep those fighters off our back
