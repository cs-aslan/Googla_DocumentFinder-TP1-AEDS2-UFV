I love you which is easy to see  
But I have to keep guessing how you feel about me  
You listen to the words that I speak  
But I feel that you listen with your tongue in your cheek  
  
Youre laughing at me  
I cant get sentimental  
For youre laughing at me I know  
  
I want to be romantic but I havent a chance  
Youve got a sense of humor and humor is death to romance  
  
Youre laughing at me  
Why do you think its funny  
When I say that I love you so  
  
Youve got me worried and Im all at sea  
For while Im crying for you  
Youre laughing at me
