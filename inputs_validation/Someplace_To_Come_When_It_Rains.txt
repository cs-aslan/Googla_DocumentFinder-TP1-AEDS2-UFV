The lady you see me with now and again in this dimly lit hideway place  
With eyes deep as midnight and smooth golden skin  
And that warm look of love on her face  
And you say aint he lucky just look at those eyes  
Shes worth any price you can name  
And you think that shes mine but you dont realize  
Im just someplace to come when it rains  
Someplace to hide when shes tired of the ride just someone to soften my pain  
Lord knows where she plays on her warm sunny days  
Im just someplace to come when she cant find the sun  
Just someplace to come when it rains  
The lady she dances so close in your arms you swear she can float you away  
And gives you the feeling youre safe from all harm  
Just as long as she holds you that way  
And I cant say its wrong cause Ive known all along  
That her lovin is worth all the pain  
So whenever she leads Ill be there when she needs someplace to come when it
rains  
Someplace to hide when shes tired
