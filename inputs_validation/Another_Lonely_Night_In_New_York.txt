Baby  oh no  Ive been stuck here  
Ive been searchin so long  
Baby dont go  millions of people were wrong  
In the dark of the cold light of day   
I will still be here  
If my heart and my soul had their way   
you would still be here  
  
Another lonely night in New York  
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down  
Cause my babys no longer around  
And my feeling can never be found  
Another lonely night in New York  
And my sorry eyes are lookin out on the world  
  
Baby  you said  a guy like me was way out of line  
And knowing today  your leavin was a question of time  
In the mist of a sweet summer rain you will find me here  
Should the sparkle of stars lose their way   
Ill be holdin near  
Another lonely night in New York  
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down  
Cause my babys no longer around  
And my feelings can never be found  
Another lonely night in New York  
And my sorry eyes are lookin out on the world  
  
break  
In the dark of the cold light of day   
you will find me here  
If my heart and my soul had their way   
you would still be here  
  
Another lonely night in New York  
And Im just a soul in the heart of the city  
Just another lonely night in New York  
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down  
Just another lonely night in New York  fade
