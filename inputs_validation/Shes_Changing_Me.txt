Now the wind  
Thats blowing out of the southwest  
Is telling me boy you better beware  
Here she comes and they call her the sweet omega  
And youll come to know the meaning of her stare  
Cause the only road that youll ever need to ride  
Is the one thats rolling out beyond her eyes  
And although shell bring you joy  
Dont you know she can destroy  
Oh lord shes changing me  
When youre down  
And youre headed for a bad night  
And youre seeing shapes of trouble in the stars  
Shell take your hand cause they call her the sweet omega  
Then shell take away the sadness in your heart  
Cause the only road that youll ever need to ride  
Is the one thats rolling out beyond her eyes  
And although shell bring you joy  
Dont you know she can destroy  
Oh lord shes changing me  
The only road youll ever need to ride  
The only road youll ever need to ride  
The only road youll ever need to ride  
Oh lord shes changing me
