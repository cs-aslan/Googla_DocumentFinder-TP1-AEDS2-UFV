God love and rest my soul  
With this sundown never ending  
The feel is gone yet you aint gonna see me fail  
I am the decadence of your world  
I am an eider covered in oil  
Happy hunting you doublefaced carnivore  
  
Tell me why  
No heart to cry  
Hang me high  
  
The music is dead the amen is said  
The kiss of faith is what I beg  
A loving heart n soul for sale  
  
Tell me why  
  
Leave me be  
And cease to tell me how to feel  
To grieve to shield myself from evil  
Leave me be  
Ode of lies is killing me  
Romanticize  
Till love do me part  
  
See me ruined by my own creations  
  
Leave me be  
  
Dead Boys alive but without sense  
I need a neardeath experience  
Heart once bold  
Now turned to stone  
Perfection my messenger from hell  
  
Wine turns to water  
Campfires freeze love letters burn  
Romance is lost  
Lord let me be wrong in this pain  
  
Temporary pain eternal shame  
To take part in this devils chess game  
Spit on me let go get rid of me  
And try to survive your stupidity
