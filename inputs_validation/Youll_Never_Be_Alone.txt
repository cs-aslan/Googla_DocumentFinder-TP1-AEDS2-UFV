Though youre far away from home  
Where the cold and lonely roam  
Dont forget the setting sun  
Shines on everyone  
And youll never be alone  
  
Youd give everything you own  
Saddle blanket rope and coat  
To be sitting by your side  
Right at Christmas time  
And youll never be alone  
  
Riding life for months on end  
Is sure to set you thinking too much  
Been so long i cant remember when  
The last time i felt your touch  
  
Though youre aching to the bone  
She loves you more than you will know  
Tell the trail to go to hell  
Just sing a noel  
And youll never be alone  
Whoa  
  
Yeah  
Riding life for months on end  
Is sure to set you thinking too much  
Its been so long i cant remember when  
The last time i felt your touch  
  
Though youre far away from home  
Where the cold and lonely roam  
Dont forget the setting sun  
Shines on everyone  
And youll never be alone  
  
Ill be sitting by your side  
Right at Christmas time  
And Ill never be alone
