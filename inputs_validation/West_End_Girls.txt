forever  
Sometimes youre better off dead  
Theres gun in your hand and its pointing at your head  
You think youre mad too unstable  
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables  
In a restaurant in a West End town  
Call the police theres a madman around  
Running down underground to a dive bar  
In a West End town  
  
In a West End town a dead end world  
The East End boys and West End girls  
In a West End town a dead end world  
The East End boys and West End girls  
West End girls  
  
Too many shadows whispering voices  
Faces on posters too many choices  
If when why what  
How much have you got  
Have you got it do you get it if so how often  
And which do you choose a hard or soft option  
How much do you need  
  
In a West End town a dead end world  
The East End boys and West End girls  
In a West End town a dead end world  
The East End boys and West End girls  
West End girls  
West End girls  
  
How much do you need  
In a West End town a dead end world  
The East End boys and West End girls  
Oooh West End town a dead end world  
East End boys West End Girls  
West End girls  
  
Youve got a heart of glass or a heart of stone  
Just you wait til I get you home  
Weve got no future weve got no past  
Here today built to last  
In every city in every nation  
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station  
How far have you been  
  
In a West End town a dead end world  
The East End boys and West End girls  
A West End town a dead end world  
East End Boys West End girls  
West End girls  
  
West End girls  
West End girls  
How far have you been  
  
Girls  
East End boys  
And West End girls  
And West End girls  
 forever  
And West End girls  
How far have you been  
  
East End boys  
The West End girls  
The West End boys  
And West End girls  
  
The West End girls  
The West End boys  
The West End girls
