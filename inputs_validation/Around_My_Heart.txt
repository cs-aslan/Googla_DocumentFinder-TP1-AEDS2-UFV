Out of my sight  
But the vision is still the same  
Out of my mind  
But the memory remains unchanged  
Stones thrown in anger hold twice the hurt  
Return to sender could only make things worse  
  
Girl youve got to break these chains around my heart  
Cause Ive been lonely too long  
Youve got to break these chains around my heart  
So I can finally get on with my life  
  
Dont ask me why  
Why Ive lived with this all alone  
Locked up inside  
And its cutting me to the bone  
Love is a stranger avoiding me  
Beware of dangers the only sign I see  
  
Girl youve got to break these chains around my heart  
Cause Ive been lonely too long  
Youve got to break these chains around my heart  
So I can finally get on with my life  
  
Are you listening  
Is there something that youd like to say  
Am I getting through  
Are you just gonna leave me this way  
Yeah  
  
Girl youve got to break these chains around my heart  
Before it tears me in two  
Youve got to break these chains around my heart  
Thats all Im asking of you  
Youve got to break these chains around my heart  
Cause Ive been lonely too long  
Youve got to break these chains around my heart  
So I can finally get on with my life
