Little grave Im grieving I will mend you  
Sweet revenge Im dreaming I will end you  
  
Ive been here since dawn of time  
Countless hatreds built my shrine  
I was born in angers flame  
He was Abel I was Cain  
I am here  
Im hell unbound  
Burn your kingdom to the ground  
To the ground  
  
Here comes revenge just for you  
Revenge you cant undo  
Revenge its killing me  
Revenge set me free  
Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth  
A life for a life its my burden of proof  
Revenge just for you  
Revenge  
You ask forgiveness I give you sweet revenge  
  
I return this nightmare I will find you  
Sleepless cloaked in despair Im behind you  
  
Man has made me oh so strong  
Blurring lines of right and wrong  
Far too late for frail amends  
Now its come to sweet revenge  
Desperate hands  
That lose control  
Have no mercy on your soul  
On your soul  
  
Here comes revenge just for you  
Revenge you cant undo  
Revenge is killing me  
Revenge set me free  
Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth  
A life for a life its my burden of proof  
Revenge just for you  
Revenge  
You ask forgiveness I give you sweet revenge  
  
Here comes revenge just for you  
Revenge you cant undo  
Revenge is killing me  
Revenge set me free  
Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth  
A life for a life its my burden of proof  
Revenge just for you  
Revenge  
You ask forgiveness I give you sweet revenge  
  
Sweet revenge
