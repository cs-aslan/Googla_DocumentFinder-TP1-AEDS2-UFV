Verse 1  
When your legs dont work like they used to before  
And I cant sweep you off of your feet  
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love  
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks  
And darling I will be loving you till were 70  
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23  
And Im thinking bout how  
  
PreChorus 1  
People fall in love in mysterious ways  
Maybe just a touch of a hand  
Well me I fall in love with you every single day  
And I just wanna tell you I am  
  
Chorus  
So honey now  
Take me into your loving arms  
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars  
Place your head on my beating heart  
Im thinking out loud  
And maybe we found love right where we are  
  
Verse 2  
When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades  
And the crowds dont remember my name  
When my hands dont play the strings the same way  
Mmm I know you will still love me the same  
Cause honey your soul could never grow old its evergreen  
And baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory  
And Im thinking about how  
  
PreChorus 2  
People fall in love in mysterious ways  
Maybe its all part of a plan  
Well Ill just keep on making the same mistakes  
Hoping that youll understand  
  
Chorus  
But baby now  
Take me into your loving arms  
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars  
Place your head on my beating heart  
Im thinking out loud  
And maybe we found love right where we are oh oh  
  
La la la la la la  
  
Chorus  
So baby now  
Take me into your loving arms  
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars  
Oh darling  
Place your head on my beating heart  
Im thinking out loud  
That maybe we found love right where we are  
And baby we found love right where we are  
And we found love right where we are
