Oh I know that Youll be watching over me  
Your shining light has changed my life  
Its like Ive found my way home  
I know Youre near hear You loud and clear  
I could live on this feeling alone  
Everywhere I go You are right there beside me  
Anytime of night or day  
Your name is on my lips Your love I cant resist  
Got to be with You wherever You are  
I want You memorized so when I close my eyes  
All I have to do is keep loving You by heart  
I dont have to see see You to believe  
That Your not going away  
I know Youll be watching over me  
Youre the shelter thats keeping me safe  
I know Your arms they can reach out to hold me  
Even when Im feeling alone  
Your name is on my lips Your love I cant resist  
Got to be with You wherever You are  
I want You memorized so when I close my eyes  
All I have to do is keep loving You by heart  
Comes naturally like every breath I breathe  
Dont have to think its second nature to me  
I close my eyes and You are there with me  
You know me You see me You hear me You heal me  
Your name is on my lips Your love I cant resist  
Got to be with You wherever You are  
I want You memorized so when I close my eyes  
All I have to do is keep loving You  
Your name is on my lips Your love I cant resist  
Got to be with You wherever You are  
I want You memorized so when I close my eyes  
All I have to do is keep loving You by heart
