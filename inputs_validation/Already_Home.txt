Chorus  
Every night up in the club  
Gettin money with the thugs  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then there was you  
And I dont wan to be a player no more  
Every night up in the club  
Trickin with a different girl  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then I met you  
Girl you changed my mind  
  
Verse  
Walk up in the club saw her in the club  
At first sight I fell in love  
Im not supposed to be falling in love  
Cuz Im a hustla and a playa  
But she had the baddest body to me  
The prettiest eyes I ever did see  
Her smile had me gone as soon as she did it  
Cuz shorty got a booty and man Ive got to hit it  
Lil mama doin her thing and I love it  
On the floor makin it swing and I love it  
Thick clothes she dont mind when I love ya  
And now I can hit it when I want it  
  
Bridge  
She she might be my lover  
She makes me want no other  
She dont care bout going to the strip club  
Cuz she want to go too  
And Ive never met a girl like you  
That makes me want to settle down  
  
Chorus  
Every night up in the club  
Gettin money with the thugs  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then there was you  
And I dont wan to be a player no more  
Every night up in the club  
Trickin with a different girl  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then I met you  
Girl you changed my mind  
  
Verse 2  
Imma spend my money on her  
Pop champagne in the club with her  
Hit the mall and take a shopping  
I dont know maybe some diamonds for her  
She deserves a real baller in her life and Im that man  
Who pick still me ladies let me see your hands  
  
Bridge  
She she might be my lover  
She makes me want no other  
She dont care bout going to the strip club  
Cuz she want to go too  
And Ive never met a girl like you  
That makes me want to settle down  
  
Chorus  
Every night up in the club  
Gettin money with the thugs  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then there was you  
And I dont wan to be a player no more  
Every night up in the club  
Trickin with a different girl  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then I met you  
Girl you changed my mind  
  
Brakedown  
None of these chicks can fuck with my baby  
None of these chicks can fuck with my baby  
And none of these chicks can fuck with my baby  
Fuck with my baby  
Fuck with my baby  
None of these chicks can fuck with my baby  
None of these chicks can fuck with my baby  
None of these chicks can fuck with my baby  
Fuck with my baby  
Fuck with my baby  
  
Chorus  
Every night up in the club  
Gettin money with the thugs  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then there was you  
And I dont wan to be a player no more  
Every night up in the club  
Trickin with a different girl  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then I met you  
Girl you changed my mind
