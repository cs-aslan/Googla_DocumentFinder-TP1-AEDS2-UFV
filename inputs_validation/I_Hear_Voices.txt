Sometimes I dont think you motherfuckers  
Understand where Im coming from  
Where Im tryin to get to  
Sometimes I hear voices  
I cant see it can you see it  
Turn the lights on  
Check this out  
  
Make moneys the motto staying desparados  
New chance of hitting the lotto  
Lets take it to the neck wit this bottle  
Get in the Eldorado  
And break from this bitch at full throttle  
You like fuckin fashion models  
That only waddle with cats that flash stacks  
Or squabble with niggas that flash gats  
Then squirt hot pellets out their nozzles  
And leave a nigga hurting on the block  
Sounding like when you gargle  
Them hero niggas that plot  
Them zero niggas get got  
And never get a chance to bust shot  
Curled up in a knot then forgot on the spot  
Then Im on the run wit a gun smoking hot  
All around the worlds where I go  
Places that only I know  
Goodfella not gunshotto  
And Im tellin niggas make moneys the motto  
Fuck the niggas that squable  
And I hit them back and fourteen hollow take that  
  
I hear voices inside  
And I see crime dont die  
And I need changes  
Oh please please please  
Dont go Dont go  
  
Im just trying to get my money right  
Dont fuck wit my money  
I wont fuck wit your money  
If you fuck with my money  
I make you like one of them presidents  
Feel me  
  
Representing my money for the love of my money  
I leave a man stiffer than the mummy  
Now dont miss it if I catch them coming for me  
When I try to tell a dummy  
You took it like I was saying something funny  
Took it like my word wasnt shit like I wasnt legit  
What occurs is gonna be hard to forget  
Thats something Ill never permit  
When I feel my eye twitch things happen  
And my voice start speaking a diffrent pitch  
Trying to keep things lowlow  
They dont really know though  
Bad Boy the motherfuckin logo  
Stay on your toes  
They shouldnt get it mistaken  
Hope they dont think Im faking  
Mess around and get thier life taken and shaken  
You know the rule of thumb be  
Dont try to take nothing from me  
I rule it wit a street stay slummy  
Make moneys the motto fuck the niggas that squabble  
I know I might be hard for you to swallow

I hear voices inside  
And I see crime dont die  
And I need changes  
Oh please please please  
Dont go Dont go  
  
Sometimes I just feel like yall dont understand  
Where Im coming from where Im trying to get to  
Shit is really deep my shit is deep  
  
They dont have a direct understanding of me  
Fuck what they planning for me  
I just wont accept the bullshit that they handing me  
Still standing after the trouble remains its me  
If you trying to make it clear and explaining to me  
And all that negative shit pertaining to me  
What ya think I claiming to be  
A straight heart staying with me  
I can tell its about to go down  
I told them slow down before I send the low down  
And skip out of town  
And I dont wanna but Ill do it if I gotta  
The situation is serious and getting hotter  
You know what they say about those that slow on the trigger  
Less then a second too late and you one dead nigga  
So I take aim and I squeaze and deliver  
Like I told them just to let him know til he figures out  
Its make moneys the motto  
Something yall should follow  
And I dont got no time for the squabble  
Ya feel me  
  
I hear voices inside  
And I see crime dont die  
And I need changes  
Oh please please please  
Dont go Dont go  
  
Sometimes you just get tired of shit  
Sometimes you just get fed up  
Dont hate me hate yourself motherfuckers  
Dont hate me hate yourself  
Cause I aint never gonna stop

And ever and ever and ever
