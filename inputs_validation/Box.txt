I was living in a small mind with no lifeline  
And no messages can reach me from the outside  
When I looked out over the horizon  
Didnt notice the sun was setting or just rising  
  
Then it hit me maybe bit me  
Then I knew quite a few would not go with me  
I didnt know exactly where I would be going  
But I had to let this river in me flowing  
  
What a ride  
When you open your eyes  
For the very first time  
A real surprise  
  
I started living outside of the box  
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop  
Living outside of the box  
Cause Im not gonna be anybody that Im not  
  
I always knew this day would come  
When I got off my back found some motivation  
Ive been living on the other side  
Come hell or high water every moment Im alive  
  
I was living on a fault line the fault was all mine  
And this unstable ground found me down half the time  
But I had enough I had to get up  
I had to shrug it all off cause its the same old stuff  
  
Then it hit me you wont permit me  
To be an individual just doesnt fit me  
But I decided that its going to be living  
Yeah I decided Im escaping from your prison  
  
What a high  
When you open your mind  
For the very first time  
A real surprise  
  
I started living outside of the box  
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop  
Living outside of the box  
Cause Im not gonna be anybody that Im not  
  
I always knew this day would come  
When I got off my back found some motivation  
Ive been living on the other side  
Come hell or high water every moment Im alive  
  
So long conformity  
And ambiguality is a new priority  
All it takes for heaven sakes  
Is to figure out the face and learn to separate  
  
I started living outside for the box  
Taking my time when I always used to rush  
Living outside of the box  
Cause Im not gonna be anybody that Im not  
  
I always knew this day would come  
When I broke down the walls for my liberation  
Ive been living on the other side  
Come hell or high water every moment Im alive  
  
Oh living outside of the box  
Oh living outside of the box  
Oh living outside  
  
Ha ha ha  
I always knew this day would come  
When I got off my back found some motivation  
Oh living outside of the box of the box of your life  
Of everything that seems that nice
