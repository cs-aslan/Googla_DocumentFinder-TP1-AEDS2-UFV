My mother was a witch she was burned alive  
Thankless little bitch for the tears I cried  
Take her down now dont want to see her face  
All blistered and burnt cant hide my disgrace  
  
Twentyseven everyone was nice  
Gotta see em make em pay the price  
See their bodies out on the ice  
Take my time  
  
Am I evil Yes I am  
Am I evil I am man yes I am  
  
As I watched my mother die I lost my head  
Revenge now I sought to break with my bread  
Taking no chances you come with me  
Ill split you to the bone help set you free  
  
Twentyseven everyone was nice  
Gotta see em make em pay the price  
See their bodies out on the ice  
Take my time  
  
Am I evil Yes I am  
Am I evil I am man yes I am  
  
On with the action now Ill strip your pride  
Ill spread your blood around Ill see you ride  
Your face is scarred with steel wounds deep and neat  
Like a double dozen before ya smells so sweet

My face is long forgot my face not my own  
Sweet and timely whore take me home

My soul is longing for await my heir  
Sent to avenge my mother sweep myself  
My face is long forgot my face not my own  
Sweet and timely whore take me home
