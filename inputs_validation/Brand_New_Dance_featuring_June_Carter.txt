Baby youre tired I can see in your eyes I know how you feel  
Weve been together too long to conceal  
Whats in our hearts maybe we should part but after so many years  
That would only bring loneliness sorrow and tears and anyway  
  
I never could never would never will ever kill whats between us  
So lets try again well start a brand new dance between old friends  
  
There will always be days when it dont seem to pay  
When it just doesnt rhyme  
Well lets bound to happen some of the time  
Our best days aint gone we dont need to move on  
Well maybe we could try  
But I dont think you can make it and neither could I and anyway  
  
I never could never would never will ever kill whats between us  
So lets try again well start a brand new dance between old friends  
  
Baby come here love aint disappeared youre just feeling low  
And let me tell you my darling its a feeling I know  
It dont mean too much we just got out of touch  
Well thats easy to change  
Cause loving you aint too hard to arrange  
And anyway  
  
I never could never would never will ever kill whats between us  
So lets try again well start a brand new dance between old friends
