The barstools built for dreamers  
Well fit fine and find  
All the worlds dreams have died  
But tonight theyre only taking thirsty people  
Whove been pullin on their drinks  
From a glass that lies a bar length wide  
And in the drink there swim the swimmers  
And those whose swims have dried  
Take another look take another pull  
Take another pour take another pull  
Before you take a ride  
  
Heir to an open barstool right theres one by Mary the Fool  
Mary sees the bartenders knees  
And she says that its a bottle that she was born to be  
And I say thats cool just right right for a fool  
Thinkin whiskey she bought me a drink  
I wont cross a word of what the lady thinks  
  
Pray I dont cross what the lady thinks  
Shes been thinking out too loud though  
This time I cant hear the pinball machine  
Well theres a birdman playing tiny little sideways bongos  
Pulling all those words down down down  
Look at how the numbers glow  
In the glass there rolls the iron ball  
And a quarter states the toll thats all thats all  
You take another look take another pull  
Take another pour take another pull  
Before you take a chance  
  
Look at your hands theyre just right for a new kinda dance  
Just forget what your bodies just done  
And ride all the waves that the drums rest on  
Like the smallest babies do ya know the little newborn babies do  
If theres some food that the moon feeds on  
A baby wont hold it back wont hold it back  
  
Baby doesnt know what I just said  
Baby doesnt know the words that I just used  
Babies havent learned any words yet  
Babies havent been used by any words yet  
People only think people only talk  
People only think in words they already know  
The babies havent learned any words yet no  
They only know what the people feel  
They dont really care what the people think  
They only care what the people feel  
Music only knows what the people feel  
Babies only care and hear what the people feel feel
