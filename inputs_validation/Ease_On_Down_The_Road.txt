Pick your left foot up  
When your right foots down  
Come on legs keep movin  
Dont you lose no ground  
You just keep on keepin  
On the road that you choose  
Dont you give up walkin  
Cause you gave up shoes no

Cause there maybe times  
When you think you lost your mind  
And the steps youre takin  
Leave you three four steps behind  
But the road youre walking  
Might be long sometimes  
You just keep on steppin  
And youll just be fine yeah  
  
Ease on down ease on down the road  
Come on ease on down  
Ease on down the road  
Dont you carry nothing  
That might be a load  
Come on ease on down  
Ease on down the road  
  
Well there maybe times  
When you wish you wasnt born  
And you wake one morning  
Just to find your courages gone  
But just know that feeling  
Only last a little while  
You stick with us  
And well show you how to smile yeah

Get em up goin down ease on down  
Get em up goin down ease on down  
Get em up get em up ease on down
