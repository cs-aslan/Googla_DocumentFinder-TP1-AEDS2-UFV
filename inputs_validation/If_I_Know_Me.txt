We both said some things I know we never meant  
And when I slammed the door tonight you wondered where I went  
If I know you youre probably wonderin what to do  
Youre thinkin that Im gone for good if I know you  
  
But if I know me Ill turn this car around  
I wont get halfway through town and Ill be sorry  
Ill stop and call and youll say youre sorry too  
And Ill come runnin back to you if I know me  
  
Sometimes I lose my head say things to break your heart  
Forgettin if I lost your love it would tear my world apart  
If I know you you didnt mean one single thing you said  
Truth be known youre dyin cryin lyin there in bed  
  
But if I know me Ill turn this car around  
I wont get halfway through town and Ill be sorry  
Ill stop and call and youll say youre sorry too  
And Ill come runnin back to you if I know me  
  
If I know me and I know me
