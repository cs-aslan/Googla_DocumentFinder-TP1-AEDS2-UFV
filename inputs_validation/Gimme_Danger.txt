Gimme danger little stranger  
And Ill feel you bleed  
Gimme danger little stranger  
And Ill heal your disease  
  
Theres nothing in my dreams  
But some ugly memories  
Kiss me like the ocean breeze  
  
Well if you will be my lover  
I will shiver and sing  
But if you wont be my master  
I will do anything  
  
Theres nothing left alive  
But some dark glassy eyes  
Raise my fears one more time  
  
Come on little danger die a little stranger  
Swear youre gonna feel my hell  
Come on little stranger die a little later  
Swear youre gonna feel my hell  
Swear youre gonna feel my hell  
  
Gimme danger  
Little stranger  
Gimme danger  
Little stranger  
Gimme danger  
Every day  
  
Can you feel it  
Can you feel it  
Can you feel it  
I gotta feel it  
I gotta feel it  
I gotta feel it  
You gotta feel it I gotta feel it  
I wanna feel it
