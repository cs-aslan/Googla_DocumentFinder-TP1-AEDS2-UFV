Bluebirds over the mountain  
Seagulls over the seaeaea  
Bluebirds over the mountain  
Bring my baby to me  
  
A boy and a girl they once found love  
To each it seemed like heaven above  
He looked into her eyes and said  
Ooo wee baby youre so good for my head  
  
Bluebirds over the mountain  
Seagulls over the seaeaea  
Bluebirds over the mountain  
Bring my baby to me  
  
Oh everyone in every land  
Please give me a helping hand  
If you see her all alone  
Oh tell my baby wont you please come home  
  
Bluebirds over the mountain  
Seagulls over the seaeaea  
Bluebirds over the mountain  
Bring my baby to me  
  
Oh bring my baby back  
I dont know why shes been so long  
But all I know is that shes gone  
Oh bring my baby back to me  
Well Im in pain cant you see  
  
A boy and a girl they once found love  
To each it seemed like heaven above  
I guess thats why we fell in love  
And now shes gone and all I have to say is  
  
Bluebirds over the mountain  
Seagulls over the sea yeah  
Bluebirds over the mountain  
Bring my baby to me  
  
Bring my baby  
Oooo baby  
Oooo oooo oooo oooo
