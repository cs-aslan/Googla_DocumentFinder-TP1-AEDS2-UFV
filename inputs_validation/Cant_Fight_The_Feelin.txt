I feel a little peculiar  
Feeling kinda strange  
I dont know what it is  
But I like the change  
That comes over me  
Whenever hes around  
Its as if my feet  
Dont even touch the ground  
  
Cause when Im feeling down  
Hes there to pick me up  
and when I talk too much  
He doesnt interrupt  
Let me tell you theres no better guy  
This is how it makes me feel inside  
  
I wanna dance dance mmm  
I wanna play play  
Well can you hear my heartbeat boom boom  
A million miles away  
He wont stop stop no no  
Till I drop drop yeah  
And every day and night he tells me  
Im so special he could never give me up  
  
Chorus  
Im hooked on a feeling  
A natural high  
You better believe it  
And the reason why  
Its a thing called love  
It makes me feel so alive  
And I cant fight the feeling  
  
Somebody told me once  
You only get one chance  
So live your life  
And do the best you can  
Once a day goes by  
You never get it back  
So live every minute  
Like it was your last  
  
Just dance dance mmm  
Come on play play  
And tell somebody you love them I love you  
At least once a day  
And dont stop stop  
Till you drop drop  
I didnt know that wanting someone so special  
Would come along to steal my heart  
  
Chorus  
  
Love love love  
And dont let it slip  
That was all you need  
If you taste it once  
It wont be enough  
  
Chorus  
  
Cant fight the feeling  
I said no cant cant cant  
Cant fight the feeling  
Cant fight oh  
You better believe it  
You better believe it  
Cant fight the feeling
