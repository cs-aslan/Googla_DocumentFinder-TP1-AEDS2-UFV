Everybody wanna be fly til you swat em  
But who am I to talk I aint shittin roses  
We in in the same picture but we all got different poses  
Im looking in my rearview I see the World in it  
I try to slow down but I get rear ended  
PAUSE Like a red light Im dead right  
Highway to Heaven God do you see my headlights  
They say you dont know what youre doing till you stop doing it  
Well call me clueless cause I do this  
  
Attention all shooters Im a shooting star  
Life is a course and Imma shoot for Par  
Im searching for today instead I found tomorrow  
And I put that shit right back like Ill see when I find tomorrow  
Young Money CMR Blood like a scar  
Weezy F baby and I do it all for yall
