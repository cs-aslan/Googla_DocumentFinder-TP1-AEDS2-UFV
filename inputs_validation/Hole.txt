Tired  
Everything around me  
I smile  
I dont feel a thing no  
  
Im so far from where I need to be  
Ive given up on faith on everything  
All I want all I need  
Is some peace  
  
Chorus  
Theres a hole  
Inside of me  
Its so cold  
Slowly killing me  
  
Secrets  
Eating at the core of me  
Shut off  
Trusting all the lies I breathe  
  
Im so far from where I need to be  
Ive given up on faith on everything  
All I wanted all I needed  
Was some peace  
  
Theres a hole  
Inside of me  
Its so damn cold  
Slowly killing me  
  
Sinking ever so slowly  
So far from where I should be  
No hands reaching out for me  
Help me help me  
  
Somethings gone  
I can feel it  
Its all wrong  
Im so sick of this  
Yeah  
  
Chorus x2
