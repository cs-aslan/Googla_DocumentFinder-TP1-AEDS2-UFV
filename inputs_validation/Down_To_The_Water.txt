The waves come in  
Crash on the shoreline  
Salty water dont you know  
Its yours yours and mine  
So grab your girl  
And dont go wastin time  
And lets go down to the water tonight  
  
White capped clouds  
Dance in the sunlight  
Purple fishes watch  
And show you some of their delight  
The weathers fine  
And everythings all right  
So lets go down to the water tonight  
Lets go down to the water tonight  
  
Come on down come on down  
Come on down down to the water  
Come on down come on down  
Come on down down to the water  
Down to the water  
  
Island music  
Sways with a palm tree  
Friends of mine lay back  
And talk of times that werent so free  
So lets have fun  
And that means you and me  
And lets go down to the water tonight  
Lets go down to the water tonight  
  
Down down down to the water  
Down down down to the water  
Down down down to the water  
Down down down to the water  
Down down down to the water  
Down down down to the water
