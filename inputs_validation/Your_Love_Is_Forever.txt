Sublime in the summertime warm and lazy    
These are perfect days like Heavens about here  
But unlike summer came and went  
Your love is forever  
I feel it and my heart knows  
That we share it together  
  
Resigned to the wintertimes cold and dreary  
Peering into fire flames burning I know  
That unlike winter came and went  
Your love is forever  
I feel it and my heart knows  
That we share it together  
  
I feel it and my heart knows youre the one  
The guiding light in all your love shines on  
The only lover worth it all  
Your love is forever
