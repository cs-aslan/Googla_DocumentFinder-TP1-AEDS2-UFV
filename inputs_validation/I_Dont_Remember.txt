I got no means to show identification  
I got no papers show you what I am  
Youll have to take me just the way that you find me  
Whats gone is gone and I do not give a damn  
  
Empty stomach empty head  
I got empty heart and empty bed  
I dont remember  
I dont remember  
  
I dont remember I dont recall  
I got no memory of anything at all  
I dont remember I dont recall  
I got no memory of anything  
Anything at all  
  
Strange is your language and I have no decoder  
Why dont you make your intentions clear  
With eyes to the sun and your mouth to the soda  
Saying Tell me the truth you got nothing to fear  
  
Stop staring at me like a bird of prey  
Im all mixed up I got nothing to say  
I dont remember  
I dont remember  
  
I dont remember I dont recall  
I got no memory of anything at all  
I dont remember I dont recall  
I got no memory of anything  
Anything at all  
  
I dont remember I dont recall  
I got no memory of anything at all  
I dont remember I dont recall  
I got no memory of anything  
Absolutely anything at all  
I dont remember
