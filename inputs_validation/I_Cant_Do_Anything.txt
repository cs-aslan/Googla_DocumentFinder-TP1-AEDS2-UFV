I cant write  
And I cant sing  
I cant do anything  
I cant read  
And I cant spell  
I cant even get to hell  
I cant love  
And I cant hate  
I cant even hesitate  
I cant dance  
And I cant walk  
I cant even try to talk  
  
Freedom tried to strangle me  
With my plastic popper beads  
But I hit him back  
With my pet rat  
Yeah I hit him back  
With my pet rat  
  
I cant spit  
And I cant kick  
I cant even be thick  
I cant read  
And I cant spell  
I cant even get to hell  
I cant love  
And I cant hate  
I cant even hesitate  
I cant dance  
And I cant walk  
I cant even try to talk
