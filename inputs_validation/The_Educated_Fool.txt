Im an educated fool  
So I dont know what it is Im supposed to do  
About this awkward situation  
Thats been forced down right upon me  
  
As Im walking down into  
On my own into the valley of life  
Got a lifetime of experience  
Yeah Ive got so much to give  
  
Open the page at chapter one  
Could this just be that lifes just begun  
Forever within your darker thoughts Reflecting on everything youve been  
Taught  
  
Never felt this way before  
Seems that somebodys just opened the door  
To the book of life or is it death  
Theres ever anyway out  
  
Someones looking down on me  
To the very inner core of my soul  
They wont tell me what they see  
But I really want to know  
  
I want to leave my life on my own  
I want to lift the unturned stone  
I want to walk right into the fire  
I want to live out all my desires  
  
I want to go and see the fire burn  
I want to see and feel my world turn  
I want to know what more theres to learn  
I want to pass the point of no return  
  
Do you really want to be  
Just another one statistic or feel  
  
That you really should aspire  
That you really do deserve more  
  
Do you ever really fell  
That you have so much potential inside  
What you really have to give  
Could be realized so much more  
  
Time will flow  
And I will follow  
Time will go  
But I will follow  
  
I want to feel what lifes like respond  
I want to meet my father beyond  
I want to walk right into the light  
I want to feel no fear but delight  
  
I want to leave my life on my own  
I want to lift the unturned stone  
I want to walk right into the fire  
I want to live out all my desires  
  
The educated fool
