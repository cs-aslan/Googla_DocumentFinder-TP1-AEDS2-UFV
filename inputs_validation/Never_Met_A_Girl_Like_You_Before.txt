Ive never known a girl like you before  
Now just like in a song from days of yore  
Here you come a knockin knockin on my door  
And Ive never met a girl like you before  
  
You give me just a taste so I want more  
Now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw  
Cos youve got me crawlin crawlin on the floor  
And Ive never met a girl like you before  
  
Youve made me acknowledge the devil in me  
I hope to God Im talkin metaphorically  
Hope that Im talkin allegorically  
Know that Im talkin about the way I feel  
And Ive never known a girl like you before  
Never never never never  
Never known a girl like you before  
  
This old towns changed so much  
Dont feel like I belong  
Too many protest singers  
Not enough protest songs  
And now youve come along  
Yes youve come along  
And Ive never met a girl like you before
