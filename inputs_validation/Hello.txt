Well I dont feel as if I know you  
You take up all my time  
The days are long and the nights will throw you away  
Cause the sun wont shine  
  
Nobody ever mentions the weather to make or break your day  
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play  
  
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away  
And its never gonna be the same  
Cause the years are fallin by like the rain  
Its never gonna be the same  
Until my minds knew comes to my house and says  
Hello  
  
There aint no sense in feeling lonely  
They got no faith in you  
But Ive got a feeling you still owe me  
So wipe from your shoes  
  
Nobody ever mentions the weather to make or break your day  
Nobody ever seems to remember the life is a game we play  
  
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away  
And its never gonna be the same  
Cause the years are fallin by like the rain  
Its never gonna be the same  
Until my minds knew comes to my house and says  
Hello hello  
  
Hello hello hello  
Hello hello  
Hello hello  
Oh yeah
