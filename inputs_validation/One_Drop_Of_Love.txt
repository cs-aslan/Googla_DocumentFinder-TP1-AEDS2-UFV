Alright  
Yeah  
  
Look at all the people livin on the street  
It dont seem they got nothin to eat  
Children play with guns and they aint toys  
What will become of all my girls and boys  
  
It dont take brains to figure it out  
Everyday the newspaper headlines shout  
Its gonna take a miracle from above  
Either that just one drop of love  
  
One drop of love  
One drop of love will make the world alright  
One drop of love  
One drop of love will unite black and white  
One drop of love  
One drop of love to make a new start  
One  
One drop of love everyones heart  
  
I know

Its getting harder everyday to make ends meet  
When you do its hard to stay on your feet  
Who are your real friends You cant keep track  
While youre wathin you front youre gettin stapped in the bag  
  
I aint no genius but I know  
Theres only one way to make this hatred go  
People I tried it now Im beggin you  
Just  
Reach in your heart and give up one drop too  
  
One drop of love  
One drop of love will make the world alright  
One drop of love

One drop of love

One drop of love will plant a seed  
Maybe everyone will follow our lead  
Then theyll see one drop can grow  
Cause wilt enough drops a whole river flows  
A whole river flows from one drop of love
