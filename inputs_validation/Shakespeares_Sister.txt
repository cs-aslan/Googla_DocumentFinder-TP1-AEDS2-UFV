Young bones groan  
And the rocks below say   
Throw your skinny body down son  
  
But Im going to meet the one I love  
So please dont stand in my way  
Because Im going to meet the one I love  
No Mamma let me go  
  
Young bones groan  
And the rocks below say   
Throw your white body down  
  
But Im going to meet the one I love  
At last At last At last  
Im going to meet the one I love  
Ladeda ladeda  
No Mamma let me go  
No  
  
I thought that if you had  
An acoustic guitar  
Then it meant that you were  
A Protest Singer  
Oh I can smile about it now  
But at the time it was terrible  
No Mamma let me go  
No
