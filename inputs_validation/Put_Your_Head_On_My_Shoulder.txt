Hold me in your arms baby  
Squeeze me oh so tight  
Show me that you love me too  
  
Put your lips next to mine dear  
Wont you kiss me once baby  
Just a kiss goodnight  
Maybe you and I will fall in love  
  
People say that loves a game  
A game you just cant win  
If theres a way  
Ill find it some day  
And then this fool will rush in  
  
Put your head on my shoulder  
Whisper in my ear baby  
Words I want to hear tell me  
Tell me that you love me too  
  
Put your head on my shoulder  
Whisper in my ear baby  
Put your head on my shoulder
