I am not American  
Though I live in North America  
Which is part of the Americas  
Which should make me an American  
Geographically Canadians  
Are certainly Americans  
As are Venisallians  
But not Hawaiians  
Theyre out in the middle of the Ocean  
Just like the you S Virgin Islands  
Who shoudnt say they are Americans  
Or even Virgins  
How could two whole continents  
Lose their name to one Constitute  
Where were we when the you S Went  
And took the word American away  
But to be fair to them  
Their other name options  
Like you S A Ers or United Statesians  
Were pretty bad  
Still I want to be as American  
As the French are European  
Or those in Antarctica are Antarctican  
Even if theyre just penguins  
That leaves us Canadians as Northern North American  
But Alaskas Norther curse them  
Were surrounded by Americans  
Americans Americans  
I just called those you S A Ers Americans  
A name meant for two continents not just them  
For if I said I was American  
People would probably think I came from Maine  
Still I think I have a plan  
Lets become Antarctican  
And join up with the penguins  
For just like them were not American
