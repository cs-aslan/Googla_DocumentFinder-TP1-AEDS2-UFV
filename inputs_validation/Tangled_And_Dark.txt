Gonna get into it babe  
Down where its tangled and dark  
Way on into it baby  
Down where your fears are parked  
Gonna tell the truth about it babe  
Honey thats the hardest part  
When we get through it baby  
Youre gonna give up your heart  
Gonna get into it baby  
Gonna give them demons a call babe  
Way on into it baby  
Gonna find out once and for all  
Gonna get a little risky baby  
Honey thats my favorite part  
When we get through it baby  
Gonna give up our hearts  
Gonna give up our hearts  
Well theres no turnin back  
No turnin back this time  
Well theres no turnin back  
No turnin back  
No use in runnin  
Its always the same  
You can count on the panic  
Its the faces that change  
We might have a chance  
To get this love off the block  
So take a deep breath  
Lets look under that rock now baby  
Gonna get into it baby  
Down where its tangled and dark no no baby  
Way on into it baby  
Down where your fears are parked  
Gonna tell the truth about it baby  
Honey thats the hardest part  
When we get through it baby  
Youre gonna give up  
If we get through it baby  
Youre gonna give up youre gonna give up  
When we get through it baby
