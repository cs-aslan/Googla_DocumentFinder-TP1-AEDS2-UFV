Every night I say my prayers  
Like throwing confetti in the air  
I dont need perfect but Ill take fair  
Ive learned to drive while I cry  
Figured out the answers always why  
Ive been brave and Ive been scared  
  
Im just a girl like you  
Im just a girl like you  
He may break my heart too  
But thats a chance I gotta take  
Just like you did  
  
Do what I can to survive  
Back and forth from a woman to a child  
Im coming up for air  
Were not all that far apart  
Both fragile works of art  
See the colors that we share  
  
But Im just a girl like you  
Im just a girl like you  
He may break my heart too  
But thats a chance I gotta take  
Just like you did  
  
Oh Ive always believed in him and me  
I get you I wish that youd get me  
  
Yeah well Im just a girl like you  
Im just a girl like you  
He may break my heart too  
But thats a chance I gotta take  
Just like you did  
  
Oh Im just a girl like you  
Im just a girl like you  
He may break my heart too  
But thats a chance I gotta take  
Just like you
