I like your pants around your feet  
And I like the dirt thats on your knees  
And I like the way you still say please while youre looking up at me  
Youre like my favorite damn disease  
  
And I love the places that we go  
And I love the people that you know  
And I love the way you cant say No too many long lines in a row  
I love the powder on your nose  
  
Ouh and now I know who you are  
It wasnt that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did you wonder why  
  
And now I know who you are  
It wasnt that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did you wonder why  
  
I like the freckles on your chest  
And I like the way you like me best  
And I like the way youre not impressed while you put me to the test  
  
I like the white stains on your dress  
And I love the way you pass the check  
And I love the good times that you wreck The good times that you wreck  
  
And I love your lack of self respect  
While youre passed out on the deck  
I love my hands around your neck  
  
Ouh and I know who you are  
It wasnt that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did you wonder why  
  
And I know who you are  
It wasnt that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did you wonder why  
Why not before you never tried  
Gone for good and this is it  
  
I like your pants around your feet  
And I like the dirt thats on your knees  
And I like the way you still say please while youre looking up at me  
Youre like my favorite damn disease  
  
And I hate the places that we go  
And I hate the people that you know  
And I hate the way you cant say No too many long lines in a row  
I hate the powder on your nose  
  
Ouh and now I know who you are  
It wasnt that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did you wonder why  
  
And now I know who you are  
It wasnt that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did you wonder why  
Why not before you never tried  
Gone for good and this is it  
Ooh
