Its been like this from the start  
One piece after another to make my heart  
You mistake the game for being smart  
Stand here sell this and hit your mark  
But the sound of the steel  
And the crush and the grind  
Itll scream cause who am I to decide my life  
But in time it all dies  
Theres nothing left inside  
Just rusted metal that was never even mine  
  
I would scream  
But Im just this hollow shell  
Waiting here  
Begging please  
God set me free so I can feel  
  
Hey  
Stop trying to live my life for me  
I need to breathe  
Im not your robot  
Stop telling me Im part of this big machine  
Im breaking free  
Cant you see  
I can love  
I can speak  
Without somebody else operating me  
You gave me eyes and now I see  
Im not your robot  
Im just me  
  
All this time  
Ive been misled  
There was nothing but crossed wires in my head  
Ive been taught to think about what I feel  
Doesnt matter at all until you say its real  
  
I would scream  
But Im just this hollow shell  
Waiting here  
Begging please  
Set me free so I can feel  
  
Hey  
Stop trying to live my life for me  
I need to breathe  
Im not your robot  
Stop telling me Im part of this big machine  
Im breaking free  
Cant you see  
I can love  
I can speak  
Without somebody else operating me  
You gave me eyes and now I see  
Im not your robot  
Im just me  
  
Im not your robot  
Im just me  
Im not your robot  
  
I would scream  
But Im just this hollow shell  
Waiting here  
Begging please  
Set me free so I can feel  
  
Hey  
Stop trying to live my life for me  
I need to breathe  
Im not your robot  
Stop telling me Im part of this big machine  
Im breaking free  
Cant you see  
I can love  
I can speak  
Without somebody else operating me  
You gave me eyes and now I see  
Im not your robot  
Im just me  
  
Im not your robot  
Im just me  
Im not your robot
