Isnt it weird  
Isnt it strange  
Even though were just two strangers on this runaway train  
Were both trying to find a place in the sun  
Weve lived in the shadows but doesnt everyone  
Isnt it strange how we all feel a little bit weird sometimes  
  
Weird oh ho  
  
Isnt it hard  
Standing in the rain  
Youre on the verge of going crazy and your hearts in pain  
No one can hear but youre screaming so loud  
You feel like youre all alone in a faceless crowd  
Isnt it strange how we all get a little bit weird sometimes  
  
Sitting on the side  
Waiting for a sign  
Hoping that my luck will change  
Reaching for a hand that can understand someone who feels the same  
When you live in a cookiecutter world being different is a sin  
So you dont stand out  
But you dont fit in  
  
Weird whoa oh  
Sitting on the side  
Waiting for a sign  
Hoping that my luck will change  
Oh ho  
Reaching for a hand that can understand someone who feels the same  
When you live in a cookie cutter world if youre different you cant win  
So you dont stand out and you dont fit in  
Oh isnt it strange how we all feel a little bit weird  
Strange how we all get a little bit  
Strange how we all feel a little bit weird sometimes  
Oh just a little bit weird sometimes
