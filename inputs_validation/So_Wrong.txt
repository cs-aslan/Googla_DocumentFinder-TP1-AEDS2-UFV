Ive been so wrong for so long  
Thought I could live without the love that you give  
I was wrong oh so wrong  
  
Ive been so wrong for so long  
I didnt know that I loved you so  
I was wrong  
  
Chorus  
Well I never knew I could want you darlin  
Oh so much  
Now that youre gone I dream of you  
And your sweet touch  
  
I was so wrong for so long  
But Ive seen the light darlin Ill make it right  
I was wrong  
  
Chorus  
  
I was so wrong for so long  
But Ive seen the light darlin Ill make it right  
I was wrong
