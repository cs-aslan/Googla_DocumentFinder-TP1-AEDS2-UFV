On an on the road goes on  
An itll go on forever  
Time will show if you and I  
Will walk that road together  
Through fire an water ice an snow  
Heaven above us an hell below  
Holding on trying to walk the line  
With sweet temptation running close behind  
  
Im talking bout love  
Ooh love  
  
Like a fire forever burning  
A flaming heart thats yearning more an more  
A love to keep us warm  
On the wings of the storm  
  
Everyday an every night  
I keep hoping itll be all right  
Trying to leave the past behind  
Still looking for some peace of mind  
But destiny brought us together  
An promised us a time that would last forever  
Tho its all been said before  
Its the kind of love worth fighting for  
  
Im talking about love  
Ooh love  
  
Like a fire forever burning  
A flaming heart thats yearning more an more  
A love to keep you warm  
On the wings of the storm  
  
On an on the road goes on  
An itll go on forever  
Time will show if you and I  
Will walk that road together  
  
Im talking about love  
Ooh love  
  
Like a fire forever burning  
A flaming heart thats yearning more an more  
A love to keep us warm  
On the wings of the storm  
My love will keep you warm  
On the wings of the storm
