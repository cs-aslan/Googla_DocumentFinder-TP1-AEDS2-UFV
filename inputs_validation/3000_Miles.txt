Good girls walk fast  
In groups of three  
Fast girls walk slow  
On side streets  
Sometimes the girls who walk alone  
Arent found for days or weeks  
  
On the busy boulevards  
Bad boys call you names  
And cruise you hard  
Bullies laugh and grin and beat  
Your soft skin against  
The cold concrete  
  
Chorus  
Im 3000 miles away Repeat x4  
  
Knock you down  
Make you bleed  
Make you cry  
And make you think  
Ill die here soon if I dont leave  
If I dont leave if I dont leave  
  
This patch of sky and native ground  
Take turns to push and pull you down  
Forget trying to live and be happy  
Ill take safe and terror free  
  
Chorus  
  
Hit the floor  
Shut off the lights  
As the bullets fly  
Terror rules the dark night  
Dogs hang from the trees  
  
Training ground for punks and thieves  
Home of poor white retirees  
Who didnt bail  
And couldnt sell  
When color made the grass less green  
  
Chorus  
  
Apples are filled with razor blades  
But fools and innocents believe  
That love and faith and truth and beauty  
Can make a garden of this human factory  
  
Chorus  
  
Bad girls run fast  
Leave home alone  
No trace or clue of where theyve gone  
Sometimes these girls are never found  
Never found never found  
  
Chorus
