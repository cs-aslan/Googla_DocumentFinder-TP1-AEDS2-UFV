Chorus  
Im the one who loves you  
Im the one who loves you  
Im the one who loves you  
Im the one who loves you  
  
Little girl again you are blue  
Another fellow has gone and left you  
I see youve come back to me  
Your best friend  
To tell another tragic story again  
And once more you look into my eyes  
And one more time you ought to realize  
  
Chorus  
  
I must confess youre not to be blamed  
For being caught in those boys vicious games  
This time I wont let you go back  
Never again my dear in fact  
Im gonna stop the blueness  
In you  
Also confess what my heart  
Wants me to  
  
Chorus  
  
Just once more you look in my eyes  
And one more time you ought to realize  
  
Chorus
