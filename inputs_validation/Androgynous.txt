Here come dick hes wearing a skirt  
Here comes Jane yknow shes sporting a chain  
Same hair revolution  
Same build evolution  
Tomorrow whos gonna fuss  
  
And they love each other so  
Androgynous  
Closer than you know love each other so  
Androgynous  
  
Dont get him wrong and dont get him mad  
He might be a father but he sure aint a dad  
And she dont need advice that he send to her  
Shes happy with the way she looks  
Shes happy with her gender  
  
Mirror image see no damage  
See no evil at all  
Kewpie dolls and urine stalls  
Theyll be laughed at  
The way youre laughed at now  
  
Now something meets Boy and something meets Girl  
They both look the same  
Theyre overjoyed in this world  
Same hair revolution  
Unisex evolution  
Tomorrow whos gonna fuss  
And tomorrow dick is wearing pants  
And tomorrow Janies wearing a dress  
Future outcasts and they dont last  
And today the people dress the way that they please  
The way they tried to do in the last centuries
