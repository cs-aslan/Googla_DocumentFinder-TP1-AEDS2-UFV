You took me up to heaven  
Oh when you took me in your arms  
I was dazzled by your beauty  
Blinded by your charms  
  
I was lost in a fools paradise  
Good and lost in a fools paradise  
  
Well when you told me that you loved me  
And I gave my heart to you  
Oh well I wondered  
If there could be any truth in love so new  
  
I was lost in a fools paradise  
Good and lost in a fools paradise  
  
The whole world was my kingdom  
And your love the gem in my crown  
But when I saw you glance at a new romance  
You know my love came tumbling down  
  
Oh well you treat me a kinda coolish  
And you never let me know  
That you think Im being foolish  
Because I love you so  
  
Ill still get lost in a fools paradise  
Good and lost in a fools paradise  
  
Well the whole world was my kingdom  
And your love the gem in my crown  
But when I saw you glance at a new romance  
You know my love came tumbling down  
  
Oh you know you treat me a kinda coolish  
And you never let me know  
Oh that you think Im being foolish  
Because I love you so  
  
Ill still get lost in a fools paradise  
Lost with you in a fools paradise  
  
Yes Ill still get lost in a fools paradise  
So doggone lost in a fools paradise
