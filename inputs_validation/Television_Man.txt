Im looking and Im dreaming for the first time  
Im inside and Im outside at the same time  
And everything is real  
Do I like the way I feel  
  
Chorus  
When the world crashes in into my living room  
Television man made me what I am  
People like to put the television down  
But we are just good friends  
Im a television man  
  
I knew a girl she was a macho man  
But its alright I wasnt fooled for long  
This is the place for me  
Im the king and youre the queen  
  
Chorus  
  
Take a walk in the beautiful garden  
Everyone would like to say hello  
It doesnt matter what you say  
Come and take us away  
  
The world crashes in into my living room  
The world crashes in into my living room  
The world crashes in into my living room  
The world crashes in into my living room  
  
And we are still good friendsTelevision man  
Im watching everythingTelevision man
