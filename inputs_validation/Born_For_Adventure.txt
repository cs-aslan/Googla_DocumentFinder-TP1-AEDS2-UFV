I am the thief of the highway  
Rich man you better take hold  
Cause last night while you lie sleeping  
I came to steal all your gold  
  
All the Kings horses  
All the Kings men  
Surrounded the chapel  
To trap me within  
  
A Lady in waiting  
Lips red with rouge  
She offered me pleasures  
I could not refuse  
No no no  
  
For I was born  
Born for adventure  
Women whisky and sin  
No Ill never surrender  
Live by the sword till the end  
  
All the Kings horses  
All the Kings men  
Were drinking and dancing  
At Fezewigs Inn  
  
They spoke of my capture  
And of my escape  
They called it misfortune  
But I called it fate  
No no no  
  
For I was born  
Born for adventure  
Women whisky and sin  
No Ill never surrender  
Live by the sword till the end
