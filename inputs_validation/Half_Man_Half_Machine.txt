tone Spectrum Pacman Commodore  
ZX81 donkey kong fucking high score  
Push it to the limit couldnt push it any more  
Wanna be a fucking robot after smoking loads of draw  
  
Bought a speak and spell stuck it to my chest  
And wraps a fucking  onto my head and to my vest  
Walking down the stret my next door neighbours not impressed  
Im a robot and buying ten fags is my quest  
  
Eggsies gone too far he thinks hes robocop  
Hes covered in tinfoil and hes got matching metal socks  
We tried to sedate him but he fucking escaped  
The man robot myth starts to escalate  
  
He tries to sell himself standing in curries  
But if the police turn up he runs in a fucking hurry  
He tries to plug himself in the mains with his nob  
And when hes fully recharged he goes out on the rob  
  
Half man half machine  
What does it mean  
What does it mean  
  
Half man half machine  
What does it mean  
What does it mean  
  
Being a robot in my digital domain  
Enter my world feel my pain  
Im not like other people you might see or you might know  
I made love to a BBC micro  
Touching on the disk drive the monitor got hot  
I knew from then I was a motherfucking robot  
Bill Gates from Microsoft Stephen Hawkings voice  
And fucking Lara Croft  
  
I built a lab secret in my loft  
And built a special costume that would help me to jack off  
I sat there in front of the screen  
For many years this had been my wet dream  
Now Ive reched it Im finally there  
Like terminator being filmed in Aberdare  
So alone when people stop and stare  
Like C3PO but with pubes and hair  
  
Robot Love  
Robot  
Robotic Breakdancing  
Robot  
  
The doctors found a nut  
They said he was an headcase  
cos he sticks silver and cans on his face  
  
Sucking off antennas and trying to fuck the fridge  
And burnt his pubic wig with the high voltage  
  
I am a robot  
My prime directive is tos go tos the shops  
And buys ten fags  
Dos yous compute  
  
He wants to buy ten fags his destination is the shops  
A tinfoil suit and a hat like Robocop  
If your ask him then hell do a bodypop  
Like terminator yeah he just wont stop  
  
Put electical cable down through the eye of his cock  
Plugged it in the wall and gave himself a big shock  
The reason that he did it wasnt to give himself pain  
Watching Terminator over again and again  
  
Fuck man get him fucking restrain him man  
get him fucking fucking get him down man  
inject him man get him down  
Hes fucking nuts spa and hes losing it  
Help me man just get him fucking  
  
Half man half machine  
What does it mean  
What does it mean  
  
Half man half machine  
What does it mean  
What does it mean  
  
Half man half machine  
What does it mean  
What does it mean
