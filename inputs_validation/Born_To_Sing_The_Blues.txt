Born to sing the blues  
So tired an worn just singin the blues  
Alone right from the start  
I walked alone with blues in my heart  
  
True love true love Ive never known Ive never known  
Everything everything I do is wrong all wrong  
But wrong Ive always been  
Its hard to go on when I never win  
  
My life my life my destiny my destiny  
Is loneliness loneliness and misery misery  
My life I didnt choose  
I guess I was born to sing the blues  
  
The lonesome blues  
The weary blues
