They packed up all his buckles and shipped his saddle to his dad  
And by the way the house looked she must have took it bad  
The workers come on Monday to fix the door and patch the wall  
They say she just went crazy the night she got the call  
  
He was up in Wyoming and drew a bull no man could ride  
He promised her hed turn own well it turned out that he lied  
And the dreams that theyd been living in the California sand  
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne  
  
They say she just went crazy screamin out his name  
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim  
That if you go down by the water youll see her footprints in the sand  
Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne  
  
They never found her body just her diary by the bed  
It told about the fight they had and the words that she had said  
When he told her he was ridin she said Then I dont give a damn  
If you never come back from Cheyenne  
  
They say she just went crazy screamin out his name  
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim  
That if you go down by the water youll see her footprints in the sand  
Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne  
  
Nobody can explain it some say shes still alive  
Theyd even claim theyve seen her on the shoreline late at night  
And if you go down by the water youll see her footprints in the sand  
Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne  
  
Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne
