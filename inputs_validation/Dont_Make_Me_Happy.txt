You stare into the room nothing there but space  
No sign of any message gone without a trace  
But I dont want your pity if thats what you think  
Ill take my comfort from this hole Im sinking in  
Waste my time drink my wine take my money  
Thats alright I dont mind but dont try to be funny  
  
Dont make me good  
Dont make me mad  
Dont make me fly  
Dont make me happy  
  
Its nice here in this room you would like it yes you would  
Its got a bed two chairs and a table Id leave here if I could  
Theres a man standing up whos down on his knees  
Outside the cold wind sends a shiver through the trees  
On the line left behind under pressure  
Its so bad leave me be I dont want to get better  
  
Dont make me good  
Dont make me mad  
Dont make me fly  
Dont make me happy  
  
I dont care what you think but think about this  
It could have been somebody else beware of what you wish  
Now the door is closed locked and sealed  
And now you think you know how rejection feels  
Waste my time drink my wine take my money  
Thats alright I dont mind but dont try to be funny  
  
Dont make me good  
Dont make me mad  
Dont make me fly  
Dont make me happy
