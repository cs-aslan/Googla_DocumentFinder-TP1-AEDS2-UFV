Its old enough to try and tie you down  
So I just couldnt wait and hang around  
You always said must be free  
But you couldnt see you were loosing me  
And messing up the one good thing we had  
  
Chorus  
And now Im going out the way that I came in  
The game is over now I couldnt win  
My heart is all I have to pack  
And this time girl I wont be back  
And years from now Ill turn around and see  
The girl I left behind me  
  
I told myself that things would be OK  
You would come around to my way any day  
As time went on you just stayed the same  
No you couldnt change or be rearranged  
Im picking up the pieces of my life  
  
Chorus  
  
As time went on you just stayed the same  
No you couldnt change or be rearranged  
Im picking up the pieces of my life  
  
Chorus  
Behind me
