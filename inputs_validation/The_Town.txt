You did many things  
That I liked that I liked  
And you like diamond rings  
I can provide I can provide for you  
You made me feel so good  
Before I left on the road  
And you deserve your name on a crown on a throne

I havent been around my town in a long while  
I apologize but I  
Ive been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids who rely  
On me  
But I remember on the bathroom floor before I went on tour  
When you said we couldnt do it again  
Cause you had a thing with some other man  
  
You said it was love  
And you said you were lost  
Then you wished me good luck  
To find somebody to love  
But ooh  
Now Ive heard that youre single  
And oh  
Ill give you something to live for  
Yes I will  
  
Honey please  
You never thought youd ever see my face again  
But your love just swayed the lies  
When he stared into your eyes  
And he just might be too good for you  
Youre almost dead to him  
Youre sleeping with a frozen heart  
Well baby girl its over now  
And you can always count on me  
Your uncheckable  
Unrestrained to touch  
So immune to love  
And it feels so priceless to me  
That youre always free  
That youll take me in  
Now Im everything your everything  
  
I bet youll take me in  
I know youll take me in now  
The same place I left you in  
Ooh  
I bet youll take me in  
I know youll take me in  
I know youll take me in  
The same place I left you in  
  
Ooh oh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
No  
Let me love you  
  
You did many things  
That I liked that I liked  
And you like diamond rings  
I can provide I can provide for you  
You made me feel so good  
Before I left on the road  
And you deserve your name on a crown on a throne
