Then you call me long distance from Memphis  
When they said it was you on the line  
I said dont come tomorrow  
Cause I wont be here  
Youd only be wasting your time  
  
Ive been your long distance lover  
For far too long  
But Im not here to tell you  
Whos right or whos wrong  
But I know I once loved you  
But somehow it seems  
That its all a part of a dream  
  
So dont call me again in the morning  
Cause I wont be changing my mind  
And the phone will be ringing in my empty room  
I aint leaving nothing behind  
  
Ive been your long distance lover  
For far too long  
The nights are so lonely  
Cant keep holding on  
And the miles are like mountains  
That hide you from me  
And its all a part of a dream  
  
Ive been your long distance lover  
For far too long  
Cant hold on to feelings  
When youre so long gone  
It all keeps on a changing  
And now it just means  
That its all a part of a dream
