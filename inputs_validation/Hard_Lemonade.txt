Nicki  
Im in a tricky little mood  
I trick these little dudes  
I tell em that I love em but  
I never really do  
See I like pretty shoes and  
I like pretty minks  
And I like sight sein the pyramids and the sphinx  
He cop Italian pieces so I do the first pump  
And I can only push it if the trunk is in the front  
If the trunk is in the back then you gotta take it back  
You can hit me on the jet  
I chat on the mac  
See I am who I am nicky motherfucker if she say she not a fan  
She a lyin motherfcuker  
Over shoppin in Paris so I speak a little French  
Oui oui raggedy time for you to hit then bench  
Indecisive so I always gotta pick two

Your woman coming single I take my chicks in twos  
And when it comes to sippin lemonade is what I choose  
And when it come to trippin thats all you really do  
I dont work at lowers but you know I keep them tools  
Come around my town Ill show ya what them hammers do  
And this is not a diss this is just what I do  
And all yall nigaas false Im only speakin in truths

Nigga package out the liver trigger finger on the trigger  
She treat me then trick ya Im in it go figure  
The way I bringin money you would think

Cause the money come in like income backwards  
So Ima go hard cause I aint trying to go home thats  
Why Im snappin on this beat like you just finished the poem  
And I spits that crack you can just call me
