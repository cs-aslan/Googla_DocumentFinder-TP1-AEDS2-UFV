Im so tall cant get over me  
Im so low cant get under me  
I must be all these things  
For I just threw out the love of my dreams  
  
He is in my eyes he is in my ears  
He is in my blood he is in my tears  
I think of and see him every day  
Even though my love is a world away  
  
Oh hes got me wondering  
My righteousness is crumbling  
  
Never before have I felt this way  
No one is right want for him to stay  
I must be made of steel  
For I just threw out the love of my dreams  
  
He is in my eyes he is in my ears  
He is in my blood he is in my tears  
I think of and see him every day  
Even though my love is a world away  
  
Oh hes got me wondering  
My righteousness is crumbling  
Oh hes got me wondering  
My righteousness is crumbling  
  
Oh hes got me wondering  
My righteousness is crumbling  
And I see him every day  
Even though my love has walked away  
  
He is in my eyes he is in my ears  
He is in my blood he is in my tears  
I must be made of steel  
For I just threw out the love of my dreams
