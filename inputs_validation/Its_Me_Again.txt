I shred your bullshit poetry  
Yes its me again  
I wreck your positivity  
Yes its me again  
  
I fuck it to watch it bleed  
I kick it to make it scream  
I am the alternate choice to some straight life of mercy  
  
You see beauty I see pain  
You see sky and I see acid rain  
  
Its me again its me again its me again  
Its me again its me again its me again  
Its me again its me again its me again  
Its me again  
  
I rip your throat out on a whim  
Yes its me again  
I only ask for everything  
Yes its me again  
I squeeze it to feel it breathe  
I smash it to fuel this need  
I am the antidote for  
Whatever sickness you feed  
  
You see beauty I see pain  
You see sky and I see acid rain  
  
Its me again its me again its me again  
Its me again its me again its me again  
Its me again its me again its me again  
Its me again  
  
Little ms fucker dont move an inch  
Yall dumb suckers cant take the heat  
Your blood rushing from head to feet  
This is what I stand for  
  
All your choices thats done to man  
All you fuckers know who I am  
Im the living proof that you can  
Turn around and say its me again  
Its me again  
  
Fuck

You see beauty I see pain  
You see sky and I see acid rain  
  
Its me again its me again its me again  
Its me again its me again its me again  
Its me again its me again its me again  
Its me again its me again its me again  
Its me again its me again its me again
