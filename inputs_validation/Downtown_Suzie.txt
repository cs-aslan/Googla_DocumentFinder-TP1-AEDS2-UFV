Got the Monday mornin blues  
Monday wasnt really real  
Oh lying on a naked bed  
With an Alka Seltzer head  
Oh Lucy looked sweet just astrollin down Newport Street  
Talkin bout Lu what ya gon do  
And I feel so bad have you ever been had  
Ill dry out sweet Lucy  
Took an early morning shower  
Well I wasted bout half an hour  
I heard the ringing of the bell  
Its Lucy with the cleaning towel  
Oh Im feelin like the Sunday Times  
Southern Californian wine  
Oh Lucy kicked me in the hole  
A tennis worth of achin bones  
Oh Lucy looked sweet just astrollin down Newport Street  
Lord Lu what ya gonna do  
I feel so bad have you ever been had  
Got a dose from Incomprehensible sweet Lucy  
Oh Lucy looked sweet just astrollin down Newport Street  
Talkin bout Lu who What ya gonna do  
Oh and I feeling so bad have you ever been had  
Oh by Incomprehensible sweet Lucy
