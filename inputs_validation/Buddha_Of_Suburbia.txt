Living in lies by the railway line  
Pushing the hair from my eyes  
Elvis is english and climbs the hills  
Cant tell the bullshit from the lies  
Screaming along in south london  
Vicious but ready to learn  
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer  
Sometimes but always in vain  
  
So Ill wait until were sane  
Wait until were blessed and all the same  
Full of blood loving life and all its got to give  
Englishman going insane  
Down on my knees in suburbia  
Down on myself in every way  
  
With great expectations I change all my clothes  
Mustnt grumble at silver and gold  
Screaming above central london  
Never bored so Ill never get old  
  
So Ill wait until were sane  
Wait until were blessed and all the same  
Full of blood loving life and all its got to give  
Englishman going insane  
Down on my knees in suburbia  
Down on myself in every way  
  
Day after  
Day after  
Day  
Day after  
Zane zane zane  
Ouvre le chien  
Day after  
Day  
Day after  
Zane zane zane  
Ouvre le chien  
Day after
