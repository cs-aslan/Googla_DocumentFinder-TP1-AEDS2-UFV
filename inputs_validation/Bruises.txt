Havent seen you since high school  
Good to see youre still beautiful  
Gravity has its solitude oh  
Quite yet I bet youre rich as hell  
  
One thats five and one thats three  
Been two years since he left me  
Good to know that you got free  
That town I know was keeping you down on your knees  
  
These bruises make for better conversation  
Loses the vibe that separates  
Its good to let you in again  
Youre not alone in how youve been  
Everybody loses we all got bruises  
We all got bruises  
  
Have you seen him Not in years  
How about her No but I hear  
Shes in Queens with the man of her dreams  
Funny back then she said that about you  
  
Caesura youll never guess who I saw  
Remember Johnny B remember him we were best friends back to be  
Lets do this soon again ten years is that what its been  
Cant believe how time flies by  
Leaving you makes me wanna cry  
  
These bruises make for better conversation  
Loses the vibe that separates  
Its good to let you in again  
Youre not alone in how youve been  
Everybody loses we all got bruises  
We all got bruises  
  
I would love to fix it all for you  
I would love to fix you too  
Please dont fix a thing whatever you do  
  
These bruises make for better conversation  
Loses the vibe that separates  
Its good to know youve got a friend  
That you remember now and then  
Everybody loses  
  
These bruises make for better conversation  
Loses the vibe that separates  
Its good to let you in again  
Youre not alone in how youve been  
Everybody loseseverybody loses everybody loses  
We all got bruises We all got bruises We all got bruises
