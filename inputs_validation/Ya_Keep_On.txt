Shit god damn motherfucker Im back  
My name aint Jack Tripper but Im a day tripper  
So watch me whip another funky rhyme  
Black hoes sayin that honkys fine  
  
Gettin mine just like Im supposed to  
And if you fuck with the Rock Ill roast you  
A little toast to the real MCs  
Aint no love for the wannabes  
  
So hey ho dont call me Joe  
Cause the Joes I know cant even flow  
I can battle rap and all that other crap  
So if ya dont want none better step to the back  
  
Im from the motherfuckin old school  
Basement partys in the Clem fool  
Talkin that trash I wish you would  
Come step to Rock its all good  
  
Ya keep on  
Rock the house  
Rockrock the house  
Ya keep on  
  
Rock the house  
Rock rock the house  
Rock rock the house  
Rock rock the house  
  
Now its the Marlboro smokin fine hoe pokin  
Kind bud be the buds Im tokin  
Hittin you straight with the fresh shit  
Mid western funk and Im the best bitch  
  
The K to the I to the chrome Ds  
In the Grand Marquees sippin OE  
Pimpin Rock its my name my game  
Servin you hoes like it aint no thang  
  
Im a kid when I rap rock when Im singin  
I dont care who comes but what the fuck you bringin  
Shit one time one rhyme  
Cause Im that motherfuckin ill one with a steel dick  
  
Hittin you hoes with the real shit  
Ya keep on  
Rock the house  
Rockrock the house  
  
Ya keep on  
Ya keep  
Rockrock the house  
Rockrock the house  
  
Ya Keep On  
Rockrock the house  
Rockrock the house  
  
Now if you dont know hoe Im the man in the dark  
I got more riffs than Stanley Clark  
Or George Duke shoot Im the kid with the funky loot  
So if ya want some get some  
  
If ya need some heres some  
If ya dont just step to the rear son  
Cause Im commin with the quickness  
If you dis this bitch youll wind up on my hit list  
  
Ill put a bounty on your head  
McCough County bitch aint a good place to wind up dead  
Cause im a real relavent elevent type menace  
But it aint Rocky Dennis  
  
Watch me bend this rhyme in half  
Im like Moses with the mic is my staff  
Layin down them 10 commandments  
Thou shall not dis the Rock god dammit  
  
Rock the house  
Rockrock the house  
Ya keep on
