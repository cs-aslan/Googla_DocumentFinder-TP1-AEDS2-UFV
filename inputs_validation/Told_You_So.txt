And do those feet in modern times  
Walk upon the flowers  
And walk upon their brothers  
While their heads are busy lying low  
Trying to keep to coveroh  
  
Something went wrong  
Along the way  
Everybodys waiting for  
Judgment day  
  
So they can go  
Told you so  
  
Bring me my gun of itching desire  
Bring me my bullets and I will fire  
Sights set higher than the tall church spire  
  
Standing in line  
The blind lead the blind  
Waiting and waiting  
For an overdue sign  
Brothers and sisters  
Playing Chinese whispers  
If things arent suited  
Then theyll get diluted  
  
Theres one more dead with a hole in his head  
He shouldnt have said all the things he said  
Many tears were shed for the blood he bled
