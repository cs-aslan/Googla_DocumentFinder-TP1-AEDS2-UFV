I lie awake  
Because Im scared  
Im not as fake  
As you once heard  
As you once heard  
  
I just want to go somewhere  
And hold you in my arms  
I just want to go somewhere  
To sort things on my own  
  
But its following  
A dream  
That reminds me  
To believe it when I say  
  
I lie awake  
Because Im scared  
Im not as fake  
As you once heard  
But well lay down now  
Making sure we put these words  
Between us  
  
Maybe I can go somewhere  
And be the only one  
Maybe I can make you think  
That Im the only one  
Thats left to say  
That I was wrong  
That youve been right  
About everything all along  
  
I lie awake  
Because Im scared  
Im not as fake  
As you once heard  
But well lay down now  
Making sure we  
Put these words between us  
Dont put these words  
Between us  
  
I lie awake  
Because Im scared  
I lie awake  
Because Im scared  
Im not as fake  
As you once heard  
But well lay down  
Well lay down  
Before we come  
To regret our fate  
And Ill push them down  
And Ill push them down  
On the floor between us  
  
I lie awake  
Because Im scared  
Im not as fake  
As you once heard  
And well lay these words  
And well put them down  
On the floor between us  
Dont put these words between us  
Dont put these words between us
