There is no understanding in this hostile age  
Sometimes I feel just like a rat locked in a cage  
Its hard to live beyond the walls  
It aint no life at all  
But dont you tear it down  
  
Chorus  
Take your chances Ill take mine  
Chasing thunder is only wasted time  
Got no reason to walk that line  
Heavens waiting if I can make it home tonight  
  
And with the years Ive found a faith that gets me by  
It shows me the truth in a hurricane of lies  
My babys left a light for me  
Thats really all I need  
They wont bring me down  
  
Chorus  
  
Aimlessly rushing leaves you with nothing  
You need some loving to make you feel alive  
In less than a moment life can be stolen  
I know where Im going gotta get me there tonight  
  
Im holding on to what I can  
Like any other lucky man  
Love wont strike me love wont sell me out  
  
Chorus
