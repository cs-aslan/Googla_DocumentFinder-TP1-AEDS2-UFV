At first I was afraid  
I was petrified  
Kept thinking I could never live  
Without you by my side  
But then I spent so many nights  
Thinking how you did me wrong  
I grew strong  
I learned how to get along  
  
And so youre back  
From outer space  
I just walked in to find you here  
With that sad look upon your face  
I should have changed that stupid lock  
I should have made you leave your key  
If I had known for just one second  
Youd be back to bother me  
  
Go on now go walk out the door  
Just turn around now  
Cause youre not welcome anymore  
Werent you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye  
You think Id crumble  
You think Id lay down and die  
  
Oh no not I  
I will survive  
As long as I know how to love  
I know I will stay alive  
Ive got all my life to live  
Ive got all my love to give  
And Ill survive  
I will survive hey hey  
  
It took all the strength I had  
Not to fall apart  
Kept trying hard to mend  
The pieces of my broken heart  
  
And I spent oh so many nights  
Just feeling sorry for myself  
I used to cry  
Now I hold my head up high  
And you see me  
  
Somebody new  
Im not that chained up little girl  
Who fell in love with you  
And so you felt like dropping in  
And just expect me to be free  
Now Im saving all my loving  
For someone whos loving me  
Go on now go walk out the door  
Just turn around now  
Cause youre not welcome anymore  
  
Werent you the one who tried to break me with goodbye  
You think Id crumble  
You think Id lay down and die  
Oh no not I  
I will survive  
As long as I know how to love  
I know I will stay alive  
Ive got all my life to live  
Ive got all my love to give  
And Ill survive  
I will survive oh  
  
Go on now go walk out the door  
Just turn around now  
Cause youre not welcome anymore  
Werent you the one who tried to break me with goodbye  
You think Id crumble  
You think Id lay down and die  
Oh no not I  
I will survive  
As long as I know how to love  
I know I will stay alive  
Ive got all my life to live  
Ive got all my love to give  
And Ill survive  
I will survive  
I will survive
