Can you find the time  
To let your lover love you  
He only wants to show you  
The things he wants to learn too  
The hardest parts youll get through  
And in the end youll have your best friend  
  
Chorus  
Love like this may come once  
Baby its fate  
Like a soul mate hes your penguin  
Baby its fate  
Baby its fate  
Not luck  
  
Can you find the time to let your lover hold you  
He needs somebody to hold to  
His love is strong and so true  
His arrows aiming for you  
And hes the one that you were born to love  
  
Chorus  
  
Let go  
Let go  
Of time for you  
And I  
Let go  
Let go  
Of time for you  
And I  
Let go  
Let go  
Of time for you  
And I  
  
Love like this is all I want  
Baby were fate  
Love like this may come once  
Baby were fate  
Like a soul mate your my penguin  
Baby were fate  
Baby its fate  
Not luck
