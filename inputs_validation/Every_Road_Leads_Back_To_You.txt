Old friend here we are  
After all the years and tears  
And all that weve been through  
It feels so good to see you  
Lookin back in time  
Thereve been other friends and other lovers  
But no other one like you  
All my life no one ever has known me better  
  
I must have traveled down a thousand roads  
Been so many places seen so many faces  
Always on my way to somethin new  
Oh but it doesnt matter  
Cause no matter where I go  
Every road leads back  
Every road just seems to lead me back to you  
  
Old friend there were times  
I didnt want to see your face  
Or hear your name again  
Now those times are far behind me  
Its so good to see your smile  
Id forgotten how nobody else  
Could make me smile the way you do  
All this time youre the one I still want beside me  
  
I must have traveled down a thousand roads  
Been so many places seen so many faces  
Always on my way to somethin new  
Oh but it doesnt matter  
Cause no matter where I go  
Every road leads back  
Every road just seems to lead me back to you  
  
I must have traveled down a thousand roads  
Been so many places seen so many faces  
Always on my way to somethin new  
Oh but it doesnt matter  
Cause no matter where I go  
Every road leads back  
Every road just seems to lead me back  
Every road leads back  
Every road just seems to lead me back to you  
Every road just seems to lead me back to you
