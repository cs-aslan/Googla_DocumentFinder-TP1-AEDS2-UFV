Stop me oh stop me  
Stop me if you think that youve heard this one before  
Stop me oh stop me  
Stop me if you think that youve heard this one before  
Nothings changed I still love you  
Oh I still love you only slightly  
Only slightly less than I used to my love  
I was delayed I was waylaid an emergency stop  
I smelt the last ten seconds of life I crashed down  
On the crossbar and the pain was enough to make a shy  
Bald buddhist reflect and plan a mass murder  
Who said Id lied to her  
Oh who said Id lied because I never I never  
Who said Id lied because I never  
I was detained I was restrained  
And broke my spleen and broke my knee  
And then he really lays into me  
Friday night in out patients who said Id lied to her  
Oh who said Id lied because I never I never  
Who said Id lied because I never  
And so I drank one it became four  
And when I fell on the floor I drank more  
Stop me oh stop me  
Stop me if you think that youve heard this one before  
Stop me oh stop me  
Stop me if you think that youve heard this one before  
Nothings changed I still love you  
Oh I still love you only slightly  
Only slightly less than I used to my love
