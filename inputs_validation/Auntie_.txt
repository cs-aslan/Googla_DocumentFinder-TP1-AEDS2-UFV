Got love if thats what you need  
I got three or four babies sittin on my knee  
I got love waitin for you  
I come sneakin round the corner of the avenue  
  
You gotta mamama belle or I will get you  
You know you gotta mamama belle before I get you  
  
Theres one thing thats on my mind  
And thats getting hold of you before I serve my time  
Ill keep on with my heavy load  
Till I see you come a strollin down that open road  
  
You gotta mamama belle or I will get you  
You know you gotta mamama belle before I get you  
  
I love you mamama belle  
Thats why I want to get it all well Im sure you can tell  
I got good soul runnin so deep  
Gonna get you in the corner so that I can keep  
Cant you hear me once mamama belle  
  
You gotta mamama belle or I will get you  
You know you gotta mamama belle before I get you
