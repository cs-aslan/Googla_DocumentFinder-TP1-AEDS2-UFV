Well I heard some people talkin just the other day  
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf  
But let me tell you I got news for you  
And youll soon find out its true  
And then youll have to eat your lunch all by yourself  
Cause Im already gone  
And Im feelin strong  
I will sing this victry song woo hoohoowoohoohoo  
  
The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why  
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right  
But remember this my girl when you look up in the sky  
You can see the stars and still not see the light thats right  
  
And Im already gone Im already gone  
And Im feelin strong now Im feelin strong  
I will sing this victry song woo hoohoowoo hoohoo  
  
Well I know it wasnt you who held me down  
Heaven knows it wasnt you who set me free oh baby  
So often times it happens that we live our lives in chains  
And we never even know we have the key  
Oh no  
  
But me Im already gone Im already gone  
And Im feelin strong now Im feelin strong  
I will sing this victry song  
Cause Im already gone  
Cause Im already gone  
And Im feelin strong  
I will sing this victry song  
Cause Im already gone  
Cause Im already gone  
Cause Im already gone
