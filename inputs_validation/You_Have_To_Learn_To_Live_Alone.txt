We sleep together close and warm  
We calm each other through the storm  
We set up home but in a while  
Were tempted by anothers smile  
When its all played out  
If the truth were known  
You have to learn to live alone  
We dance around the fading light  
You hold me closer every night  
You fell in love but I did not  
But in the end youre all Ive got  
When its all played out  
When the truth is known  
You have to learn to live alone  
We fly around the world too fast  
We cannot make one moment last  
We love the crowd we sing and play  
We do it all we get our way  
When its all played out  
When the bird has flown  
You have to learn to live alone  
When were all played out  
If the truth were known  
You have to learn to live alone
