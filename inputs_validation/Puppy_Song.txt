Dreams are nothing more than wishes  
And a wishs just a dream wish to come true  
  
If only I could have a puppy Id call myself so very lucky  
Just to have some company to share a cup of tea with me  
  
Id take my puppy everywhere la la la la I wouldnt care  
Then well stay away from crowds with signs that say no dogs allowed  
Oh we I know hed never bite me we I know hed never bite me  
  
If only I could have a friend who sticks with me until the end  
And walk along beside the sea to share a bit of moon with me  
  
Id take my friend most everywhere la la la la I wouldnt care  
And well stay away from crowds with signs that say no friends allowed  
Oh we wed be so happy to be we wed be so happy to be together  
  
But dreams are nothing more than wishes  
And a wishs just a dream you wish to come true  
  
Dreams are nothing more than wishes  
Your wish will come true  
And a wishs just a dream  
Your wish will come true  
Your wish to come true  
Your wish will come true  
  
Your wish will come true  
Your wish will come true  
Your wish will come true  
  
Dreams are nothing more than wishes  
Your wish will come true  
And a wishs just a dream  
Your wish will come true  
Your wish to come true  
Your wish will come true
