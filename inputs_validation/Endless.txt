You better wrap yourself around me  
Its a miracle that youve found me  
I cant fool myself any longer  
Were both willing young and able  
Lets put our cards on the table  
This feelins gettin stronger  
I see the sunlit tears in your eyes again  
Now I realize  
Maybe its the right time  
Oh maybe youre the right one  
Ooh and now I understand  
You couldve slipped through my hands  
Well I just cant wait anymore  
Theres a chance we can make it  
We just gotta take it  
  
Endless are the nights  
I stay with you  
Endless are the dreams  
You made come true  
Forever in my arms  
Youre the reason tonight our love is endless  
  
We better get ourselves together  
Before we hit bad weather  
And we cant go any further  
Wont you give me some affection  
Point me in the right direction  
This storm is blowin harder  
Here comes that voice deep inside again  
And it says to me  
That maybe its the right thing  
Oh maybe youre the right one  
Ooh and now I understand  
You couldve slipped through my hands  
Well I just cant wait anymore  
Theres a chance we can make it  
We just gotta take it  
  
Endless are the nights  
I stay with you  
Endless are the dreams  
You made come true  
Forever in my arms  
Youre the reason tonight our love is endless
