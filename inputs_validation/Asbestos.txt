Dont start with the ugly part  
Dont end with the things that will make them want to walk away  
Tune in at the den again Another price aint cheap but somebodys gonna have
to pay  
Oh yes you can only guess what it is what it was  
Or remember what I had in mind  
Shotgunning on a joy ride coming down the block halfcocked nearly half the
time  
  
Give it back give it back give it back sing it  
  
One time for the words divine and  
Two times for the things that you hope you never have to say  
Three seams in a dead mans dream  
And the girls tell the boys that they better fucking run away  
Live it up wont you give it up  
Turn it up put it out let it ride with the other lie  
Shotgunning on a joy ride coming down the block halfcocked nearly all the
time  
  
Give it back give it back give it back sing it
