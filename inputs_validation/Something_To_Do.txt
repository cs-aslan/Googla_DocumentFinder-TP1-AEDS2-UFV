My little girl  
Wont you come with me  
Come with me  
And tell me  
Is there something to do  
Im going crazy with boredom  
Come with me  
Tell me  
Grey sky over a black town  
I can feel depression  
All around  
Youve got your leather boots on  
I cant stand another drink  
Its surprising this town  
Doesnt sink  
Youve got your leather boots on  
Your pretty dress is oil stained  
From working too hard  
For too little  
Youve got your leather boots on  
Youre feeling the boredom too  
Id gladly go with you  
Id put your leather boots on  
Id put your pretty dress on
