Well youve got me working so hard lately  
Working my hands until they bleed  
If I was twice the man I could be  
Id still be half of what you need  
Still you lead me and I follow  
All of your back up to your chin  
Over to the tip of your switchblade as you pull it out and stick it in  
  
Chorus  
Twist Twist Twist we can go a little deeper  
Twist Twist Twist Im wearing these chains  
Twist Twist Twist you make it hurt real good  
TwistTwistTwist I love the pain  
  
Well you just leave me nailed here  
Hanging like Jesus on the cross  
Im just dying for your sins  
And aiding to the cause  
  
Chorus  
  
Wrap my soul in bandages  
Im tired of this war  
Go ahead and cut me  
I cant even feel it anymore  
  
Chorus
