When love comes so late itll really hit hard  
It slams through the gate itll catch you off guard  
Everyone said What a perfect love match  
Cause she is so smart shes a hell of a catch  
  
I was drinking in love gulping it down  
Drifting for months on a billowing cloud  
But after awhile I stopped to rebel  
Im back in the past and Im raising up hell  
  
But I think Ive just made the biggest mistake of my life  
And I think Ive just made the biggest mistake of my life  
  
Wed been living together for over a year  
The harmonys perfect it rang loud and clear  
But then very slowly my nerves start to fray  
The little things big thats what they say  
  
I acted impatient I acted unkind  
I took her for granted I played with her mind  
She didnt deserve it but it was too late  
I walked out the door and left her to her fate  
  
But I think Ive just made the biggest mistake of my life  
And I think Ive just made the biggest mistake of my life  
  
Whoo Whoo Whoo  
Now Im down in a slump and Im eating alone  
I ruined the day with some friends on the phone  
I never go out Im becoming a grouch  
I just watch the TV and I drink on the couch  
  
But if love comes again Ill be really surprised  
Ill grab it real fast keep it right in my sights  
  
Cause I think Ive just made the biggest mistake of my life  
Well I think Ive just made the biggest mistake of my life
