I look at you looking at me  
Feels like a feeling meant to be  
And as your body moves with mine  
Its like Im lifted out of time  
  
And time again  
Patiently Ive waited  
For this moment to arrive  
  
After tonight  
Will you remember  
How sweet and tenderly  
You reached for me  
And pulled me closer  
After you go  
Will you return to love me  
After tonight begins to fade  
  
I feel your touch caressing me  
This feelings all Ill ever need  
With every kiss from your sweet lips  
Its like Im drifting out of time  
  
Alone will tell  
If you feel the way I feel  
When I look in your eyes  
  
After tonight  
Will you remember  
How sweet and tenderly  
You reached for me  
And pulledme closer  
After you go  
Will you return to love me  
After the night becomes the day  
  
Time  
And time and time again  
So patiently Ive waited  
For this moment to arrive  
  
After tonight  
Will you remember  
How sweet and tenderly  
You reached for me  
And pulled me closer  
After you go  
Baby will you return to love me  
After the night becomes the day  
After tonight begins to fade
