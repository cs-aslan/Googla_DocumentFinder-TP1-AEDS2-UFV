Its so long since I sang songs to you  
I forget all the words I once knew  
I could look back  
But I cant waste the time  
  
Did it matter  
They sometimes didnt rhyme  
Its so long since I sang songs for you  
  
Its so long since you smile just for me  
Now your smiles just an old use to be  
Does it matter  
That I can take the time  
  
Would you rather  
I write you one more line  
Can my songs once again be for you  
  
Claudie made a fool out of me  
Made me find another place to be  
Ive been living alone  
In a house that wasnt my home  
With Claudie is the place I want to be  
  
When I left did you think of me crying  
Did you care that I felt I was dying  
I pretended  
That I dont give a damn  
All along  
Ive know what I really am  
Im a fool little Claudie just for you  
  
Claudie made a fool out of me  
Made me find another place to be  
Ive been living alone  
In a house that wasnt my home  
With Claudie is the place I want to be
