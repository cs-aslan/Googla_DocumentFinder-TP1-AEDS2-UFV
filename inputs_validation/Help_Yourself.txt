Love is like candy on a shelf  
You want to taste and help yourself  
The sweetest things are there for you  
Help yourself take a few  
Thats what I want you to do  
  
Were always told repeatedly  
The very best in life is free  
And if you want to prove its true  
Baby Im telling you this is what you should do  
  
Just help yourself to my lips to my arms  
Just say the word and theyre yours  
Just help yourself to the love in my heart  
Your smile has opened up the door  
The greatest wealth that exists in the world  
Could never buy what I can give  
Just help yourself to my lips to my arms  
And then lets really start to live  
  
My heart has love enough for two  
More than enough for me and you  
Im rich with love a millionaire  
Ive so much its unfair  
Why dont you take a share  
  
Just help yourself to my lips to my arms  
Just say the word and theyre yours  
Just help yourself to the love in my heart  
Your smile has opened up the door  
The greatest wealth that exists in the world  
Could never buy what I can give  
Just help yourself to my lips to my arms  
And then lets really start to live
