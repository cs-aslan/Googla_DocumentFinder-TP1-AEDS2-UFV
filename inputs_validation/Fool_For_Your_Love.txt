And I heard a story all about you  
That you never started  
And maybe I can learn to give my cheek another turn  
And so Ill drink your point of view  
Blur my vision my feelings too  
Sometimes I dont see what your giving means to me  
  
Shes acting strangely  
And says her whole world is starting to turn  
Shes got a broken heart  
Shes good at playing the part  
Ive been tricked again  
Ive been a fool for your love  
  
And every time Ive got it made  
You come and burn it all down down  
Its always something that I said hey hey hey  
And dont say a word dont say anything  
Dont even make a sound  
And hear the rumors scream and shout yeah  
  
Shes acting strangely  
And says her whole world is starting to turn  
Shes got a broken heart shes good at playing the part  
Ive been tricked again Ive been a fool for your love  
  
I remember the time when I first met her  
Since that night Ive been trying to hold it together together  
  
And I heard a story all about you  
You come and burn it all down down  
Dont say anything  
And hear the rumors scream and shout yeah  
  
And Im acting crazy cause my whole world has started to turn  
I got a broken heart  
And I stand at playing the part  
Ive been tricked again Im still a fool for your love
