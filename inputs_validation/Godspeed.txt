You are the adrenaline  
Rushing through my veins  
Stimulate my heart  
Heavy crystalline  
You are the sulphur  
Extinguished by the flame  
You are everything to me  
All this in your name  
  
Oh walking in your blue coat  
Weeping admiral  
All the twisted cellars  
They had to hand your name  
Ended all thats static  
In a myth of sin  
Mirror minor static  
Pale adrenaline  
  
Take it  
Ah take it  
That day you said to me  
it could never be  
Say the hour of sea to seep  
have you said godspeed   
  
Love is a vampire  
Energy of dead  
Love is like a boomerang  
Comin back again  
On a rack of red leather  
On a rack of skin and sin  
Tell me how to pale  
In adrenaline  
  
And you said to me  
it could never be  
Say the hour of sea to seep  
And you said to me  
have you said godspeed   
  
I could make it all  
All the twisted sand and foam  
Ill never ever return  
I could make it  
Make it all  
  
Im walking follow me  
Down the twisted stair  
Stuck inside a memory  
Shot and shot again  
Hand upon a railin  
Courtin fate and fate  
Were sailin sailin sailin sailin  
Down a black black river  
And I plunge right in  
And I plunge right in  
In adrenaline  
In adrenaline  
  
I move inside my vein  
Ah youre the speed I need  
Throw the pistol in  
Oh your loves a vampire  
Comin in to suck  
Stop stop stop stop  
Oh I fell and fell and fell  
Down down down down  
Oh Im gonna duck
