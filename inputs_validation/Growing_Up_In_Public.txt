Some people are into the power of power  
The absolute corrupting power that makes great men insane  
While some people find their refreshment in action  
The manipulation encroachment and destruction of their inferiors  
  
Growing up in public growing up in public  
Growing up in public growing up in public with your pants down  
  
Some people are into sadistic pleasures  
They whet their desires and drool in your ears  
Theyre quasieffeminate characters in love with oral gratification  
They edify your integrities so they can play on your fears  
  
Theyre gonna do you in public cause youre growing up in public  
Theyre gonna do it to you in public  
Cause youre growing up in public with your pants down  
  
Some people think being a man is unmanly  
Some people think that the whole concepts a joke  
But some people think being a man is the whole point  
And then some people wish theyd never awoke  
  
Up from a dream of nightmarish proportions  
Down to a size neither regal nor calm  
A Prince Hamlet caught the middle between reason and instinct  
Caught in the middle with your pants down again  
  
Caught in the middle Im really caught in the middle  
Im caught in the middle caught in the middle deciding about you
