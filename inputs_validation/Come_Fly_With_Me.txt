Come fly with me lets fly lets fly away  
If you can use some exotic booze  
Theres a bar in far Bombay  
Come fly with me lets fly lets fly away  
  
Come fly with me lets float down to Peru  
In lama land theres a one man band  
And hell toot his flute for you  
Come fly with me lets take off in the blue  
  
Once I get you up there  
Where the air is rarefied  
Well just glide  
Starry eyed  
Once I get you up there  
Ill be holding you so near  
You may here angels cheer  just because were together  
  
Weather wise its such a lovely day  
Just say the words and well beat the birds  
Down to Acapulco Bay  
Its perfect for a flying honeymoon  they say  
Come fly with me lets fly lets fly away  
  
Hit it Jack  
  
Once I get you up there  
Where the air is rarefied  
Well just glide  
Starry eyed  
Once I get you up there  
Ill be holding you so near  
And you may here angels cheer  just because were together  
  
Weather wise its such a kooky day  
Just say the words and Ill beat the birds  
Down to Acapulco Bay  
Its perfect for a flying honeymoon  they say  
Come fly with me  
Pack up lets fly away
