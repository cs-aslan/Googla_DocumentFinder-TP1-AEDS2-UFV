Every day it seems my smiles a little harder  
And every day I seem to laugh a little less  
Living this way it seems my skys a little darker  
You went away and left me lonely in success  
  
Cant you see Im falling apart Repeat  
Cant you see whats happenin to me  
  
Take this hand and show my fingers where my heart is  
Understand you may just save me from despair  
Watch this man youll see he cant stop what he has started  
Take this hand youll see right now theres noone there  
  
Cant you see Im falling apart  
You laugh at me as I fall  
Cant you see Im falling apart  
Just tell me tell me give me one good reason  
  
Armed with love I could save my heart  
But on my own I just cant make it  
Im too weak to fight so take it  
Armed with love I could save my heart  
But instead I watch you die  
  
Armed with love I could save my heart  
But on my own I just cant make it  
Im too weak to fight so take it  
Armed with love I could save my heart  
Tell me why am I so blue
