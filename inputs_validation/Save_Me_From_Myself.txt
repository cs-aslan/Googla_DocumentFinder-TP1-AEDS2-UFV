The clouds are rollin in  
Who will watch them  
The waves are strong  
The boat is gone  
I hope theyre swimming  
  
Little boy lost in the woods  
Wheres the clearing  
The town is out  
Theyre calling loud  
But hes not hearing  
  
It seems to me Im always miles away  
Looking for my old face  
  
Save me from myself  
I cant relate  
Were mouth to mouth  
And still I suffocate  
Theres nothing left  
Inside for me to break  
Save me from myself  
  
The bullet in the yard  
Is slowly rusting  
The bottles crack  
The kids come back  
And Im just looking  
  
The wine is on the floor  
The candles flicker  
Your eyes fall  
And Im appalled  
Its all just cinder  
  
It seems to me were always miles apart  
Trying to find another place to start  
  
Save me from myself  
I cant relate  
Were mouth to mouth  
And still I suffocate  
Theres nothing left  
Inside for me to break  
Save me from myself  
  
The sailors never left  
They knew the weather  
When they were found  
They were having drinks together  
  
They found the little boy  
In the grocery  
Happy endings all around  
And still they haunt me  
  
Save me from myself  
I cant relate  
Were mouth to mouth  
And still I suffocate  
Theres nothing left  
Inside of me to break  
Save me from myself  
  
Save me from myself  
Theres nothing left inside me  
Theres nothing left
