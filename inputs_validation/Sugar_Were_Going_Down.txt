Am I more than you bargained for yet  
Ive been dying to tell you anything you want to hear  
Cause thats just who I am this week  
Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum  
Im just a notch in your bedpost but youre just a line in a song  
A notch in your bedpost but youre just a line in a song  
  
Drop a heart break a name  
Were always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team  
  
Were going down down in an earlier round  
And Sugar were going down swinging  
Ill be your number one with a bullet  
A loaded gun complex cock it and pull it  
Were going down down in an earlier round  
And Sugar were going down swinging  
Ill be your number one with a bullet  
A loaded gun complex cock it and pull it  
  
Is this more than you bargained for yet  
Oh dont mind me Im watching you two from the closet  
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans  
Isnt it messed up how Im just dying to be him  
Im just a notch in your bedpost but youre just a line in a song  
Notch in your bedpost but youre just a line in a song  
  
Drop a heart break a name  
We were sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team  
  
Were going down down in an earlier round  
And Sugar were going down swinging  
Ill be your number one with a bullet  
A loaded gun complex cock it and pull it  
  
Were going down down in an earlier round  
And Sugar were going down swinging  
Ill be your number one with a bullet  
A loaded gun complex cock it and pull it  
  
Down down in an earlier round  
And Sugar were going down swinging  
Ill be your number one with a bullet  
A loaded gun complex cock it and pull it  
  
Were going down down in an earlier round  
Take aim at myself  
And Sugar were going down swinging  
Take back what you said  
Ill be your number one with a bullet  
Take aim at myself  
A loaded gun complex cock it and pull it  
  
Were going down down down down  
Down down down down  
Were going down down down down  
A loaded gun complex cock it and pull it  
  
Were going down down in an earlier round  
Take aim at myself  
And Sugar were going down swinging  
Take back what you said  
Ill be your number one with a bullet  
Take aim at myself  
A loaded gun complex cock it and pull it
