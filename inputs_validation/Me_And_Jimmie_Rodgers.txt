Me and Jimmie Rodgers used to ride them rollin boxcars in the summer time  
Jimmie hed play his guitar Id lay back and watch the stars and sip my wine  
Me and Audie Murphy used to crawl out on our bellies through the German lines  
Audie I wont leave you here  
Ill pull you through cause you know youre a friend of mine  
Me and Phil Rizzuto didnt we move like lightnin round there on the double
play  
Id look over in the stands and Marilyn would see me and shed smile and wave  
Hell no Coach Lombadi this old broken back aint nothin if the game is saved  
And fellers if I dont pull through just put a little golden football on my
grave  
John Wayne he once said to me them Japs theyll take that Island  
And weve got to save the old Red White and Blue  
Someones got to swim out to that submarine and warn em  
You know T I hate like hell to ask you to  
Me and Sugar Ray we used to spar together up there an old Stillmans Gym  
Knowin someday it would be the garden and the championship for me or him  
And Coop if no one in this town is man enough to back you when Frank Miller
comes  
Come High Noon Ill walk with you Ive had a few but I know how to use a gun  
 acguitar   
Betty Grable dont you cry you know you can be a star  
And with my drinkin Id just hold you back  
So go on sign the contracts kid  
Ill read about you in some old newspaper from some rack  
Cause me and Jimmie Rodgers we still ride them rollin boxcars in the summer
time  
Jimmie he plays his guitar I lay back and watch the stars and sip my wine  
Me and Audie Murphy we still crawl out on our bellies through the German lines  
At away theres scooner shoot that ball to me and I swear well get two this
time  
So whats old Hank I said Hank I wrote a real good song and he said lemme
hear it
