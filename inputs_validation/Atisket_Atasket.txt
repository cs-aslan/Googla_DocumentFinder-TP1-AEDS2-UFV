ATisket ATasket  
A green and yellow basket  
I bought a basket for my mommie  
On the way I dropped it  
I dropped it I dropped it  
Yes on the way I dropped it  
A little girlie picked it up  
And took it to the market  
She was truckin on down the  
Avenue without a single thing to do  
She was peck peck peckin all around  
When she spied it on the ground  
ATisket ATasket  
She took my yellow basket  
And if she doesnt bring it back  
I think that I shall die  
Was it red  
No no no no  
Was it brown  
No no no no  
Was it blue  
No no no no  
Just a little yellow basket
