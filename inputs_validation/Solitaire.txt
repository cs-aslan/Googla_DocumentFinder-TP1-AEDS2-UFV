Im not so bulletproof  
But this is something  
I could never say to you  
This sometimes buries me  
And I dont know if this is someone I can be  
  
I tell myself its right  
Still feels so wrong  
  
Its better than nothing  
Id rather not be here all by myself  
Its better than nothing here with someone else  
Its better than nothing  
Id rather not be standing here alone  
Its better than feeling like youre on your own  
  
Im not so culpable  
I never meant for this to get out of control
