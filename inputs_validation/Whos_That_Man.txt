Know whos that man  
Repeat  
Verse One Kandi  
Hes got a different little style than other men today  
He does his thing with a swing  
And everything you see him do is in a different way  
You never ever seen before  
Bridge LaTocha  
Hes not your ordinary slick uptown type of brother  
Dont think twice cause youll never find another  
Because the man behind the mask  
Youve never ever seen him before  
Repeat Chorus  
Verse Two

Hes got the flava to do his his thang  
Hes got something everybody wish they had

And something tells me you dont want to make him mad  
No you dont no you dont no you dont
