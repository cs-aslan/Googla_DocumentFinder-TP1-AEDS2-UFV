Well I calls my baby on the telephone  
She says hurry home Bret cause Im all alone  
Oh now giddyap hurry and dont be late  
Cause a be be be be baby I just cant wait  
  
She starts talkin dirty right in my ear  
Making herself so perfectly clear  
She needs some good love  
  
So I roll her over in the middle of the night  
and I rock my baby til the morning light  
Gettin hot good love yeah  
  
Well the good people say Im a sinnin man  
But if they knew my baby they would understand  
The neighbors keep yellin bout all the noise  
They say the things youre doin aint natural boy  
  
Well my baby she just loves to play  
And I need my baby each and every day  
Need some good love  
  
Were hoppin and a bobbin in the old moonlight  
Rockin and a rollin til the morning light  
Gettin hotgood love  
Bring it home  
  
Solo  
  
Well my baby she just loves to play  
And I need my baby each and every day  
Need some good love  
  
Well my daddy thinks that Ive gone crazy  
And my poor boss swears Im losin my cool  
But I just want to play with my baby  
If you only knew what she could do  
  
She starts talkin dirty right in my ear  
Makin herself so perfectly clear  
need some good love  
  
Baby she just loves to play  
and I need my baby each and every day  
  
Start hoppin bobbin in the old moonlight  
Rockin and a rollin til the morning light  
  
Gettin hot hot hot  
good love
