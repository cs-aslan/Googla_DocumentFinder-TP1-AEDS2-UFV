We have time for racism  
We have time for criticism  
Held bondage by our isms  
When will there be a time to love  
  
We make time to debate religion  
Passing bills and building prisons  
For building fortunes and passing judgments  
When will there be a time to love  
  
At this point in history we have a choice to make  
To either walk a path of love  
Or be crippled by our hate  
  
We have time to cause pollution  
We have time to cause confusion  
All wrapped up in our own illusions  
When will there be a time to love  
  
We make time to conquer nations  
Time for oil exploration  
Hatred violence and terrorism  
When will there be a time to love  
  
At this moment in time  
We have a choice to make  
Father God is watching  
While we cause mother earth so much pain  
Its such a shame  
  
Not enough money for  
The young the old and the poor  
But for war there is always more  
When will there be a time to love  
  
We make time for paying taxes  
Or paying bills and buying status  
But we will pay the consequences  
If we dont make the time to love  
  
Nows the time to pay attention  
Yes now is the time to love  
A time love love  
A time to Love  
Please please wont you tell me  
When will there be a time to love
