Thought it wouldnt matter  
If we didnt stay together  
And if it was over  
Maybe it was for the better  
I was thinking Id be alright  
til I thought it all through  
Now I know that I aint really living  
If I have to live without you  
  
I dont want to live without your love  
I dont want to face the night alone  
I could never make it through my life  
If I had to make it on my own  
I dont want to love nobody else  
I dont want to find somebody new  
I dont want to live without your love  
I just want to live my life with you  
  
Guess I had to go away  
So much I had to go through  
Guess I had to lose you  
To realize how much I love you  
Can we make the fire burn again  
Burn a little stronger  
cause Ive been alone and baby  
I cant be alone now any longer  
  
I dont want to live without your love  
I dont want to face the night alone  
I could never make it through my life  
If I had to make it on my own  
I dont want to love nobody else  
I dont want to find somebody new  
I dont want to live without your love  
I just want to live my life with you  
  
Oh if I had to make it on my own  
My life would never be the same  
My love would never be the same  
I dont want to live without your love  
  
chorus repeats
