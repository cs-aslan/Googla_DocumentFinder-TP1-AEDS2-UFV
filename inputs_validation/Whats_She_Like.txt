Whats she like when she turns around to kiss you goodnight  
When she wakes up in the morning by your side  
Whats she like  
  
Whats she like  
The yellow moon or the deep blue of the sea  
Do you feel the same way you did when it was me  
Whats she like  
  
Oh Ive been holding on  
Ive been holding on for far too long  
Ive been holding on  
Ive been holding on much too long  
  
Whats she like when youre making love and stars are in her eyes  
When youre looking for the answers in her smile  
Whats she like  
  
Oh Ive been holding on  
Ive been holding on for far too long  
Ive been holding on  
Ive been holding on much too long  
Too long  
  
I never knew I could love somebody the way I loved you  
I never thought Id be the brokenhearted  
Well nothing hurts you like the truth  
So whats she like when she turns to you  
When push comes to shove  
When she whispers in your ear that shes in love  
Whats she like  
  
Oh Ive been holding on  
Ive been holding on for far too long  
Ive been holding on  
Ive been holding on much too long  
So whats she like
