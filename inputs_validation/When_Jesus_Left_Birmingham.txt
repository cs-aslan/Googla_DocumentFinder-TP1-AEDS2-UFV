When Jesus left Birmingham  
All the disciples went crazy  
When Jesus left Birmingham  
All the people went completely nuts  
They all busted out on a wild night  
Riding high on a golden calf  
When Jesus left Birmingham  
All the people had themselves a big long laugh  
  
Well my girl shes a walker  
And she can talk herself out of any mess  
My girl she dont pray  
But somehow she seems still to be blessed  
And when those crazy nights come callin  
Man shell dance on the tables  
Like all of the rest  
When my girl left Birmingham  
She was doing what she thought was best  
  
Its all free on the inside  
I passed a very uncomfortable feeling last night  
Save us right now we need you  
To hell with all the lies and liars  
Recovery recovery I dont know about any recovery  
Inside gotta get inside  
Inside  
  
I see myself with a rosary  
Im in a garden and Im talking to myself  
I aint sayin much worth repeating  
Just askin for forgiveness and all of his best  
When those crazy nights come callin  
Man Im just as human as I can be  
When Jesus left Birmingham  
He left it there for you and me  
When Jesus left Birmingham  
He left it there for you and me  
  
So let it rock let it roll  
Let the Bible belt come and save my soul
