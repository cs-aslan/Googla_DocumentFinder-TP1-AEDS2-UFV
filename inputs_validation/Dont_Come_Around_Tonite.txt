I bring a paper  
To the cafe on the corner  
I catch a movie in the afternoon  
I spend an hour  
Doing nothing that important  
But nothings what Im in the mood to do  
This peaceful image  
Of a seen almost forgotten  
Just touched the surface  
Of my conscious mind  
Of things I used to do  
Before I knew you  
Chorus  
So dont come around here tonite  
But that doesnt mean forever  
I trust you to spare us a fight  
And humour my endeavour  
There was something about you to me  
How easier love used to be  
Well I just need to know  
That Im all right  
If you dont come around tonite  
And so I wander  
Through the workings of the city  
Where every stranger has discovered me  
With my desire my isolation  
Somehow I have to make the two agree  
And then you vanish  
All my thoughts and independance  
When you put your hands on me  
And I feel these things you do  
That Ive grown used to  
Chorus  
You say Im the one  
Youve been searching for  
But for myself I would rather be more  
Then someone who only aspires  
To forfeit your every desire  
And nights Ive been mad you are few  
Now all I am asking of you is  
Chorus  
repeat
