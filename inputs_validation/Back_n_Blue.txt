Every night  
Caught up on the same old dream  
I hear your broken heart  
Crumbling down and haunting me  
And everyday  
Try to tell myself it aint so hard  
But then I hear your name  
And it feels like a grip around my heart  
till I change the way you feel  
till I change the world  
So help me girl  
Ill show you wounds can heal  
  
Chorus  
Tell ya what Im gonna do  
Ill be comin back for you  
Ill move the mountains  
Part the sea  
Anything for you  
Ill be back n blue  
Back n blue  
  
Forget that girl  
She could never take your place  
Its hard enough  
When you look at me that way  
I know I was caught redhanded  
I wouldnt blame you if you twist the knife  
I swear Ive come to my senses  
Tell me what to do  
Anyday Ill make it right  
Ive got to change the way you feel  
If I have to Ill change the world  
So help me girl  
Ill beg borrow and steal  
If thats what it takes  
  
Chorus  
  
Back n blue  
Back n blue  
Back n blue  
Back n blue  
At ttill make you believe me  
Im prepared to make any sacrifice  
The shadow of our love keeps gettin bigger  
Without your love Ill sure die  
  
Tell you what Im gonna do  
I keep comin back for you  
Ill move the mountains  
Part the sea  
Anything for you  
Ill be back n blue back n blue  
  
Back n blue  
So help me girl  
Beg borrow and steal  
If thats what it takes  
Ill be back n blue back n blue  
Im prepared to make any sacrifice  
Back n blue  
Back n blue  
So help me girl
