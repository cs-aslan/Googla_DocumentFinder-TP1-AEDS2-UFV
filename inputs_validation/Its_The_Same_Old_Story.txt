The same old story  
Its as old as the stars above  
The same old story  
Of a boy and a girl in love  
The scenes say more moonlight  
The times say more June light  
Romances the thing  
Two hearts away deep in a dream  
  
The same old story  
Its been told much too much before  
The same old story  
But its worth telling just once more  
Its all fun and laughter  
They lived ever after in ecstasy  
The same old story but its new to me
