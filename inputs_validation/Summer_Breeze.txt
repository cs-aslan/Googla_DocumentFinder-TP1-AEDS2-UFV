I see the curtains hangin in the window in the evenin on a Friday evenight  
A little light shinin through the window lets me know that everythings
alright  
Summer breeze really makes me feel fine  
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind  
Summer breeze makes me feel fine  
Blowing through my makes me feel alright  
Makin me feel makin me feel fine  
Makes me feel fine  
Blowin through the jasmine in my mind  
O sweet days of summer the jasmines in bloom  
July is dressed up and playing a tune  
And when I come home from a hard days work  
And your waiting there  
Yes your waiting there without a care in the world  
Sometimes I see the smile waiting in the kitchen food a cookin and a place
there for two  
I see the arms that reach out to hold me in the evenin when the day is through  
Summer breeze makes me feel fine  
Blowin through the jasmine in my mind  
Summer breeze makes me feel fine blowin through my makin me feel alright  
Makin me feel makin me feel fine makes me feel right  
blowin through the jasmine in my  
Blowin blowin

Blowin through the jasmine in my
