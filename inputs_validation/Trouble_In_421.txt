The evening began as a positive swaret  
And my abode was 420 G  
But little did I know that in the very next apartment  
Thered be trouble on the brew for me  
Ubiquitous I wish I could be  
Because the clock cuts short my own day  
  
One hundred things to do before I rest my sore ass  
Upon the cushion that supports my array  
Can this be  
Trouble  
So if I may slip you a tip  
Youd best stay away from 421  
Trouble  
  
So get high the green way  
So get by the green way yes  
I knocked upon their door  
In hopes of bidding them their welcome  
And instead I was caught by an eye  
His pupil was wide open  
  
Kinda like a liquor barn at 300  
It was indoubadoubly dose derived  
It was then that they took me  
And shined their light between my eyes  
  
He said What are ya new  
Why are you here Whats the catch  
Why not explain in clear Why youre peaking around  
I wish I couldve just kept to my own  
  
My hospitality has been too well spent and Ive paid my rent  
I shouldve kept my thoughts on who mightve been inside  
So that my mind could sit and delude my pride  
I beg my common sense to keep my  
Neighbor out away from my front door  
  
Until I find a way  
To hide myself from those in 421 one  
one away from the good one
