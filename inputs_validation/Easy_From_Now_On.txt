There he goes gone again  
Same old storys gotta come to an end  
Lovin him was a one way street  
But Im gettin off where the crossroads meet  
Quarter moon in a ten cent town  
Its time for me to lay my heartaches down  
Saturday night gonna make myself a name  
Take a month of Sundays to try and explain  
Its gonna be easy to fill the heart of a thirsty woman  
Harder to kill the ghost of a no good man  
And Ill be ridin high in a fandangled sky  
Its gonna be easy its gonna be easy from now on  
Raw as whip but clean as a bone  
Soft to touch when you take me home  
When the mornin comes and its time for me to leave  
Dont worry bout me I got a wild card up my sleeve  
Its gonna be easy to fill the heart of a thirsty woman  
Harder to kill the ghost of a no good man  
And Ill be ridin high in a fandangled sky  
Its gonna be easy its gonna be easy  
Its gonna be easy from now on
