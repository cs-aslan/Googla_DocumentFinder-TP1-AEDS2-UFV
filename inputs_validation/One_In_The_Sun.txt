Somewhere the sun is shining  
On some unhappy day  
Somewhere theres people laughing  
They think theyve found the way  
  
But its not me  
Its not me no no now  
Its not me its not me its not me its not me  
Im not the one  
  
Well sure I used to cry but I used to laugh to  
I had ups as well as downs you see  
But I been down now for so long  
Ive forgotten all my dreams  
  
Yeah it must be me  
It must be me you know now  
Its not me its not me its not me its not me  
Im not the one in the sun  
  
Since I became Ive wondered what Ive become  
Lord I know it cant be much longer before  
I find my place in sun  
  
Sometimes I wonder will I figure something out  
Will I find a reason good enough to live  
Lord if it dont dawn on me pretty soon  
I think somethings gonna give  
  
Yeah it might be me  
Yeah it just might be me yea  
Its not me no it cant be  
Cause Im not the one in the sun  
  
No Im not the one  
Yea Im not the one  
But Im not the one  
Sorry to say Im not the one
