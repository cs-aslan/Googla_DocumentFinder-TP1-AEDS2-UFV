Do you know  
And do you know  
Do you know  
  
Chorus  
Do you know what it feels like  
Loving someone thats in a rush to throw you away  
Do you know do you know do you know  
Do you know what it feels like  
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed  
Do you know do you know do you know do ya  
  
If birds flying south is a sign of changes  
At least you can predict this every year  
Love you never know the minute it ends suddenly  
I cant get it to speak  
Maybe if I knew all the things it took to save us  
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me  
Look in your eyes to see something about me  
Im standing on the edge and I dont know what else to give  
  
Chorus  
  
How can I love you  
How can I love you  
How can I love you  
How can I love you  
If you just dont talk to me babe  
  
It flows through my head  
The question is she needed  
And decide all the man I can ever be  
Looking at the last 3 years like I did  
I could never see us ending like this Do you know  
Seeing your face no more on my pillow  
Is a scene thats never ever happened to me Do you know  
But after this episode I dont see  
You could never tell the next thing life could be  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Do you know  
Do you know  
Do you know  
Do you know  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Repeat x2  
Do you know  
Do you know  
Do you know  
Do you know  
Do ya
