Gone with the wind  
Just like a leaf that has blown away  
Gone with the wind  
My romance has flown away  
  
Yesterdays kisses are still on my lips  
Ive had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips  
  
But now all is gone  
Gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart  
Gone with the wind  
The gladness that filled my heart  
  
Just like a flame  
Love burned brightly then became  
An empty smoke dream that has gone  
Gone with the wind  
  
Gone gone gone with the wind  
Just like a leaf that has blown away  
Gone with the wind  
My romance has flown away  
Yesterdays kisses are still still on my lips  
Ive had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips  
  
But now allall is gone  
Gone is the rapture that fills my heart  
Gone with the wind  
The gladness that filled my heart  
  
Just like a flame  
Love burned brightly then became  
An empty smoke dream that has  
Gone with the wind  
  
Gone with the wind
