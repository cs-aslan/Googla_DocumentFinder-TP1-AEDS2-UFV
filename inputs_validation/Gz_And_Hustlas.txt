But this time Ima hit yo ass with a touch  
To leave motherfuckers in a daze fucked up  
So sit back relax new jacks get smacked  
Its Snoop Doggy Dogg Im at the top of the stack  
I dont lack for a second and Im still checking  
The dopest motherfucker that ya hearing on the record

And Im high till I dizzie rizzide

Chorus  
  
How many hoes in your motherfucking group  
Want to take a ride in my 78 Coupe DeVille  
Chill as I take you on a trip  
Where them niggas ride and slide you know about the East Side  
Niggas like myself here to show you where its at  
With my hoes on my side and my strap on my back  
Papers I stack daily and Death Row is still the label that pays me  
But you know how that goes  
We flow toe for toe if you aint on the Row  
Fuck you and your hoe really doe so check it  
Its Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip  
Still clocking grip and really dont give a shit  
About nothing at all just my Doggs stepping through the fog  
And Im still gonna fade em all  
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hanging  
How many hoes in ninetyfour will I be banging  
Every single one to get the job done  
As I dip skip flip right back to two one  
Where the sun be shining and I be ryhming  
Its me Snoop DOdoubleG and Im climbing  
  
Chorus  
  
I come creeping through the fog with my sagging Dukes  
East Side Long Beach in a 78 Coupe DeBille  
Im rolling with the G Funk bumping in my shit and it dont quit  
So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set  
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit  
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfucking dick  
And the Compton niggas all about to set trip  
Swing it back bring it back just like this  
And if you with my shit then blaze up another spliff  
And keep the motherfucking blunt in your pocket loc  
cause Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke  
See its a West coast thing where Im from  
And if you want some get some bad enough take some  
But watch the gun by my side  
Because it represents me and the motherfucking East Side  
So bow down to the bow wow cause bow wow  
Yippie yo you cant see my flow  
My shit is dope original now you know  
And cant no hood fuck with Death Rizzow  
  
Chorus
