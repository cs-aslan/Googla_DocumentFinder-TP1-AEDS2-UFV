Well gather round people  
And listen to this  
I am a hermit of burial ridge  
Once I was shaven and worked every day  
But the call of the wild just lured me away  
Singing hi hi ho its a water a day  
On my way to an unmarked grave  
Hi hi ho its a water a day  
On my way to an unmarked grave  
  
Theres pals at my table and mud on the floor  
Theres bears in the area and wolves at the door  
Their singing a song about cookie McBride  
Who goes out atrapping and then tails their hide  
  
Hi hi hey its a water a day  
On my way to an unhappy grave  
Hi hi hey its a water a day  
On my way to a rain filled grave  
So if youre planning a natural trip  
Dont call up snooping on burial ridge  
The searchers will come and discover your hide  
High wet and hanging like cookie McBride  
  
Hi hi hey its a water a day  
On your way to an unhappy grave  
Hi hi hey its a water a day  
Who will remember the money you saved  
Im in over your head  
Youre in over your head
