I woke up one morning  
Waking with the rising sun  
Woke up one morning  
Awakin with the rising sun ahh  
Thought about my baby  
Did I just do what she done  
Well I shoulda loved you more  
I know I didnt treat her right  
Oh yes I shoulda loved you more  
I know I didnt treat her right  
I know that a woman needs  
Rollin every day and night  
Oh yeah  
Break  
Well my heart beat like a hammer  
My eyes plumb full of tears  
Yes my heart beat like a hammer  
My eyes plumb full of tears  
Shes been gone about an hour  
But it seems like a thousand years  
Dont ever dog your woman  
You know youre gonna ruin yourself  
Dont ever dog your woman  
You know youre gonna ruin yourself  
Know that a woman shell  
Run off with somebody else  
Oh yeah
