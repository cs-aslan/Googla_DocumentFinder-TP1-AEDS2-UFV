Canned laughter for applause  
Youve got open doors  
In and out of their wives  
In and out of your smalls  
Its not a BAFTA youre after  
You want a million dollar lay  
By all means necessary  
You will get your way  
  
It all seems so easy  
But so are you  
Thats what Ive heard them say  
  
All the makeup that you wear  
Cant hide the flaws  
Your work in charity for your own cause  
You wont be dating a teacher  
Youd rather shag a manic street preacher  
By all means necessary  
You will get your way  
  
It seems all so easy  
But so are you  
Thats what Ive heard them say  
  
Sex with a stranger  
Youve been laid in a manger  
And you think hes your saviour  
Will he leave his pager  
You could be his daughter  
Look what hes bought ya  
But the money wont change ya  
Of that theres no danger  
Now your lifes gettin darker  
Its you that theyre after  
Fifteen minutes a martyr  
Blame it on your father  
That dress nearly fits ya  
Girl whats possessed you  
Can we please take your picture  
You know theyll forget ya  
Ooh yeah  
  
It all seems so easy  
But so are you  
Thats what Ive heard them say  
  
By all means necessary  
You will get your way  
By all means necessary  
You will get your way  
By all means necessary  
You will get your way  
  
You dont get your way  
By giving it away  
  
You dont get your way  
By giving it away
