Oh sweetheart  
Put the bottle down  
Youve got  
Too much talent  
I see you  
Through those  
Bloodshot eyes  
Theres a cure  
Youve found it  
  
Slow motion  
Sparks You got that chill  
Now dont deny it  
But boys will be boys  
Oh yes they will  
They dont want  
To define it  
Just give up the game  
And get into me  
If youre looking  
For thrills  
Then get cold feet  
  
Oh no  
I do not  
Hook up up  
I go slow  
So if you want me  
I dont come cheap  
Keep your thing  
In your pants  
And your heart  
On your sleeve  
Oh no  
I do not  
Hook up up  
I fall deep  
Cause the more you try  
The harder Ill fight  
To say goodnight  
  
I cant cook no  
But I can clean  
Up the mess you left  
Lay your head down  
And feel the beat  
As I kiss  
Your forehead  
  
This may not  
Last but this is now  
So love the one  
Youre with  
You wanna chase  
But youre chasing  
Your tail  
And quick fix  
Wont ever  
Get you well  
  
Oh no  
I do not  
Hook up up  
I go slow  
So if you want me  
I dont come cheap  
Keep your thing  
In your pants  
And your heart  
On your sleeve  
Oh no  
I do not  
Hook up up  
I fall deep  
Cause the more  
You try  
The harder  
Ill fight  
To say goodnight  
  
Cause I feel  
The distance  
Between us  
Could be over  
With a snap  
Of your fingers  
Oh oh oh yeah  
  
Oh no  
I do not  
Hook up up  
I go slow  
So if you want me  
I dont come cheap  
Keep your thing  
In your pants  
And your heart  
On your sleeve  
Oh no  
I do not  
Hook up up  
I fall deep  
Cause the more  
You try  
The harder  
Ill fight  
To say goodnight  
  
Oh sweetheart  
Put the bottle down  
Cause I dont wanna  
Miss out
