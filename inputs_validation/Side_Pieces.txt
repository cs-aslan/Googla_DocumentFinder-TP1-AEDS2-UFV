Drake  
Side pieces  
I know that youre watching this from home  
I cant wait to see you on the road  
Cheering from the shadows I hear you calling out  
Wifey sees a text and asks whats this all about  
I tell her youre just a friend  
A lot of these guys are dying for this song to end  
Im asking would you be mine  
Would you get on this flight to Cleveland Ohio at 245  
I had a rough game I took two shots I was 0 for 2  
Tough day I need that one thing only you can do  
Skylar this is the one thing that Id be for you  
This goes out to all my side pieces  
Side pieces side pieces  
This goes out to all my side pieces  
You know that youll never be the main one  
City to city I see you wearing the same one  
Side pieces side pieces  
Los Angeles I want you to make some noise for the real king of side pieces
Brian McKnight one time  
  
Brian McKnight  
This is dedicated to all the side pieces  
I know youll never be more  
And youll always be less  
But theres courage in knowing that youre ok being shit  
I already got a starter but Im looking for the rest of my team  
Side pieces in training go on and wave your hands for Drake and me  
Dont be embarrassed  
Side pieces where you at  
Probably in the top balcony  
I know youre not down here in front of us you got to be way back in the back  
They cant even see us  
Side pieces go on and be side pieces ya  
Side pieces
