Shes sun and rain shes fire and ice  
A little crazy but its nice  
And when she gets mad you best leave her alone  
Cause shell rage just like a river  
Then shell beg you to forgive her  
Shes every woman that Ive ever known  
  
Shes so New York and then LA  
And every town along the way  
Shes every place that Ive never been  
Shes making love on rainy nights  
Shes a stroll through Christmas lights  
And shes everything I want to do again  
  
It needs no explanation  
Cause it all makes perfect sense  
When it comes down to temptation  
Shes on both sides of the fence  
  
No it needs no explanation  
Cause it all makes perfect sense  
When it comes down to temptation  
Shes on both sides of the fence  
  
Shes anything but typical  
Shes so unpredictable  
Oh but even at her worst she aint that bad  
Shes as real as real can be  
And shes every fantasy  
Lord shes every lover that Ive ever had  
And shes every lover that Ive never had
