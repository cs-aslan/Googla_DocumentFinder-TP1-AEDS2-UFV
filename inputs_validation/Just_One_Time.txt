Oh oh oh how I miss you so  
Mmm I need you so  
I I Id give this heart of mine  
If I could see you just one time  
If I could see you just one time  
Oh how itd ease my troubled mind  
If I could hold you just one time  
And then pretend that youre still mine  
Oh oh oh how I miss you so  
Mmm I need you so  
I I Id give this heart of mine  
If I could see you just one time  
Wish I could really one more time  
Turn back the pages in there Id find  
That same old love that once was mine  
Wish I could see you just one time  
Oh oh oh how I miss you so  
Mmm I need you so  
I I Id give this heart of mine  
If I could see you just one time  
Oh oh oh how I miss you so  
Mmm I need you so  
I I Id give this heart of mine  
If I could see you just one time
