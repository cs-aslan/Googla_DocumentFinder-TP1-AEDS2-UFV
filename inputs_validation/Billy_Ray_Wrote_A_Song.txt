Well we left home free spirits me and Billy Ray  
He was a going to be going to be going and I was running away  
Now we was broke before we got started and it got worse later on  
I wrote home for money and Billy Ray wrote a song  
  
Now the people sure get picky when it comes to givin a ride  
It didnt take long us leavin but I thought wed never arrive  
Now we get more rides than hitches as we hitch hiked along  
I got sore feet and blisters and Billy Ray wrote a song  
  
Billy Ray wrote a song about everything we did  
I was afindin fault he was findin rhyms that fit  
Well we did a lot of thinkin most of my thoughts were wrong  
I wanted to ride to Nashville but Billy Ray wrote a song  
  
Well we got into Nashville tired ahungry and cold  
If wed had a dime between us we could acalled everybody we know  
We found a bar still open a little band was pickin away  
And I set in to drinkin Billy Ray set in to play  
  
He was an overnight sensation I heard the radio say  
Somehow they failed to mention the miles all along the way  
Anyway thats how it happened yeah and it sure happened strong  
They wrote about it happenin Billy Ray wrote a song  
  
Billy Ray wrote a song about everything he knew  
If Id a known what I know now well Ida been writing too  
Billy Ray sure had it made and Im still taggin along  
Im awriting home for money Billy Ray still writes the songs
