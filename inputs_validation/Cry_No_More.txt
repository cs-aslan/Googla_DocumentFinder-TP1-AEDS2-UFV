Theres a time for all our innocence  
When the tears arent far away  
And a time to build a strong defense  
When the boys too old to play  
And we learn the hard way  
Day by day  
Giving in but always coming back for more  
And we cry no morecry no more  
Theres a time for games and visions  
And the stake is more or less  
Theres a time for fast decisions  
When our dreams become success  
We do anything to raise that score  
Cause the end will always justify the means  
And we cry no more  
Cry no moreand we cry no more  
Our years in misery  
Made dreams reality Ohh  
And we cry no more  
Cry no moreand we cry no more
