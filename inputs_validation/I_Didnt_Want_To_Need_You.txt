Baby I never gave my heart to anyone oh no  
Used to think that love was a game  
I used to make it just for fun  
When we spent the night together  
Didnt mean it meant that much  
Now I just cant live without your touch  
  
I didnt want to to need you no  
I didnt want to want you like I do  
I didnt mean to fall  
Didnt want to care at all  
I didnt want to need you  
Like I need you now  
  
I cant get no sleep  
Cause I keep thinking of you all through the  
Night oh yeah  
My eyes cant wait to see you again  
My arms cant wait to hold you tight oh yeah  
And when youre laying here beside me  
There is nothing else I need  
Never thought that this could ever be  
  
I didnt want to to need you oh no  
I didnt want to want you like I do  
I didnt mean to fall  
Didnt want to care at all  
I didnt want to need you  
Like I need you now  
  
Ive always been free  
To leave when I want to leave  
But its not up to me anymore  
I didnt want to need you  
  
I didnt want to to need you no  
I didnt want to want you like I do  
I didnt mean to fall  
Didnt want to care at all  
I didnt want to need you  
But I need you now
