gary rossington  ed king  johnny van zant  mike estes  
  
Getting work aint easy in the hills of tennessee  
But things are bad all over my friends keep telling me  
Even though I grew up there and never thought Id leave  
Had too many bills to pay seven mouths to feed  
Movin to the city was all that I could do  
Got them hillbilly blues  
  
People here wont say goodmorning they wont even take the time  
I guess I know just how it feels to have something on your mind  
So all I want is to go back home and fish in a mountain stream  
This ol life Im living lord you know it aint for me  
They say the sun it shines out here but all I see is rain  
Got them hillbilly blues  
Got them hillbilly blues  
  
All I want is to go back home and fish in a mountain stream  
This ol life Im living lord you know it aint for me  
They say the sun it shines out here but all I see is rain  
Got them hillbilly blues  
Hillbilly blues  
Hillbilly blues
