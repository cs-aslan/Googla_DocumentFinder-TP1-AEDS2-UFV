A man in my shoes runs a light  
All the papers lie tonight  
But falling over you  
Is the news of the day  
  
Angels fall like rain  
And love is all of heaven way  
Inside you the time moves and she dont fade  
The ghost in you she dont fade away  
  
The race is on Im on your side  
But hearing you my engines died  
Im in the mood for you  
Or for running away  
  
All the stars come down in you  
But love love love you cant give it away  
Inside you the time moves and she dont fade  
The ghost in you she dont fade  
Inside you the time moves and she dont fade away  
Dont you know she dont fade  
  
Dont you go it makes no sense  
And all these talking supermen  
Just take away the time just to get it away  
Aint it just like the rain  
Cause love love love love is only heaven away  
Inside you the time moves and she dont fade  
The ghost in you she dont fade away  
  
Inside you the time moves and she dont fade away  
The ghost in you she dont fade  
  
A man in my shoes runs a light  
But all the papers lie tonight  
Falling over you is the news of the day  
And love will not fade away  
And love love love will not fade away
