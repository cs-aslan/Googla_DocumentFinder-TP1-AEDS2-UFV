Quite some time I been sittin it out  
Didnt take no chances I was a prisoner of doubt  
I knocked down the wailin wall it aint no sin  
I got the feel of fortune deal me in  
  
Chorus  
Im comin straight on for you  
You made my mind  
Now Im stronger now Im comin through  
Straight on straight on for you  
Straight on for you  
  
Now I know I got to play my hand  
What the winner dont know the gambler understands  
My heart keeps playin it through with you my friend  
Ill take my chances on you again and again again  
  
Chorus
