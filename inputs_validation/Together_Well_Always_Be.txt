I saw you over there  
But what could I do  
I couldnt stand and stare  
Or come and talk to you  
And it is always fair  
To formally be introduced  
To you especially  
  
I took it on my own  
To come an talk to you  
Because you were alone  
I hope I didnt intrude  
Observing you had shown  
That you were so lonely and blue  
  
Nothing beats a failure like a try  
Theres a great reward  
Someone will surely hail you  
  
If you try  
But you must try hard  
And if I hadnt tried  
I wonder where Id be  
If I upon relied  
On fate you meeting me  
But because I tried  
Together well always be  
  
Nothing beats a failure like a try  
Theres a great reward  
Someone will surely hail you  
  
Oh darling  
Together well always be
