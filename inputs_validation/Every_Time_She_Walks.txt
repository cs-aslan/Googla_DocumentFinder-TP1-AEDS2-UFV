Listen in  
Listen  
Listen in  
Listen  
Listen in to the sound  
All the day stops  
Chords keep ringing  
Cant believe what Ive found  
Im shellshocked  
Finding out  
When I hear her coming round  
I drop everything  
When I hear her coming round  
Yeah  
Everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground  
Movin underneath  
And I dont remember how it ever was before  
Daylight  
Its alright  
Even when shes gone  
cause it wont be long  
I know everything is different  
Cause everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground  
Movin underneath  
And I dont remember how it ever was before  
Everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground movin underneath  
And I dont remember how it ever was before  
Everything is turned around  
And nothing looks the same to me  
She is music when she walks  
Shes playing me a melody  
Everything is turned around  
And nothing looks the same to me  
Listen in  
Listen  
Listen in to the sound  
All the day stops  
Chords keep ringing  
Got my feet on the ground  
Im not losing losing  
When I hear her coming round  
I drop everything  
When I hear her coming round  
Yeah  
Cause everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground  
Movin underneath  
And I dont remember how it ever was before  
Everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground  
Movin underneath  
And I dont remember how it ever was before  
Everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
Its like the world is turning just for me  
Its like the world is turning just for me
