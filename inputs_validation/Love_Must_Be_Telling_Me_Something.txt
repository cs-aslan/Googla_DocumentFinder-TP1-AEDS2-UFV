Cant see cant breathe  
Cant get up off my knees  
I dont know what comes over me  
Whenever you come near  
  
Hearts poundin in my chest  
Little voice inside my head  
I cant hear a word it said  
But the feelins loud and clear  
  
Love must be tellin me somethin  
Givin me some kind of sign  
Spellin it out for me  
Love must be tellin me  
I must be fallin tonight  
  
Well Ive been in love and lost  
I swore us one and all  
No matter what the cost  
Gotta learn to live without  
  
No you werent in my plans  
But baby here I am  
I still dont understand  
But I know there aint no doubt  
  
Love must be tellin me somethin  
Givin me some kind of sign  
Spellin it out for me  
Love must be tellin me  
I must be fallin tonight  
  
No you werent in my plans  
But now baby here I am  
I still dont understand  
But I know there aint no doubt  
  
Love must be tellin me  
Love must be tellin me  
Love must be tellin me  
  
Love must be tellin me somethin  
Givin me some kind of sign  
Spellin it out for me  
Love must be tellin me  
I must be fallin tonight  
  
Love must be tellin me  
Love must be tellin me  
  
I must be fallin tonight
