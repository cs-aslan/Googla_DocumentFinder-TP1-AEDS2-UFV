Well I never been to Spain  
But I kinda like the music  
Say the ladies are insane there  
And they sure know how to use it  
The dont abuse it  
Never gonna lose it  
I cant refuse it  
Well I never been to England  
But I kinda like the Beatles  
Well I headed for Las Vegas  
Only made it out to Needles  
Can you feel it  
It must be real it  
Feels so good  
Oh feels so good  
Well I never been to heaven  
But I been to Oklahoma  
Well they tell me I was born there  
But I really dont remember  
In Oklahoma not Arizona  
What does it matter  
What does it matter  
Well I never been to Spain  
But I kinda like the music  
Say the ladies are insane there  
And they sure know how to use it  
The dont abuse it  
Never gonna lose it  
I cant refuse it  
Well I never been to heaven  
But I been to Oklahoma  
Well they tell me I was born there  
But I really dont remember  
In Oklahoma not Arizona  
What does it matter  
What does it matter
