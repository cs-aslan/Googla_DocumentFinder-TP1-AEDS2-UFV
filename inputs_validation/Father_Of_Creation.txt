We come into Your presence  
To sing a song to You  
A song of praise and honour  
For all the things you helped us through  
  
You gave a life worth living  
A life in love in with You  
And now I just love giving  
All my praises back to You  
  
Youre the Father of Creation  
The risen Lamb of God  
Youre the One who walked away  
From the empty tomb that day  
And You set your people free  
With love and liberty  
And I can walk with you  
Every night and every day
