He blew into town like a paper sack  
In a stolen car with a shotgun in the back he said  
She cant run now she cant hide  
Im gonna get her back for her lies lies lies  
  
He taught her how to pout  
And he taught her how to tease  
And he taught her how to beg  
When she fell down to her knees he said  
Your face is different  
But youre really all the same  
I have to teach you a lesson again and again  
  
See I feel no pleasure  
And I feel no pain  
So what else can I do  
I cant stop killing you  
  
When youre out there in the dark  
Ill come rushing through your brain  
When you wake up in the morning  
Ill be coursing through your veins  
When youre swimming in the water  
Im the hand that drags you under  
Im the lightning that strikes you  
Just before you hear the thunder  
I cant stop killing you  
  
Well she woke up in the bathroom  
With her face upon the floor  
She said I dont know what Im doing here  
But Ive been here before  
And the fixit man had fixed her  
Cause hes such a little hitler  
And he loves the feel of power  
That she gives him through her terror  
I cant stop killing you  
  
Well she looked into the mirror  
And she smoked her cigarette  
And she wondered where shed go now  
To find a place she could forget  
All the things he said hed do  
I cant stop killing you  
  
When youre out there in the dark  
Ill come rushing through your brain  
When you wake up in the morning  
Ill be coursing through your veins  
When youre swimming in the water  
Im the hand that drags you under  
Im the lightning that strikes you  
Just before you hear the thunder  
I cant stop killing you
