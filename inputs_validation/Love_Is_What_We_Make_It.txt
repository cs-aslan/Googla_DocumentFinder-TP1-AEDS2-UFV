Girl weve come a long long way  
Too far for us to end this way  
Sometimes the cost of love is hard  
And we must pay this little giveandtake  
  
So dont you think if you and I  
Were just about and let our hearts decide  
Maybe it would all work out in time  
So wont you stay please dont go away  
  
Love love is what we make it  
We can make it so much better if we try  
Love love is what we make it  
So lets make it real good this time  
  
Is it too late to change your mind  
Or has it gone to fall this time  
Wont you hold me just one more time  
Lets just say theres a chance for you and me  
  
Love love is what we make it
