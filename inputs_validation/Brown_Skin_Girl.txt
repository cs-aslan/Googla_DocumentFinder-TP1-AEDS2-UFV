Shes a force of nature that I cant outrun  
A devil and a savior all in one  
Her eyes can heal me or they can make me bleed  
Her lips have me addicted to the poetry  
But never really knowing just who I am  
And I confess that I dont mind at all  
Cause I would trade the world away to stay inside this dream  
Ill never find a better place to fall no no  
I got a lover a brown skin girl  
Shes got a magic of another world  
And every time that I think of her Im on fire fire  
She knows a way a spiritual flow  
Making me dizzy like a vertigo  
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire yeah  
I get a strong vibration  
When she just says my name  
And it drives me crazy  
Cause I dont know if she feels the same  
But she likes to breathe some mystery in all she does  
She laughs and says that Im under her spell  
Now I wont lie I enjoy the ride and pray it never ends  
I feel her deeper than anything Ive felt  
I got a lover a brown skin girl  
Shes got a magic of another world  
And every time that I think of her Im on fire fire  
She knows a way a spiritual flow  
Making me dizzy like a vertigo  
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire  
Oh I cant help but crave another taste of her  
Like a drowning man thats praying for the rain  
And how she worked her way inside Ill never understand  
Shes too beautiful to ever take the blame  
But shell always fan the flame  
My brown skin girl my brown skin girl  
I got a lover a brown skin girl  
Shes got a magic of another world  
And every time that I think of her Im on fire fire  
She knows a way a spiritual flow  
Making me dizzy like a vertigo  
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire yeah  
I got a lover a brown skin girl  
Shes got a magic of another world  
And every time that I think of her Im on fire fire  
She knows a way a spiritual flow  
Making me dizzy like a vertigo  
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire
