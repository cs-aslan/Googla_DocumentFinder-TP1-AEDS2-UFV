I finally found someone that knocks me off my feet  
I finally found the one that makes me feel complete  
We started over coffee we started out as friends  
Its funny how from simple things the best things begin  
  
This time its different dah dah dah dah  
Its all because of you dah dah dah dah  
Its better than its ever been  
Cause we can talk it through  
Oh my favorite line was Can I call you sometime  
Its all you had to say to take my breath away  
  
This is it oh I finally found someone  
Someone to share my life  
I finally found the one to be with every night  
Cause whatever I do its just got to be you  
My life has just begun  
I finally found someone oh someone  
I finally found someone oh  
  
Did I keep you waiting I didnt mind  
I apologize baby thats fine  
I would wait forever just to know you were mine  
And I love your hair are you sure it looks right  
I love what you wear isnt it too tight  
Youre exceptional I cant wait for the rest of my life  
  
This is it oh I finally found someone  
Someone to share my life  
I finally found the one to be with every night  
Cause whatever I do its just got to be you  
My life has just begun  
I finally found someone oh someone  
I finally found someone oh  
  
Whatever I do its just got to be you  
My life has just begun  
I finally found someone
