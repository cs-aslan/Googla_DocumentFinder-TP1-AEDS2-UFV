Babe  
Come in from the cold  
Put that coat to rest  
Step inside  
Take a deep breath  
And do what you do best  
Yea  
Kick off them shoes  
And leave those city streets  
I do believe  
Love came our way  
Fate did arrange  
For us to meet  
Refrain  
I love when you do  
That hocus pocus to me  
The way that you touch  
Youve got the power to heal  
You give me that look  
Its almost unreal  
Its almost unreal  
Hey  
We cant stop the rain  
Lets find a place by the fire  
Sometimes I feel  
Strange as it seems  
Youve been in my dreams  
All my life  
Its a crazy world out there  
Lets hope our prayers  
Are in good hands tonight
