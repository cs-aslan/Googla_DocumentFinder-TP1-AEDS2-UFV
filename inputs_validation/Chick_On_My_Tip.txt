She wears a tight skirt but it wont rip or tear  
When I went out with her she got extensions in her hair  
She got style and she got the cat moves  
Youre gonna keep the beat Bud because shes coming after you  
  
I aint high I wont lose  
I might be lookin for attention but Im just not gunna lose  
Its Friday night and theres going to be another chick on my tip  
But it wont be you baby  
  
Got one more trick up my sleeve  
One more thing to say to you before I leave  
Yo girl you dont mean a thing to me  
And if you thought you ever did you were high on things  
  
I said high no but Im not lying  
Gunna lose a Goddamn thing tonight  
  
I saidb Friday night theres going to be  
Another chick on my tip but it wont be you baby  
  
Oh if you change your ways  
Oh I would lay down any time with you  
With you  
  
But I fear one more slip and this will go right  
But Im not ready to say goodbye  
Because first I got a couple of tails  
Im gunna kick it on down your butthole  
  
High low High on Booze  
Run for attention but I just cant lose  
Friday night theres going to be  
Another chick on my tip but it wont be me  
  
But oh  
Oh if you change your ways  
Oh I would lay down anytime with her  
With her  
  
Got one my my my  
I know we had a couple of times  
But Im ready to go  
Im gunna kick it on down your butthole  
  
High low High on booze  
Im gonna run for attention but I just cant lose  
Friday night theres going to be  
Another chick on my dick but it wont be me  
  
But oh  
Oh if youll change your ways  
I would lay down anytime with her With her
