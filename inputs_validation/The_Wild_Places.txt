I was walking alone through the lofty San Juans  
With a heart full of light  
And a head full of songs  
I was thinking of time  
And how much it will cost  
To recapture the souls  
That we surely have lost  
  
In the cities and towns  
There are millions who dream  
But the traffics so loud  
That you cant hear them scream  
Theres a heaven on earth  
That so few ever find  
Though the maps in your soul  
And the roads in your mind  
  
So many mountains before us  
So many rivers to cross  
Where is the wisdom to bring  
Back the vision weve lost  
  
Can we gaze with wonder of children  
Into the deafening night  
Has it gotten so dark  
That we cannot remember the light  
  
When you sleep on the ground  
With the stars in your face  
You can feel the full length  
Of the beauty and grace  
In the wild places man  
Is an unwelcome guest  
But its here than Im found  
And its here I feel blessed
