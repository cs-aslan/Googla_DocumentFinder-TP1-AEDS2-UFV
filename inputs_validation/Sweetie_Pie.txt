Sweetie pie  
Ive fallen in love  
And the joke is on me  
And the suns given up  
Im depending on you  
To see I get safely to  
The port where my heart  
Is too lost to find  
And will be there to meet you when its your time  
  
Sweetie pie  
Im ending my life  
Because Ive fallen in love  
And nothing is enough  
To see I get safely to  
The port where my heart  
Is too lost to find  
And will be there to meet you when its your time  
  
Sweetie pie  
How I feel in my mind  
And how I live in he world  
They are oceans apart  
To see I get safely to  
The port where my heart  
Is too lost to find  
And will be there to meet you when its your time
