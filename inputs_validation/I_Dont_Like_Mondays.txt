The silicon chip inside her head gets switched to overload  
And nobodys gonna go to school today  
Shes going to make them stay at home  
And daddy doesnt understand her he always said she was good as gold  
And he can see no reason cause there are no reasons  
What reason do you need to be shown

And the playing stopped in the playground now  
She wants to play with her toys a while  
And schools out early and soon well be learning  
The lesson today is how to die  
And then the bullhorn cackles and the captain tackles  
With the problems and the hows and whys

What reason do you need to die die ohoho
