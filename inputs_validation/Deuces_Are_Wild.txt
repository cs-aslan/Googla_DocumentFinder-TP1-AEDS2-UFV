I love to look into your big brown eyes  
They talk to me and seem to hypnotize  
You say the things nobody dares to say  
And Im not about to let you fly away  
My lover with no jet lag  
Well stay up all night in my sleepin bag  
You got a heartbeatin rhythm from the subterranean  
I really love you little girl I dont need to explain  
I love you cause your deuces are wild girl  
Like a double shot of lovin so fine  
I been lovin you since you was a child girl  
cause you and me is two of a kind  
Like deja vu I feel like Ive been here  
Or somewhere else but youve been always near  
Its you thats in my dreams Im beggin for  
But I woke up when someone slammed the door  
So hard I fell out of bed  
Screamin mamas little baby loves shortnin bread  
And the moral of the story I can testify  
I get stoned on you girl thats the best reason why
