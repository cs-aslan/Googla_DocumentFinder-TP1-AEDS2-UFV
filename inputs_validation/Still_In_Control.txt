Verse 1  
Lately Ive been thinkin  
Thinking bout you  
And all the things  
Ive seen you go through  
Your mother the kids and  
The problems at home  
Sorry I wish I could fix whats wrong  
I hurt when you hurt and  
I cry when you cry  
Even the deep ones  
Sometimes wonder why am I going through  
Im waiting but still no use  
  
Chorus  
Hes still in control  
Hes sovereign and He knows  
Just how it feels to be afraid  
Have folk you love walk away  
Be still and know Hes still in control  
  
Verse 2  
Lately depression  
Your job and your life  
Weighs on your mind  
All day and all night  
You know every scripture  
And what prayer to pray  
Only a fool would think  
Itll all go away  
But there is a use  
For you theres a plan  
A High Priest who knows  
And who understands what you cannot say  
Just a little longer can you wait  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
Dont know what tomorrow will bring  
Or if this sickness will ever leave  
You can paint a perfect picture  
But will it ever look like it used to be  
See one thing I know for sure  
This season made you stronger and more mature  
Cant you see how far youve come  
And when you look back  
Its gonna be worth it oooh  
  
Chorus  
  
Hes still in control  
Hes still in control  
Hes still in control  
repeat and fade out
