I know somewhere out in the world  
There is a gal for me  
Id like to find and make you mine  
How happy we would be   
We wouldnt need a moonlit night  
To sit outdoors and spoon  
Cause I would buy a rocket ship  
And take you to the moon  
  
We would have our honeymoon  
On the rocket ship  
We would fly from star to star  
On our wedding trip  
You could make your wedding gown  
Out of a big moonbeam  
Sprinkle stardust in your hair  
Youd be a perfect dream  
  
Wed sit on top of the universe  
With no one else around  
Id reach right up and pick the stars a  
Ad make you a pretty crown  
Id place it on your little head  
And kiss your smiling lips  
As we glided out through space  
Upon the rocket ship  
  
CHORUS  
  
Then wed go strolling arm in arm  
Along the milky way  
We would visit every planet  
On our wedding day  
We would laugh and love sweetheart  
And you could be my wife  
We would find the land of love  
Out there in paradise  
  
We would have our honeymoon  
On the rocket ship  
We would fly from star to star  
On our wedding trip  
Id take my old guitar along  
And we could softly croon  
On our journey through the sky  
And headed for the moon
