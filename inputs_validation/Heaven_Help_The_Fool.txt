I was born in a flatland usa and all my dreams led me to L A  
Another chase of rags to riches I learned to throw some fancy pitches  
I found out what aint and which is just exactly cool well all right  
Heaven help the fool heaven help the fool  
Got a place in Malibu like you never seen  
Picking out your lady friend from Penthouse magazine  
You oughta see the chrome gleam on my Mercedes all shiny and new  
Hey Im the Jack of Diamonds the boy with all the clues  
Not a pretty vanity no no not me Glorified insanity no no not me  
Ooh Im a hypersupervisor fast driver star driver fool  
Heaven help the fool professional gimmefiver heaven help the fool  
Anything you could want to be you can buy even get it free  
Make yourself a smoother dancer fill your head with answers  
Never a backward glancer its you who makes the rules aah  
Heaven help the fool heaven help the fool  
No no never a backward glancer fool heaven help the fool  
I meet alot of pentagram heart of the star thats what you are  
You can trade your soul for an electric guitar  
Ooh not a pretty vanity no no not me Glorified insanity no no not me  
And when they offer golden apples are you sure youll refuse  
Heaven help the fool are you sure youll refuse it Heaven help the fool  
Its like a deaf man dancing or a blind man shooting pool  
Heaven help the fool heaven help the fool
