You broke my heart tore it apart  
Thought it was cute thought it was smart  
But now Im back and Ive got the strength of ten  
So I got a message for you my friend  
  
Chorus  
Im Daniel waitin in the lions den  
Daniel waitinfor that lion to come  
Daniel waitinin the lions den  
dumb dumb dee dumb dumb dee dee dumb dumb  
  
That old lions mean and long in the tooth  
And like you baby hes out on the loose  
Messin hearts up time and time again  
Now its the time for that messin to end  
  
Chorus  
  
At night I hear you out prowling around  
Tearing guys up scaring em down  
Now all that growlings gonna come to no end  
Cause Im just bidding my time my little friend  
  
Chorus
