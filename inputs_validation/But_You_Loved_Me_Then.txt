Remember all the castles that we once built in the sand  
Remember how we used to go and visit fairy land  
Remember how wed search for that pot of gold at the rainbows end  
But you loved me then  
And the flowers the we picked from the fields where we did run  
And the sunbeams that wed catch from the summers golden sun  
And the butterflies wed chase as wed go running through the wind  
But you loved me then  
Now I walk through the ruins of our castles in the sand  
When you left I lost my way forever and the fairy land  
Now the rainbows have all gone and the flowers have all died  
And the sunbeams that we caught have all gone free again  
And the butterfiles we chased have all gone with the wind  
And you no longer care but you love me then  
And you no longer care but you love me then  
And you no longer care but you love me then
