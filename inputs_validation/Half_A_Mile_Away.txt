Little Geo is a friend of mine  
We get some money and we buy a cheap wine  
Sit on the corner and have a holiday  
Hide the bottle when the cop goes by  
Talk about women and lie lie lie  
Oh my other world is just a half a mile away  
  
Wait for mama to turn out the light  
Crawl on the roof and then I hit the night  
I should be sleeping tonight but I just cant stay  
Ive given everybody so much time  
Now I need a moment thats mine  
Oh my other world is just a half a mile away  
  
Its just a half a mile away  
  
Angelina save a place for me  
Ive been livin someone elses life and now Ive got to be free  
Turn your transistor on and let the music play  
I try to keep the family satisfied  
But theres gotta be more to life than just try try try  
Oh my other world is only a half a mile away  
  
Its just a half a mile away
