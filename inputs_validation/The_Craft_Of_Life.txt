I tried to study it for just a while  
All of the potions from oysters to seducing smiles  
But Ive found its already inside me  
A big round bubble of sensuality  
Dared to be burst  
But worried about getting hurt  
I know how you like to kiss  
Ill ask you what youre thinking  
Silvers in our dark hair  
The sheets are soaked by your tiny fish  
The craft of life  
The craft of life  
The craft of life  
The craft of life  
Ooooh  
Tears spring to mind when I go back in time  
All those lost bodies just seeking security  
Jittering strangers with smutting hands  
Heavy and clever and full of demands  
Well Im similar to you  
Were familiar with what to do  
I know how you like to kiss  
Ill ask you what youre thinking  
Silvers in our dark hair  
The sheets are soaked by your tiny fish  
The craft of life  
The craft of life  
The craft of life  
The craft of life  
Ooooh
