Do you have a heavy heart Cause you try to play the part  
Of a life that you dont know and now its scaring you  
Cause youre saying all the right words but no ones ever heard  
The voice thats crying out inside your heart  
Saying please dont make me die for you Ive gotta make you see  
That theres a part of me I never want to lose  
But if I have to die for you somehow let me see  
That youre more than words I need a glimpse of you  
But its Sunday church again and the habit to pretend  
Is stronger than you knew look how its ruling you  
But its friends you try to blame oh Ive done it just the same  
Cause its easier than answering to Him  
You think that theyre playing games  
They leave and never act the same  
And you dont want a part of their show  
Yes you think theres something more  
But not inside these holy doors  
Well what are you looking for  
Yes we have to die for Him thats the struggle that you see  
Cause its the hardest thing youll ever have to do  
But no its not impossible Hes been waiting so long for you  
But dont be afraid cause He knows the pain  
Because He had to do it for you for you
