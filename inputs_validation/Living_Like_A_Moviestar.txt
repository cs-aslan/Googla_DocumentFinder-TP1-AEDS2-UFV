They got the luxury money can buy  
Theyre living like kings and queens  
The whole worlds crying whenever they cry  
They smile when they smile at scenes  
Whats left of all that glamour and glory  
You find behind the doors in hollywood  
Living like a moviestar  
Tell me how they really are  
Prisoners of roles  
Until their final curtains fall  
Living like a moviestar  
I dont think i go too far  
If i say theyre lonely after all  
Too much of everything  
Too much to choose  
They finally lose control  
Crime and insanity scandals and booze  
Theyre dying fore getting old  
Whats left of all that glamour and glory  
You find behind the doors in hollywood  
Living like a moviestar  
Tell me how they really are  
Prisoners of roles  
Until their final curtains fall  
Living like a moviestar  
I dont think i go too far  
If i say theyre lonely after all  
Living like a moviestar  
Tell me how they really are  
Prisoners of roles  
Until their final curtains fall
