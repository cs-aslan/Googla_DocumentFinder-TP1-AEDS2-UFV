She fell out of bed and said Im leavin this place  
In a hot blooded redheaded rage  
She grabbed her things and slammed out that door  
Jumped in the car said dont need you no more  
  
She turned on the radio I said hey hey babe  
Why do you have to treat me this way  
Shes wrapped up and wound herself way too tight  
I think shes finally come loose this time  
  
Shes not the same I cant explain  
Shes gone away I dont mean maybe  
Shes not the same my burnin flame  
Shes gone  
Shes gone crazy  
  
Shes drivin me crazy  
  
Well I rode down the highway so she pulled off  
Way past the point of gettin lost  
She calls me up on my mobile phone  
I said hey hey babe  
Youre in the twilight zone  
  
Call it blind luck but she found a way  
Back to the scene where it all took place  
And when she walked through that door its all I could say  
Hey hey babe its me thats changed  
  
Shes not the same I cant explain  
Shes gone away I dont mean maybe  
Shes not the same my burnin flame  
Shes gone  
Shes gone crazy  
  
Come on get out of here  
Youre drivin me crazy  
  
Im not the same I cant explain  
Im goin away I dont mean maybe  
Im not the same  
Its me thats changed  
Shes gone  
Shes gone crazy  
  
Shes gone away no time to play  
Shes in the wings  
No time to please  
Come on get out of here  
Shes drivin me crazy  
  
Go on get out  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye
