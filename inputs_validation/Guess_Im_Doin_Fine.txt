Well I aint got my childhood  
Or friends I once did know  
No I aint got my childhood  
Or friends I once did know  
But I still got my voice left  
I can take it anywhere I go  
Hey hey so I guess Im doin fine  
  
And Ive never had much money  
But Im still around somehow  
No Ive never had much money  
But Im still around somehow  
Many times Ive bended  
But I aint never yet bowed  
Hey hey so I guess Im doin fine  
  
Trouble oh trouble  
Ive trouble on my mind  
Trouble oh trouble  
Trouble on my mind  
But the trouble in the world Lord  
Is much more bigger than mine  
Hey hey so I guess Im doin fine  
  
And I never had no armies  
To jump at my command  
No I aint got no armies  
To jump at my command  
But I dont need no armies  
I got me one good friend  
Hey hey so I guess Im doin fine  
  
I been kicked and whipped and trampled on  
I been shot at just like you  
I been kicked and whipped and trampled on  
I been shot at just like you  
But as long as the world keeps aturnin  
I just keep aturnin too  
Hey hey so I guess Im doin fine  
  
Well my road might be rocky  
The stones might cut my face  
My road it might be rocky  
The stones might cut my face  
But as some folks aint got no road at all  
They gotta stand in the same old place  
Hey hey so I guess Im doin fine
