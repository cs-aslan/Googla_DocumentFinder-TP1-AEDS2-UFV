Fall back  
Take a look at me  
And youll see Im for real  
I feel what only I can feel  
  
And if that dont appeal to you  
Let me know  
And Ill go  
Cause I flow  
  
Better when my colors show  
And thats the way it has to be  
Honestly  
Cause creativity could never bloom  
  
In my room  
Id throw it all away before I lie  
So dont call me with a compromise  
Hang up the phone  
Ive got a backbone stronger than yours  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
Chorus  
If youre trying to turn me into someone else  
Its easy to see Im not down with that  
Im not nobodys fool  
If youre trying to turn me into something else  
Ive seen enough and Im over that  
Im not nobodys fool  
If you want to bring me down  
Go ahead and try  
Go ahead and try  
  
You dont know  
You think you know me like yourself  
But I fear  
That youre only telling me what I want to hear  
  
But do you give a damn  
Understand  
That I cant not be what I am  
Im not the milk and cheerios in your spoon  
  
Its not a simple hearing but not so soon  
I might have fallen for that when I was fourteen  
And a little more green  
But its amazing what a couple of years can mean  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
Chorus  
  
Go ahead and try  
Try and look me in the eye  
But youll never see inside  
Until you realize realize  
Things are trying to settle down  
  
Just try to figure out  
Exactly what Im about  
If its with or without you  
I dont need you doubting me  
  
Chorus  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
Would you be laughing out loud  
If I played to my own crowd  
Try
