Now its your type o mad Jinx the mad sucker with a tail Ive got my life
worked up it aint as cheap as one thinks Ive got links on it the same
internet porn aint as deep as Ive been now Ive got Justin in my corner  
I creep up but they dont want me back in you know my love is so big I think
my head is cracking smacking my face and always giving me the baseline dead
in a days time give back whats mine This aint no rhyme about a junky on
run another punk with a gun Now when you get it meet the mad fun So get on
your feet and get in pack with the deal the beats on the wheel now how do you
feel  
The cool vibe from my lyrical solo I beat on your chest when Im bouncing like
yoyo This story is old just like the tales Ive told But mark my words it
will turn into gold  
  
All right weve got it right all right Weve got it right all right Weve
got it right all right  
  
We dig around fanatics tall and fallen manics and the planets breaking down
with god the only mechanic around faking firm ground fucking up the program
so now Im working on my devious master plan Its all about these crazy comic
relieves you know Wooster and Jeeves and modern prophets you never believe we
get them all on a boat leave out all the rules the white pigeons and sail
the ship of fools  
  
All right weve got it right all right Weve got it right all right Weve
got it right all right x3
