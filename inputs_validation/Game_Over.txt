You had me  
You lost me  
Youll never get the chance again  
We broke up You messed up  
It all worked out in the end  
I didnt know how to tell you  
That I didnt wanna be yours  
But you did it for me  
You opened and shut the same door  
Not gonna be your doormat  
Not gonna linger  
It just aint like that  
Dont you click your fingers  
You said you didnt want me  
You didnt wanna be my lover  
Now youre changing the story  
Im afraid man down Its game over  
Game over  
  
You want me You crave me  
Youre barking up the wrong tree  
Ill shake you Coz I wont take you  
This is how it was meant to be  
I didnt know how to tell you  
Im not in love anymore  
Even though it was a mistake  
Telling me to walk out the door  
And now youre wanting me back  
I wont comply You text me saying I love you  
You know I wont reply  
Not gonna be your doormat Not gonna linger  
It just aint like that So dont you click your fingers  
  
You said you didnt want me  
Im not a pushover  
Now youre changing the story  
Im afraid man down Its game over  
Game over  
You just cant expect me To come running everytime  
Because Im happier the way I am  
And Im doing fine  
I feel like your obsession  
Like you want me day and night  
You shouldnt have let me go Or at least put up a fight No No no Not  
Gonna run to you No no  
Your games over Not gonna be your doormat  
Not gonna linger It just aint like that  
Dont you click your fingers  
You said you didnt want me  
You didnt wanna be my lover  
Now youre changing the story  
Im afraid man down Its game over  
Its game over Oh no no  
Game over Now youre changing  
The Story  
Man down  
Its game over
