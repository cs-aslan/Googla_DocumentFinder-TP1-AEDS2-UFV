I hear the thunder three miles away  
The Islands leaking into the bay  
The poison is spreading  
The demon is free  
And people are running from what they cant even see  
  
Face the fire  
You cant turn away  
The risk grows greater with each passing day  
The waitings over  
The moment has come  
To kill the fire and turn to the sun  
  
Theyll take your money  
And then take your health  
To line their pockets with unequalled wealth  
Those men are under the power of gold  
We wont be safe until we shut them down  
  
Face the fire  
You cant turn away  
The risk grows greater with each passing day  
The waitings over  
The moment has come  
To kill the fire and turn to the sun  
  
The people came to the capitol town  
One hundred thousand of them laid their hearts down  
They screamed in anger and broadcast their fears  
Just to have them fall on deaf ears  
  
Face the fire  
You cant turn away  
The risk grows greater with each passing day  
The waitings over  
The moment has come  
To kill the fire and turn to the sun  
  
Kill the fire and turn to the sun
