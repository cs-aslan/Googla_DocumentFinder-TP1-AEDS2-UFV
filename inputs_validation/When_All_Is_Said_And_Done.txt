Heres to us one more toast and then well pay the bill  
Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill  
Birds of passage you and me  
We fly instinctively  
When the summers over and the dark clouds hide the sun  
Neither you nor Im to blame when all is said and done  
  
In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks  
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex  
Were still striving for the sky  
No taste for humble pie  
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun  
Neither you nor Im to blame when all is said and done  
  
Its so strange when youre down and lying on the floor  
How you rise shake your head get up and ask for more  
Clearheaded and openeyed  
With nothing left untried  
Standing calmly at the crossroadsno desire to run  
Theres no hurry any more when all is said and done  
  
Standing calmly at the crossroadsno desire to run  
Theres no hurry any more when all is said and done
