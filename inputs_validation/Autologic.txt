Cmon  
Go Go Go Ugh  
Go Go Go Go  
Drop the AyouTOLOGIC  
Drop the AyouTOLOGIC  
Hey  
Drop the AyouTOLOGIC  
Cmon  
Drop auto logic  
You thought you could get wit  
Me and Tommy hittin man  
Cold dropped a smash hit  
Angry as a battery  
Back in the funk  
cause Im not frontin  
Commin upon the stage Ill say ya somethin  
Clear as a project  
The style is hectic  
Guess Im left with  
A system sceptic  
The truths Im droppin  
From the pulpit Im yellin  
Inspired by gunshots from a township rebellion  
Word is a rough mix  
Sign of justice  
The rhyme is allowed cause you cant philabust this  
Style Ill catch ya  
Ill catch ya the rapture  
Ya murdered my level head  
Ya know that I have to  
  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the logic  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic  
  
Auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the logic  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic  
  
Stop before you take a wrong turn  
Stop before you step up on the stage and get burned  
Stop and just listen  
Im dismissing competition with decisions  
So I guess youll have to listen and learn  
  
Creative  
So what ya gonna do  
Aint no fading  
So what ya gonna do  
Grab the microphone and say a check one two  
The kids solo  
Unafraid of any crew  
cause Im the type of mother with the maddest  
Status  
Statue or poll  
Paid in full  
No bull never dull  
Always in control  
Taking no shit like I was Manute Boll  
Ugh Huh Huh  
  
speaking  
Awww ya  
It goes a just like that Ya  
Now break it down  
  
Auto logic  
On auto pilot  
Silence equals death  
And death equals silence  
The crew that doesnt choose to speak their mind  
Is a crew that looses power over time  
And now that ya finally woke up  
Yo wish your mother fuckin ass would have spoke up  
Voices in full  
The balled of the bullet  
The mic is a trigger and I pull it  
Droppin and smashin  
Thrashin and bashin the set  
Mentally and spiritually correct  
Back And ya know its a treat  
cause every time I step ya know I wont forget ta  
  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the logic  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic  
  
Auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the logic  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic  
  
Auto logic go Go Go Go  
Yo I got to drop the logic  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic  
  
Auto logic go Go Go Go  
Yo I got to drop the logic  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic  
Cmon
