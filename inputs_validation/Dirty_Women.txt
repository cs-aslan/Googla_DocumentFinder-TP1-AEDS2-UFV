The neon lights are shining on me again  
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend  
I need a lady to help me to get through the night  
If I could find one then everything would be alright  
  
The sleepy city is dreaming the nigh time away  
Out on the street I watch tomorrow becoming today  
I see a manhes got take away women for sale  
Yes for sale  
Guess thats the answer  
cause take away women dont fail  
  
Oh dirty womenthey dont mess around  
Oh dirty womenthey dont mess around  
Youve got me coming  
Youve got me going around  
Oh dirty women  
They dont mess around  
  
Walking the streets I wonder will it ever happen  
Gotta be good then everything will be ok  
if I could score tonight then I will end up happy  
A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day
