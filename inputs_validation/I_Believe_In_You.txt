Im so glad that you believe in me like I believe in you  
This loves exactly how I picture how I picture  
Its such a joy when I receive all that I need in you  
Were flowing smooth just like a river like a river  
Express my true  
When I make love to you to you  
Just like that day back in September  
If we might run in some problems

We aint been fussing or fighting  
You play all day and I be working at night and  
The only one who understands my life and  
The cake and the icing

In the world  
Live their life so trifling  
I couldnt do it no more  
I had to sit you down  
And make you my wife and yaa  
Cold thing  
But you know  
Its a cold gain goal gain  
Its so real

Slowed me down  
Straight took me out the fast lane fast lane  
Hold me down

Im feeling good and my babys home  
Youre spending time  
Holding hands  
To this beat  
The fellow that can satisfy my every need  
Is he the one  
Weve been around and were both grown grown

And I feel secure about this love romance  
Lets have some fun

And call my name

On your two way

And a dizzay  
Cause I believe in you
