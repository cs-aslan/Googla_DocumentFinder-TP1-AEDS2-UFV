Im not fucking around  
I think Im coming out  
All the deceivers and cheaters  
I think weve got a bleeder right now  
Want you to slap me around  
Want you to knock me out  
Well you missed me kissed me  
Now you better kick me down  
  
Maybe youre the runnerup  
But the first one to lose the race  
Almost only really counts in  
Horseshoes and hand grenades  
  
Im gonna burn it all down  
Im gonna rip it out  
Well everything you employ  
Was meant for me to destroy  
To the ground now  
So dont you fuck me around  
Because Ill shoot you down  
Im gonna drink fight and fuck  
And pushing my luck  
All the time now  
  
Maybe youre the runnerup  
But the first one to lose the race  
Almost only really counts in  
Horseshoes and hand grenades  
  
Demolition selfdestruction  
What to annihilate  
The ageold contradiction  
Demolition selfdestruction  
What to annihilate  
The old age  
  
Im not fucking around  
I think Im coming out  
All the deceivers and cheaters  
I think weve got a bleeder right now  
Im not fucking around  
GLORIA
