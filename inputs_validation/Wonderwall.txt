today is gonna be the day  
that theyre gonna throw it back to you  
by now you shouldve somehow  
realized what you gotta do  
I dont believe that anybody  
feels the way I do about you now  
backbeat the word was on the street  
that the fire in your heart is out  
Im sure youve heard it all before  
but you never really had a doubt  
I dont believe that anybody feels  
the way I do about you now  
and all the roads we have to walk along are winding  
and all the lights that lead us there are blinding  
there are many things that I would like to say to you  
but I dont know how  
because maybe  
youre gonna be the one who saves me
