Hush little baby dont you cry  
Ohoh dont you cry  
Maybe tomorrows a better life  
Ohoh if you try  
  
Rain is falling all around  
Storm came it brings you down  
But if you lose your mind  
Weatherman in his overcoat  
  
Look up in the sky now the weatherman cry now  
Ohoh the window pane  
Damp in the valley up in the alley  
Ohoh its pouring rain  
  
Rain is falling all around  
Storm came it brings you down  
So let your mind roll on  
Weatherman drys the lonely tears  
  
Early in the morning while the suns still yawning  
Ohoh smiles on you  
Maybe today is a better life  
Ohoh if we try  
  
Sun is shining all around  
It warms your heart and melts the cloud  
But if your mind can see  
Weatherman smiles a lonely smile
