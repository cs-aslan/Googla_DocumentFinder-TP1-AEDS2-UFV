I dont care about no curfew tonight   
I just come of age my car is stood outside  
Got my wings and Im looking for a place to roost   
Cruise with the boys catch anything on the loose  
Going down the road and my tail lights glow  
Im going to accelerate in some old fatty bar yes sir  
If I hit the deck just pick me up for some more  
Going to look around till the first girl smiles at me  
And on the way home Ill check out her id  
Going down the road and my tail lights glow  
I cant fight love  
I cant fight love at first sight  
I cant fight love  
I cant fight love  
Im going to write my graffiti on the wall   
Paint this town like its never been done before  
The way I feel theres nothing I cant do  
So hold on baby Im coming straight on through  
Going down the road and my tail lights glow  
I cant fight love  
I cant fight love at first sight  
I cant fight love  
I cant fight love  
Running wild with the pack ace up my sleeve  
Got a taste of your love and its blinding me  
Cant see straight thats for sure  
Me Im knocking on your pearly door  
Going down the road and my tail lights glow  
I cant fight love  
I cant fight love at first sight  
I cant fight love  
I cant fight love  
Dont want to fight your love  
Cant fight love  
Dont want to fight your love  
Cant fight love  
Got to give it to me now  
Cant fight love  
I cant fight your love
