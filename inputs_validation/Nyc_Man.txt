It can only lead to trouble if you break my heart  
If you accidentally crush it on the ides of March  
Id prefer you were straight forward  
You dont have to go through all of that  
Im a New York city man baby  
Say go and that is that  
  
New York city man you just say go and that is that  
Im a New York city man you just say go and that is that  
  
Its far too complicated to make up a lie  
That youd have to remember and really why  
I wouldnt want to be around you  
If you dont want to have me around  
Im a MANN man  
Slink your eyes and Ill gone  
  
Im a MANN man slink your eyes honey I love you and Ill gone  
New York city man slink your eyes and Ill gone  
  
Brutus made a pretty speech but Caesar was betrayed  
Lady Macbeth went crazy but Macbeth ended slain  
Ophelia and Desdamona dead leaving Hamlet in a play  
But Im no Lear with blinded eyes  
Say  go  and I am gone  
  
The stars have shut their eyes up tight  
The earth has changed its course  
A Kingdom sits on a black knights back  
As he tries to mount a white jeweled horse  
While a clock full of butterflies on the hour  
Releases a thousand moths  
You say  leave and Ill be gone  
Without any remorse  
No letters faxes phones or tears  
Theres a difference between  
Bad and worse  
  
Im a New York city man blink your eyes and Ill be gone  
New York city  man blink your eyes and Ill be gone  
  
New York city I love you New York city man  
New York city I love you blink your eyes and Ill be gone  
Just a little grain of sand  
New York city ooohhh I love you  
New York city baby blink your eyes and Ill be gone  
I love you
