Come over here  
  
All you got is this moment  
The twentyfirst centurys yesterday  
You can care all you want  
Everybody does yeah thats okay  
  
So slide over here  
And give me a moment  
Your moves are so raw  
Ive got to let you know  
Ive got to let you know  
Youre one of my kind  
  
I need you tonight  
cause Im not sleeping  
Theres something about you girl  
That makes me sweat  
  
How do you feel  
Im lonely  
What do you think  
Cant take it all  
Whatcha gonna do  
Gonna live my life
