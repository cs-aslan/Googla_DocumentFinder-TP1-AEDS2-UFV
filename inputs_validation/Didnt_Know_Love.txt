I thought I had it long ago  
I held on but It let go  
It kissed me on a subway train  
And I melted  
  
It got my hand it brushed my cheek  
It moved right in it cut me deep  
You know it even had a name  
I really felt it  
  
I didnt know love  
Not even close  
This is more beautiful and frightening than Ive ever known  
Its making me weak  
Making me strong  
Its making me afraid Im gonna wake up  
And find it gone  
I didnt know love  
  
Its a blessing its a curse  
You know youve found it when it hurts  
It can drive you off a cliff  
But its worth it  
  
Careful where you spend the night  
Its complicated when its right  
You can make me such a mess  
Yeah youre perfect  
  
But I didnt know love  
Not even close  
This is more beautiful and frightening than Ive ever know  
Its making me weak  
Making me strong  
Its making me afraid Im gonna wake up  
And find you gone  
I didnt know love  
No I didnt know love  
  
Now youre lying in my arms beside me  
In the past Id settled for a touch  
Id tell myself it was enough  
I was lying lying lying  
Cause I didnt know love  
  
I didnt know love  
Not even close  
This is more beautiful and frightening than Ive ever known  
Its making me weak  
Making me strong  
Its making me afraid Im gonna wake up and find you gone  
  
I didnt know love  
No I didnt know love  
I didnt know love  
I didnt know love
