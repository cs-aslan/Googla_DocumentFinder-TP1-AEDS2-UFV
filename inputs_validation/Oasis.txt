In that perfect place  
In a dream of the place that you met  
And a lonely feel  
And a little emotion  
  
But all those childish things  
But all those childish things that you said  
When you were young in your head  
When you were in our bed  
  
And if you say that its ok  
Then its ok for you to do now  
And if you say that its all right  
Then its all right for me  
  
And if you say that its ok  
Then its ok for me to do  
You know it must be all right  
You know it must be all right  
  
But you went too far  
And its gone all the wrong way  
But you went too fast and now the only thing that you ever  
Well its not there  
Its all gone  
  
And if you say that its ok  
Then its ok for me to do now  
And if you say that its all right  
Then its all right for you  
  
And if you say that its ok  
Then its ok for us to do  
You know it must be all right  
You know it must be all right  
  
Its not unusual to be loved by anyone  
Its not unusual to be fucked by everybody  
Its not unusual to spend some time on yourself  
Gonna make it all right  
Say well make it all right  
  
Its all right  
Its all right  
  
Fuck
