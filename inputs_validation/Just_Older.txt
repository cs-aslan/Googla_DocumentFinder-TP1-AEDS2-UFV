Hey man its been a while  
Do you remember me  
When I hit the streets I was 17  
A little wild a little green  
  
Ive been up and down and in between  
After all these years  
Can you believe Im still chasing that dream  
But I aint looking over my shoulder  
  
Chorus  
I like the bed Im sleeping in  
Its just like me its broken in  
Its not old  just older  
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans  
This skin Im in its alright with me  
Its not old  just older  
  
Its good to see your face  
You aint no worse for wear  
Breathing that California air  
When we took on the world  
When we were young and brave  
We got secrets that well take to the grave  
And were standing here shoulder to shoulder  
  
Chorus  
  
Im not old enough to sing the blues  
But I wore the holes in the soles of these shoes  
You can roll the dice til they call your bluff  
But you cant win until youre not afraid to lose  
  
Well I look in the mirror  
I dont hate what I see  
Theres a few more lines staring back at me  
The nights have grown a little colder  
Hey man I gotta run  
Now you take care  
  
If you see coach T Tell him I cut my hair  
Its been all these years  
Can you believe Im still chasing dreams  
But I aint looking over my shoulder  
  
Chorus
