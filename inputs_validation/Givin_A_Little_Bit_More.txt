Theres a gentleness to everything you do  
And its rubbing off on me I feel it too  
Ive been waiting but my loneliness I get  
When you call me on the phone  
And Im feeling so alone  
When you ask me to come over  
Baby you know I will  
I could never stay on my own  
  
Givin it all I got to give  
Ive never done that before  
Im always givin a little more  
When Im with you  
  
Givin it all I got to give  
Ive never done that before  
Im always givin a little more  
When Im with you  
Im always givin a little more  
When Im with you  
  
Givin it all I got to give  
Ive never done that before  
Im always givin a little more  
When Im with you  
Givin it all I got to give  
Ive never done that before  
Im always givin a little more
