Some people say lifes like a merrygoround  
I think its more like a Ferris wheel  
Cause sometimes youre up sometimes youre down  
Sometimes you just dont know what to feel  
And just when you think youve got the game figured out  
And you say youve had enough  
The mysterious mad man with his hand on the lever  
Dont seem to never ever want to let you off  
You cant get off this wheel of karma  
You cant stop the hands of time  
Now I have a friend I might have a few  
Sometimes I think they just dont care  
But I think sometimes they think the same thing of me yeah  
You might say weve got a problem there  
You know we all got this habit  
We like to talk too much  
And that always tends to slow you down  
But we never change direction  
We just keep going round and round and round and round  
And let me off this wheel of karma  
Let me stop the hands of time  
Seems like Ive been around so many places  
And I must have learned a lot of things  
And although I aint yet come up with a socalled answer  
At least I think I finally learned how to sing  
And theres j  
Sometimes they make my brain get sore  
Like if kids were left of all devices  
Would they ever come up with a thing like war  
Let us off this wheel of karma  
Let us stop the hands of time
