I tried my best  
I gave my heart  
I took no rest  
Time will tell  
If I left my mark  
But Ill know full well  
  
I did my part  
When I look down that road  
What Do I see  
My childrens children looking  
Right back at me  
When they look back at meand Im  
Long gone away  
Will they think kindly of me  
When they hear me say  
  
Chorus  
I did my part  
I tried my best  
I gave my heart  
I took no rest  
Time will tell  
If I left my mark  
But Ill know full well  
  
I did my part  
When I look down that hall  
What do I see  
A little baby crawling  
Right back at me  
I cannot walk for him  
I cannot run  
But I can hold his hand  
And show him how its done  
  
Chorus  
  
I did my part  
Build a family  
Build a city  
Build a country  
Build a world  
Time will tell  
If I left my mark  
But Ill know full well  
I did my part  
But Ill know full well  
I did my part
