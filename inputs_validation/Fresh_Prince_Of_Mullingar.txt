In Mullingar Westmeath born and raised  
At Nandos is where I spent most of my days  
Chilling out Maxing Relaxing all cool then I go eat  
Some chicken outside the school  
When a couple of chavs they were up to no good  
They started making trouble in my neighborhood  
I got in one little fight and my mom started objectin  
She said Your moving to London and joining one direction  
I made it through auditions thanks to Katy Perry  
And thats where I met Lou Zayn Liam and Harry  
And now who wouldve thought that weve come this far  
Im sure as hell not going back to Mullingar
