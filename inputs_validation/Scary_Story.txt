Willow  
Daddy can you tell me a story  
Will  
Oh you want to hear a story What kind of story you want to hear baby  
Willow  
A scary story  
VERSE 1  
Oh ok  
Once upon a time there was a kid who wanted nothin more than to rhyme  
Almost like he was born in the rhyme  
He thought of his rhymes almost all of the time  
And he fought with his mom  
His school getting caught with his rhyme book  
And he knew he shouldnt of took it there in the first place  
At least he shouldnt of been sittin lookin there in her face with it  
Teacher told him get it out of her class  
Wicked witch trick told him thats probably why you wont pass  
Now if you shy you wont last but youre new  
So underneath his breath before he left he said Im a be richer then you  
What you say She said  
What you mean He said  
Boy dont you play she said  
What you mean He said Damnit  
Ten minutes later standin up in the principles office  
Getting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking  
And he was pissed he wasnt listening to his son  
You testing me You messin up again  
You done boy  
CHORUS  
This is just a story about a young man comin up in the rap game  
A real scary story  
Went from rags to riches it has goblins in it haters and witches Uh  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
VERSE 2  
First thing he did was find somebody to give him some money  
He wasnt stupid but wasnt using his senses honey  
The guys he meant was a little shady a little funny  
But they gave him the money so they played the record company  
It sounds silly but when he grew up in Philly rhymin wasnt what it is today  
Deals wasnt a dime a dozen  
Today every sister uncle or mom or cousin gotta record deal  
But for real it wasnt like that then  
As you could imagine when he started risin to fame and fortune he was  
havin Started antagonizing the guys he was with  
At the same time he started realizing  
The deal he got from them guys in his eyes didnt fly with size of his hits  
He called a meeting to find a solution  
He said Im gettin beat out of my loot  
And Im not recording no more until we find a solution  
The dudes said we found a solution its this 44  
He ran for the door a little shaken  
But the next day he found a lawyer told him the situation  
He said Im breakin this contract for ya  
He said how much the lawyer said Im a charge you a quarter cause I like you  
Just do me a favor  
get your life in order  
  
CHORUS
