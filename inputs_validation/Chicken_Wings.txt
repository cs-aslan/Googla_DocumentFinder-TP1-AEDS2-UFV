Well I always knew youd take the crutches  
And not the skis  
1 always knew youd take the stilts  
And then your knees  
When God gave you the sky  
I knew youd take the trees  
Son youve grown those chicken wings  
You just cant fly  
  
They anchored our dream yacht to ocean bed  
Chained our ideal home to bicycle shed  
Clamped our racing car before we sat in drivers seat  
Tied our shooting stars and wrapped them round a tree  
  
We couldve courted Einstein  
Couldve courted Marx  
We couldve gone for strolls  
Like other families do in parks  
Son you were born a dud  
In a family without sparks  
Yes youve got those chicken wings  
You just cant fly  
  
The checkered flag  
That losers despise  
Never flew in our port  
Or harbored in our eyes  
Cause we always formed that queue  
For second prize  
This familys got those chicken wings  
We just cant fly  
  
Our winning tickets ripped up into shreds  
The tale of this family is its heads  
Were bouncing on a pogo stick  
Without any springs  
It hurts me to admit this  
But weve got those chicken wings  
  
Yes youve got those chicken wings  
And all the luggage that the failure brings  
Is a swallow flying high that sings  
Look hes got those chicken wings  
He may as well die
