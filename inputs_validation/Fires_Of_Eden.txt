Its not over til its over  
I heard someone say  
Must be a whisper in the wind  
Cause youre too far away  
  
But in my restless sleep  
I could swear I saw you next to me  
Saying  oh Im coming home  
Youll never spend another night alone  
  
Chorus  
Remember when love was innocent  
There was never a better time  
But you know those fires of Eden  
Still burn in this heart of mine  
  
The mornings uncertain  
Its a nervous day  
And I look for a reason  
Why I should feel this way  
  
I hear a voice run before  
Drifting through my open door  
Saying its alright  
Were going to light those flames tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
And dont you wonder  
How we drifted so far  
When we belong to each other  
We were miles apart  
  
And theres a place  
That was meant for the two of us  
And when you touch the embers  
You feel my love  
As strong as it ever was  
  
Chorus
