Cars and trucks  
Fly by me on the corner  
But Im all right  
Standin proud before the signal  
When I see the light  
I know Im more than just a number  
And I stand before you  
Or else we just dont see the other  
Computer age computer age  
Computer age  
  
Bikes and vans  
Fly by me on the desert  
But Im all right  
Standing out here in the hot sun  
When I see the light  
I feel like more than just a number  
And I stand before you  
Or else we just dont see the other  
Computer age computer age  
Computer age  
  
Precious metal lines  
Molded into highways  
Running through me  
So microscopically  
Days and nights  
Weeks and months and seasons  
Rolling through me  
So chronologically  
Computer age computer age  
Computer age  
  
I need you  
To let me know that theres a heartbeat  
Let it pound and pound  
And Ill be flying like a free bird  
And you need me  
Like ugly needs a mirror  
And day by day  
This horizons getting clearer  
Computer age computer age  
Computer age
