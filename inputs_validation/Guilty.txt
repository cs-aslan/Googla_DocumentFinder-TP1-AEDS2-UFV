Yes baby Ive been drinkin  
Shouldnt come by anymore  
But I found myself in trouble darlin  
And I have no place else to go  
  
I got some whiskey from a bottle  
Got some cocaine from a friend  
And I had to keep on movin darlin  
Till I was back in your arms again  
  
And Im guilty I am guilty  
And Ill be guilty for the rest of my life  
  
How come Im never gonna do  
What Im supposed to do  
Seems like everything I do  
Never turns out right  
  
Thats how it is with me darlin  
You know I just cant stand myself  
But it takes a whole lot of medicine darlin  
For me to pretend that Im somebody else
