Farewell to you my own true love  
I am going far far away  
I am bound for California  
And I know that Ill return someday  
So fare thee well my own true love  
For when I return united we will be  
Its not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me  
But my darling when I think of thee  
I have shipped on a Yankee sailing ship  
Davy Crockett is her name  
And her Captains name was Burgess  
And they say that shes a floating hell  
So fare thee well my own true love  
For when I return united we will be  
Its not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me  
But my darling when I think of thee  
Oh the sun is on the harbour love  
And I wish that I could remain  
For I know that it will be a long long time  
Before I see you again  
So fare thee well my own true love  
For when I return united we will be  
Its not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me  
But my darling when I think of thee
