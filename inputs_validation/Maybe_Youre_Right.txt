Chapter one we started happy  
The second that you said you loved me  
Started questioning us are we really in love  
Trying to figure out chapter three  
But youre not giving me anything  
If this is what we are then I gotta move on  
You think this is everything  
But this is no book of us  
  
You might think Im crazy  
That Im lost and foolish  
Leaving you behind  
Maybe youre right  
You might think Im crazy  
That Im lost and foolish leaving you behind  
Maybe youre right  
Maybe youre right  
  
Here comes the part of you and me  
Arguing about nothing  
You told me its as good as it gets  
Yeah Im real emotional  
Blame it on your mental jokes  
How much did you think that I could take  
So much for taking this too far  
You cant blame me for who I am  
Its too late for us to try to be in love right now  
  
You might think Im crazy crazy  
That Im lost and foolish  
Leaving you behind  
Maybe youre right  
You might think Im crazy  
That Im lost and foolish leaving you behind  
Maybe youre right  
Maybe youre right  
  
Felt the pages now this chapters done  
Moving on up and forward onto all that will become  
If you ever get to the place where the sun is shining every day  
Then Ill be on your mind  
  
You might think Im crazy  
That Im lost and foolish  
Leaving you behind  
Maybe youre right  
You might think Im crazy  
That Im lost and foolish leaving you behind  
Maybe youre right  
Maybe youre right
