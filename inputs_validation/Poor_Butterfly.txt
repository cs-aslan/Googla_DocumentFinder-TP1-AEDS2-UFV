Theres a story told of a little Japanese  
Sitting demurely neath the cherry blossom trees  
Miss Butterflys her name  
A sweet little innocent child was she  
Till a fine young American from the sea  
To her garden came  
They met beneath the cherry blossoms every day  
And he taught her how to love the American way  
To love with a soul twas easy to learn  
Then he sailed away with a promise to return  
  
Poor Butterfly neath the blossoms waiting  
Poor Butterfly for she loved him so  
The moments pass into hours  
The hours pass into years  
And as she smiles through her tears  
She murmurs low  
The moon and I  
Know that hell be faithful  
Im sure hell come to me by and by  
But if he wont come back  
Then Ill never sigh or cry  
I just must die  
Poor Butterfly
