Anything I can do girl  
Anything I can say  
Look at the sky its blue girl  
How can you feel this way  
  
Dont wanna see you sad girl  
Try on it wont be long  
Soon youll be feeling glad girl  
Ill sing you my summer song  
  
Sun come on down  
And warm up the heart of the girl in my garden  
Sittin with me  
Hearing my song  
  
Sun come on down  
And dry up the tears of the girl in my garden  
Sittin with me  
Poor little thing  
Listen to my summer song La la la la  
  
Anything I can do girl  
Anything I can say  
Look at the sky its blue girl  
How can you feel this way  
  
Dont wanna see you sad girl  
Try on it wont be long  
Soon youll be feeling glad girl  
Ill sing you my summer song  
  
Sun come on down  
And warm up the heart of the girl in my garden  
Sittin with me  
Hearing my song  
  
Sun come on down  
And dry up the tears of the girl in my garden  
Sittin with me  
Poor little thing  
Listen to my summer song La la la la  
  
Anything I can do girl  
Anything I can say  
Look at the sky its blue girl  
How can you feel this way  
  
Dont wanna see you sad girl  
Try on it wont be long
