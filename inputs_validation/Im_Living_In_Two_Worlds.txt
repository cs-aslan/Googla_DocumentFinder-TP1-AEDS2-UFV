Im living in two worlds dividing my time  
Unhappy in your world and lonesome in mine  
  
When Im in your world I just pretend  
That Im really happy though I dont fit in  
Then I drift in my world so cold and alone  
Im living in two worlds where do I belong  
Im living in two worlds  
  
Old friends in your world are new friends to me  
So I cant take part in your old memories  
Our love shared in two worlds that dont turn the same  
We both have our own worlds and neither can change  
Im living in two worlds
