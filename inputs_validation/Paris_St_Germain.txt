The City of Light is dimmed now by the winter  
No gut full of wine could keep out this frost  
Well shiver and sigh by the ice on the river  
Ask the dull heavens The hell have we lost  
  
My hearts too empty to speak true of sorrow  
Whats dust is but dust and as dust shall remain  
If only I could I would make it tomorrow  
Id make it tomorrow where youd live again  
  
Ill lay myself down in the mist and the heather  
Ill lay myself down and Ill wait for your call  
The bell rings last orders were walking together  
While the boulevards burn and crumble and fall  
The boulevards burn and crumble and fall  
  
My hearts too empty to speak true of sorrow  
Whats dust is but dust and as dust shall we fall  
The bell rings last orders were walking together  
While the boulevards burn and crumble and fall  
The boulevards burn and crumble and fall  
The boulevards burn and crumble and fall
