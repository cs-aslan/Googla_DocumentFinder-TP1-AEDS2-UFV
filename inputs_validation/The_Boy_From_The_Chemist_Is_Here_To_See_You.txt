Every day of every year you live your life in hope and fear  
That each small sin and imperfection is buried deep beyond detection  
But one by one the ghosts return and each selects its place to burn  
Into your soft and breaking heart and this is how the aching starts  
The jokes about the ugly kid  
The things you said but never did  
The people torn and crushed and battered  
The ones you broke but shouldve flattered  
  
Oh you should have run whilst you had time  
Oh you should have left the past behind  
  
  
The boy from the chemist is here to see you  
The laughing stops cause hes too near you  
The girl you left that always loved you  
Returns to earth from miles above you now  
  
  
So wash away the dirty skin theres always worse remains within  
The tangled web and bitter mesh but each shall have their pound of flesh  
No sympathy no charity no false pleas of humility  
No money back no guarantee no great escape for you and me  
  
Oh you should have run whilst you had time  
Oh you should have left the past behind  
  
The boy from the chemist is here to see you  
The laughing stops cause hes too near you  
The girl you left that always loved you  
Returns to earth from miles above you now  
  
And everyone thats ever suffered friend or foe or wives or lovers  
Theyll come back to have their day  
In time you find your mind has no escape  
  
  
Dont believe that you can hide dont believe theyll be denied  
Theyll come knocking at your door this is what theyve waited for  
The chance to even up the score  
  
The boy from the chemist is here to see you  
The laughing stops cause hes too near you  
The girl you left that always loved you  
Returns to earth from miles above you now  
  
And everyone thats ever suffered friend or foe or wives or lovers  
Theyll come back to have their day  
In time you find your mind has no escape
