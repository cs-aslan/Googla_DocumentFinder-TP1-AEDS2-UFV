Aint no golden gates gonna swing open  
Aint no streets paved in natural pearl  
Aint no angel with a harp come singin  
Leastways not that I know of in this world  
  
In these days of uncertain futures  
Who knows what the masters might do  
They got their big deals goin on goin on  
Got nothing to do with me and you  
  
If I could Id get us a big suite  
Overlooking the park  
Only promise I know to be true  
Are the promises made from the heart  
  
I dont need to see the whole thing go down  
I dont need to see another lonely man  
I dont need to see a woman crying for the savior  
Holding on to some moneymans hand  
  
Who can I call to make my reservations  
Forever thrown in the dark  
The only promises I know to be true  
Are the promises made from the heart  
  
I dont believe in the authorities  
They aint gonna take care of me and you  
I dont have all the strength that I need  
To love the way that I want to  
  
The only promises I know to be true  
Are the promises made from the heart
