Lead in me and me in water  
Dangling in my world  
I swallowed too much oily water  
It keeps slipping down my spine  
  
In a sense of self decline  
Growing fat on sound  
Its oly and early morning dream  
And the whole world will be alright  
  
My heads is full of suspicion  
Im coming home sometime  
Ive swallowed too much oily water  
It keeps slipping down my spine  
  
In a sense of self decline  
Growing fat on sound  
Its oly and early morning dream  
And the whole world will be alright
