Theyre holding a committee of treason and lies  
Double speak and sedition then somebody dies  
From the hills the smell of lilacs then the repeat of guns  
When she closes the window and draws the blinds her first touch sucks the air
from my lungs  
  
Hey Blue Eyes what you doing tonight  
Hey Blue Eyes its alright  
  
She says In this house weve abandoned history in this house there are no
laws  
Just the false taste of paradise and then the fall  
In this house the guilty go unpunished and blood and silence prevail  
Here the dead remain nameless the nameless remain jailed  
  
Hey Blue Eyes what you doing tonight  
Hey Blue Eyes its alright  
  
In this house theres just the dust of bones the basements filled with liars  
In this house our sons and daughters are spilled like wine  
So come close my pretty darling and let me feel your disease  
Tonight Ill have you naked and crawling at the end of my leash  
  
Hey Blue Eyes what you doing tonight  
Hey Blue Eyes its alright  
  
She says In this house its so easy to set a world on fire  
All you need is the need and the money and a soul full of reckless desire  
Upstairs the landlord is dining here with his criminal friends  
Dont worry theyll have the bags packed and be long gone before the real
fucking begins  
  
Hey Blue Eyes yeah what you doing tonight  
Hey Blue Eyes its alright  
Hey Blue Eyes what you doing tonight  
Hey Blue Eyes its alright
