Stay alive soft dark and dreamless  
Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness  
I hate me for breathing without you  
I dont want to feel anymore for you  
  
Grieving for you Im not grieving for you  
Nothing real love cant undo  
And though I may have lost my way  
All paths lead straight to you  
  
I long to be like you  
Lie cold in the ground like you  
  
Halo blinding wall between us  
Melt away and leave us alone again  
Humming haunted somewhere out there  
I believe our love can see us through in death  
  
I long to be like you  
Lie cold in the ground like you  
Theres room inside for two  
And Im not grieving for you  
Im coming for you  
  
Youre not alone  
No matter what they told you  
Youre not alone  
Ill be right beside you forevermore  
  
I long to be like you sis  
Lie cold in the ground like you did  
Theres room inside for two  
And Im not grieving for you  
  
And as we lay in silent bliss  
I know you remember me  
  
I long to be like you  
Lie cold in the ground like you  
Theres room inside for two  
And Im not grieving for you  
Im coming for you
