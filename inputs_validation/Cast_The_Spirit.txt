When you feel down and youve nobody to turn to  
When you feel youre about to give up  
The sun goes down and darkness surrounds you  
And its runnin dry in your lovin cup  
  
Cast the spirit cast it out  
If its in your body then let it out  
Put out the fire let it cool down  
If its in your tears then let it drown  
  
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo  
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo  
  
You cant ignore the feeling inside you  
In your mind youre without a friend  
The spirit is there its in every doorway  
You say to yourself will it ever end  
  
Cast the spirit cast it out  
If its in your body then let it out  
Put out the fire let it cool down  
If its in your tears then let it drown  
  
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo  
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo  
  
When you feel down and have nobody to turn to  
You say to yourself why cant it be  
The sun goes down and darkness surrounds you  
You feel you want to be free  
  
Cast the spirit cast it out  
If its in your body then let it out  
Put out the fire let it cool down  
If its in your tears then let it drown  
  
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo  
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo  
  
Cast the spirit  
Cast the spirit  
Cast the spirit
