Is it really true what theyre saying  
Are you really sure theres nobody come for me  
When Im walking home there is noone  
Once there was a house full of laughter  so warm  
Trying to pretend there is someone  
Someone who will care when I need it  
  
I will now receive my comfort conjured by the magic power of wine  
Just a drink Ill get that drink and Im feeling good  
Just a drink Ill get that drink and Im feeling fine  
Just a drink to take my sorrow  
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow  
Just a drink to make me feel like a man again  
Now Im down  
  
When I walk outside there is nowhere  
Children follow me with their laughter  so cold  
Casting just a glance at the churchyard  
Casting just a glance at my painted female friend  
  
Now Im on my way I am falling  
Got to find some elp ooh I will need that now  
  
So I will receive my comfort conjured by the magic power of wine  
Just a drink Ill get that drink and Im feeling good  
Just a drink Ill get that drink and Im feeling fine  
Just a drink to take my sorrow  
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow  
Just a drink to make me feel like a man again  
Now Im down  
  
I will now receive my comfort conjured by the magic power of wine  
Just a drink Ill get that drink and Im feeling good  
Just a drink Ill get that drink and Im feeling fine  
Just a drink to take my sorrow  
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow now
