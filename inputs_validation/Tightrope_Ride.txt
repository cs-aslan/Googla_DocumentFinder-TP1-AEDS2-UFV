Youre on a tightrope ride  
Nobody by your side  
Well youre all alone  
Gotta find a new home  
Dont go over the line  
You better keep on time  
Or youll lose your mind  
On your tightrope ride  
  
Watch out dont fall  
Careful dont slip  
  
You better get your balance  
You have to feel the weight  
There are no more questions  
Or no answers today  
There are no reasons  
There are no more rhymes  
But if you can feel it you can fly next time  
You can fly next time  
Or maybe this time  
  
Did you think we were all together  
Did you think we were all the same  
Did you think I could help you remember your name  
Remember the pain  
Whats the name of the game  
  
Its a very good game  
Never stays the same  
From the mud to the sun  
Youre on a tightrope ride  
Were all by your side  
But youre all alone and were going home  
And were by you side  
But youre all alone like a rolling stone  
Like Brian Jones  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride
