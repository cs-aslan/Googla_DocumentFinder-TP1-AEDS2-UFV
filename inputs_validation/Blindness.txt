Why cant I see you  
Stuck in black and white  
Youre in technical brightness  
Why cant I see you  
Ive been struck by blindness  
  
I close my eyes cause youve been gone  
Such a long time I fantasize  
You close so long fantasy  
Began to see it altered my mind  
Am I crazy  
When I open my eyes  
Then world was gone  
Reached out when I heard you call my name  
But all I felt was cold  
  
Tell me why cant I see you  
Im stuck in black and white  
Youre in technical brightness  
Why cant I see you  
Ive been struck by blindness  
  
If I close and concentrate  
You illuminate your body slide  
And I let you do the worst mistake  
Its clear as day  
But I cant wrap my mind around it baby  
And when I open my eyes  
Then world is gone long gone long gone  
Reached out when I heard you call my name  
But all I felt was cold  
  
Tell me why cant I see you  
Im stuck in black and white  
Youre in technical brightness  
Why cant I see you  
Ive been struck by blindness  
  
Oh tell me why cant I see you  
Its like Im stuck in black and white  
And youre in technical brightness  
Why cant I see you yeah  
Ive been struck by blindness  
Why cant I see you  
In black and white  
Youre in technical brightness  
Why cant I see you Yeah  
Ive been struck by blindness  
Blindness blindness  
Blindness blindness  
Blindness blindness
