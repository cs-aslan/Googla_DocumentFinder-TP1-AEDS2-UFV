Doom gloom and misery  
Thats what you gave to me  
Cold tight late and mean  
Beyond my wildest dreams  
  
Now that its over  
And the sun came out to shine  
  
Dont look for me  
Cause I set myself free  
In my own time  
  
New days have come along  
And now Im at where I belong  
Blue sky shines above  
And I got someone to love  
  
Now I think about it  
Lifts the clouds from my mind  
Goin out on the sea  
Getting further from me  
  
In my own time  
My own time  
  
Bye bye bye bye  
Is that a tear in your eye  
Too late to cry  
You and your precious disguise  
  
Sometimes I wonder if I ever saw the sign  
But its too late to care  
Cause Ive done that been there  
In my own time  
  
So dont look for me  
Cause I set myself free  
In my own time  
In my own time
