Remember I will still be here  
As long as you hold me in your memory  
  
Remember when your dreams have ended  
Time can be transcended  
Just remember me  
  
I am the one star that keeps burning so brightly  
It is the last light to fade into the rising sun  
  
Im with you  
Whenever you tell my story  
For I am all Ive done  
  
Remember I will still be here  
As long as you hold me in your memory  
Remember me  
  
I am that warm voice in the cold wind that whispers  
And if you listen youll hear me call across the sky  
  
As long as I still can reach out and touch you  
Then I will never die  
  
Remember Ill never leave you  
If you will only  
Remember me  
  
Remember me  
  
Remember I will still be here  
As long as you hold me  
In your memory  
  
Remember when your dreams have ended  
Time can be transcended  
I live forever  
Remember me  
  
Remember me  
Remember Me
