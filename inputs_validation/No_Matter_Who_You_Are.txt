No matter who you are no matter what you do  
Theres gonna be someone wants something else from you  
Yeah  
This is an ancient test its a shiny lie  
Discover somethin pure then sit and watch it die  
Yeah  
No matter who you are no matter where youve been  
No matter what youve done youll have to start again  
No matter who you are  
Between the soaring dreams and the bottom line  
So much is given up so much is left behind  
Yeah  
This is the price you pay this is the beast you feed  
When you abandon hope and you give in to greed  
No matter who you are no matter who youve been  
Youll have to sort it out and start again  
No matter who you are  
No matter who you are  
Dont take this wrong dont let it bring you down  
Its just the way things work in this great big town
