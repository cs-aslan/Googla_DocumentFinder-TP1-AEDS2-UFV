  
Im a one boy one boy girl  
You know Im a one boy girl  
  
1  
Some girls say in their world  
They couldnt bear to have just him  
But I dont need a load of guys  
To pump up my self esteem  
  
Girl what you doin with just one guy  
Given all my lovin  
What you gonna do when  
Theres lipstick on his collar  
Youre gonna get old before your time  
You cant tell me nothing  
bout this man of mine  
  
CHORUS  
No other love could ever  
Compare to my lover  
Im a one boy one boy girl  
No other touch could mean half as much  
As my lover  
You know Im a one boy girl  
  
2  
Check it out  
  
Some guys never realise  
What a girl needs from a man  
But my guy always satisfies  
Its a love we understand  
  
Dont you want to go out and play  
Im sorry but Im busy  
What if you call and there isnt any answer  
Youre gonna find him gone one day  
Hell always be with me no matter what you say  
  
CHORUS  
  
No other kiss is the one that I miss  
With my lover  
Im a one boy one boy girl  
No other man could love like he can  
As my lover  
You know Im a one boy girl  
  
RAP
