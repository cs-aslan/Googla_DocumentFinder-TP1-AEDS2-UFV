Manowar Manowar living on the road  
When were in town speakers explode  
We dont attract wimps cause were too loud  
Just true metal people thats Manowars crowd  
  
They want to keep us down  
But they cant last  
When we get up were gonna kick your ass  
Gonna keep on burnin  
We always will  
Other bands play Manowar kill  
Other bands play Manowar kill  
  
We like it hard we like it fast  
We got the biggest amps man they blast  
True metal people want to rock not pose  
Wearin jeans and leather not cracker jack clothes  
  
They want to keep us down  
But they cant last  
When we get up were gonna kick your ass  
Gonna keep on burnin  
We always will  
Other bands play Manowar kill  
Other bands play Manowar kill  
  
Were the kings of metal commin to town  
When we light up have the roof nailed down  
Dont try to tell us that were too loud  
Cause there aint no way that well ever turn down  
  
They want to keep us down  
But they cant last  
When we get up were gonna kick your ass  
Gonna keep on burnin  
We always will  
Other bands play Manowar kill
