Earth A biosphere  
A complex  
Subtly balanced life support system  
  
Et turtur nidum  
Ubi reponat pullos suos  
Altaria tua Domine virtutum  
Rex meus et Deus meus  
and the turtledove a nest  
Where it might place its young  
Your altar of strengths Lord  
My king and my God  
  
We are floating over the line  
Let us follow our mind  
All of our life well wait for the answer  
And the question is why  
  
If were following our mind  
We can glide into light  
No one knows if therell be an answer  
While were morphing through time  
  
We are floating over the line  
Let us follow our mind  
All of our life well wait for the answer  
And the question is why  
  
Were just travelers  
In endless space  
If were following our mind  
We can glide into light  
  
No one knows if therell be an answer  
While were morphing through time
