Ive been lately thinking  
About my lifes time  
All the things Ive done  
And how its been  
And I cant help believing  
In my own mind  
I know Im gonna hate to see it end  
  
Ive seen a lot of sunshine  
Slept out in the rain  
Spent a night or two all on my own  
Ive known my ladys pleasures  
Had myself some friends  
And spent a time or two all on my own  
  
And I have to say it now  
Its been a good life all in all  
Its really fine  
To have a chance to hang around  
And lie there by the fire  
And watch the evening tire  
While all my friends and my old lady  
Sit and pass the pipe around  
  
And talk of poems and prayers and promises  
And things that we believe in  
How sweet it is to love someone  
How right it is to care  
How long its been since yesterday  
And what about tomorrow  
And what about our dreams  
And all the memories we share  
  
The days they pass so quickly now  
Nights are seldom long  
And time around me whispers when its cold  
The changes somehow frighten me  
Still I have to smile  
It turns me on to think of growing old  
For though my lifes been good to me  
Theres still so much to do  
So many things my mind has never known  
Id like to raise a family  
Id like to sail away  
And dance across the mountains on the moon  
  
I have to say it now  
Its been a good life all in all  
Its really fine  
To have the chance to hang around  
And lie there by the fire  
And watch the evening tire  
While all my friends and my old lady  
Sit and pass the pipe around  
  
And talk of poems and prayers and promises  
And things that we believe in  
How sweet it is to love someone  
How right it is to care  
How long its been since yesterday  
What about tomorrow  
What about our dreams  
And all the memories we share
