Its early morning  
The sun comes out  
Last night was shaking  
And pretty loud  
My kitty is purring  
And scratches my skin  
So what is wrong  
With another sin  
The bitch is hungry  
She needs to tell  
So give her inches  
And feed her well  
More days to come  
New places to go  
Ive got to leave  
Its time for a show  
  
Here I am rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am rock you like a hurricane  
  
My body is burning  
It starts to shout  
Desire is coming  
It breaks out loud  
Lust is in cages  
Till storm breaks loose  
Just have to make it  
With someone I choose  
The night is calling  
I have to go  
The wolf is hungry  
He runs the show  
Hes licking his lips  
Hes ready to win  
On the hunt tonight  
For love at first sting  
  
Here I am rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am rock you like a hurricane
