Yeah n Im doin all right in school  
They aint said I broke no rule  
I aint never been in Dutch  
I dont browse around too much  
Dont bother me leave me alone  
Anyway Im almost grown  
I dont run around with no mob  
Got myself a little job  
Im gonna buy me a little car  
Drive my girl in the park  
Got my eye on a little girl  
Ah shes really out of this world  
When I take her to the dance  
Shes got to talk about romance  
You know Im still livin in town  
But I done married and settled down  
Now I really have a ball  
So I dont browse around at all
