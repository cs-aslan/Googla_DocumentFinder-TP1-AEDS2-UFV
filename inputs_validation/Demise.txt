Please dont ask me how  
I ended up at my wits end and breaking down  
Pages torn from books we never read  
Because were plugged into this grid  
Dont pull this plug right now or then wed really have to live  
  
When I die will they remember not what I did but what I havent done  
Its not the end that I fear with each breath its life that scares me to
death  
  
When we build these dreams on sand  
How they all slip through our hands  
This might be our only chance  
  
Lets take this one day at a time  
Ill hold your hand if you hold mine  
The time that we kill keeps us alive  
  
Your words wont save me now  
Im at the edge feeling the sweat drip from my brow  
Get a grip on yourself is what they say  
Every hour every day  
Hands over my ears Ive been screaming all these years  
  
When I die will they remember not what I did but what I havent done  
Its not the end that I fear with each breath its life that scares me to
death  
  
When we build these dreams on sand  
How they all slip through our hands  
This might be our only chance  
  
Lets take this one day at a time  
Ill hold your hand if you hold mine  
The time that we kill keeps us alive  
  
We came in search of answers  
We left empty handed again  
Shots fired into the sky are now returning  
Where the fuck will you hide  
  
Hiding from the laughter in the closet of our lives  
But the door hinges are squeaking letting in thin shards of light  
And now a hands extending outward quiet comfort they invite  
Do we dare take what they offer do we step into the light  
  
When I die will they remember not what I did but what I havent done  
Its not the end I fear with each breath its life that scares me to death  
  
When we build these dreams on sand  
How they all slip through our hands  
This might be our only chance  
  
Lets take this one day at a time  
Ill hold your hand if you hold mine  
The time that we kill keeps us alive
