One emotion  
Its all over the place  
You let it get out  
It cuts in your face  
  
One emotion  
Back of a shop  
Everybody wants what the next guys got  
  
One emotion  
One emotion  
All you ever know  
Is your narrow life  
One emotion  
  
One emotion  
Dont think I dont trust  
People trample people on the daily bus  
  
One emotion  
Fighting through the night  
And if you can keep your buttons down  
When it gets right  
  
One emotion  
One emotion  
All you ever know  
Is your narrow life  
One emotion  
  
One emotion  
Smokin through the town  
Banging on the doors  
And   
  
One emotion  
Boy meets girl  
Smashing   
Its that kind of world  
  
One emotion  
One emotion  
All you ever know  
Is your narrow life  
One emotion  
  
One emotion  
Moving out loud  
Better get your weapon ready  
Walking through the crowd  
  
One emotion  
Back of a shop  
Everybody wants what the next guys got  
  
One emotion  
One emotion  
All you ever know  
Is your narrow life  
One emotion  
  
One emotion  
Emotion
