When you like a fellow  
Try to treat him right  
Give him your attention  
Day and Night  
  
When he starts to smilin  
And hes got you uptight  
Shower him with kisses  
Day and night  
  
Tell him how you love him  
Tell him hes out of sight  
Then hell know you dig him  
Day and night  
  
If he wants to leave you  
And you think he might  
Beg him not to leave you  
Day and night  
  
Tell him that youre lonely  
Tell him that youre cold  
Tell him that you need him  
Here to Satisfy your soul  
  
If he likes to dance now  
Tell you what you do  
When you see him comin down the street  
You start to Do the bungaloo  
  
Oh no even when hes wrong  
Tell him that hes righr  
You can take the blame  
Both day and night
