Sally free and easy  
That should be her name  
Sally free and easy  
That should be her name  
Took a sailors loving  
For a nursery game  
  
Well the heart she gave me  
Wasnt made of stone  
No the heart she gave me  
Wasnt made of stone  
It was sweet and hollow  
Like a honeycomb  
  
Think Ill wait till sunset  
See the ensign down  
Think Ill wait till sunset  
See the ensign down  
Then Ill take the tideway  
To my burial ground  
  
Sally free and easy  
That should be her name  
Sally free and easy  
That should be her name  
When my bodys landed  
Hope she dies of shame
