Reach for a new horizon  
Setting sights on a circuit scream  
Hail the new arrival on  
Static signs from a distant wanderer  
Fill the air nights are never seen  
Face the electric time shock now  
No its not a dream anymore  
  
I will light the way for us to find  
Order of a new kind  
Join us on the stay the road is mine  
Poets line in a rhyme of silence  
Gathered from the winter air  
Warms the childrens eyes they see  
The time is near for the signs  
  
I can hear the chimes  
Ringing for you for me  
I can see your eyes  
Your hands joining with me  
I can feel its time  
Come together hold the light  
Keep the flame we cant let this world remain  
the same  
  
I can hear the chimes  
Ringing for you for me  
I can see your eyes  
Your hands joining with me  
I can feel its time  
Its time for the world to hear  
Neue Regel is here
