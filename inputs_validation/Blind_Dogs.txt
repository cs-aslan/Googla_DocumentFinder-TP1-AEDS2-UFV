Run away  
Now its Halloween  
Shave your head and burn your sheets  
Evil could be right next door  
What do blind dogs believe  
I dont want to know  
  
Blind  
Following blind  
  
Run away  
Now its Halloween  
The safe bet is on your knees  
Bow your head to the Trinity  
Thats what blind dogs believe  
But Ive heard that before  
  
Dead on my feet  
While my nightmare walks  
I fell asleep  
Where the freeway talks  
Suffer to swim and dying to sink  
These things in the air  
They will make you think  
Make you think  
Make you think
