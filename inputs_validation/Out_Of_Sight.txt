Tell me why  
Do you always forgive the things I do to you  
Youre too good  
Or am I not too bad  
Those six years  
Were the best that ever happened to me and you  
No regrets after all this fear  
  
Well always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
Well always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
  
So tell me why  
I cant find any satisfaction somewhere else  
Not good enough  
Or am I way too bad  
Cause those six years  
I consumed all your energy  
And I didnt replace  
Sad enough  
I cant give you what you need  
  
Well always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
Well always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
Well always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
Well always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
  
Six years  
Such a long time  
I cant give you what you need  
Six years  
Such a long time  
Something special between you and me  
You and me  
  
Well always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
Well always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
Well always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
Well always be best friends  
Something between you and me
