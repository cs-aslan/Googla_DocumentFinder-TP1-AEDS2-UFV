I remember the taste of the vintage wine  
From 63 through to 69  
And Im proud of the things we believed in then  
If I had the chance Id go around again  
Oh I tell you  
We were young and free  
Oh Ill tell you  
Cause I was there you see  
  
And I look to the future with open arms  
And the songs that flow from my old guitar  
And I want to be there when the music plays  
And the lights go up on the empty stage  
  
Oh I tell you  
Music set me free  
Oh I tell you  
It sounds so good to me  
  
And if youre into wandering  
Underneath the stars  
Well take the trip together  
Through this magic world of ours  
  
And if youre still uncertain  
Just what we can be  
Well baby make your mind up  
Get your things and follow me  
  
Cause if youre into romance baby  
Love will find a way  
And if youre into dreaming  
Dream with me  
  
I remember the sounds of the childrens prayer  
The laughing eyes and the golden hair  
And as hard as I try  
Not a day goes by  
That I dont think of them  
  
I tell you  
We can be so free  
Oh I tell you  
If youll be there with me
