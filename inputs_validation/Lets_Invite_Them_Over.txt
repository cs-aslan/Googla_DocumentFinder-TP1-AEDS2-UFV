I know why youre lonely  
And I know why youre blue  
Youre lonesome to see him  
And you long to see her too  
Were not in love with each other  
Were in love with our best friends  
So lets invite them over again  
Weve talked it over and over  
And we know its not right  
We should stay away forever  
But were lonesome each night  
Yes we stay away for a while  
But we know in the end  
Well invite them over again  
Weve talked it over and over  
And we know its not right  
We should stay away forever  
But were lonesome each night  
Yes we stay away for a while  
But we know in the end  
Well invite them over again  
Lets invite them over again
