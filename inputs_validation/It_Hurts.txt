Take your time  
Take it easy  
Keep my little promise  
In your mind  
Making out  
Make it easy  
For all the broken pieces  
Of my heart  
  
A love like this I wasnt looking for  
Ive never known a girl like you before  
  
Lonely nights  
Soft soap story  
Playing in the bedroom  
Of your mind  
Acting up  
I tried to make it happen  
Just another extra  
In your life  
  
A love like this I wasnt looking for  
Ive never known a girl like you before  
  
Yeah  
  
Chorus  
It hurts to say its over  
Its sad to say its gone  
It doesnt really matter  
Whos right or wrong  
When all is said and done  
  
A love like this I wasnt looking for  
Ive never known a girl like you before well  
  
Chorus  
  
Making eyes  
Make it easy  
For all the broken pieces  
Of my heart  
Trying hard  
I nearly made it happen  
Playing out the bedroom of your life  
  
Chorus x2  
  
It hurts yes it does to say its over  
It is over  
Its sad its so sad to say its gone gone gone  
It hurts oh it hurts to say its over  
Yes it hurts  
Its sad to say its gone gone gone  
It hurts yes it hurts to say its over  
Baby its over  
Its sad so sad to say its gone gone gone
