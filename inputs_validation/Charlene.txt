You were mend for me  
Ill give you love and ecstasy  
Strangers on the shore  
I want to play this game no more  
But if you run with me  
Babe to eternity  
Baby Im born again  
Broken hearts can mend tonight  
  
My Charlene Charlene Charlene  
Im lonely youre the only  
Queen of hearts  
My Charlene Charlene Charlene  
Im falling  
Oh Im calling  
For your love for your love  
  
My Charlene  
You are like the flame of love  
Sole survivor of my lost emotion  
My Charlene I never get enough  
How my love is deeper than an ocean  
Daytime friends and nighttime love  
  
If my heart could speak  
You hear Im lonely and Im weak  
There must be a way  
I love you more than words can say  
And if you run with me  
You can have my love for free  
Come on the wings of love  
Up in the sky above tonight
