Yeah yeah  
It seems like yesterday when I said I do  
And after all this time my heart still burns for you  
If you dont know by now that youre my only one  
Take a look inside me and watch my heartstrings come undone  
  
I know I promised you forever  
Is there no stronger word I can use  
To reassure you when the storm is raging outside  
Youre my safest place to hide  
  
Can you see me here I am  
I need you like I needed you then  
When I feel like giving up  
I promise inside your heart Id still fine  
Youre my safest place to hide  
  
You see colors no one else can see  
In every breath you hear a symphony  
You understand me like nobody can  
I feel like my soul unfolding like a flower blooming  
  
When this whole world gets too crazy  
And theres nowhere left to go  
I know you give me sanctuary  
Youre the only truth I know  
Youre the road back home  
  
Can you see me here I am  
Standing here where Ive always been  
And when words are not enough  
I promise inside your heart Id still fine  
Youre my safest place to hide  
My safest place to hide  
  
I know I promised you forever  
Theres no stronger word I can use  
To reassure when the storm is raging outside  
Youre my safest place to hide  
  
Oh Can you see me here I am  
Standing here where Ive always been  
When I feel like giving up  
I promise inside your heart Id still find  
Yeah yeah  
Youre my safest place to hide oh yeah  
Youre my safest place to hide
