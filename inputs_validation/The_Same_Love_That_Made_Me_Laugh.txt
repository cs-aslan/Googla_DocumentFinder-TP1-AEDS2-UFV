Come on now Im the one you love  
Im the one you cant breathe without remember  
Why you wanna make me cry like this  
Why is you wanna make me cry  
Why me  
Your love is like a chunk of gold  
Hard to gain hard to hold  
Like a rose thats soft to touch  
Love has gone and it hurts so much  
Well then why  
Must the same love that made me laugh make me cry  
Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain  
Think about it being a great big rock  
Wont you think before you started to roll it down  
Because once you start it you cant make it stop  
Ive given all I have to give  
And if you dont want me baby  
I dont want to live  
Well then why  
Oh why  
Must the same love that made me laugh gon make me cry  
Why you wanna make me cry 5x  
Why you wanna make me lay in my pillow  
Im just cryin like a weeping willow  
Tell me why oh why oh why  
Why you wanna go home and make your lady cry  
You use to be so soft and sweet to me  
And now you act so wrong and mean to me  
Now you get so wrong and mean to me  
Why oh why oh why  
Oh why you wanna mess my pillow  
You got me cryin like a weeping willow  
Wanna make me cry  
Oh why oh why  
Why why why why  
Why oh why oh why  
Why oh why oh why  
Why oh why oh why  
Why oh why oh why  
Ooh why
