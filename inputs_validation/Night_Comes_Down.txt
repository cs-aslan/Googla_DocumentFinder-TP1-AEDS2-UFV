In the last rays of the setting sun  
And the past days thats where our memories run  
And all of those times  
Still race through my mind  
Im shattered inside to find  
  
When the night comes down  
And Im here all alone  
When the night comes down  
Theres nowhere to go  
  
Call me and Ill wait till the summer  
You never understood  
That Ill wait forever  
For love thats only good  
As the light starts to dim  
The fear closes in  
And the nightmares begin  
  
When the night comes down  
And Im here all alone  
When the night comes down  
And theres no place to go  
  
Oh no you wont be there tomorrow  
Oh no say it isnt true  
I cant take this pain and sorrow  
Oh cant you see my heart is broken in two  
  
Oh say Im trying inside to fight  
  
When the night comes down  
And Im here all alone  
When the night comes down  
And theres no place to go
