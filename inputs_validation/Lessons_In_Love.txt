First you cuddle up beside me nice and near  
Then you whisper all the things I long to hear  
Thats the first lessson in love  
MmmmGive me your heart  
Then you put your two sweet lips on mine like this  
And youll learn the magic of a tender kiss  
Thats the next lesson in love  
Mmmmlesson in love  
Its so easy when you know how  
O my darling let me show you now  
Last you whisper I love you so sweetly  
Then Ill know youve learned it all completely  
Thats the last lesson in love  
Mmmmbaby love me true
