Here she comes you better watch your step  
Shes going to break your heart in two its true  
Its not hard to realize  
Just look into her false colored eyes  
She builds you up to just put you down what a clown  
  
Cause everybody knows  
Shes a femme fatale  
The things she does to please  
Shes a femme fatale  
Shes just a little tease  
Shes a femme fatale  
See the way she walks  
Hear the way she talks  
  
Youre put down in her book  
Youre number thirty seven have a look  
Shes going to smile to make you frown what a clown  
Little boy shes from the street  
Before you start youre already beat  
Shes going to play you for a fool yes its true  
  
Cause everybody knows  
Shes a femme fatale  
The things she does to please  
Shes a femme fatale  
Shes just a little tease  
Shes a femme fatale  
See the way she walks  
Hear the way she talks  
  
Cause everybody knows
