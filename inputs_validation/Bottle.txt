My heart is like a bottle with the world inside  
I couldnt fit more happy in it if I tried  
Look at all the love this thing can hold  
I keep the lid on tight so it wont explode  
I cant help notice from the day we met  
When you touch my hand this is how I get  
To keep my symptoms simplified  
Oh my heart is like a bottle with the world inside  
  
So tell me how do you fit every star in the sky  
Every perfect work of art thats ever made me cry  
Every rose every sound every ocean every shore  
Youve gone and found a way to fit all of that and more  
  
I said to the doctor Doctor whatll I do  
To stretch this heart and make a little more room  
He said Youre one in a million and Im mystified  
See your heart is like a Bottle with the world inside  
  
So tell me how do you fit every star in the sky  
Every perfect work of art thats ever made me cry  
Every rose every sound every ocean every shore  
Youve gone and found a way to fit all of that and more  
  
Well my heart is like a bottle with the world inside  
I couldnt fit more happy in it if I tried  
You love me that must be why  
Oh my heart is like a bottle with the world inside
