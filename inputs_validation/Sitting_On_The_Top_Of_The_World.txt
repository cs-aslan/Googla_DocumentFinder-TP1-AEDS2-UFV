Hey I paid my dues Ive had my share of holes in the shoes  
Im glad its so forgotten  
I love it when you free to spoil me rotten those little things you know  
night shopping for a soul to go  
  
Im sitting on the top of the world and I like it  
Im sitting on the top of the world I want this to be real  
  
Coming out of my cage made of steal  
God I know its final  
Decided to release my love on vinyl  
Those little things you show you kissed the wind you let it blow  
  
Im sitting on the top of the world and I like it  
Im sitting on the top of the world and I like it  
Im sitting on the top of the world and I like it and I like it  
  
Flip right through a magazine bottle neck a tambourine  
Light a candle at the show swinging high and low  
  
Im watching the dawning  
Im sitting on top of the world  
And I like it  
Im sitting on top of the world  
And I like it yeah  
Im sitting on top of the world  
And I like it  
Im sitting on top of the world  
And I like it  
Im watching the dawning  
Im watching the dawning  
Like it  
Im watching the dawning  
Im sitting on the top of the world  
And i like it
