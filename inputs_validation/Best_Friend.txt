Verse 1 Yelawolf  
Aint never been much of the church type  
But I believe in the last days  
I walk through Hell almost every night  
But I believe its a pathway  
Say boy what you doin with your life  
With those tattoos on your face  
Say boy you know that youll pay the price  
Well I guess Ill see when I head that way  
  
Hook Yelawolf  
To the Father Son and Holy Spirit  
I hold You nearest  
My best friend best friend  
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance  
I can almost hear it  
My best friend best friend  
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit  
Behold these lyrics  
I got a best friend best friend  
Yeah I got a best friend best friend yeah  
  
Verse 2 Yelawolf  
I dont know much about Holy Bibles  
But I grew up in the Bible Belt  
I put my love for a woman on idle  
Because I got beat with my mamas belt  
But I learned from my mistakes  
Try hard to respect people for what they believing in  
But if you spit on my fucking grave  
And wish me Hell then I wish you well  
Imma send you straight up to my best friend

Verse 3 Eminem  
God please could you arm me with the armor  
To calm me when theres drama like Gandhi  
Could have gone the other way many times  
Could have turned Dalai with the lama  
But I squashed my beefs and things seem to be looking decent  
Recently but dont jinx it  
Its like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though  
Maybe not finna enter  
The priesthood but at least should  
Make an attempt to show some remorse  
And to be some sort of a repenter  
For the people Ive been a minister  
Not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher  
Into the mind of a thick skin but a short temper  
This patience of mine is thinner  
Than twine is when I get attacked  
So I might say something back that might offend you  
So if you dont like when I rap  
Or what I have to say on the mic then you  
Might wanna act just like quarterbacks  
And take a fuckin hike when I snap cause Im a sinner  
I got a best friend best friend  
Plus balls and intestines  
And they never been yes men  
They gon tell me when Im fuckin up  
The minute Im ever giving it less than  
Im about to vomit and I can feel it coming  
Cause failures something I can barely stomach  
And I only listen to my gut  
So unless youre my fuckin belly button  
Dont tell me nothin  
You aint my best friend best friend  
Who you think Im talking bout  
Lifts me up when Im down and out  
Still look to him without a doubt  
Still got a best friend best friend  
Shout it out like theres never been a louder mouth  
Should have never been allowed a mouth  
Now that I got a higher power  
Now when I blackout power outage  
They powerless but they crowd around  
They tend to flock like shepherds  
The black sheep  
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard  
When Im counted out  
You be DOA theyll announce  
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out  
So prepare for a rival your arch enemy surrounds you now  
Hes all around you  
Not even the doctors at the hospital  
Are gonna shiggyshock you back to life  
Its impiggypossible to revive you  
Thats word to the diggy doc  
Stiggystopping is not an option  
Something Im not gonna do  
Im the Iggy Pop of hiphop when I walk in the booth  
Dawg Im the truth like Biggie rockin with 2Pac in the suit  
Talking to Proof dropping a deuce  
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script cock and I shoot  
Who you thinks my Glock that I use  
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters  
And hell be waiting at the gate when you get sprayed up  
Sending you hoes straight up to deal with my best friend  
  
Hook
