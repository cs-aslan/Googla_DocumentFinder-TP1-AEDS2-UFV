What a life it would be  
If you would come to mine for tea  
Ill pick you up at half past three  
And well have lasagna  
  
Ill treat you like a Queen  
Ill give you strawberries and cream  
And then your friends will all go green  
For my lasagna  
  
These could be the best days of our lives  
But I dont think weve been living very wise  
Oh no no  
What a life it would be  
  
If you would come to mine for tea  
Ill pick you up at half past three  
And well have lasagna  
These could be the best days of our lives  
  
But I dont think weve been living very wise  
Oh no no  
What a life it would be  
If you would come to mine for tea  
  
Ill pick you up at half past three  
And well have lasagna  
Ill treat you like a Queen  
Ill give you strawberries and cream  
  
And then your friends will all go green  
For my lasagna
