I dont want you on my mind all the time  
I believe that it shows a sign of weakness  
I dont want no lonely nights that gets me cryin  
I found out I dont get nowhere with weakness  
Every dream about you  
I just wake up knowing that Ive got to do without you  
  
I dont want all the time doin up my mind  
I dont want you on my mind all the time  
  
I dont want you on my mind all the time  
I believe that it shows a sign of weakness  
I dont want no lonely nights that gets me cryin  
I found out I dont get nowhere with weakness  
Every dream about you  
I just wake up knowing that I got to do without you  
  
I dont want all the time doin up my mind  
I dont want you on my mind all the time
