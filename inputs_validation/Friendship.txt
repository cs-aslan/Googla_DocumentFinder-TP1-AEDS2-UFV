If youre ever in a jam here I am  
If youre ever in a mess SOS  
If youre so happy you land in jail Im your bail  
When other friendships are soon forgot ours will still be hot  
Da da da da da da dig dig dig  
If youre ever up a tree just phone to me  
If you ever loose your teeth when youre out to dine borrow mine  
Its friendship friendship just a perfect blendship  
When other friendships are soon forgeet ours will still be great  
Loddle doddle chuck chuck chaa  
If they ever cook your goose turn me loose  
And if they ever put a bullet through your brain Ill complain  
Its friendship friendship just a perfect blendship  
When other friendships are soon forgit ours will still be it  
Ah loddle doddle hip hap hap  
If you ever loose your mind Ill be kind  
And if you ever loose your shirt Ill be hurt  
If youre ever in a mill and get sawed in half I wont laugh  
Its friendship friendship just a perfect blendship  
When other friendships are are up the crick ours will still be slick  
Ah loddle doddle woof woof woof hep hep hep chopp chop chop dig dig dig  
Good evening friends
