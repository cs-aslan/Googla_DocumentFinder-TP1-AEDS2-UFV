Everytime I Try To Leave  
Something Pulls Me Back Baby  
Tried And Tried To Let You Go  
But Its Just Impossible  
Everytime We Say Goodbye  
Bitter Tear Drops Fill My Eyes  
Wish I Didnt Need You So  
But Youre Irresistible  
  
Verse 1  
I Dont Wanna Lose You To Somebody Else  
But I Cant Go On Contradicting Myself  
I Know That Its Pointless To Keep Hodling On  
But Something Inside Tells Me Youre Where I Belong  
  
Chorus  
Everytime I Try To Leave  
Something Pulls Me Back Baby  
Tried And Tried To Let You Go  
But Its Just Impossible  
Everytime We Say Goodbye  
Bitter Tear Drops Fill My Eyes  
Wish I Didnt Need You So  
But Youre Irresistible  
  
Verse 2  
I Know That Its Unrealistic To Think  
That Things Will Get Better  
Between You And Me  
Cause Time After Time  
You Just Shatter My Heart  
But When Im Without You  
I Feel So Torn Apart  
  
Chorus  
Everytime I Try To Leave  
Something Pulls Me Back Baby  
Tried And Tried To Let You Go  
But Its Just Impossible  
Everytime We Say Goodbye  
Bitter Tear Drops Fill My Eyes  
Wish I Didnt Need You So  
But Youre Irresistible  
  
Boy  
I Wish  
That I Didnt  
Love You So  
Oh Oo Oh Oo Oh Oh  
I Try To Tell You No  
But Youre Irresistible  
Oh Oo Oh Oo Whoah Oh  
  
See I Only Want It To Be Like It Was  
When We Got Together And First Fell In Love  
Sometimes Its Like Im Addicted To You  
This Loves So Consuming  
I Dont Know What To Do  
  
Everytime I Try To Leave  
Something Pulls Me Back Baby  
Tried And Tried To Let You Go  
But Its Just Impossible  
Everytime We Say Goodbye  
Bitter Tear Drops Fill My Eyes  
Wish I Didnt Need You So  
  
But Youre Irresistible  
  
Everytime I Try To Leave  
Something Pulls Me Back Baby  
Tried And Tried To Let You Go  
But Its Just Impossible  
Everytime We Say Goodbye  
Bitter Tear Drops Fill My Eyes  
Wish I Didnt Need You So  
But Youre Irresistible  
  
Everytime I Try To Leave  
Something Pulls Me Back Baby  
Tried And Tried To Let You Go  
But Its Just Impossible  
Everytime We Say Goodbye  
Bitter Tear Drops Fill My Eyes  
Wish I Didnt Need You So  
But Youre Irresistible
