Youre such a flirt I know you hurt  
And so do I I empathize  
I see you out you never cared  
A conversation that we never shared  
  
But its so strange its something new  
Amazing feelings that I have for you  
I close my eyes when Im alone  
Wonder what itd be like to make you moan  
  
I wanna give you something better  
Than anything youve ever had  
A stronger and a faster lover  
The world it disappears so fast  
  
Sweet Kiwi  
Your juice is dripping down my chin  
So please let me  
Dont stop it before it begins  
  
So give it up and dont pretend  
And spread your arms and legs across the bed  
And when you shake you wont regret  
The things I whisper in your ear  
What I said  
  
I wanna give you something better  
You wanna give me something better  
Than anything youve ever had  
Than anything Ive ever had  
A stronger and a faster lover  
A stronger and a faster lover  
The world it disappears so fast  
It disappears so fast  
  
Sweet Kiwi  
Your juice is dripping down my chin  
So please let me  
Dont stop it before it begins  
  
I cant wait to take you home  
Fingers through your hair  
Kisses on your back  
Scratch me with your nails  
Save me from myself  
Show me how to care  
Get everything out  
Dripping everywhere  
Lipstick smeared all over your face  
How much longer must we wait  
Dont think that I can wait  
  
Sweet Kiwi  
Your juice is dripping down my chin  
So please let me  
Dont stop it before it begins  
  
Hey yeah  
  
Sweet Kiwi wanna give you something better than this  
Your juice is dripping down my chin hey  
So please let me wanna give you something better than this  
Dont stop it before it begins  
  
Dont stop it before it begins  
Dont stop it before it begins  
Dont stop it before it begins  
Dont stop it before it begins
