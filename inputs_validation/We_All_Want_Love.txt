We all we all we all we all we all  
We all we all we all we all we all  
  
I can pretend that Im not lonely  
But Ill be constantly fooling myself  
I can pretend that it dont matter  
But Ill be sitting here lying to myself  
Some say love aint worth the buck  
But Ill give every dime I have left  
To have what Ive only been dreaming about  
  
Everybody wants something  
Better want something  
What are you living for  
Everybody needs something  
Fighting for something  
I know what youre fighting for  
Cause we all  
  
We all want someone there to hold  
We just want somebody  
We all wanna be somebodys one and only  
We all wanna be warm when its cold  
Yeah yeah yeah  
No one wants to be left scared and lonely  
  
We all we all we all we all we all  
We all want the same thing  
We all we all we all we all we all  
We all want the same thing  
We all we all we all we all we all  
We all want the same thing  
Everybody wants something  
Gotta want something  
Yeah yeah we all want love  
  
Im able to close my eyes  
Yet my hearts not so blind  
I feel so entitled of owes me  
I want whats mine  
  
And some say love aint worth the buck  
But Ill give em the last dime  
To have what Ive only been dreaming about  
  
Everybody wants something  
Better want something  
What are you living for  
Everybody needs something  
Fighting for something  
I know what youre fighting for  
Cause we all  
  
We all want someone there to hold  
We just want somebody  
We all wanna be somebodys one and only  
We all wanna be warm when its cold  
Yeah yeah yeah  
No one wants to be left scared and lonely  
We all we all we all we all
