Well you can stake that claim  
Good work is the key to good fortune  
Winners take that praise  
Losers seldom take that blame  
If they dont take that game  
And sometimes the winner takes nothing  
We draw our own designs  
But fortune has to make that frame  
  
We go out in the world and take our chances  
Fate is just the weight of circumstances  
Thats the way that lady luck dances  
Roll the bones  
  
Why are we here  
Because were here  
Roll the bones  
Why does it happen  
Because it happens  
Roll the bones  
  
Faith is cold as ice  
Why are little ones born only to suffer  
For the want of immunity  
Or a bowl of rice  
Well who would hold a price  
On the heads of the innocent children  
If theres some immortal power  
To control the dice  
  
We come into the world and take our chances  
Fate is just the weight of circumstances  
Thats the way that lady luck dances  
Roll the bones  
  
Jack relax  
Get busy with the facts  
No zodiacs or almanacs  
No maniacs in polyester slacks  
Just the facts  
Gonna kick some Gluteus max  
Its a parallax you dig  
You move around  
The small gets big Its a rig  
Its action reaction  
Random interaction  
So whos afraid  
Of a little abstraction  
Cant get no satisfaction  
From the facts  
You better run homeboy  
A facts a fact  
From Nome to Rome boy  
  
Whats the deal Spin the wheel  
If the dice are hot take a shot  
Play your cards Show us what you got  
What youre holding  
If the cards are cold  
Dont go folding  
Lady Luck is golden  
She favors the bold Thats cold  
Stop throwing stones  
The night has a thousand saxophones  
So get out there and rock  
And roll the bones  
Get busy
