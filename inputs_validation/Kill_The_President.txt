In a world without leaders  
Whod start all the wars  
The world that your saving  
Will always be yours  
Kill the President  
Listen to the voice of reason  
Unify with that single line  
Stop the man with the power  
Of the government  
A leaders not the center  
Of democracy  
In a world without leaders  
Whod make people starve  
The world that were saving  
Will always be ours  
Everyone says  
Well maybe Ill make a difference  
Thinking theyve got plenty of time  
But youre squeezed  
A little tighter everyday  
Finished before you can commit a crime  
In a world without leaders  
Whod start all the wars  
The world that your saving  
Will always be yours  
Kill the President  
Listen to the voice of reason  
Unify with that single line  
Stop the man with the power  
Of the government  
A leaders not the center  
Of democracy  
America  
All of your enemies  
Come from within  
But you lash out so  
It is seen  
Like some frightened child  
In an angry world  
Or the fall of Rome  
Your demise comes  
From your own hands  
In a world without leaders  
Whod start all the wars  
The world that your saving  
Will always be yours  
In a world without leaders  
We might have a chance  
But well never see it  
As long as theres
