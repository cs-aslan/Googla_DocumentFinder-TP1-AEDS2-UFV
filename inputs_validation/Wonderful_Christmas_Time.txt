La la da ta da  
The mood is right the spirits up  
Were here tonight and thats enough  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
The partys on the feelings here  
That only comes this time of year  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
The choir of children sing their song  
They practiced all year long  
Dingdong dingdong dingdong dingdong  
La la la la la la la la la la  
Yeah  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
The word is out about the town  
To lift a glass and dont look down  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
