So you see Im too legit too ever quit  
I started gaining momentum when they put me in the mix  
Youll feel my power the stage Ill burn it up  
So put it on the hammer then people will burn it up  
To the records who tried to diss this is on yo face  
Ill turn this mutha out leave you lookin disgraced  
Bet you cant touch and now you regret fo calling  
Yourself a pet instead of something wet  
Now brothers went long its still the same song  
While people rollin on your crew is gone

Suck as betta pray cause its hammer time one mo time

See I step to her shes mine in a matter of minutes  
It aint how long you talk its what you put in em  
Spittin this game so cold and you tellin me  
That Im not able to pick up this freak well you fail to see  
The hard nigga is what they call me  
And every year Im at the players balgee  
Whenever Im next you can prepare to see a show  
And whenever it comes to breakin it up  
You know Im lettin em win the net  
And Im the man in command so Im puttin em in their place  
And if shes lookin for handouts then get outta Hammers Face

And everywhere I went I made the people say  
Hey Im makin em all amazed in every phase  
And rap fools I gotta serve em but this time  
The Hammer gotta hurt em

And watched Holy field know em out in Vegas city

Just rolls out fifteen hundred cities every one of em sold out
