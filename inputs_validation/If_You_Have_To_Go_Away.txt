When I was a younger  
I used to dream a lot  
Staring into my coffee  
About how youd love me  
And write me poetry  
And want to be with me yeah  
Well momma done told me  
You might wander far yeah  
But nobody warned me  
The road would own your heart  
  
And so Im saying  
If you have to go away  
I will be waiting by the phone  
And if you have to go away  
Ill put your records on  
Pretend youre still at home  
  
Now that Im older  
I sit at home a lot  
With the kid weve got yeah  
The radios playing  
He really loves his wife  
I hear the DJ saying  
Well momma done told me  
You might wander far oh  
As long as you hold me  
More than you hold that guitar  
  
Ill keep on saying  
If you have to go away  
Ill leave your shoes beside the bed  
And if you have to go away  
Ill want to be with you  
Ill be with me instead  
If you have to go away  
I wont be sleeping very well  
But if you have to go away  
Ill be loving you  
Till its cold in hell  
  
Maybe youll write me this time  
Maybe youll call on a static line  
Saying dont you ever worry your pretty mind  
Cause you and me are gonna be fine  
  
And so Im saying  
If you have to go away  
I will be waiting by the phone  
And if you have to go away  
Ill put your records on  
Pretend youre still at home  
  
If you have to go away  
Ill leave your shoes beside the bed  
And if you have to go away  
Ill want to be with you  
Ill be with me instead  
If you have to go away  
I wont be sleeping very well  
But if you have to go away  
Ill be loving you  
Ill be loving you  
If you have to go away
