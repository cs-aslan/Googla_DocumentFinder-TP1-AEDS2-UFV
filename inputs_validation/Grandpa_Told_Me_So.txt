If you dont get in the water youre never gonna learn to swim  
He said a snake is just as scared of you as you are of him  
He could tell by the moon when the fish would bite  
Seems there was nothing that he didnt know  
And as a kid I believed cause Grandpa told me so  
  
He talked Daddy into letting me have my first car  
I thought I was really something til Becky Thompson broke my heart  
That first taste of love really did me in  
Getting over her slow  
And I knew someday I would cause Grandpa told me so  
  
He said life is made for you to live  
The best love is the love that you give  
Therell be times when you want to hold on but you gotta let go  
And I live by those words cause Grandpa told me so  
  
I promised him I wouldnt cry when it was his time to leave  
Thats the only promise I made him I couldnt keep  
He smiled from his bed and said well meet again  
Somewhere down the road  
And I believe cause Grandpa told me so  
  
He said life is made for you to live  
The best love is the love that you give  
Therell be times when you want to hold on but you gotta let go  
And I live by those words cause Grandpa told me so  
  
He said life is made for you to live  
The best love is the love that you give  
Therell be times when you want to hold on but you gotta let go  
And I live by those words cause Grandpa told me so  
  
Yeah and I still believe  
Grandpa told me so  
Grandpa told me so  
I still believe  
Grandpa told me so  
I still believe
