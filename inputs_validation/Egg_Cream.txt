When I was a young man  no bigger than this  
A chocolate egg cream was not to be missed  
Some U Bets Chocolate Syrup seltzer water mixed with milk  
Stir it up into a heady fro  tasted just like silk  
  
You scream I steam We all want Egg Cream  
  
Now you can go to Juniors Daves on Canal St  
And I think theres Kens in Boston  
There must be something in LA  
But Beckys on Kings Highway  
Was the Egg Cream of choice  
And if you dont believe me  
Go ask any of the boys  
  
You scream I steam We all want Egg Cream  
  
The only good thing I remember about PS92  
Was the Egg Cream served at Beckys  
It was a fearsome brew  
For fifty cents you got a shot  chocolate bubbles up your nose  
That made it easier to deal with knife flights  
and kids pissing in the street  
  
You scream I steam We all want Egg Cream  
  
So the next time youre in Brooklyn  Please say hello for me  
At Totonnos for Pizza and ice cream at Al and Shirleys  
But mostly you go to Beckys  sit in a booth and say hello  
And have two chocolate Egg Cream  one to stay and go  
  
You scream I steam We all want Egg Cream
