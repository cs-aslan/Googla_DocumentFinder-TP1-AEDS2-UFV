I will miss you when you go much more than youll ever know  
But Ill have a memory to keep you near  
  
In my heart you will remain but it just wont be the same  
I will miss a million things that make you dear  
  
Your lovely ways make you so sweet I prayed the angels fair will keep  
Youre happiness so youll be blessed just as you deserve to be  
  
I wonder why there are so few lovely people like you  
My but I will surely miss you when you go  
  
Your lovely ways make you
