In South Australia I was born heave away haul away  
In South Australia round Cape Horn were bound for South Australia  
  
Haul away your rolling king heave away haul away  
Haul away youll hear me sing were bound for South Australia  
  
As I walked out one morning fair heave away haul away  
Twas there I met Miss Nancy Blair were bound for South Australia  
  
Theres just one thing thats on my mind heave away haul away  
Thats leaving Nancy Blair behind were bound for South Australia  
  
And as we wallop round Cape Horn heave away haul away  
Youll wish to God youve never been born were bound for South Australia  
  
In South Australia I was born heave away haul away  
In South Australia round Cape Horn were bound for South Australia
