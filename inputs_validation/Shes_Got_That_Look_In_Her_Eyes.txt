Shes still got those pretty eyes like she did in school  
The first time that she looked at me my heart went kaboom  
Today I saw that look again on sale in summer square  
She looked so good in what she wore somehow it dont seem fair  
Shes got that look in her eyes just like shes always had  
Shes got that smile on her lips that always drives me mad  
When she looks at me the way I feel comes as no surprise  
I love that look when shes got that look in her eyes  
Just today she looked at me and I felt like a kid  
Even thought Im grown up now the puzzle seems to fit  
I may never have her but Ill still love her still  
Oh I may never hold her in my mind I always will  
Shes got that look in her eyes just like shes always had  
Shes got that smile on her lips that always drives me mad  
When she looks at me the way I feel comes as no surprise  
I love that look when shes got that look in her eyes  
When she looks at me the way I feel comes as no surprise  
I love that look when shes got that look in her eyes
