In Trinidad there was a family  
With much confusion as you will see  
There was a Mama and a Papa and a boy who was grown  
He wanted to marry a wife by his own  
He met a young girl who suited him nice  
He went to his Papa to ask his advice  
His Papa said Son I have to say no  
That girl is your sister but your Mama dont know  
  
Woe is me Shame and scandal in the family  
Woe it worries me Shame and scandal in the family  
  
A week went by the summer came down  
Soon another girl on the island he found  
He went to his Papa to name the day  
His Papa shook his head and this time he did say  
You cant marry this girl have to say no  
That girl is your aunty but your granny dont know Hey  
  
Woe is me Shame and scandal in the family  
Woe it worries me Shame and scandal in the family  
  
Now he went to his Mama covered his head  
And told his Mama what his Papa had said  
His Mama she laughed she said Go son go  
Your Daddy aint your Daddy but your Daddy dont know  
  
Now he went to his Mama covered his head  
And told his Mama what his Papa had said  
His Mama she laughed she said Go son go  
Your Daddy aint your Daddy but your Daddy dont know
