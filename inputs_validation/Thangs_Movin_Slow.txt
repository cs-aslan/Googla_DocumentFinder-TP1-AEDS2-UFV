Yeah yeah my nigga its Attic Crew and Cooley see my nigga  
Yeah Youngbloodz Youngbloodz and Cooley see my nigga  
Um Mark Twayne  
Now its time to let yall nigga know about me  
Oh I can get mo money mo money dont come to me  
And everything I say that be on the blow  
Rap for the love of money stack it up once mo  
Going once going twice got the O for the LOW  
Got my cheese in the soil tryin to make my flow grow  
Hell no never fall off  
Slip pimpin you can get it hard or get it soft  
All day round the clock tryin to get it in  
I aint worried bout the rich cause Im in the wind  
All I got is my folks Lord forgive me for my sins  
And if this aint for me please make me thank again  
Gotta get my shit right tight like these gurls draws  
Let me recognize the game and all the flaws  
While Im out here please let me come up  
And watch my every step so I dont have to duck  
Never wanted this damn how a nigga stuck  
Hit me on the hill nigga Im a sack it up  
Rabbit on my head all day for good luck  
On the hustle everyday but who really gives a fuck  
hook  
So what you got when you aint got nothing to show  
Thangs movin slow cant get your hands on no blow  
Aint got no flow naw need some quick cash  
If hustlin is the answer nigga get up off your ass  
I walk about the crib with my mind on the dough  
Been hustlin these verses aint got a damn thang to show  
I keep my head up because I feel its bout to pop  
Done heard about a deal going down at the dock  
Critics say it dont stop til you get it and its gone  
Its all about the fett set it off get it crunk  
You catch me on the corner Ill be buddy with the sacks  
Off in the studio it be Twayne with the tracks  
Fire fire like that dope gettin smoked everyday  
Got a call from my source he on the way with the llell yeah  
Coming in from overseas bout 82 kis  
Not a word to be said everybody hit your knees lets leave  
Get the cheese make away with the blow  
Slip in the door right before we do the show  
Mr Dope Man your looking kinda sick  
Thangs movin slow now that you aint got shit  
hook  
So what you got now you out of luck  
Sellin your soul to the devil just to make a quicker buck  
But for what you took a chance receiving half of some blow  
And pushing them quarter kis underground to keep the flow  
Its toe to toe we can take it to the deepest of the seas  
And anybody else who want to bite then try a piece  
Of these Youngbloodz bustin 30 slugs so just perhaps  
You crawlin out of a shell  
Finding ways up out these traps  
Like craps you out to gamble losing everything you own  
And still like to pretend as if this game gonna keep em known  
And do know you in a ball of burning hell  
So might as well take a ride on the weed into the ATL  
And niggas swear we outdone and outgunned  
So whats the first attempt when they got you on the run  
With fun they shootin tons of shots so whose to blame  
Nobody but yourself as you hold inside the pain  
hook
