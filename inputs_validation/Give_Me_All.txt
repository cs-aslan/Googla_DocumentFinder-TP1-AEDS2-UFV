I wanna get deeper  
Deeper than skin  
I wanna be more than  
just another friend  
  
Im ready to love you  
with all of my heart  
But I wont give it if you  
cant do your part  
  
Chorus  
A little bit just aint it  
Give me all  
A little love is not enough  
Give me all  
  
Need your lovin  
Need your kissin  
Dont want nothin  
To be missin  
  
Youre givin me portions  
You wanna move fast  
What youre giving  
Is never gonna last  
  
I wanna be closer  
I need to have more  
Cause Im gonna love you  
like no one before  
  
Chorus  
  
Need your lovin  
Need your kissin  
Dont want nothin  
To be missin  
  
Im on fire babe  
You wanna build me up  
Just to let me down
