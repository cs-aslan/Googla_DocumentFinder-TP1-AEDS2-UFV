Hush a bye  
Dont you cry  
Go to sleep my little baby  
When you wake  
You shall have  
All the pretty little ponies  
  
In your bed  
Momma said  
Babys riding off to dreamland  
One by one  
Theyve begun  
Dance and prance for little baby  
Blacks and bays dapples and greys  
Running in the night  
When you wake  
You shall have  
All the pretty little ponies  
  
Can you see the little ponies  
Dance before your eyes  
All the pretty little ponies  
Will be there when you arise
