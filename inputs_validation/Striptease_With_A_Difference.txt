Bending the rules of a late night card game  
Where the loser removes an item of clothing  
Your treading each deal so eargings and grey  
Have a shufty over your shoulder well its a shady game  
And I want to lose  
Oh please let me lose  
Oh please let me lose  
Its nothing to you  
Its nothing to you  
  
This reshuffled pack brings back the sickness of luck  
Because the ace in my hand is such a shock  
Exchanging queen for your two while youre out of the room  
Have a shufty over your shoulder well all the same its a shady game  
And I want to lose  
Oh please let me lose  
Oh please let me lose  
Its nothing to you  
Its nothing to you  
  
Im cutting this queen  
Well this six is chewed  
Youre all undisguised  
Im stuck on shoes  
So have you ever met a bad winner  
Well how do you do  
Jack ace queen king no na no na no na no na  
Noooooo

Nooooooooooooaooooohohoh  
They wont let me lose  
  
Im bending the rules of a late night card game
