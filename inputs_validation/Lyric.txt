here comes my faith to carry me on  
a faith not of grade  
i fight to to stay strong so i  
stand accused of playing numb  
i know it is wrong  
for i give my strength  
i give my heart  
take these chains  
and hold them as ours  
for i must shine  
and i will a star  
in a season all mine  
  
a lyric a time a crusade a line  
one minute a friend a road without end  
a lyric a time a crusade a line  
one minute a friend a road without end  
  
so here is the view  
i cast about  
im leaving no room  
for you to get out  
youll never get out  
  
dove cant you cry without an aside  
  
i need you as my way  
across my life  
to spend these years  
create a new thought  
for i give you strength  
and offer my heart  
take these chains  
and hold them as ours  
for im a star  
and i will shine  
in a season all mine  
  
a lyric a time a crusade a line  
one minute a friend a road without end  
a lyric a time a crusade a line  
one minute a friend a road without end  
a lyric a time a crusade a line  
one minute a friend a road without end  
a lyric a time a crusade a line  
one minute a friend a road without end  
a road without end
