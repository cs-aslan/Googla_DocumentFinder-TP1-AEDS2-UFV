Kool Keith  
Now heres a funky beat my rhyme is updated  
For soft ducks I played it once  
A biter jumped on it  
Girls got stupid freaks humped on it  
And from the back I pumped on it  
mostly with skill top finesse  
East to West but I guess Im right  
while others are wrong  
Tryin to teach and usin my song  
along with your wiggedywack  
Stay back get back sit back down  
and think about it whenever youre dissin me  
You are the roach the six legs wishin me  
and pushin me steadily on  
Metaphor better for psychin more  
On my tour brains are sore  
Ill be sure Im fresher  
So tell me how I  
duck wack rappers around  
In town never wearin no boots  
Toy Bally sharkskin suits  
Rip a story and threw his auditory  
Canal Street is my territory  
For gold glory reachin my hand  
to smack rappers and makin em stand outside  
waitin for me to tell them my secret style  
And show them how really its done  
My son now Im back to you  
And if youre bad Ill smack you too  
A glass of rhymes shattering  
Now youre cut up say what up  
Shut up cause Im feelin it

Hello Im back again

of knowledge and wisdom over all topics

Topping all the ducks who are delerious  
about rhymin Im more serious  
Like this with twists as changes  
I took time and rearranged this  
style like how versatile you ask me now wow

The movie you seen on TV  
Ill be numerous but believe me  
Ill chop you up bash your brain rotate your liver  
Then Im gonna give ya a fresh rhyme maybe  
Sealed and delivered by me  
The manufacturer  
Straight out of Attica I come after ya  
And if ya run I have to damage ya  
mentally by using my mind  
Choosing adjectives hard to define  
in rhymes a dictionary wordpiece  
From the Brainiac I blew your domepiece  
open hopin youll say to me  
That was dope like an anatomy  
operation on the turntables  
Slicing nerds with verbs fully enabled  
Equipped with a white handkerchief  
to wipe away the germs who wanna hang with this  
Ultra smoker dope man no joker  
With the line I wrote and I quote them  
Cause Im feelin it
