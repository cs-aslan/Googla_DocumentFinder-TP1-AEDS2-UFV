Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
  
You were in college working parttime waiting tables  
Left a small town never looked back  
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin  
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts  
  
I say can you believe it  
As were lyin on the couch  
The moment I can see it  
Yes yes I can see it now  
  
Do you remember we were sittin there by the water  
You put your arm around me for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter  
You are the best thing thats ever been mine  
  
Flash forward and were takin on the world together  
And theres a drawer of my things at your place  
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded  
You say well never make my parents mistakes  
  
And we got bills to pay  
We got nothin figured out  
When it was hard to take  
Yes yes  
This is what I thought about  
  
Do you remember we were sittin there by the water  
You put your arm around me for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter  
You are the best thing thats ever been mine  
  
Do you remember all the city lights on the water  
You saw me start to believe for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter  
You are the best thing thats ever been mine  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
And I remember that fight twothirty am  
Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands  
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street  
  
Braced myself for the goodbye  
Cause thats all Ive ever known  
Then you took me by surprise  
You said Ill never leave you alone  
  
You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water  
And every time I look at you its like the first time  
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter  
She is the best thing thats ever been mine  
  
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter  
You are the best thing thats ever been mine  
  
Do you believe it  
Were gonna make it now  
And I can see it  
  
I can see it now
