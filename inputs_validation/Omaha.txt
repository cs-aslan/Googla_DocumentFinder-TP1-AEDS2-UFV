Start tearing the old man down  
Run past the heather and down to the old road  
Start turning the grain into the ground Roll a new leaf over  
In the middle of the night theres an old man treading around in the gathered  
rain  
Well mister if youre going to walk on water  
Could you drop a line my way  
  
Omaha Somewhere in middle America  
Get right to the heart of matters  
Its the heart that matters more  
I think you better turn your ticket in  
And get your money back at the door  
  
Start threading a needle  
Brush past the shuttle that slides through the cold room  
Start turning the wool across the wire Roll a new life over  
In the middle of the night theres an old man threading his toes through a  
bucket of rain  
Hey mister you dont want to walk on water  
Because youre going to just walk all over me  
  
Omaha Somewhere in middle America  
Get right to the heart of the matters  
Its the heart that matters more  
I think you better turn your ticket in  
And get your money back at the door  
  
Start running the banner down  
Drop past the color come up through the summer rain  
Start turning the girl into the ground Roll a new love over  
In the middle of the day theres a young man rolling around in the earth and  
rain  
Hey Mister if youre going to walk on water  
You know youre only going to walk all over me  
  
Omaha Somewhere in middle America  
Get right to the heart of matters  
Its the heart that matters more  
I think you better turn your ticket in  
And get your money back at the door
