Well here you come again and youre lookin so fine  
You dont notice me but its alright  
Im just a guy who wishes that I could be your man someday  
Yeah a picture paints a thousand words its true  
But its still not enough for how I feel about you  
I wanna put you in a melody I gotta set you to a groove  
  
I wanna put you in my car and drive  
And turn you up loud roll down all the windows and shout it out  
I love this girl oh  
If I could press play repeat how happy Id be  
Wherever Id go Id have you there with me  
Youd be right where you belong  
I wanna put you in a song oh oh oh  
  
Well Id sing about your smile and your pretty blue eyes  
The way your hair shimmers in the sunlight  
Itd be so easy Ill just write it from my heart  
Cause I gotta tell the world what you mean to me  
Wrap you up in a melody so youll be  
Stuck in my head all day  
Cause youre already there anyway yes you are  
  
I wanna put you in my car and drive  
And turn you up loud roll down all the windows and shout it out  
I love this girl  
If I could press play repeat how happy Id be  
Wherever Id go Id have you there with me  
Youd be right where you belong  
I wanna put you in a song  
  
And if I get it right everybody will be singing along yeah  
And when they see you on the street theyll say  
Hey aint you the girl in that song  
  
I wanna put you in my car and drive  
And turn you up loud roll down all the windows and shout it out  
Im in love with this girl  
Yeah if I could press play rewind a couple million times  
Imagine for a moment that youre all mine  
Every night Id drive you home  
If I could put you in a  
Let me put you in a song  
Let me put you in a song  
Oh a pretty little song about you baby
