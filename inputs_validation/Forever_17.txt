Never thought it would be me  
Living in a shattered dream  
How could this be the end for me  
What I wouldnt give to have  
  
A life to live  
A day to plan  
Instead Ill be Forever 17  
Couldve lived out every dream  
Couldve been most anything  
  
Chorus  
Can someone wake me up  
I havent lived yet Im only 17  
God did you forget  
Im just a baby and I dont want to be  
Forever 17  
  
Ill never have a bed to make  
A test to take  
A summer day  
Ill always be Forever 17  
  
Couldve had a family  
If things had worked differently  
Instead Ill be Forever 17  
Could I have just one more day  
A chance to learn from my mistakes  
  
Chorus  
  
In a matter of a moment  
Life fell before my eyes  
Now Im looking at the meaning of the miracle of life  
Where were we going without even knowing the answer deep inside  
  
Forever 17  
  
So dont give up  
You havent lived yet  
Youre only 17  
  
And God did not forget  
Youre just a baby
