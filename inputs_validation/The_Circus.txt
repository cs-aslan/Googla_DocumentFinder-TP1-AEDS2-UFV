The sky collapsed around us you didnt seem to care  
I hailed you through the raindrops you werent even there  
I juggle with the breakfast you fret behind the sheets  
I want you to be steadfast you want to be released  
Chorus  
Oh my pretty darling where did we go astray  
Oh my pretty darling I thought youd come to stay  
Were all dollied up for the circus oh isnt it grand  
Were laughing jumping and kissing were beating the band  
Ive got no more smiles to win you no tricks to turn your head  
When love cannot continue theres not much to be said  
Chorus  
Its all cut and thrust at the circus and maybe makes three  
Youre twisting my words into serpents Im down on my knees  
Oh my pretty darling I thought youd come to stay  
I thought youd come to stay I thought youd come to stay
