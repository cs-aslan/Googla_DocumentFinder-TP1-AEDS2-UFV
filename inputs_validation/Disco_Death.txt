Ha ow ha ow ha ow haaaaaaaaaa baby this is my life  
When I walk out the door I see you baby you are not in my life  
I wanna hold em like they do in texas plays  
Fold em let em hit me raise it baby stay with me I love it  
Luck and intuition play the cards with spades to start  
And after hes been hooked Ill play the one thats on his hearti  
Have something that I love longlong  
But my friends keeping telling me that somethings wrong  
Then I met someone  
This is my life  
And babe theres nothing else I can say  
Eh eh eh eh  
Theres nothing else I can say  
Eh eh eh eh  
I wish youd never looked at me that way  
Eh eh eh eh  
Theres nothing else I can say  
Eh eh eh eh  
My my my my life  
Lets have some fun this beat is sick  
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick  
Dont play too much just as that kid  
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick  
  
Touch me ttouch me baby but dont mess up my hair  
Love me llove me crazy  
But dont get too attached this is a brink affair  
My life  
Vanity pictures in magazines movie screens  
Vanity there is a camera so many beauty queens  
Vanity its so good to be  
Popular and glamourous we love ourselves and no one else  
Vavavavavanity vavanity vavavavanity  
My life so shut up  
Lets play a love game baby love game  
When you want love when you want fame  
Though you in a game though in a love game  
Lets play a love game baby love game  
When you want love when you want fame  
Though you in a game though in a love game  
This is my life
