Cant you see Im tryin  
Cant you see Im tryin  
Oh why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin  
  
Everywhere I wanna go you dont wanna go  
Everything I wanna do You dont wanna do  
Hy are you so hard to please  
Must I wear out my knees  
  
Cant you see Im tryin  
Cant you see Im tryin  
Oh why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin  
  
Ill do anything to help you get your kicks  
But Im scrapin the bottom of my bag of tricks  
Oh and I have needs to fulful an occasional thrill  
  
Cant you see Im tryin  
Cant you see Im tryin  
Oh why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin  
  
Cant you see Im tryin  
Cant you see Im tryin  
Oh why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin  
  
Woh Cant you see Im tryin  
Cant you see Im tryin  
Oh why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin  
  
Woh Cant you see Im tryin  
Cant you see Im tryin
