I want you  
I need your rhyme  
But you keep saying babe  
Its gonna take time  
I know the heartache  
I put you through  
Believe me babe  
Im gonna make it up to you  
  
You are the reason  
Im down on my knees  
Im begging you to give me a chance  
If only you would  
Give me just a little more time  
Give me just a little more time  
Give me just a little more time  
Give me just a little more time  
To prove it to you  
  
So many feelings  
I cant explain  
I never thought Id ever cause you any pain  
Now Im alone here  
An I cant hide  
The sun dont shine for me  
Without you by my side  
  
You are the reason  
Im down on my knees  
Im begging you to give me a chance  
If only you would  
Give me just a little more time  
Give me just a little more time  
Give me just a little more time  
Give me just a little more time  
To prove it to you  
  
An Im gonna prove it  
  
I want you  
Right by my side  
Cause youre the only one who keeps me satisfied  
I need your loving  
I need your charms  
I cant stand the through of you  
In someone elses arms  
  
You are the reason  
Im down on my knees  
Im begging you to give me a chance  
If only you would  
Give me just a little more time  
Give me just a little more time  
Give me just a little more time  
Give me just a little more time  
To prove it to you  
An Im gonna prove it
