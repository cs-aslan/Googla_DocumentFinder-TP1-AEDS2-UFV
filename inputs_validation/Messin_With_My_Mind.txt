I said one thing Id never do was care or hang around for too long anywhere I  
Could always move ahead with nothing left behind then you started messin with  
My mind This town was just another place to play have some fun then be on my  
  
Way you were just another way for me pass some time then you started messin  
With my mind  
  
Chorus  
I cant believe how much my mind has changed or the way my  
Lifes been rearranged I swore one thing Id never do was be to stay inclined  
  
Then you started messin with my mind The first in line for party time was me  
Always the last to leave or try to be I never thought Id want to change I
suited  
Me just fine then you started messin with my mind CHORUS
