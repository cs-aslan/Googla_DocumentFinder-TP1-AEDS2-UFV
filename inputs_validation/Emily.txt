Caught in an endless time  
Waiting for a sign  
To show you where to go  
Lost in a silent stare  
Looking anywhere  
For answers you dont know  
  
Chorus  
On the wire  
Balancing your dreams  
Hoping ends will meet their means  
You feel alone  
Uninspired  
Well does it help you to  
Know that I believe in you  
Youre an angel waiting for wingsEmily  
  
You going through this stage  
Its a restless age  
Young and insecure  
Sill there are doubts to fade  
Moments to be made  
And one of them is yours  
  
Chorus  
  
On the wire  
Balancing your dreams  
Hoping ends will meet their means  
But you feel alone  
Uninspired  
Oh does it help you to  
Know that I believe in you  
Youre an angel waiting for wings  
Oh youre an angel waiting for wingsEmily
