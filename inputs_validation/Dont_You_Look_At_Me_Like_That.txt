I still dream of you wakin up openin your eyes  
Like a little girl I once knew  
Walkin to the window lookin down on the street  
You walk with me and I walk with you  
  
Well I thought it all over it doesnt make any sense  
Why did it fall apart when it seemed so innocent  
You and I were like a light from a fallen star  
You cant go back you cant run away from your heart  
  
Chorus  
Dont you look at me like that cause I fall all over again  
And I just cant hold on to your love anymore  
Dont you look at me like that cause I start all over again  
And it just cant be like it was once before  
  
Dont stand there in the rain lookin like some long lost angel  
You and I were like a light from a fallen star  
You cant go back you cant run away from your heart  
  
Dont stand there in the rain lookin like some long lost angel  
No I never could turn away from you  
  
Chorus
