I feel like the dj is my bodyguard  
You see the way he keeps me safe  
With the treble and that bass  
I feel free enough to party hard  
This dress wont go to waste  
Feels like I own the place  
V I P to to be the boss  
You see the way these people stare  
Watching how I fling my hair  
Im a dancefloor lover  
Baby theres no other  
Who do it like I do it yeah

Verse 2  
Aint no reason to celebrate  
But you know we gon hav a ball Champagne spillin from the wall  
And Ill be partying til hella late  
But I aint worried not at all  
I just give my driver a call yeah
