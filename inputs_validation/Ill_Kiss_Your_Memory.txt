Maybe its been so long  
Our house looks kind of different  
But the empty rooms still mean the same to me  
And as I wander through the darkness  
Ill keep crying one last tear  
Now your lips are gone  
Ill kiss your memory  
  
Chorus  
Ill kiss your memory  
As though you were here  
Ill hold your memories till you reappear  
And as I wander through the darkness  
Ill keep crying one last tear  
Now your lips are gone  
Ill kiss your memory  
  
Ill kiss the thoughts of leaves that fell when summer was over  
And Ill cherish all the thoughts you gave to me  
And I will wander through the darkness  
Ill keep crying one last tear  
Now your lips are gone  
Ill kiss your memory  
  
Chorus
