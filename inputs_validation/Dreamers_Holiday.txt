Climb aboard a butterfly  
An take off on the breeze  
Let your worries flutter by  
An do the things you please  
In a land where dollar bills  
Are fallin off the trees  
On a dreamers holiday  
  
Every day for breakfast  
Theres a dish of scrambled stars  
An for lunchin youll be munchin  
Rainbow candy bars  
Youll be livin a la mode  
On Jupiter and Mars  
On a dreamers holiday  
  
Make it a long vacation  
Time there is plenty of  
You need no reservation  
Just bring along the one you love  
  
Help yourself to happiness  
An sprinkle it with mirth  
Close your eyes an concentrate  
An dream for all youre worth  
You will feel terrific  
When you get back down to earth  
From a dreamers holiday
