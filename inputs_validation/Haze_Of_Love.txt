Its three oclock in the morning  
Or maybe its four  
I am thinking of you  
Wondering what I should do  
  
But Im finally cutting through this haze  
Its four oclock in the morning  
Or maybe its five  
I think Im alive  
  
And I think Ill survive  
Im finally cutting through this haze of love  
Haze of love  
For days and days and days  
  
Im in a haze of love  
Yeah you dont love me like I love you  
All though you pretend  
I can see this will end  
  
Im finally cutting through this haze of love  
Haze of love  
For days and days and days  
Im in a haze of love  
  
Its five oclock in the morning  
Or maybe its six  
I am sick of your lies  
I am sick of your tricks  
  
Im finally cutting through this haze of love  
Haze of love  
For days and days and days  
For days and days and days  
  
For days and days and days  
Im in a haze of love
