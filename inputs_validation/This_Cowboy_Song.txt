We rode all night across an endless desert  
We had no moon to light our way  
And though a billion stars were slowly turning  
We lacked the consciences to pray  
Our horses running like devil chasers  
Those feet they hardly touched the ground  
Yes Im familiar with the grey wolves howling  
But Im certain I never heard this sound  
Devil to pay  
On judgement day  
Would Jesus strike me down  
If I should pray this cowboy song  
Its all I know  
To bring me back into your arms  
Your distant sun  
Your shining light  
Youll be my dog star shining  
Tonight  
Ive been the lowest of the low on the planet  
Ive been a sinner all my days  
And I was living with my hand on the trigger  
I had no sense to change my ways  
The priest asked if Id embrace the resurrection  
To suck the poison from my life  
Just like an existential cowboy villain  
His words were balanced on my knife  
Devil to pay  
On judgement day  
Would Jesus strike me down  
If I should pray  
This cowboy song  
Its all I know  
To bring me back into your arms  
Your distant sun  
Your shining light  
Youll be my dog star shining  
Tonight  
Every night  
Every night  
All my distances afar  
This cowboy song  
Its all I know  
To bring me back into your arms  
This cowboy song  
This cowboy life  
Ill be your dog star shining  
Tonight  
Dog star
