Silence is golden  
When the one that youre holding  
Means more then love words can say  
But what I dont hear  
From you makes me fear  
That our love is slipping away  
  
The quiets so loud  
It fills up the house  
With words that cant be set free  
So wholl break the curse  
And say the first word  
Well I dont know  
Were not talking you see  
  
Chorus  
Its another silent night  
Its a cold war of whos wrong or right  
Nobodys winning this unspoken fight  
Its another silent night  
  
If we could just talk  
And tear down the wall  
That stands there between our hearts  
We could put back together  
Our love for each other  
Before it all falls apart  
  
Chorus x2
