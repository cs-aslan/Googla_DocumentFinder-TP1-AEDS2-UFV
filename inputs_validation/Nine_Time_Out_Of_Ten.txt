Nine times out of ten baby Ive told you  
And I aint gonna tell you just nine times again  
Aah just how much I aim to hold you  
Again and again and again  
  
Little girl its nine times out of ten youve refused me  
And then say that you refuse me nine times again  
But I wont stop until you choose me  
Again and again and again  
  
Well dont try to fight it  
Cause its no use  
Youre gonna find that  
Im stubborn as a doggone mule  
  
Nine times out of ten Ive tried to kiss you  
And I aint trying just nine times again  
Well if I missed the nine times that Ive tried baby  
Ill bet my life Ill get you on number ten  
  
instr break  
  
Well dont try to fight it  
Come baby it aint no use  
Youre gonna find that  
Im stubborn as a doggone mule  
  
Nine times out of ten Ive tried to kiss you  
And I aint trying just nine times again  
Well if I missed the nine times that Ive tried baby  
Ill bet my life Ill get you on number ten
