Youve never driven through a red light  
Or let your mind leave your body  
Its pitch black in bed every night  
You set the clock right for the morning alarm  
Youve never wanted to start any fights  
Dont know a thing about tapping in on wires  
I fill the room with people  
But still you sit empty  
Stuck like putty  
I tried to teach you good rocknroll  
But you couldnt get over the old onetwo  
And nevertheless youll do  
Nevertheless youll do  
Nevertheless I do  
Youre getting up in the morning and put on your suit ca 055  
For the office and leave me  
You come home all pushed and pulled  
At sixthirty in the evening  
The television it takes you away  
To a pictureworld where I have no say in it  
I fill the room with people  
But still you sit empty  
Stuck like putty  
I tried to teach you good rocknroll  
But you couldnt get over the old onetwo  
And nevertheless youll do  
Nevertheless youll do  
Nevertheless I do
