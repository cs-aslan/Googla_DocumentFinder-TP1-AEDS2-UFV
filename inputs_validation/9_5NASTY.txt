One woman down my street is too hot for the average man  
Hard to handle a fire in her eyes wants the hot rocks right in her hand  
I know shes burning hot with love a come on look and she aint fooling  
And she knows just what it does  
She gave me a number to make me fell fine  
She said call me up baby its gonna be  
  
95 NASTY  
Youre everything I need  
Cause I want what youre giving  
Im yours to do with what you please  
NASTY  
Youre everything I need  
Cause I want what youre giving  
Im yours to do with what you please  
  
Ooh no mommas baby this child shes a killer wrapped in high heel shoes  
Touch the skin it burns like fire I dont even care if Im being used  
Threw me down and then she tore off my jeans  
She said come on baby I mean business  
Im gonna show you what liberated means  
Do it to me baby Im losing my mind  
She said call me up honey tonight Im

Some bad habits are hard to break  
Like an earthquake coming I gotta shake shake shake
