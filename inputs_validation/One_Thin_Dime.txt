Your minds made up  
Youre gonna leave  
Nothing I can say will stop you so it seems  
But before you up and go  
Theres just something you should know  
When you find that Im the one you still need  
  
Chorus  
One thin dime  
Is all it takes  
When you need someone who cares  
These arms of mine  
Are always open  
One thin dime is all you need  
And Ill be there  
  
Oh youre chasing rainbows and I understand  
When youre through Ill take you back again  
Ill be waiting patiently  
For when you come back to me  
Aint nobody else can love you like I can  
  
Chorus  
  
You know the number  
Im always home  
So honey just pick up and dial that telephone  
When this world treats you unkind  
Get your momma on the line  
There aint no need for you to ever be alone  
  
Chorus  
  
These arms of mine  
Oh theyre always open  
One thin dime is all you need  
And Ill be there
