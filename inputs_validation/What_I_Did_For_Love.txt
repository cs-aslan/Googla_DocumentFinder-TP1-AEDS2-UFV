Kiss today goodbye  
The sweetness and the sorrow  
Wish me luck the same to hoo you  
But I cant regret  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
Look my eyes are dry  
The gift was ours to borrow  
Its as if we always knew  
And I wont forget  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
Gone love is never gone  
As we travel on  
Loves what well remember  
  
Kiss today goodbye  
And point me toward tomorrow  
We did what we had to do  
Wont forget cant regret  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
What I did for love  
And I wont forget  
What I did for love  
  
Gone love is never gone  
As we travel on  
Loves what well remember  
  
Kiss today goodbye  
And point me toward tomorrow  
We did what we had to do  
Wont forget cant regret  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
What I did for love
