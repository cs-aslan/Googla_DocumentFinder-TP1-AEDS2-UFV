The warden threw a party in the county jail  
The prison band was there and they began to wail  
The band was jumpin down they began to swing  
You shouldve heard those jailbirds sing  
  
Lets rock everybody lets rock  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin to the Jailhouse Rock  
Well Spider Murphy played on the saxophone  
  
Little Joe was blowin on the slide trombone  
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash boom bang  
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang  
Lets rock everybody lets rock  
  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin to the Jailhouse Rock  
Well number fortyseven said to number three  
Youre the cutest jailbird I ever did see  
I sure could enjoy some of your company  
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me  
  
Lets rock everybody lets rock  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin to the Jailhouse Rock  
Well sad sack was a sittin on a block of stone  
  
When over in the corner weepin all alone  
The warden said buddy dont you be no square  
If you cant find a partner use a wooden chair  
Lets rock everybody lets rock  
  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin to the Jailhouse Rock  
Well Henry said to Bugs For Heavens sake  
No ones lookin nows our chance to make a break  
  
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said Nix nix  
I want to stick around a while and get my kicks  
Lets rock everybody lets rock  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin to the Jailhouse Rock
