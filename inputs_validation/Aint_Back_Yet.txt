I heard a song bout a ramblin man  
Bought a guitar and I started a band  
I got a gig at the local Am Vet  
And I was gone and I aint back yet yeah  
  
69 bored out and jacked up  
A quarter mile that was all it was  
I burned the cool off of that Corvette  
And I was gone and I aint back yet  
  
Lookin back at the moments black and white  
I wouldnt change a thing that changed my life  
For the worse for the better  
Man I was gone gone forever  
  
She was a cut offs pepper sauce queen  
Man we were matches and gasoline  
First taste of love never will forget  
I was gone and I aint back yet  
I was gone gone and I aint back yet  
  
Lookin back at the moments black white  
I wouldnt change a thing that changed my life  
For the worse for the better  
Man I was gone gone forever  
The laughs the smiles the trials the tears  
Its hard to hate what got me here  
What got me here  
  
She was a straight out of Hollywood smile  
We missed it all by a country mile  
Went out one night for some cigarettes  
And I was gone and I aint back yet  
  
I was gone gone and I aint back yet  
I was gone and I aint back aint back aint back  
Gone and I aint back yet  
I was gone and I aint back yet  
I was gone and I aint back yet  
I was gone gone and I aint back yet
