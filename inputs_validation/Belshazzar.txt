Well the bible tells us about a man  
Who ruled Babylon and all its land  
Around the city he built a wall  
And declared that Babylon would never fall  
He had concubines and wives  
He called his Babylon Paradise  
On his throne he drank and ate  
But for Belshazzar it was gettin late  
  
For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting  
His kingdom was divided couldnt stand  
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting  
His houses were built upon the sand  
  
Well the people feasted and drank their wine  
And praised the false gods of his time  
All holy things they scorned and mocked  
But suddenly all their mocking stopped  
For on the wall there appeared a hand  
Nothin else there was no man  
In blood the hand began to write  
And Belshazzar couldnt hide his fright  
  
For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting  
His kingdom was divided couldnt stand  
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting  
His houses were built upon the sand  
  
Well no one around could understand  
What was written by the mystic hand  
Belshazzar tried but couldnt find  
A man who could give him peace of mind  
But Daniel the prophet a man of God  
He saw the writing on the wall in blood  
Belshazzar asked him what it said  
And Daniel turned to the wall and read  
  
My friend youre weighed in the balance and found wanting  
Your kingdom is divided it cant stand  
Youre weighed in the balance and found wanting  
Your houses are built upon the sand
