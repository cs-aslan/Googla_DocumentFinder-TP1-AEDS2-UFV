All the talk shows you know geniouses and experts  
Looking to lay some blame  
Some on the left and some on the right  
Playing that controversy game  
Im not in a real cheery mood so I think Ill call them up  
And them em why dont you play some blues  
And both sides shut up  
  
But do we just love trouble  
Aint the world got enough  
Without yall stirrin it up  
  
I am from the old school  
Cowboy hat sure enough  
Too damn old to change horses now  
Cause I would probably fall off  
Im a little whiskey bent and slowed my roll  
And if you aint real sure about me  
Why dont you take it up with Gretchen and Tim  
Rockin Shawn Hannity  
  
But you just love trouble  
Aint the world got enough  
Without yall stirrin it up  
  
Back off  
  
So some celeb has teed yall off  
Well I get teed off too  
Why didnt you know that youre supposed  
To except our point of view  
I have learned at the school of hard knocks  
Things change quite a bit  
Folks get all jacked up  
I dont really give a Darn  
  
I got a little child and a fishing pole  
A can of worms and a boat  
Im goin down to the river now  
And let all my problems float  
Yeah Ive mellowed a lot  
And I dont jump into things like I used to  
Hey whatd you say  
Why you son of a gun  
Now see what you made me do  
  
I dont want no trouble  
Aint the world got enough  
Without yall stirrin it up  
  
Stirrin it up  
  
Let the pot simmer stirrin it up  
Let the dust settle stirrin it up  
Lets try and get along  
And itll be more better  
Stirrin it stirrin it stirrin it up  
Stirrin it up sick em Rush  
Stirrin it up jump in there Bill  
Stir it up Shawn  
Stirrin it up  
Stirrin it up
