You look out of your window  
Into the night  
Could be rain could be snow  
But it cant feel as cold as what youre feeling inside  
  
And all of your friends are either married vanished  
Or just left alone  
But thats no reason to just stop living  
Thats no excuse to just give in to a sad and lonely heart  
  
Dont forget to dance no no no  
Dont forget to smile  
Dont forget to dance no no no  
Forget it for a while  
  
Cause darling darling  
I bet you danced a good one in your time  
And if this were a party  
Id really make sure the next one would be mine  
Yes you with the broken heart  
  
Dont forget to dance no no no  
Dont forget to smile  
Dont forget to dance no no no  
Forget it for a while  
  
Dont forget to dance no no no  
Forget it for a while  
  
You walk down the street  
And all the young punks whistle at you  
A nice bit of old  
Just goes to show what you can achieve  
With the right attitude  
As you pass them by  
They whisper their remarks one to another  
And you give them the eye  
Even though you know that you could be their mother  
You do the thing you love the most  
What separates you from the rest  
And what you love to do the most  
And when they ask me how you dance  
I say that you dance real close  
  
Dont forget to dance no no no  
Dont forget to dance
