Shes gotta be beautiful nice thin waist

Verse 1  
I reminisce of all of the things that dont exist yet  
Like the breakfast on Sunday mornings after drunk sex  
Or when youre out with your girls and you send me a drunk text  
Saying Baby are you far want you to come closer to my heart  
I miss you girl whoever you are  
  
Hook  
Oh I miss you already  
And I just wanna kiss you already  
So come on come on come on  
If you are ready hurry up to the home  
You dont know I miss you already  
Girl I miss you yeah

Verse 2  
Pillow cases covered in traces of your makeup  
And if I ever cheat all Im gonna taste is your flavor real shit  
I dreamt about you last night I aint wanna wake up  
Even though I cant see you so far  
Lookin just like the the tint of my car

The crazy shit is you already knew what it was

To take my heart baby come claim mine  
Wont wait forever but I wait for you  
Dont take too long girl cause Im missin you
