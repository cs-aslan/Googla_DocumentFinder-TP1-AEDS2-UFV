Here am I a sinner free  
Pardoned by your majesty  
Love has led me into liberty  
Holy King upon the throne  
You made this heart your very own  
I feel like the leper whos been healed  
  
I have known a love so sweet  
A saving love that brings relief  
I healing love that makes the blind eye see  
King of love and Prince of Peace  
Your shepherds love is tending me  
A love that satisfies my deepest needs  
  
Lost and dirty yet you found me  
Stained by sin but you have cleansed me  
Can it be Im precious in Your sight  
What is man and who am I A child of God  
My Fathers pride  
What a joy to be the Lords delight  
  
Oh oh ohhhh How can it be  
How can it be that you would seek a friend in me  
How can it be that I am precious in Your sight
