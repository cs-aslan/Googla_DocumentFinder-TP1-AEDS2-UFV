Well if you ever said goodbye I wouldnt waste all of my time cryin  
I wouldnt sit home alone wonderin where I went wrong  
Id be rockin on outta of here baby faster that a rollin tear  
Aint no grass gonna grow under me when youre gone  
No I wont stay down for long  
  
Id hit the ground Id hit the ground runnin  
I know exactly what Id do honey  
Id hit the ground Id hit the ground runnin  
Id hit the ground runnin after you yeah  
  
Gonna stop in long enough for a couple of things I gotta pick up  
Like some pretty red flowers and a store bought card  
That say what I really feel that Ill need you and I always will  
And the three little words that used to come hard  
Then Id jump in back in my car  
  
Then Id hit the ground Id hit the ground runnin  
I know exactly what Id do honey  
Id hit the ground Id hit the ground runnin  
Id hit the ground runnin after you yeah  
  
There aint no doubt I aint that proud  
There aint no doubt about what Id do  
Id hit the ground hit the ground  
Id hit the ground runnin after you yes I would  
  
So if you gotta go baby I wont stop you  
And I wont sit around and miss you no no no  
Cause if you leave Im comin with you yeah  
Comin with you baby  
  
Id hit the ground Id hit the ground runnin  
I know exactly what Id do sugar  
Id hit the ground Id hit the ground runnin  
Id hit the ground runnin after you  
  
There aint no doubt I aint that proud  
There aint no doubt about what Id do  
Id hit the ground Id hit the ground  
Id hit the ground runnin after you
