Daniella  
Dont say be tender first  
And dont say teach me  
Before you get tied up for your first time  
Im not like that  
Im not so good you will want to  
Run away for us  
your black hair is like black hair  
Mine I promise is a jerks hair  
Your acne is like a pearl  
Mine I swear is a brimstone  
Im not like that  
How is it you thought I might be  
Im not like that  
Im not like that  
All Ill recall of you  
A sturdy tongue like a blistered toe
