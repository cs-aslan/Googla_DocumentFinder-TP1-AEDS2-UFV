Why am I strapped to this hospital bed  
  
First your eyes then your skin  
We will make you feel born again No More Me my friend  
  
A shiny scalpel is in the Masters hand  
His Wife has got the jars for Blood she keeps one near  
I fear for my life No More Me  
I fear there will be No More Me at all  
Is this goodbye sweet life  
  
AhhhhhScalpel cuts eyelids drop  
Into a jarIm crying Blood  
Fingers pull my eyeballs out  
Scissors snapI bleed a lot  
  
They set my eyes into this Puppets head  
And still my eyes can see Im looking back at myself  
And what I see is No More Me at all  
I have no eyes  
  
My veinsfeel like worms  
Drying in the sun this takes too long  
Stripping skin from all my bones  
Pain too strongmy senses they go numb  
  
All of my Blood is now in little jars  
I should be dead by now but I am still  
I am still alive inside my eyes  
And I see Emerencia throw my carcass in the trash
