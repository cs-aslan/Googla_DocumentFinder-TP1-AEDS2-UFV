My cousins gettin married at the Methodist church  
Thats why I stayed home from work  
Im supposed to hold the flowers  
When the new bride kisses the groom  
Thats what Im supposed to do  
So what are we doin with the windows rolled down  
Twenty five passionate miles from town  
I love er like a sister baby but to tell you the truth  
Id rather ride around with you  
  
The guy shes gonna marrys got money to burn  
His daddys a partner in some big law firm  
Yeah thats how theyre goin  
To Hawaii on their honeymoon  
First class to Honolulu  
She aint ever even set foot on a jet  
Im a little bit jealous I confess  
Id like to fly to Hawaii but honey if I had to choose  
Id rather ride around with you  
  
I dont care where this road goes  
No I dont wanna turn around  
Let go of the wheel and feel the wind blow  
Dont even think about slowin down  
  
Theyre tyin tin cans to the back of the car  
Wonderin where in the world we are  
The preachers done prayin  
And the couples done sayin I do  
That could be me and you  
Theres way too many decisions to make  
The length of the dress the layers on the cake  
One of these days I might get married too  
But Id rather ride around with you  
  
I dont care where this road goes  
No I dont wanna turn around  
Let go of the wheel and feel the wind blow  
Dont even think about slowin down
