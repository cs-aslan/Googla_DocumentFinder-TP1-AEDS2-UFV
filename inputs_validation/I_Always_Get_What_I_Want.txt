Every now and then we all want something  
Even if theres no way of gettin it  
If i stomach that thats the way it must be  
Be the way around it could I get myself around it  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause Im a big shot  
  
dont want to always have to be so nice  
dont want to hear you say well thats just life  
I dry out when I open my mouth  
I make my way around it make my way around it  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause Im a big shot  
  
So give me what I want  
I always get what I want  
dont want to see me red  
If I dont get what I want  
thats not what you want  
  
Im not about to take no for an answer  
no  
If I tell you I cant Im still gonna go  
I did it all by myself  
I found my way around it  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause Im a big shot  
So give me what I want  
I always get what I want  
dont want to see me red  
If I dont get what I want  
thats not what you want  
  
Its not to lovely  
It could start to get ugly  
It really bugs me  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause Im a big shot  
So give me what I want  
I always get what I want  
dont want to see me red  
If I dont get what I want  
thats not what you want
