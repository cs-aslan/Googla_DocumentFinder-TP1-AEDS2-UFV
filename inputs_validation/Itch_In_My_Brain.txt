You got to stop its much too deep for me  
I was mistaken yes I dont understand  
And my decision if I choose not to choose  
Theres nobody on this line but me  
I got a free will that I aint even used yet  
I got a free will and I aint gonna use it  
til I know what Im doing  
Theres an itch in my brain and I cant get at it  
Theres an itch in my brain and I cant get at it  
Theres an itch in my brain and I cant get at it  
And I cant stop thinking til I scratch it  
Im still dancing Im just a change machine  
Dont have to tell me Im only waving my arms  
But theres so much smoke and so little fire  
And theres nobody on this line but me  
I got a free will and its making me crazy  
I got a free will and I aint gonna use it  
til I know what Im doing  
I got a free will and Im dying to keep it  
I got a free will and I aint gonna use it  
til I know what Im doing
