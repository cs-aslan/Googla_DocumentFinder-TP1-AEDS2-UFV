You dont need a lot of money  
Honey you dont have to play no games  
All I need is all your loving  
To get the blood rushing through my veins  
Huh  
I wanna say were going steady  
Ha  
Like its 1954  
No  
It doesnt have to be forever  
Just as long as Im the name  
On your tattooed heart  
  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
  
You dont need to worry about making me crazy  
Cause Im way past that  
Eh and so just call me if you want me  
Cause you got me and Ill show you how much I wanna be  
On your tattooed heart  
  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
  
Just as long as Im  
The name on your tattooed heart  
  
Wrap me in your jacket  
My baby  
And lay me in your bed  
And kiss me underneath the moonlight  
Darling let me trace the lines on your tattooed heart  
  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
  
Just as long as Im the name on your tattooed heart
