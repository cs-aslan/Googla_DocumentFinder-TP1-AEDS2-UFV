Well I just washed my car  
And I think its gonna rain  
Im not gonna quiver or complain  
And I just smashed my hand on its  
Stupid metal frame thats enough to drive us all insane  
Nothing to sort out and nothing to do right  
Always a thorn in my side and its not right  
So complicated were tired and unpaid  
Tough to admit it accept it not my day  
And now Im just a target  
Id bridge to word it so Im just standing where I just dont know  
I know Im not for you  
And I should be asking how should I stay asleep  
Or brave it now  
Nothing to sort out and nothing to do right  
Always a thorn in my side and its not right  
So complicated were tired and unpaid tough  
Tough to admit it accept it not my day
