Far from the evergreen of old Assam  
Far from the rainfall on the trails of old Saigon  
straight from the poster town of scorn and ritz  
To bring you the wilder side of gold and glitz  
  
But neon tiger theres a lot on your mind  
They promised just to pet you but dont you let them get you  
Away away away  
Under the heat of the southwest sun  
  
Took to the spotlight like a diamond ring  
Came from the woodwork and the hopes they might  
Redeem themselves from poor decisions to win big  
  
But neon tiger theres a lot on your mind  
Strategize to maim you but dont you let them tame you  
Youre far too pure and bold  
To suffer the strain of the pain thats old  
  
I dont wanna be kept I dont wanna be caged I dont wanna be damned oh hell  
I dont wanna be broke I dont wanna be saved I dont wanna be SOL  
Give me rolling hills so tonight can be the night that I send them up a
thousand thrills  
Can you cut me some slack Cause I dont wanna go back I want the new day and
age  
  
Come on girls and boys everyone make some noise  
  
Run neon tiger theres a price on your head  
Theyll put you down and cut you Ill never let them touch you  
Away away away  
Oh Im gonna need a neon tiger roar  
  
Under the heat of  
Under the heat of  
Under the heat of the southwest sun  
  
Neon tiger  
Theres a lot on your mind
