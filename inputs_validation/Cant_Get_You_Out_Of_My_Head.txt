I just cant get you out of my head  
Boy your loving is all I think about  
I just cant get you out of my head  
Boy its more than I dare to think about  
  
La la la  
La la la la la  
  
I just cant get you out of my head  
Boy your loving is all I think about  
I just cant get you out of my head  
Boy its more than I dare to think about  
  
Every night  
Every day  
Just to be there in your arms  
  
Wont you stay  
Wont you lay  
Stay forever and ever and ever and ever  
  
La la la

I just cant get you out of my head  
Boy your loving is all I think about  
I just cant get you out of my head  
Boy its more than I dare to think about  
  
Theres a dark secret in me  
Dont leave me locked in your heart  
  
Set me free  
Feel the need in me  
Set me free  
Stay forever and ever and ever and ever  
  
La la la  
La la la la la

La la la la la  
  
I just cant get you out of my head  
I just cant get you out of my head  
I just cant get you out of my head
