Stop stop going around  
With the girl that I love  
Shes already taken  
Shes all sewn up  
Itll only end in tears  
Shell only break your heart  
If my fist doesnt get you  
Before she tears you apart  
  
Stop stop going places  
Where you know that she goes  
Ive heard all the stories  
Its just another pose  
Youll only get rejected  
Just when you think youve scored  
And when you think youve made it  
Shell be walking through that door  
  
Every little now  
And every little then  
Toe to toe with my best friend  
Arm in arm in luxury  
Heaven knows you wont see me  
Again  
  
Well  
Youd better be careful  
With the things that you say  
Your mouth will get you in trouble  
One of these days  
I know you dont believe me  
And I know it seems absurd  
But it just goes to show  
How little you know that girl  
  
Every little now  
And every little then  
Toe to toe with my best friend  
Arm in arm in luxury  
Heaven knows you wont see me  
Again
