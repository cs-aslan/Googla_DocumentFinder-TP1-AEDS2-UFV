Well your CD collection looks shiny and costly  
How much did you pay for your bad Moto Guzzi  
And how much did you spend on your black leather jacket  
Is it you or your parents in this income tax bracket  
  
Now tickets to concerts and drinking at clubs  
Sometimes for music that you havent even heard of  
And how much did you pay for your rocknroll t shirt  
That proves you were there  
  
That you heard of them first  
How do you afford your rocknroll lifestyle  
How do you afford your rocknroll lifestyle  
How do you afford your rocknroll lifestyle  
  
Ah tell me  
How much did you pay for the chunk of his guitar  
The one he ruthlessly smashed at the end of the show  
And how much will he pay for a brand new guitar  
  
One which hell ruthlessly smash at the end of another show  
And how long will the workers keep building him new ones  
As long as their soda cans are red white and blue ones  
And how long will the workers keep building him new ones  
  
As long as their soda cans are red white and blue ones  
Aging black leather and hospital bills  
Tattoo removal and dozens of pills  
Your liver pays dearly now for youthful magic moments  
  
But rock on completely with some brand new components  
How do you afford your rocknroll lifestyle  
How do you afford your rocknroll lifestyle  
How do you afford your rocknroll lifestyle  
  
Excess aint rebellion  
Youre drinking what theyre selling  
Your selfdestruction doesnt hurt them  
Your chaos wont convert them  
  
Theyre so happy to rebuild it  
Youll never really kill it  
Yeah excess aint rebellion  
Youre drinking what theyre selling  
  
Excess aint rebellion  
Youre drinking  
Youre drinking  
Youre drinking what theyre selling
