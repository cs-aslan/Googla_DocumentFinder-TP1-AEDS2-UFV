This morning as I watched a bird  
Just spread its wings and fly  
It was then a thought came over me  
And I wondered why cant I  
Oh why oh why cant I  
  
If I could only fly you see  
A lot of problems would be gone  
When you think of just  
How much Id save on shoes alone  
If I could only fly  
  
I would never tear my clothes  
Climbing in and out of trees  
If I could only fly Id never crawl  
Or wear holes in my knees  
If I could only fly  
  
How Id love to spread my wings  
And streak across the sky  
Id be off to see the world  
If I could only fly  
  
But Id always come right back
