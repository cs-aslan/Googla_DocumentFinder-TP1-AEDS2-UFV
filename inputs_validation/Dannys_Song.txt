People smile and tell me Im the lucky one and weve just begun  
Think Im gonna have a son  
He will be like she and me as free as a dove conceived in love  
Sun is gonna shine above  
  
And even though we aint got money Im so in love with ya honey  
And everything will bring a chain of love  
And in the morning when I rise you bring a tear of joy to my eyes  
And tell me everything is gonna be alright  
  
Seems as though a month ago I beta chi never got high

And everything will bring a chain of love  
And in the morning when I rise you bring a tear of joy to my eyes  
And tell me everything is gonna be alright  
  
Pisces Virgo rising is a very good sign strong and kind  
And the little boy is mine

And everything will bring a chain of love  
And in the morning when I rise you bring a tear of joy to my eyes  
And tell me everything is gonna be alright  
  
Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup drink it up  
Love her and shell bring you luck  
And if you find she helps your mind buddy take her home  
Dont you live alone try to earn what lovers own  
  
And even though we aint got money Im so in love with ya honey  
And everything will bring a chain of love  
And in the morning when I rise you bring a tear of joy to my eyes  
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
