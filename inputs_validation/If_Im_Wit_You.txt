I dont understand  
I do all this for you  
You contemplating on me  
Or is it him  
Or is it me  
Or is it him  
He told you hed be there for you  
And he wasnt  
I told you Id be there for you  
And I was  
And still is the real is  
Who takes care of biz  
Took you from apartments  
And got you home like The Wiz  
Im not the kind of guy  
To give you everything  
But if youre real then  
You can get some ice in your rings  
You and me straight to the crib  
Off the tour bus  
Spottin my eyes fireplace big as us  
It really dont matter  
Whos first in the shower  
Fruit platter from a young maid every hour  
And when it comes down to the dollar  
You can have it  
All ya gotta do is keep it hoppin like a rabbit  
Friends come around dont be ready to change  
Treat me like a stepchild when Im up on my game  
Remember Im the first to give your cootie the pain  
So I wanna hear you answer when I ask you my name  
  
Ooh baby I want you here with me  
And give you everything  
That your heart desires  
Lady can you feel me  
Do you wanna be with me for always  
Baby cant you see  
What you do to me  
when he do the things that he has done to you baby  
  
Chorus  
You dont need nobody to love you  
You dont need nobody to kiss you  
You dont need nobody to please you ooh babe  
Cause I can do those things if Im wit you baby  
  
Now who took you in when that nigga put you out  
And who picked you up when that nigga put you down  
Restraining orders keep that fool from around  
Had to set you up in a spot downtown  
See I was the one who was there for you  
But Im not the one thats gonna play the two  
Channel bags in the trunk what you gon do  
You could treat the future like a menu  
As long as Im the only one to bend you  
And when you wanna take a flight Im the one to send you  
Never be the one thats out to hurt you  
Tell you that Im there and then desert you  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Baby cant you see  
What you do to me  
When he do the things he do to you baby  
  
Chorus
