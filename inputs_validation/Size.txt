Do not think of me alive do not think of me as dead  
Get that thought right out of your head  
Fifty times you told me so to satisfy  
I must grow but all you did was pull or blow  
  
If size isnt everything and Im half his size  
How come its him who gets to keep the prize  
But you fuck long and you fuck slow  
But you fuck like a walrus smoking blow  
Im too ashamed to scream your name  
Well I dont feel hard and I dont feel lame  
Never proud and never ashamed  
But this beds too big for the both of us  
  
If size isnt everything well Ill slap my thighs  
But there wont be parting and there wont be cries  
If size isnt everything then try this size  
Turn off the lights and bring a torch  
  
Oh my hearts in the right place  
My hearts in the right place  
My hearts in the right place  
My hearts in the right place  
And my hearts twice the size of his arse  
  
So if size isnt everything then try this size  
Turn off the lights and bring a torch  
And if size isnt everything and Im half his size  
How come its him who gets to keep the prize  
How come its him who gets to keep the prize  
  
How come its him who gets to keep the prize
