I I should know  
You shouldnt have to tell me  
Sometimes its the way we feel  
Or the way we feel we feel  
Pretty bad  
In a double dare  
Hes got wandering eyes  
And I see em look at you  
Looking straight at you  
But I know where they are  
Ill walk you home  
You take as long as it takes  
The sun in the morning sky  
In the morning sky well know where we are  
Well know where we are
