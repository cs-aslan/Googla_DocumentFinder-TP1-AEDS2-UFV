You see me on the street well you guess Im doing fine  
Oh but its fantasy baby almost all the time  
Ive got to get away by myself  
Oh the way its going soon be needing help  
Cause Im just a man doing the best I can  
Dont you understand I just want some peace of mind  
  
You see me on the stage doing my job  
I learn to do it well keep on singing the song  
But sometimes it gets so lonely out there  
When youre on the road and youre going nowhere  
Because Im just a man oh I aint got no plans  
Dont you understand Im just trying to find some peace of mind  
  
I have to stand in line baby when Im in queue  
I got to do it all just the same as you  
Got my doubts about it oh but I try  
Oh make it work with tears in my eyes  
Because Im just a man only trying to do the best I can  
  
Dont you understand I want some peace of mind  
Oh Im just a man baby I aint got no plan  
Oh dont you understand got to get some peace of mind  
  
Oh got to get got to get some peace of mind  
Oh got to get got to get some peace of mind  
Got to get got to get some peace of mind  
Got to got to got to get got to get get some peace of mind  
  
Got to get got to get get some peace of mind  
Get me some get me some get me some get me some peace of mind  
Get me some get me some peace of mind  
Get me some baby get me some peace of mind
