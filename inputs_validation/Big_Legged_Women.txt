I love the tip I love the top I love you better than a hog loves slop  
Cause youre a big legged woman with a short short miniskirt  
Promise me darlin youll never make me feel like dirt  
Just like the vine goes around the stump you are mine call me sugar lump  
Cause youre a biglegged woman with a short short miniskirt  
Promise me darlin youll never make me feel like dirt  
Ive told you once Ive told you twice we go together like fried beans and
rice  
Cause youre a big legged woman with a short short miniskirt  
Promise me darlin youll never make me feel like dirt  
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust you mess with my woman Im gonna hurt you
first  
Cause shes a biglegged woman with a short short miniskirt  
Promise me darlin youll never make me feel like dirt  
I love my biglegged woman I love my biglegged woman  
I love my biglegged woman I love my biglegged woman  
I love my biglegged woman I love my biglegged woman  
Shes alright shes alright

Shes alright shes alright
