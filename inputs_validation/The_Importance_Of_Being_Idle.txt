I sold my soul for the second time cause the man dont pay me  
I begged my landlord for some more time he said Son the bills waiting  
My best friend called me the other night he said Man are you crazy  
My girlfriend told me to get a life she said Boy you lazy  
  
But I dont mind as long as theres a bed beneath the stars that shine  
Ill be fine  if you give me a minute a mans got a limit  
I cant get a life if my hearts not in it  
  
Solo  
  
I dont mind as long as theres a bed beneath the stars that shine  
Ill be fine  if you give me a minute a mans got a limit  
I cant get a life if my hearts not in it  
  
I lost my faith in the summertime cause it dont stop raining  
The sky all day is black as night but I know I cant blame me  
I begged my Doctor for one more line he said Son words fail me  
There aint no place to be killing time I guess Im just lazy  
  
I dont mind as long as theres a bed beneath the stars that shine  
Ill be fine  if you give me a minute a mans got a limit  
I cant get a life if my hearts not in it
