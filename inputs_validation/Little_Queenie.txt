I got lumps in my throat  
When I saw her comin down the aisle  
I got the wiggles in my knees  
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled  
Well there she is again  
Standin over by the record machine  
Well she looks like a model  
On the cover of a magazine  
But shes too cute  
To be a minute over seventeen  
  
Meanwhile I was thinkin  
  
Well if shes in the mood  
No need to break it  
I got the chance and I oughta take it  
If she can dance we can make it  
Cmon queenie lets shake it  
  
I said go go go little queenie  
I said go go go little queenie  
I said go go go little queenie  
  
Wont someone tell me  
Whos the queen standin over by the record machine  
Well she looks like a model  
On the cover of a magazine  
But shes too cute  
To be a minute over seventeen  
  
I said go go go little queenie  
I said go go go little queenie  
I said go go go little queenie  
  
Meanwhile I was still thinkin hmmmm  
Well if its a slow one  
Well omit it  
If its a rocker then well get it  
If its a good one shell admit it  
Cmon queenie lets get with it  
  
Repeat x6  
I said go go go little queenie
