Oh such a stranger you dont even know me  
Its just as though we never even met  
Oh such a stranger you dont even see me  
Tell me was I that easy to forget  
Dont you remember please wont you try  
Was it that long ago you brought tears to my eyes  
Oh such a stranger were not even friends  
Dont you even remember me when  
Oh such a stranger were not even friends  
Dont you even remember me when
