Verse One Tamika  
The snow is falling like I knew it would  
Carolers are already singing  
Last year is all that I can think about  
Everytime I hear sleigh bells ringing  
Bridge Tamika  
But I know  
That when summer came I pushed you away  
I should have never let you go no  
Now all Im really trying to say is  
Chorus  
I want you to come home  
I know that there wont be a christmas without you  
I miss you so much  
Youre all that I want  
I know that there wont be a christmas without you  
I miss you come home  
Verse Two Kandi  
I remember all the love we made  
I miss your stocking on the fireplace  
Underneath the mistletoe we stayed  
Twas a very special holiday  
Repeat Bridge Tiny  
Repeat Chorus  
Verse Three LaTocha  
Theres a fire thats still burning in my heart tonight  
Theres no reason why we both should be alone  
Its the night before Christmas  
And Im waiting here for you to come home come home  
Repeat Chorus to fade
