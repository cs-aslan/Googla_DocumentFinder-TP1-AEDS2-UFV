Oh city shine on tomorrow  
For today I feel rain  
There is a decent moon  
Now I lay me down in the light  
  
My mans afraid no communication  
Im sure life in my arms aint been free  
Is it a sacrifice to love me now  
Are you alright  
  
Will you take my hand so Im not alone  
Youre the road I need to lead me home babyforever  
Will you be my friend will you walk with me  
Can we wash away the history that clouds our love  
What came before surely wont be  
Theres a clean rain fallin over me  
  
I know I cried after what you told me  
You said youre not sure where this love is going  
Why would you hesitate if you really love me now  
Are you alright  
  
Will you take my hand youre the road I need to lead me homeforever  
Will you be my friend will you walk with me  
Can we wash away the history that clouds our love  
What came before surely wont be  
  
Hey weve been running too long lets settle down  
Gotta keep our head above water  
Take a look around  
How long will you wait for me  
How long will you wait for me  
  
Repeat Chorus
