Yeah eh yeah yeah  
  
I can feel a phoenix inside of me  
As I march alone to a different beat  
Slowly slowing down my fear  
Yeah yeah  
  
I am ready for the road less traveled  
Suiting up for my crowning battle  
This test is my own cross to bare  
But I will get there  
  
Its never easy to be chosen  
Never easy to be called  
Standing on the front line when the bombs start to fall  
I can see the Heavens  
But I still hear the flames calling out my name  
  
I can see the writing on the wall  
I cant ignore this war  
At the end of it all  
Who am I living for  
  
I can feel this light thats inside of me  
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning  
I know one spark will shock the world  
Yeah yeah  
  
So I pray for favor like Ester  
I need Your strength to handle the pressure  
I know there will be sacrifice  
But thats the price  
  
Its never easy to be chosen  
Never easy to be called  
Standing on the front line when the bombs start to fall  
I can see the Heavens  
But I still hear the flames calling out my name  
  
I can see the writing on the wall  
I cant ignore this war  
At the end of it all  
Who am I living for  
  
I can see the writing on the wall  
I cant ignore this war  
At the end of it all  
Who am I living for  
  
At the end at the end  
Who am I living for  
  
At the end at the end  
Who am I living for  
  
Heavy is the head that wears the crown  
Dont let the greatness get you down  
Heavy is the head that wears the crown  
Dont let the greatness get you down  
  
Oh yeah  
  
I can see the writing on the wall  
I cant ignore this war  
At the end of it all  
Who am I living for  
  
I can see the writing on the wall  
I cant ignore this war  
At the end of it all  
Who am I living for  
  
At the end at the end  
Who am I living for  
At the end at the end  
Who am I living for
