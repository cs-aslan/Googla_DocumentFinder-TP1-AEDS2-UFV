Tumbling curls of green by stained glass streaming light  
And a yellow colored lampshade used to keep us up all night  
And the smile upon your face a tear upon your cheek  
And the night sky on the window your heart calling out to me  
Come running home again Katie come running home again  
Cross my heart and hope to die shall I cause another tear from your eye  
The mirror that wont talk and your nightgown on the door  
The old pedal singer just wont sing no more  
You can roll the reel for hours from the movie from this book  
Its a question mark upon this heart of mine sends an elder back to look  
Come running home again Katie come running home again  
Cross my heart and hope to die shall I cause another tear from your eye  
Now Im looking through a tunnel back into this room  
with the genius of the Druid when the sunlight floods the tomb  
And Im never going back there I wouldnt any way  
Cause though I made the great escape I never got away  
Come running home again Katie come running home again  
Cross my heart and hope to die shall I cause another tear from your eye
