Surely this cant be heaven  
Though it feels like I died  
I guess its just goodbye then  
Theres nowhere left to hide  
Cant you see you have the power  
  
To make or break my day  
Im getting weaker by the hour  
All the time you stay away  
  
Im so in alone I feel so lonely  
Here on my own Ive lost my way  
I never dreamt that it could hurt like this boy  
Lost in the absence of your precious kiss  
Why do I feel this pain  
Loves just a dangerous game  
  
So where do I go from here  
What do I have to do  
Something to make you realize  
Just how I feel for you  
  
Dont you see you have the power  
To make or break my day  
Im getting weaker by the hour  
Do you hear me when I say  
  
Im so in alone I feel so lonely  
Here on my own Ive lost my way  
I never dreamt that it could hurt like this boy  
Lost in the absence of your precious kiss  
Why do I feel this pain  
Loves just a dangerous game  
  
But the feeling still remains  
And the embers feed the flame  
How I hope you feel the same  
So I love will grow again  
  
Its only you see you have the power  
To make or break my day  
Im getting weaker by the hour  
Cant you hear me say  
I cant face the world today  
  
Im so in alone I feel so lonely  
Here on my own Ive lost my way  
I never dreamt that it could hurt like this boy  
Lost in the absence of your precious kiss  
Why do I feel this pain  
Loves just a dangerous game
