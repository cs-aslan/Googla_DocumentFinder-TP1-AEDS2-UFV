Walking slow down the avenue  
Through my old neighborhood  
Dont know why Im happy  
Ive got no reason to feel this good  
Maybe its because Im all alone  
And Ive got no place to go  
And everywhere I look I see  
Another person Ill never know  
  
I got a thing or two to say  
Before I walk on by  
Im feeling good today  
But if die a little farther along  
Im trusting everyone to carry on  
  
Pretty little girl  
Running up and down the street with no shoes on  
I got a pretty little girl of my own at home  
Sometimes we forget we love each other  
And we fight for no reason  
I dont know what Ill do if she ever leaves me alone  
  
I got a thing or two to say  
Before I walk on by  
Im feelin good today  
But if I die a little farther along  
Im trustin everyone to carry on  
  
Im puttin down my left foot  
Im puttin down my right foot  
  
I got a thing or two to say  
Before I walk on by  
Im feelin good today  
But if I die a little father along  
Im trusting everyone to carry on
