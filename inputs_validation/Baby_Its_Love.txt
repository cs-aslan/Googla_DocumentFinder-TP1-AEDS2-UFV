I should run away boy  
But Im satisfied  
Its your way of loving  
Thats filling my desires  
  
Baby when youre gone  
I wonder why you turn me on  
Ooh you must be the only man for me  
Cause youre the only one I see  
  
Its love ooh baby its love  
Baby its love makes me weep for you  
  
I love your affection  
Take me in the right direction  
For the rest of my life  
  
Im a slave for your love  
Just like mama said  
I should be without you  
But losing you Im dead  
  
Your love is so tough  
I swear I just cant get enough  
Speaking to you with all sincerity  
You dont know what you do to me  
  
Its love ooh baby its love  
Baby its love makes me weep for you  
  
I love your affection  
Take me in the right direction  
For the rest of my life  
  
Thanks a lot for your affection  
Always wanting your protection  
For the rest of my life  
  
Its love ooh baby its love  
Baby its love makes me weep for you  
  
Thanks a lot for your affection  
Always wanting your protection  
For the rest of my life  
Baby for the rest of my life  
Baby baby baby baby  
For the rest of my life  
Baby always wanting your protection
