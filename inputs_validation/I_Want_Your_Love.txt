Verse 1  
Do you feel like you ever want  
To try my love and see how well it fits  
Baby cant you see when you look at me  
I cant kick this feeling when it hits  
Oh all alone in my bed at night  
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight  
I think of you and I dream of you all of the time  
What am I gonna do  
  
Chorus  
I want your love I want your love want your love you know I need your love  
I want your love I want your love want your love you know I need your love  
  
PostChorus  
I need your love I need your love  
I need your love I need your love  
I need your love I need your love  
  
Verse 2  
Ill share my dreams  
And make you see  
How really bad your love I need  
I want your love I need your love  
Just like the birds in the sky above  
Ill share my dreams  
And make you see  
How really bad your love I need  
Ill share my dreams  
And make you see  
How really bad your love I need
