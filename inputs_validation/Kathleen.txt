Its plain to see the sun wont shine today  
But I aint in the mood for sunshine anyway  
Maybe Ill go insane  
I got to stop the pain  
Or maybe Ill go down to see Kathleen  
  
A swallow comes and tells me of her dreams  
She says shed like to know just what they mean  
I feel like I could die  
As I watch her flying by  
Ride the north wind down to see Kathleen  
  
Stars hang high above the oceans roar  
The moon is come to lead me to her door  
Theres crystal across the sand  
And the waves they take my hand  
Soon Im gonna see my sweet Kathleen  
  
Soon Im gonna see my sweet Kathleen
