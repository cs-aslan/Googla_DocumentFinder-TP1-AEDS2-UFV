The wind was howling  
Dogs were sleeping  
I had to bite my tongue  
Looking down the street  
I was hanging on  
Eighty floors above the ground  
Suffering vertigo  
Got me a date with a drug store blond  
With a cure I know  
She picks me up when Im coming down  
Kicks on the street  
Its a shot in the arm  
Get your kicks on the street  
Cant do any harm  
Cant put me on a drip feed  
Under state control  
I put a razor to my face  
And the steel is cold  
It aint going to take me too long before I get revived  
Im traveling incognito  
Dont want to be identified  
They dress you up  
They strip you down  
Aint going to find me falling asleep behind the drivers wheel  
You get me intoxicated  
Thats the way I feel  
I cant break the ice  
Shrinks in the heat  
Falling like an acrobat and landing on my feet  
She picks me up when Im coming down
