Are you ready  
Ad libbed  
You think you can tell us what to do You think you can tell us what to  
Wear  
You think that youre better Well you better get ready  
Bow to the masters  
Break it down  
Degenerate into something fool  
We just got tired of doin what ya told us to do  
Thats a brace boy yeah  
Thats a brace little man  
Break it down  
Chorus  
Degeneration X  
Degeneration  
Think you can tell me what to do  
You know who yer talkin to  
Well you better get used  
To the way the ball bounces  
I see what you got  
It measures in ounces  
Thats a brace boy Yeah  
Thats a brace Little Man  
Break it down  
Chorus  
Think your a big man

Treat you like your a little man  
Yo tell me what its like to be half a man  
It must break your heart  
To see what I am but

Chourus  
Degeneration X part doubles  
Think you can tell me what to do

Just stop wanting me to be someone else  
Put it away like a book on a shelf  
That you cant read boy Yeah

Break it down  
Chorus  
Repeats and fades towards the end
