To hold you  
Love you  
To see you smile at the break of day  
To touch you  
Know you  
Want you by me when youre far away  
  
Its easy to say  
But hard to do  
When youre in love  
With a foolish child  
And everybody  
Just cant understand  
They say see him watch him  
He will change his mind  
  
But I see you  
Want him  
Youre always with him  
When the lights go down  
You need him  
Love him  
He promises  
Hell always stay around  
  
Its easy for me  
When the daylights here  
Its easy to be happy  
When Im in the crowd  
But maybe someday  
I could take his place  
I want you need you  
I wont change my mind  
  
But he holds you  
Loves you  
He has you with him  
Loves you  
  
But he holds you  
Loves you  
He has you with him  
Loves you  
At the break of day  
Hell touch you  
Know you  
Wants you by him  
When youre far away  
  
If all these things you say are true  
Theres one thing I need to know  
Is this love or lies just a flame or a fire  
Theres something I need and only you can help  
  
To hold you  
Love you  
See you smile  
At the break of day  
  
To touch you  
Know you  
Want you by me  
When youre far away  
  
To hold you  
Love you  
Have you with me  
When the lights go down  
  
To see you  
Need you  
Promise me  
Youll always stay around
