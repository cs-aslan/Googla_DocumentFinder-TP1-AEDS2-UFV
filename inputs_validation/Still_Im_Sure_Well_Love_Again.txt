There was a piano  
We use to play And spend the time  
Til we found it was love  
Hidding inside us Can not separate us  
  
Theres a flame of love  
Searching in the dark Its there to guide us  
But through the days beyond the haze  
I can see you reaching out to hold me  
  
Reff   
Still Im sure well love again  
Its a matter of time  
I will belong to you You belong to me  
How can I convince you girl  
That Im stuck on you Cant find another heart  
I love you more each day I love you more each day  
  
Never though never cross my mind  
You gave everything You ask me just holding on  
If I could just walk away  
To love again with somebody new  
  
Too many memories  
Release the passion inside And set them free  
But through the days beyond the haze  
I can see you reaching out to hold me  
Back to Reff
