Cant get down Ive seen the light  
I made the choice and chose the right  
Ill put in trust take out the hate  
Dont tell me I cant cause I have faith  
I have faith in people they have faith in me  
I have faith in my society  
If youve got a problem put your trust in me  
Ill never pretend that I cant see  
I have faith in the human race  
The worlds got problems  
The worlds got fears  
But my trust in people  
Makes me not scared  
The worlds got riots  
The worlds got fights  
But I trust people will see the light
