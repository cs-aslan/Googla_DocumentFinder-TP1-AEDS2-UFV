It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters  
And make fun of our exes uh uh uh uh  
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight  
To fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh  
Yeah  
Were happy free confused and lonely at the same time  
Its miserable and magical oh yeah  
Tonights the night when we forget about the deadlines its time uh oh  
  
I dont know about you but Im feeling 22  
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you  
You dont know about me but I bet you want to  
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like were 22 22  
  
It seems like one of those nights  
This place is too crowded too many cool kids uh uh uh uh  
It seems like one of those nights  
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming instead of sleeping  
Yeah  
Were happy free confused and lonely in the best way  
Its miserable and magical oh yeah  
Tonights the night when we forget about the heartbreaks its time uh oh  
  
I dont know about you but Im feeling 22  
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you  
You dont know about me but I bet you want to  
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like were 22 uh uh ah ah
