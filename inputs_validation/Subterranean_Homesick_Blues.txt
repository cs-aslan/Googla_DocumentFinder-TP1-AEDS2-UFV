Johnnys in the basement mixing up the medicine  
Im on the pavement thinking about the government  
The man in the trench coat badge out laid off  
Says hes got a bad cough wants to get it paid off  
God knows when but youre doin it again  
You better duck down the alleyway lookinfor a new friend  
The man in the coonskin cap by the big pen  
Wants eleven dollar bills you only got ten  
Look out kid  
Look out kid its somethin that you did  
Look out kid cause they keep all hid  
Maggie comes fleet foot face full of black soot  
Talkin at the heat put plants in the bed but  
The phones tapped anyway Maggie says that many say  
They must bust in early may  
Orders from the DA  
Walk on your tip toes dont try no doz  
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose  
Keep a clean nose watch the plain clothes  
You dont need a weather man to know which way the wind blows  
Look out kid  
Look out kid its somethin that you did  
Look out kid cause they keep all hid  
Looks to me like you did  
A little to much hittin kid  
You shouldve took it to the bridge  
Before you started to skid  
Look out kid  
The good god willin well bebop to Bob Dylan  
Chillin em thrillin em and red hot killin em  
Killin em  
Get sick get well hand around a ink well  
Ring bell hard to tell if anything is goin to sell  
Try hard get barred get back write braille  
Get jailed jump bail join the army if you fail  
But users cheaters six time losers  
Hand around the theaters  
Girl by the whirlpool lookin for a new fool  
Dont follow leaders watch the parkin meters  
Look out kid  
Look out kid its somethin that you did  
Look out kid cause they keep all hid
