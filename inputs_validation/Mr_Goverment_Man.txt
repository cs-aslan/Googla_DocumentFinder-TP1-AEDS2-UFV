Well I was driving around tryin to find a place to get a beer and some
cigarettes  
Pullin up behind me not afraid to flirt theres a girl in a red corvette  
I saw in her face that she wanted to race so I let my car outta jail  
Man I blew it before I knew it the feds were on my tail  
I knew it was trouble didnt wanna stop I couldnt forget that girl  
My dashboards slick from alcohol and my heads still in a whirl  
Just a country boy in the city lights tryin to have some fun  
But the man behind me didnt wanna play he pulled out a gun  
Hey hey Mr Government Man  
Im just a poor boy doin the best that I can  
Ive been stepped upon and pushed around  
You can tie me up but never tie me down  
Well I had it comin I hit the wall and my car went up in flames  
My head got hammered thrown in the slammer no one but me to blame  
Thats my story aint much for it but I know Ive paid my dues  
One thing I know in my heart and soul I aint never gonna lose  
They say I might be goin crazy hey what else can I do I have my mind  
Dont ya push me around no more
