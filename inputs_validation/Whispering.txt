Whispering while you cuddle near me  
Whispering so no one can hear me  
Each little whisper seems to cheer me  
I know its true dear Theres no one but you  
Im a singin  
Whispering why youll never leave me  
Whispering why youll never grieve me  
Whisper and say that you believe me  
Whispering that I love you  
  
Instrumental break  
  
Whispering while you cuddle near me  
Whispering so no one can hear me  
Each little whisper seems to cheer me  
Just whispering that I love you
