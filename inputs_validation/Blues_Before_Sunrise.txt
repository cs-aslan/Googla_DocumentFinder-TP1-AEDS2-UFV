I have the blues before sunrise  
Tears standing in my eyes  
I have the blues before sunrise  
Tears standing in my eyes  
It was a miserable feeling now babe  
A feeling I do despise  
  
I have to leave leave you baby  
Because you know you done me wrong  
I have to leave you baby  
Because you know you done me wrong  
Im gonna pack up and leave you darling  
And break up my happy home  
  
I have to leave leave you baby  
Im gonna leave you all alone  
Im gonna leave you baby  
Im gonna leave you all alone  
Im gonna pack up and leave you darling  
Because you know you done me wrong  
  
Well now goodbye goodbye baby  
Ill see you on some rainy day  
Well now goodbye baby  
Ill see you on some rainy day  
You can go ahead now little darling  
Cause I want you to have your way
