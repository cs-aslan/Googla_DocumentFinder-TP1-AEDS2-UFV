Evelina wont ya ever take a shine to that moon  
Evelina aint ya bothered by the bobolinks tune  
Tell me tell me how long  
Ya gonna keep delayinthe day  
Dont ya reckon its wrong  
Trifflin with April this way  
Evelina wont ya pay a little mind to me soon  
Wake up wake up  
The earth is fair the fruit is fine  
But whats the use o smellin winter water melon  
Clingin to another fellas vine  
Evelina wont ya roll off that vine an be mine
