Boy is lonely on a burning hot summer night  
Hes looking for some action hes looking 4 a fight  
Hes looking for a savior in a city full of fools  
Maybe he just needs a good talker to give him a good talking to  
Can we talk baby Strip down strip down  
I think Im gonna fall in love tonight  
  
Elephants and flowers hot sweaty light paints a picture red and gold  
On a crowd of naked bodies stripped down to their very souls  
How can he find a shy angel in a city so bold so bold  
He cant even find a place to dance this is rock and roll  
Strip down strip down elephants and flowers  
Is everybody ready Here we go  
  
Love the one who is love love the one who gives us the power power  
The one who made everything what elephants and flowers what will he do  
The one who will listen when all others will not  
There will be peace for those who love god a lot  
  
Elephants and flowers strip down  
Think Im gonna fall in love tonight  
When I do there wont be no more confusion  
There wont be no more no tears  
There wont be no more enemies so that eliminates all the fear  
And there wont be no sorrow sorrow  
There wont be no pain no pain  
There wont be no ball and no chain  
Strip down strip down elephants and flowers  
  
Boy is lonely on a burning hot summer night  
Hes looking for an angel to hold him til the morning light  
Here we go  
  
Love the one who is love well the one who gives us the power power  
The one who made everything everything elephants and flowers oh yeah  
The one who will listen when all others will not all others will not  
There will be peace for those who love god a lot  
Here we go  
  
Love the one who is love love the one who gives us the power power  
The one who made everything what elephants and flowers what will he do  
The one who will listen when all others will not  
There will be peace for those who love god a lot
