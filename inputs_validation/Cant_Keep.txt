I want to shake  
I want to wind out  
I want to leave  
this mind and shout  
  
Ive lived  
all this life  
like an ocean  
in disguise  
I dont live for  
ever  
you cant keep me here  
  
I want to race  
with the sundwon  
I want a last breath  
I dont let out  
  
Forgive  
every being  
the bad feelings  
its just me  
I wont wait  
for answers  
you cant keep  
me here  
  
I want to rise  
and say goodnight  
want to take  
a look on the other side  
  
Ive lived  
all these lives  
its been wonder  
full at night  
I will live for  
ever  
you cant keep  
me here
