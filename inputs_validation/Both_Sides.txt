Rows and flows of angel hair  
And ice cream castles in the air  
And feather canyons everywhere  
Ive looked at clouds that way  
  
But now they only block the sun  
They rain and they snow on everyone  
So so many things I wouldve done  
But clouds got in my way  
  
Ive looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down and still somehow  
Its cloud illusions I recall  
I really dont know clouds at all  
  
Moons and junes and ferris wheels  
The dizzy dancing way that you feel  
As every fairy tale comes real  
Ive looked at love that way  
  
Ive looked at love from both sides now  
From up and down and still somehow  
Its cloud illusions I recall  
I really dont know love  
Really dont know love at all  
  
But now its just another show  
and you leave em laughing when you go  
and if you can dont let them know  
Dont give yourself away  
  
Angel dust gets in your eyes your hair  
On acid stars youre getting there  
My bodys assembled into  
A little ittybitty gift to you  
When you die Ive looked at life that way  
  
But now its just another show  
You leave em laughing when you go  
So so dont let them inside dont let them know  
Dont give yourself ohh away  
  
But now my friends are acting strange  
They shake their heads man they say Ive changed well  
Well somethings lost rearranged  
From living every every every Ive  
  
Ive looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down and still somehow  
Its just illusions I recall  
  
I really dont know I really dont know  
I really dont know I really dont know  
I really dont I really dont clouds at all  
Why are we here Terrified terrified wow
