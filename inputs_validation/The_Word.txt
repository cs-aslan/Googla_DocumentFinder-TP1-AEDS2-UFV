This garden universe vibrates complete  
Some may get a sound so sweet  
Vibrations reach on up to become light  
And then through gamma out of sight  
Between the eyes and ears there lie  
The sounds of color and the light of a sigh  
And to hear the sun what a thing to believe  
But its all around if we could but perceive  
To know ultra violet infrared and Xrays  
Beauty to find in so many ways  
Two notes of the chord thats our full scope  
But to reach the chord is our lifes hope  
And to name the chord is important to some  
So they give a word and the word is Om
