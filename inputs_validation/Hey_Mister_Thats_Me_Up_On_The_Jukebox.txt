Hey mister thats me up on the jukebox  
Im the one thats singing this sad song  
Well Ill cry everytime that you slip in one more dime  
And let the boy sing the sad one one more time  
  
Southern California thats as blue as the boy can be  
Blue as the deep blue sea  
Wont you listen to me now  
I need your golden gated cities like a hole in the head  
Just like a hole in the head Im free  
  
Hey mister thats me up on the jukebox  
Im the one thats singing this sad song  
Well Ill cry everytime that you slip in one more dime  
And let the boy sing the sad one one more time  
  
I do believe Im headed home  
Hey mister cant you see that Im as dry as a bone  
I think Ill spend some time alone  
Yes unless youve found a way of squeezing water from a stone  
  
Let the doctor and the lawyer do as much as they can  
Let the springtime begin  
Let the boy become a man  
I done wasted too much time just to sing you this sad song  
I done been this lonesome picker a little too long  
  
Hey mister thats me up on the jukebox  
Im the one thats singing this sad song  
Well Ill cry everytime that youre up and slip in one more dime  
And let the boy sing the sad one one more time  
  
Well Ive been spreading myself thin these days  
Dont you know  
Goodbye
