Hey mama when you leave  
Dont leave a thing behind  
I dont want nothin  
I cant use nothin  
  
Take care into the hall  
And if you see my friends  
Tell them Im fine  
Not using nothin  
  
Almost burned out my eyes  
Threw my ears down to the floor  
I didnt see nothin  
I didnt hear nothin  
  
I stood there like a block of stone  
Knowin all I had to know  
And nothin more  
Man thats nothin  
  
As brothers our troubles are  
Locked in each others arms  
And you better pray  
They never find you  
  
Your back aint strong enough  
For burdens doublefold  
Theyd crush you down  
Down into nothin  
  
Being born is going blind  
And buying down a thousand times  
To echoes strung  
On pure temptation  
  
Sorrow and solitude  
These are the precious things  
And the only words  
That are worth rememberin
