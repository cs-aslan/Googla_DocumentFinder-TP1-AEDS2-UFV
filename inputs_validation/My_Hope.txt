Lay down my life before You Lord  
Stand here in wonder of Your Love  
Lord I live for You alone  
Youre worthy of all praise  
  
All of Heaven shouts Your Name  
All the earth will bring You praise  
With my life I honour You  
Youre worthy of all praise  
  
Youre all I want  
Youre all I need  
My one desire  
  
My hope is found in You  
Everything I need is at Your feet  
My life I lay it down an offering  
Im living for the glory of Your Name  
  
Youre all I need  
Youre all I need  
Youre all I need  
Jesus
