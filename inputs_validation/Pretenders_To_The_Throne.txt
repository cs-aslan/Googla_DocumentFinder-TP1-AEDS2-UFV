Is it Cologne with its great cathedral Milan with its glamour and its
pace London with its river and its bridges Lisbon with its beauty and
its grace Funny looking buses Climb its potbellied hills And a solitary
jogger Times the time he kills Do you know where Im gonna go None of you
have guessed so none of you can know If youve been thats not where I mean
Its got class and its got excellence like youve never seen Your town is
dragging me down Dragging me down down down Your town is dragging me down
Dragging me down down down Is it Dublin with its culture and its wit
Madrid with its market square Paris with its bustling cafes Hull with its
musical flair Do you know where Im gonna go None of you have guessed so
none of you can know If youve been thats not where I mean Its got class
and its got excellence like youve never seen Your town is dragging me down
Is dragging me down down down Your town is dragging me down Is dragging me
down down down As I watch them drop the grain into your fish tank brain How
can you like this place when it never even rains Never even rains Your town
is dragging me down Is dragging me down down down Your town is dragging me
down Is dragging me down down down Is dragging me down down down Is
dragging me down down down Is dragging me down down down
