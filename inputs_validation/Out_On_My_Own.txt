Your smiles they dont come easy  
Like they used to come before  
The awkwardness and boredom  
Is scattered out across the floor  
I can feel your love waxin and wanin  
And a quick look in your eyes needs no explainin  
  
Im out on my own  
Livin alone  
  
Im an old reluctant gypsy  
I dont like campin anymore  
And the dreams and disappointments  
Scatter out across the floor  
Im nervous on this train I feel it derailin  
And I can read the letters that nobodys mailin  
Im out on my own  
Livin alone yeah  
  
Somethin deep inside of me  
Must have died some time ago  
I havent called no place my home  
Since nineteenninetyfour  
Im out on my own  
  
Thirtysomethin single  
And tired of runnin everywhere  
And I can wear a welcome out  
When I aint even there  
Im nervous on this train I feel it derailin  
And I can read the letters that nobodys mailin  
Im out on my own  
Livin alone Im livin alone  
And I got nowhere to go  
Look at me Im out on my own  
Im out on my own  
But its gonna be all right now  
Its gonna be all right  
Its gonna be all right  
Oh yes I know it and I know and I know its gonna be all right
