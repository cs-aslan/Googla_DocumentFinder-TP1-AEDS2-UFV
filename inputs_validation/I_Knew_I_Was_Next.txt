So what do you think I am  
And how precisely could you tell  
A decent skin is all I am  
People think badly of me  
But one day maybe theyll praise  
Oh but meanwhile  
  
I knew I was next  
And I didnt mind  
Here I offer you my life for any debts youre due  
And when youve been down for the very last time  
There is nothing anyone can do to hurt you  
  
The shadows of trees they reach to me  
They know a decent skin is all I am  
People think badly of me  
But when Im in grave maybe theyll praise  
Oh but meanwhile  
  
I knew I was next  
And I didnt mind  
Here I offer you my life for any debts youre due  
And when youve been down for the very last time  
There is nothing anyone can do to hurt you  
  
Oh but meanwhile  
  
I knew I was next  
And I didnt mind  
When youve been slapped around  
And one more slap cant hurt you  
And when youve been down for the very last time  
There is nothing anyone can do to hurt you  
  
I knew I was next  
And I didnt mind  
When youve been slapped around  
And one more slap cant hurt you  
And when youve been down for the very last time  
There is nothing anyone can say to hurt you
