Something happened  
I just dont understand  
Something happened  
Its making me feel mad  
Something happened you dont hear about  
Oh please that never did before  
Something happened

Something happened

Something happened

I never read it in no book  
Ahh

Something happened  
Its making me feel mad  
I thought I knew a lot of things  
But I dont know a thing oh oh oh  
Something happened  
I just dont understand  
The things I hear and see  
Dont seem the same  
The things I touch and feel  
Are forever changed  
Ive never felt this way before  
And I hope I never do again  
Something happened  
I dont know why or when  
Oh something happened
