Words and music by bob seger  
  
Headin out on some uncharted path  
You soon turn back  
It happens time and time again  
You never seem to reach the end  
Someones out there on the street tonight  
When things go wrong  
Hell guarantee to make them right  
If the price is right  
  
Every time I look youre fallin fallin  
Beaten by the wind  
Every time I turn around hes there again  
  
Its like a full force gale  
An american storm  
Youre buried far beneath a mountain of cold  
And you never get warm  
Its like a wall of mirrors  
You charge em at full speed  
You cover up  you hear the shattering glass  
But you never bleed  
You never feel the need  
  
Everybody casts a certain light  
A special gift  
Its theirs to use for wrong or right  
When you face the night  
More and more we choose the easy way  
We take no risks  
We figure out which games to play  
And how to make em pay  
  
Suddenly the pressures fallin fallin  
Skies have all turned grey  
Suddenly the storm is heading straight your way  
  
Its like a full force gale  
Atop a mountain of cold  
You tell your story again and again  
And it never gets old  
Its like a wall of mirrors  
You charge em at full speed  
You cover up  you hear the shattering glass  
But you never bleed  
You face a full force gale  
An american storm  
Youre buried beneath a mountain of cold  
And you never get warm  no you never get warm  
You face a wall of mirrors  
You charge em at full speed  
You cover up  you hear the shattering glass  
But you never bleed  
You never feel the need
