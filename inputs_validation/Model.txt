Shes ahead of her time and shes never lazy  
But something changed your mind and she could drive you crazy  
Volunteers for winter coats and summer clothes that shine  
Volunteers for magazines I read them all the time  
But thats all right  
Do do do do do do do do do do  do do do do do do da da da  
Down the runway  
Do do do do do do do do do do  do do do do do do do  
Shes so ugly  
  
Tidy work never suffers when you stage your abuse  
Cocktails in the evening when youre completely nude  
Models at the motor show and I dribble at the thought  
Models looking like lobsters convertibles and sports
