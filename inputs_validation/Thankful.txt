Somedays we forget to look around us  
Somedays we cant see the joy that surrounds us  
So caught up inside ourselves  
We take when we should give  
So for tonight we pray for  
What we know can be  
And on this day we hope for  
What we still cant see  
Its up to us to be the change  
And even though we all can still do more  
Theres so much to be thankful for  
Look beyond ourselves  
Theres so much sorrow  
Its way to late to say Ill cry tomorrow  
Each of us must find our truth  
Its so long overdue  
So for tonight we pray for  
  
What we know can be  
And everyday we hope for  
What we still cant see  
Its up to us to be the change  
And even though we all can still do more  
Theres so much to be thankful for  
Even with our differences  
There is a place were all connected  
Each of us can find each others light  
So for tonight we pray for  
What we know can be  
And on this day we hope for  
What we still cant see  
Its up to us to be the change  
And even though this world needs so much more  
Theres so much to be thankful for
