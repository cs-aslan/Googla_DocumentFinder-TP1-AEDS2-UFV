I wont stay around with you my friend  
My lifes been empty since I went  
Since I went away from home  
Im sick and tired of being alone  
Theres nothing left for me to do  
So I gotta get the first plane home  
I gotta get the first plane home  
I gotta wing wing fly high over the see  
Theres a little girl whos waiting for me  
Love her till my dying day  
And when I die youll hear me say  
I love that girl for eternity  
But I gotta get the first plane home  
I gotta get the first plane home  
Got to wing wing fly high over the see  
Theres a little girl whos waiting for me  
Love her till my dying day  
And when I die youll hear me say  
I love that girl for eternity  
But I gotta get the first plane home  
I gotta get the first plane home  
I gotta get the first plane home  
I gotta get the first plane home
