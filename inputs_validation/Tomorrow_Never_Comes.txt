I watch you lie asleep  
Watch you breathing  
And as you fall and rise  
Like the tears in my eyes  
I know youll be leaving  
  
Ive earned all the pain  
I suppose it was worth it  
Id do it again but I just couldnt face it  
And if I see you again  
You wont be the person I knew  
I look to the future and see  
A thousand setting suns  
But tomorrow never comes  
  
I still watch from my window  
To see if youre coming  
But I know in my heart  
Theres really no chance  
Youll never stop running  
Its like waiting for Xmas again  
Its all lost in the blink of an eye  
  
And about all the pain  
Well you know it was worth it  
You could do it again but I just dont deserve it  
Let us part in the rain so the clouds hide  
The despair and the sorrow I feel on the inside  
And let my tears dry  
In the light of a setting sun  
And tomorrow never comes
