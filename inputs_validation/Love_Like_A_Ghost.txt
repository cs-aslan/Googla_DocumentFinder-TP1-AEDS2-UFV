Ive seen enough of life  
Enough to last a lifetime  
Ive seen too many tears  
Far too many tears  
I dont know the answer  
I dont know the question  
So show me something good  
Something to believe in  
CHORUS  
Love like a ghost in the dark  
Love like a ghost in my heart  
So lets talk of love  
Maybe for the last time  
You will remember me  
Im the one who died for you  
So shell take everything  
Everything and nothing  
I cant do anything  
Anything at all  
repeat chorus to fade
