Yes I understand that Im to set you free  
Yes I understand you love her more than me  
I understand she won your heart  
Stoled your love drew us apart  
I understand and so Ill let you go  
  
I tried my best to do the things  
I thought would please you dear  
I never dreamed the time would come  
When you would not be here  
  
Yes I understand what Im supposed to do  
Find me someone else to take the place of you  
And if I live a hundred years  
Ill find some way to hide these tears  
I understand and so Ill let you go
