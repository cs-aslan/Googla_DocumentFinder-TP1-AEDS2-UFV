Oh what a time to be me  
Im sorry youre feeling so lonely  
I know how hard it can be  
You lost your one and your only  
You told her you had to be free  
You say that you think shes found somebody new  
Who gives her the love that she needs  
Now its safe to say its a bad day for you  
But oh what a time to be me  
  
You say that you just had to call her  
To tell her you knew you were wrong  
Youre thinking you misdialed her number  
Just because I answered the phone  
I hate to be the one to have to break it to you  
But you got it accurately  
Now its safe to say its a bad day for you  
But oh what a time to be me  
  
Remember those kisses you used to receive  
They sure feel good on my cheek  
And now that you mentioned it I cant believe  
That anyone could ever leave a love so sweet  
  
Now I truly hope that we can still be friends  
Its hard to find a buddy like you  
And youre more than welcome  
But right now I get something to do  
And oh by the way heres a message for you  
Would you mind returning her key  
Theres somebody else that shes giving it to  
And oh what a time to be me  
  
Remember those kisses you used to receive  
They sure feel good on my cheek  
And now that you mentioned it I cant believe  
That anyone could ever leave a love so sweet  
  
Now I truly hope that we can still be friends  
Its hard to find a buddy like you  
And youre more than welcome  
But right now I get something to do  
And oh by the way heres a message for you  
Would you mind returning her key  
Theres somebody else that shes giving it to  
And oh what a time to be me  
  
Now its safe to say
