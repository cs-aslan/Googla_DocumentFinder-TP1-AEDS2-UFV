When I looked you in the eye  
I knew it was time for goodbye  
You were the only one I had around  
But you couldnt keep your feet on the ground  
  
Run rabbit run  
But whats that youre runnin for  
Run rabbit run  
You aint gonna run no more  
  
Bye bye baby bye bye bird  
  
Thought the cold sidewalk stones  
Broke your little brittle bones  
I know you were already dead  
When the truck rolled over your head  
  
Bye bye baby bye bye bird
