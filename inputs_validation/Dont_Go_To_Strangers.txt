Build your dreams  
To the stars above  
But when you need someone true to love  
Dont go to strangers  
Lover come to me  
  
Play with fire  
Get your fingers burned  
But when theres no place left to turn  
Dont go to strangers  
Lover come to me  
  
You give the call to follow your heart  
Youll follow your heart I know  
Ive been around  
Im an old hand  
Ill understand if you have to go  
  
So make your mark  
For your friends to see  
But when you need more than company  
Dont go to strangers  
Lover come to me  
  
Dont go to strangers  
Lover come to me
