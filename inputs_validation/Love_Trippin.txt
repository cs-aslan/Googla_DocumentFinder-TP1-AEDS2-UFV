They say Im crazy the way you got me open baby  
They say Im buggin the way Im tight sweatin your lovin  
They all sit and wonder why the reason this I cannot hide  
It aint a question of pride  
  
They say Im trippin the way you got my whole life flippin  
They say Im losin it just cant seem to keep my grip baby  
We all cry when we feel pain when love is gone were not the same  
It aint a question of brains  
  
Crazy the way you got me open baby  
They say Im buggin the way Im tight sweatin your lovin  
  
They say Im slippin the way you got my whole life flippin  
They say Im losin it just cant seem to get my grip baby  
  
They all sit and wonder why the reason this I cannot hide  
It aint a question of pride
