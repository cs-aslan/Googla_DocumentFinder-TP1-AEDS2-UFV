Sid was a punk rock king  
Nancy was a broken queen  
Their lives were so glamorous  
Sid and Nancy were a mess  
  
When youre hooked on heroin  
Dont you know youll never win  
Drugs dont ever pay  
You really did it your way  
  
Love kills x3  
We still believe in anarchy  
It makes me so damn angry  
Sid and Nancy meant a lot to me  
You may be dead but your souls are free  
Like Romeo and Juliet  
You two made a pact of death  
Like the needle that ya used  
Sid and Nancy were born to lose  
  
Love kills x3  
Sid never meant any harm  
He shot some dope into his arm  
All he wanted was some fun  
Now shes lying in a pool of blood  
Always loaded always high  
Why did you have to die  
Ill say one thing is  
It leaves me with a bitter taste  
  
Love kills x9
