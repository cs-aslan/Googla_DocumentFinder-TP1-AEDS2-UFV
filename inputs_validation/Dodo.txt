Now we can talk in confidence  
Did you guess that weve been done wrong  
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line  
Such a shameless design  
  
He thinks hes well screened from the man at the top  
Its a shame that his children disagree  
They coolly decide to sell him down the line  
Daddys brainwashing time  
  
Hes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me  
Hes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me  
  
Shes quite enthralled with the childhood of yore  
When a unit was a figure not a she  
When lovers chose each other now the perks are due  
Another memo to screw  
  
Shes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me  
Shes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me  
  
Can you wipe your nose my child  
Without them slotting in your file a photograph  
Can you sleep alone at night  
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbor Jim  
Hes come to turn you in  
  
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me  
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me  
Another dodo didnt hear it from me
