What can I say man I hit him with the brick  
Killed the little prick him and his chick  
Tried to be slick but you aint slinky  
Youre brinky youre dinky you suck my twinkie  
I dont give a fuck if you call me a clown  
Break it on down its murder go round  
Whatcha dishing out I betcha ya it comes back to ya  
If youre trying to creep Id hate to say I never knew ya  
Once upon a time in the ghetto zone  
A tenfoot led pipe slapped on my dome  
Im laying in the street with blood oozing out my head  
Excuse me motherfucker was it something I said  
Forks up forks down man forks sideways  
Then he grabbed my finger and he said crime pays  
Swung on his pipe once again for the road  
Hold up dawg UH this shit gets old  
Now I walk the streets with a shattered skull  
Im gonna swing my axe to his jaw  
Where the motherfucker at Where the motherfucker stay  
How ya gonna fuck with the juggla Jayayay  
There he sits so I knock on the door  
Pops opened up pops hit the floor  
Then I chop chop pops twice in his nugget  
Well he didnt do shit fuck it  
Its the murder go round  
  
Well its me and my mellow mellow roll on Military  
Gangbangers gangbangers big bang fairy kinda scary  
Tags up all on the bricks  
Latin Count XMen CFP and all that shit  
We love gangbangers and we hope they love us back  
We just some wicked clowns and its been like that  
I dont understand why some people in town  
We witness your water still southwest down  
But this motherfucker gonna try and clown me  
But Im the juggalugalocoro G  
Took a shot and he missed 2 Dope in the dust  
What I aint got shot bitch so now you must  
Take your ticket for the murder go round  
Cant nobody kill a clickclack clown  
Seen him and his boys smoking blunt in a bucket  
Pulled out the dagger creeped up and I stuck it  
Into his head into his boys head  
Into his boys head his boys head his boys head  
Five dead fucks in the trunk on deliver  
Push that old piece of shit in the river  
The cat and my boys saw five go down  
Can ya get a free ride No not again  
On the murder go round No  
  
Chorus  
Murder go round murder go round  
How ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown  
  
  
Now Im in a street gang fiftyfive strong  
Everybody singing that southwest song  
What can go wrong I mean Im fuckin in the haugh  
Popping that shit Im gonna bust you in the mouth  
Nobody fucks with a jokero juggalo  
I dont give a fuck ya know bitches Im a fuck you though  
But you know the shit had to hit the fan  
Some gangbanger shot me man  
Twice in the forehead twice in the back  
Twice in the eye and Im feeling kinda whack  
Stumbling along its becoming entwined  
Whos the next in line  
For the murder go round  
  
Chorus
