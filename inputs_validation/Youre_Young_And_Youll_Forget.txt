I know that it would make you cry to find that I have gone didnt even say
goodbye  
Youll hate me for a while because I promised love and left you just regret  
I know that I could never be the kind of man that you have in your mind of me  
Though you said we must part it would break your heart  
But youre young and youll forget  
  
Youre young and I know time will help you find a perfect man to really love
you  
And not a man like me whos like the wind and must be free  
But a man whos worthy of you  
  
For I could never settle down to just one way of life  
One woman and one town so sad to part this way  
Youll be glad someday for youre young and youll forget  
Youre young and I know time
