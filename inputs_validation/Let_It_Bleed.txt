This poisons my intoxication  
I broke a needle off in my skin  
Pick the scabs and pick the bleeding  
And assume that it was all in vein  
Popping a scab thats never healing  
It just hit me in the face  
Burning bridges So misleading  
The poisons more important now with the pain  
  
Let it bleed  
Take the red for what its worth whoa  
Watch the fire  
Fill your lungs with smoke for the last time  
If you feel like dying you might want to sing  
  
The fire department couldnt drown the city  
They didnt even try to wash it clean  
And what did you think that I was sober  
For me yea cause Im on fucking fire  
Popping a scab thats never healing  
Im proud that I kept this clean  
The most that I can do for you is keep on lying  
Im tired of lying I think Id rather sin  
  
Let it bleed  
  
Take the red for what its worth woah  
Watch the fire  
Fill your lungs with smoke for the last time  
If you feel like dying you might want to sing  
  
Oh oh you might want to sing  
Aha ha you might want to sing  
Ha ha you might want to sing  
Ha ha ha ha sing  
You might want to sing  
You might want to sing  
You might want to sing or scream at  
  
This poisons my intoxication  
I broke a needle off in my skin  
Pick the scabs and pick the bleeding  
And yeah assume that it was all in vein  
  
Let it bleed  
Take the red for what its worth whoa  
Watch the fire  
Ima fill your lungs with smoke for the last time  
If you feel like dying  
If you feel like dying  
If you feel like dying You might want to sing  
Ha ha ha You might want to sing  
Ha ha You might want to sing
