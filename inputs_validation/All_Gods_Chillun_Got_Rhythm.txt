Chillun listen here to me  
This is my philosophy  
To see me through the day  
To scare my cares away  
  
All Gods Chillun Got Rhythm  
All Gods Chillun got swing  
Maybe havent got money  
Maybe havent got shoes  
All Gods Chillun Got Rhythm  
For to push away the blues  
Yeah   
  
All Gods Chillun got trouble  
Trouble dont mean a thing  
When they start to go ho ho ho de ho  
Troubles bound to go way say  
  
All Gods Chillun Got Swing
