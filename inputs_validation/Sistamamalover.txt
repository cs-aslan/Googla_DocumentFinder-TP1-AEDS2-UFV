Ive gone from talkin to walkin  
You touch me deep down inside  
Oh cant you see that Im fallin  
And I can no longer hide  
  
You are my everything  
my sistamamalover  
You give me everything  
I have no need to borrow  
And when I think of you  
You take away my sorrow  
Ill always love you baby  
Like theres no tomorrow  
  
When I get up in the morning  
I feel like Im so alive  
With you it never gets boring  
Cause you always get me high  
High  
  
You are my everything  
my sistamamalover  
You give me everything  
I have no need to borrow  
And when I think of you  
You take away my sorrow  
Ill always love you baby  
Like theres no tomorrow  
  
Ill never go with another  
Cause baby you are so fly  
Dont have to live undercover  
Because I dont have to lie  
I dont have to lie baby  
  
You are my everything  
my sistamamalover  
You give me everything  
I have no need to borrow  
And when I think of you  
You take away my sorrow  
Ill always love you baby  
Like theres no tomorrow
