Civilization crumblin fast  
End the world with a blast  
People afraid walking the streets  
Scums have their day  
Til they run into me  
Are you ready  
Livin in fear aint livin to me  
Im armed with a gun defending the free  
They blew it in nam shot up my friends  
Im back in the streets the fight never ends  
I was born with a gun in my hand  
Ill die for my country  
But Ill die like a man  
Violence and bloodshed  
Violence and bloodshed  
Violence and bloodshed  
Now were back to animal law  
The paybacks a bitch and Im paying all  
All my life I been waitinto see  
Whos gonna win crumbs or me  
Are you ready  
My brothers still in danang  
Puttinan ad in the back of kerrang  
Im looking for people who just want to kill  
Well go back the nam cause no one else will  
Land of the free  
Home of the brave  
Now thats how it is  
And thats how it stays  
Violence and bloodshed  
Violence and bloodshed  
Violence and bloodshed
