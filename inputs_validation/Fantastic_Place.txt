Islands are mountaintops  
  
Its always a struggle  
To let somebody go  
Its a natural desire  
To own your lover I know  
  
And you can screw a man down  
Until he takes to drinking  
Hell give you all of his money  
You still wont know what hes thinking  
  
Take me to the fantastic place  
Keep the rest of my life away  
Take me to the fantastic place  
Keep the rest of my life away  
  
Take me to the island  
Ill watch the rain over your shoulder  
The streetlights in the water  
The moment outside of real life  
  
I never could dream while I was sleeping  
Put your arms around my soul  
And take it dancing  
  
Take me to the fantastic place  
Keep the rest of my life away  
Take me to the fantastic place  
Keep the rest of my life away  
  
Take me to the island  
Ill watch the rain over your shoulder  
The streetlights on the wet stone  
The moment outside of real life  
  
Say you understand me  
And I will leave myself completely  
Forgive me if I stare  
But I can see the island behind your tired troubled eyes  
  
Take me to the island  
Ill tell you all I never told you  
The boy I never showed you  
More than I gave in my life  
Take me by the hand  
Youll either kill me or youll save me  
Take me to the island  
Show me what might be real life
