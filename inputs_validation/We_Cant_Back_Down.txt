We cant  
We cant back down x4  
  
Not right now  
We cant back down  
Not right now  
We cant back down  
We cant back down  
  
Dont close your eyes  
Were all in this together  
Wherever we draw the line  
Were not gonna straddle across it  
Or lose it  
  
We cant back down  
Theres too much at stake  
This is serious  
Dont walk away  
We cant pretend its not happening  
In our backyard  
Our own home plate  
No way  
Weve been called out  
Weve been called out  
Do you hear your name  
Yeah  
Im not confused  
Lets win this thing  
Lets do it  
We cant back down  
Theres too much at stake  
Dont walk away  
Dont walk away yeah  
  
Dont get me wrong  
I dont like confrontation  
Id rather we all just get along  
Music should be undivided united  
  
We cant back down  
Theres too much at stake  
This is serious  
Dont walk away  
We cant pretend its not happening  
In our backyard  
Our own home plate  
No way  
Weve been called out  
Weve been called out  
Do you hear your name  
Yeah  
Im not confused  
Lets win this thing  
Lets do it  
We cant back down  
Theres too much at stake  
Dont walk away  
Dont walk away yeah  
  
We got a situation that we cant ignore  
Cause ignorance is not bliss  
We dont have to take this no  
With every big decision  
Comes an equally important share of the risk  
We gotta take this  
  
We cant back down  
Theres too much at stake  
This is serious  
Dont walk away  
We cant pretend its not happening  
In our backyard  
Our own home plate  
Weve been called out  
Do you hear your name  
Im not confused  
Lets win this thing  
We cant back down  
Theres too much at stake  
Dont walk away  
Dont walk away yeah  
We cant back down  
  
We cant back down  
Not right now  
We cant back down
