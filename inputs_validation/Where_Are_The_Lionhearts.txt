Destiny took me in her arms and told me  
Youre a little lost on the fall  
You fall for all the men  
You shouldnt fall for all at all   
Ooh I know she knows but still I go on  
Well Im a fool  
  
Climbing up the ladders  
To slide down the adders  
On the rocks  
On the rocks  
On the rocks  
On the rocks  
  
Joan of Arc walks into my mirror  
A burning sword  
Id like to cry  
I look into her eyes  
I see shes seen the long days and night  
Ooh she says  
The games are still the same I see  
But theyve changed the names now  
Are all Lionhearts put in parks apart   
  
Lionhearts in the asylums  
Lionhearts tossed at sea  
Lionhearts whove lived their lives like Arthur  
Lionhearts in cathedrals  
Lionhearts at mournings  
Lionhearts in every seed  
But theyre sown  
On the rocks  
On the rocks  
On the rocks  
On the rocks  
  
Somebody I couldnt see  
Tied me up and put me away  
Here on the rocks  
Here on the rocks  
Here on the rocks
