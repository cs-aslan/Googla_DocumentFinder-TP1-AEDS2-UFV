If they want to blow up the French king of Italy  
Coprince of Andorra  
You guessed it  
Its me  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
Ugh  
  
Hello Paris I bust through the door  
Now everybody lift your jaws off the floor  
You act like youve never seen your emperor before  
Its Napoleon and Im back for more  
  
Ive just escaped from exile on Elba  
Where they call me the cage monster  
They say Im short and I got little hands  
But check out my massive battle plans  
  
Yes weve got to go to war one more time  
Against who Everybody but dont worry well be fine  
Just fighting to get back whats rightfully mine  
Which is everything I conquered the first time  
  
King Louis whatever  
He aint got nothing on me  
The greatest Frenchman ever  
Come to war with me  
French people my subjects  
I brought you success  
Women used to make me nervous  
But in battle Im the best  
  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
  
I didnt come to party  
I came to get nasty  
  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
  
Just got to win at Waterloo  
Then Ill get back to ruling you  
  
You say Im cocky  
Maybe I am  
Its not my fault  
Its my pituitary gland or maybe my ego  
But Ill tell you what is true  
Im a military genius  
And my army love me too  
  
I can barely ride a horse  
But not for want of trying  
Id say its not my sore  
But I would be lying  
Its the British and the Dutch and the Prussian army  
But thats okay  
The Prussian leaders barmy  
  
Im pregnant with an elephant  
  
See what I mean  
But I really need to win before they get on the scene  
Cant pray for rain to stop  
Dont believe in God  
If it carries on much longer well be stuck in the mud  
  
I got 100 days  
And Im back up in this  
Were out numbered yes  
But we can win this  
  
Sure Im a little fat  
And it hurts when I pee  
But dont worry about that  
Ill lead you to victory baby  
  
Napoleon Bonaparte

Look out world wait and see  
Youre about to see the best of me  
  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
  
Just got to beat Wellington  
Which almost nobody has done

And Ill go down in history  
Cos Waterloos my destiny
