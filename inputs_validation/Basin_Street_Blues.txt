No wont you come along with me  
Down the Mississippi  
Well take trip to the land of dreams  
Floatin down the river down to New Orleans  
  
And the bandll be there to meet us  
Oh friends to greet us  
Thats where the light and the dark folks meet  
A heaven on earth  they call it Basin Street  
  
Basin Street is the street  
Where the elite always meet  
Out in New Orleans the land of dreams  
Youll never know how nice it seems  
Or just how much it really means  
And Id rather be yessiree  
New Orleans the land of dreams  
Where I can lose my Basin Street blues  
  
Now aint you glad you came with me  
We went down the Mississippi  
We took a trip  
To the land of dreams  
We floated down the river  
Down to New Orleans  
  
Basin Street  thats the street  
Where the elite always meet  
Down in New Orleans the land of dreams  
And youll never know how nice it seems  
Or just how much it really means  
Id rather be yessiree  
New Orleans the land of dreams  
Where I can lose my Basin Street blues
