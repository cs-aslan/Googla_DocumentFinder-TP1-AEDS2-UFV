Look how the wind carries the sea  
And see how the soul supplies what it needs  
The rain falls the sun shines and a flower breaks reed  
And it all works together why cant we  
And I have seen children at play in the park  
Skin shades of ivory red yellow and dark  
While my eyes saw colors their little hearts could not see  
They were playing together why cant we  
Why cant we  
Why cant we  
I can love you and you can love me  
Why cant we  
Why cant we  
Set our foolish pride free just be and let be  
Why cant we  
And I had a dream about a lion and a lamb  
They were laying together and there was peace in the land  
And so it became precious cause there were no enemies  
And I woke up and wondered God why cant we  
Why cant we  
Why cant we  
I can you love you and you can love me  
Why cant we  
Why cant we  
Set our foolish pride free just be and let be  
Why cant we  
Set our foolish pride free just be and let be  
Why cant we  
Oh why cant we
