I cry I cry  
I was born in a land I dont think you understand  
God damn what I am  
Im a native of this place please dont kick me in my face  
My race has been disgraced  
  
Wont somebody testify kick a hole right in the sky  
Testify testify kick a hole right in the sky  
Slap a liar in his eye kick a hole right in the sky  
Testify testify kick a hole right in the sky Johnny  
Johnny Johnny  
Puts us in a pumpkin shell where you keep us very well  
Its hell where I dwell  
When history books are full of shit I become the anarchist  
Im pissed at this  
What this country claims to be  
Its a lie  
No place for me  
I bleed  
Kill my trust if you must  
But in my blood there is lust  
For life  
Thats right  
Apache blood is in my heart thrashing though me like a shark  
Crashing though the dark  
What am I supposed to do  
I feel like Im cut into confused  
By rules  
Do these cultures clash or am I living in the past  
I ask please tell me fast  
To what do I belong and if I change will I be wrong  
I took my foot kicked a hole in the sky  
I proceeded to plead fathers help me decide  
A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye  
I turned around and found that I was still alive  
Snakes rise high from the purple black sky  
The red cloud rains and the black horse rides  
Then it dawned on my like the mornin sun  
Im a part of two worlds and the mornin comes  
Glowing embers tend to remember when  
The power that is peace was treated as a friend  
I am a master of and Ive got to take action  
Im a man the animal man
