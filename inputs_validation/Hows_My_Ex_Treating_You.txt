Hows my ex my ex treating you  
Has she had time time to find someone new  
Any day now will be her last  
son I know from the past  
Cause I was once once there too  
hows my ex treating you  
  
Like the sand she moves with the tide  
Your two arms will never keep her satisfied  
You cant keep her satisfied  
Shell use you just the way she used me too  
But up till now hows my ex treating you  
  
Like the sand she moves with the tide  
Your two arms will never keep her satisfied  
Shell use you just the way you use her too  
But up till now hows my ex treating you
