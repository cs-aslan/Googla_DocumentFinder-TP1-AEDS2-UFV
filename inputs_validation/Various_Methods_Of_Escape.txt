Hallucinating half a day  
The pieces of a plan  
Instruction of the highest quality  
Bled from my own hand  
A line of little blueprint in my head  
The body lives  
It doesnt really matter anymore  
Yes it doesnt mean a thing  
  
Ive gotta let go  
Ive gotta get straight  
What do you have to make it so hard  
Let me get away  
  
The wonders to the hall  
Days are so profound  
A place to bury everything I did  
And lie onto the ground  
If I illuminate I finally see  
The masterpiece itself  
I cannot tell the difference anymore  
I cannot trust myself  
  
Ive gotta let go  
Ive gotta get straight  
What do you have to make it so hard  
Let me get away  
  
Ive gotta let go  
Ive gotta get straight  
What do I make the soul  
Let me get away  
  
I think I could lose myself in here  
I think I could lose myself in here  
I think I could lose myself in here  
I think I could lose myself in here  
  
Ive gotta let go  
Ive gotta get straight  
What do you have to make it so hard  
Let me get away  
Got to let her know  
Find another way  
What do you have to make it so hard  
Let me get away  
Away away away
