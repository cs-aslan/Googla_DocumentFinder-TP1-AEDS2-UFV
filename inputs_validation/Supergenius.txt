Turn your face down  
its your chance to meet the man  
When you saw that  
tha nightstick hit his head  
Saw it fall on his skull  
you heard the sound that it made  
Impressed by the sound  
hes impressed with himself  
  
You stand in the way  
youre the next one down  
Call it like you see it  
no muted witness  
You stand in the way  
youre the next one down  
It just might break  
it just might break down  
  
Its in the way  
that you stand up for right  
thats why the old guards shaking  
It lets them know youre there  
It lets them know  
that you cant ignore what you saw  
Lifting weights of conscious  
Story of tragic miscarriage  
  
You stand in the way  
youre the next one down  
Call it like you see it  
no muted witness  
You stand in the way  
youre the next one down  
It might just break  
just might break  
break down  
It just might take more than you have got  
  
Forgotten something  
aright you have got  
Stopping for nothing  
It might take more than you have got
