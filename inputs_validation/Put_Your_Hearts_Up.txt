Lemme see you put your hearts up yeah lemme see you put your hearts up yeah  
If we give a little love maybe we can change the world  
  
You think youre so small  
Like youre itty bitty  
Just one match in the lights of the city  
Walking by strangers on the side of the street  
Like a quarter in a cupll get em off on their feet like  
You think youre never gonna make your mark  
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart like  
Out of sight out of mind like like  
Its just a waste of time  
Like like like

Maybe we can change the world  
  
Wishing on a shooting star in the sky  
We can do anything if we try  
Cant resurrect ghandi

If we put our heads together  
We can do anything like

Much too show how much care
