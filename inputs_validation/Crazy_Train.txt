All aboard ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
  
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay  
  
Crazy but thats how it goes  
Millions of people living as foes  
Maybe its not too late  
To learn how to love  
And forget how to hate  
  
Mental wounds not healing  
Lifes a bitter shame  
Im going off the rails on a crazy train  
Im going off the rails on a crazy train  
  
Lets go  
Ive listened to preachers  
Ive listened to fools  
Ive watched all the dropouts  
Who make their own rules  
One person conditioned to rule and control  
The media sells it and you live the role  
  
Mental wounds still screaming  
Driving me insane  
Im going off the rails on a crazy train  
Im going off the rails on a crazy train  
  
I know that things are going wrong for me  
You gotta listen to my words  
Yeah  
  
Heirs of a cold war  
Thats what weve become  
Inheriting troubles Im mentally numb  
Crazy I just cannot bear  
Im living with something that just isnt fair  
  
Mental wounds not healing  
Who and whats to blame  
Im going off the rails on a crazy train  
Im going off the rails on a crazy train
