Judge me feel free  
Cause the freer you feel  
The freer youll let me be  
  
Its such a terrible terrible shame  
You keep on judging me in his name  
Youre so quick to shift the focus  
Cause you can find yourself  
In todays frame  
But I know hes approve  
And Ive nothing to prove to you  
He smiles down on me lovingly  
  
Just me feel free  
Cause the freer you feel  
The freer youll let me be  
  
Its truly sad to see  
You suffering so immensely  
You need distracting  
So you use me conveniently  
But I know hed approve  
And Ive nothing to prove to you  
He smiles down on me lovingly
