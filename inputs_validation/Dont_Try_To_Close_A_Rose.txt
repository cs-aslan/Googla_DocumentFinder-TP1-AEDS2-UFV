They say that every thing you do  
Turns out all wrong  
That youre bound to lose  
And you love me too much  
Take me along  
Ah baby dont ever try to close a rose  
After it blooms to the tuned  
Of a spring time day  
It wont work any way  
cause once it knows the sun it grows  
And keeps on growing  
Knowing it must say goodbye  
To the field and the sky  
So dont you worry about me  
You could never make me unhappy  
Cause we both have been touched  
By the spring time sun  
We already won  
As long as you want me  
Ill be right there  
But with a life time of hard times  
We gotta love  
Babe we can share  
Ah baby dont ever try to close a rose  
After it blooms to the tuned  
Of a spring time day  
It wont work any way  
cause once it knows the sun it grows  
And keeps on growing  
Knowing it must say goodbye  
To the field and the sky  
Ah baby dont ever try to close a rose  
After it blooms to the tuned  
Of a spring time day  
It wont work any way  
cause once it knows the sun it grows  
And keeps on growing  
Knowing it must say goodbye  
To the field and the sky
