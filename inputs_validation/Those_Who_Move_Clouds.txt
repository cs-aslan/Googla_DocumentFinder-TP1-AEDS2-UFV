The throwing of your mental clothes wasnt ever your intention  
The malady within your heart has no cure and prevention  
There are those who move clouds  
Those who move clouds  
Heard it murmured in a far off crowd  
Those who move clouds  
  
I wish that I could offer you a chance to change direction  
But you know that pathways must be followed to near destruction  
There are those who move clouds  
Those who move clouds  
Heard it murmured in a far off crowd  
Those who move clouds  
  
There are those who will patronise and compromise your position  
They cant feel the forceful hand of  
Predetermined destination  
There are those who move clouds  
Those who move clouds  
Heard it murmured in a far off crowd  
Those who move clouds  
  
I can feel the forceful hand  
And it wont let me change direction no  
And theres this hunger inside of me  
And it wont and it wont no it wont stop its aching  
And I can feel it inside of my head the forceful hand  
And it wont let me change direction  
And theres this hunger and it wont let me  
And it wont let me stop and it wont let me stop this aching no
