You are distraction  
Like pictures on the wall  
I dont like eyes  
  
You are attraction  
It gets to be routine  
Youre up Im down  
  
Shes got claws  
But the factory knows  
Were dreams in cold storage  
We could dance the night away  
  
You say you love me  
Maybe you do  
A patience I cant steal  
I dont believe you  
You said Straight  
Its like giving up hope  
  
Here on the ground  
On the floor  
Screaming nothing at all  
Here on the ground  
Like some whore  
Looking down on you all  
Too much advice  
Im not sure  
  
Laughing hyenas  
With pens for charm  
Youll just suck in the boys  
We have to leave soon  
Shudder The Door  
This house is far too cool  
  
Shes got claws  
But the factory knows  
Were dreams in cold storage  
We could dance the night away
