Your head spins round on a Monday  
And the daylights in your eyes  
How you laughed and cursed tomorrow  
Now hes standing by your side  
You touched the stars at midnight  
The whole world seem to shout Hello  
Now your throat is tired and heavy  
And only one can go  
  
Ill be all right though I may cry  
The tears that flow they always dry  
Its just that I would rather be with you now  
And every time I see that star  
I will say a prayer for you  
Now and forever September blue  
  
Ill be all right though I may cry  
The tears that flow they always dry  
Its just that I would rather be with you now  
And every time I see that star  
I will say a prayer for you  
Now and forever September blue  
cause Ill always love you  
September blue
