Oh what a lucky day  
Things are going my way  
Sun is arising mesmerizing everything I say  
People all around this uptight town  
Someones gonna recoginze me  
Aint it time  
Dues Ive been paying for so long only making me stronger  
Lady luck wont you please come to me I cant wait any longer  
I spend all my time writing notes and rhyme  
Tryin to find new dimensions  
Aint it time  
Time for movin on  
Time enough to grow  
Time enough to find myself  
Everythings okay  
What a lucky day  
Time enough to play my guitar  
Competition everywhere is getting all of us down  
Ive been makin all the rounds I feel like a train on the wrong track  
Dont get lost cause you might get caught going out  
The wrong door now  
Aint it time  
Time for movin on  
Time enough to grow  
Time enough to find myself  
Everythings okay  
What a lucky day  
Time enough to play my guitar
