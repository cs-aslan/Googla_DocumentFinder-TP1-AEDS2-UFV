Sometimes its hard to make things clear  
Or know when to face the truth  
And I know that the moment is here  
Ill open my heart and show you inside  
My love has no pride  
  
I feel with you Ive got nothing to hide  
So open your eyes and see who I am  
And not who you want for me to be  
I am only myself myself  
  
I dont wanna lose you now  
Were gonna get through somehow  
I dont wanna lose you now or ever  
  
Baby Ive finally found  
The Courage to stand my ground  
But if you want me  
Ill be around forever  
  
We all make mistakes we all lose our way  
But we stood the test of time and I hope  
Thats the way it will stay  
Its all up to you to tell me to go  
Cause it wont be me to walk away  
When youre all that I know  
And I know that  
  
I dont wanna lose you now  
Were gonna get through somehow  
I dont wanna lose you now or ever and ever  
Baby Ive finally found  
The courage to stand my ground  
  
But if you want me  
Ill be around forever forever yeah  yeah  
  
Dont wanna lose you  lose you now  
Were gonna get through somehow  
Dont wanna lose you now  
Dont wanna lose you  
Dont wanna lose you
