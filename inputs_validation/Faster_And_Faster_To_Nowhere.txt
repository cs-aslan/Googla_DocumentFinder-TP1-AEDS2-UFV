Where am i going what is the place  
Somebody help me outta here  
  
Oh im walking faster faster and faster to nowhere  
Oh im running slower slower and slower to somewhere  
cause the citys closing tighter and tighter around me  
Its a nightmare daymare its a badmare  
No matter which waymare  
  
Spoken  
Seems that there must be some way to get out  
But i just cant find it  
  
People pushing hustling rushing on into the future  
Windows open closing in a way that they just never used to  
Oh theres violence lurking in the alleys  
Where no one should dare go  
So keep walking faster faster and faster to nowhere  
  
I gotta get out somebodythat guy came at me with a gun  
The city closing in  
  
Trip to nowhere trip to nowhere trip to nowhere

Trip to nowhere trip to nowhere trip to nowhere  
Were gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere trip to nowhere trip to nowhere  
Were gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere trip to nowhere trip to nowhere

Children crying screaming but no one lets on that they hear them  
Its getting louder louder surely that someone must hear them  
cause the citys closing tighter and tighter around me  
Its a nightmare daymare its a badmare  
No matter which waymare  
  
Help me i want to get out  
Cut it out stop closing in on me help  
  
Trip to nowhere trip to nowhere trip to nowhere
