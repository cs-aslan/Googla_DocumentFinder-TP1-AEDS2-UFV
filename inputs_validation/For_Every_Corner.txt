Ill take your side and Ill take you into town  
And there youll search around  
You hope she must be waiting now  
Found what you need dont push her too far  
Dont ever let her see you down  
I hope shes waiting now  
Its not that she has been around  
Too long to never try  
Too long to never try  
For every corner theres a way out  
And every day that you lose  
Theres a pay out theres a pay out  
And if she cries you know it will be fine  
With things now on your side dont frown  
She is waiting now  
But if she sings then shes taken all you bring  
To her you mean all things you smile  
Shes waiting now  
Its not that she has been around  
Too long to never try  
Too long to never try  
For every corner theres a way out  
And every day that you lose  
Theres a pay out theres a pay out  
But dont you think the time will come  
When youll get in her way  
Or shell bring you down the same  
For every corner theres a way out  
And every day that you lose  
Theres a pay out  
For every corner theres a way out  
And every day that you lose  
Theres a pay out theres a pay out  
Theres a pay out
