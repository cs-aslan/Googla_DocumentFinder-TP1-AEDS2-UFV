You were a lady  like lady I was a boy running wild  
The way that you used everything that god gave you  
I gave you my heart like a child one moment you took me to heaven  
Took me back to earth and then before I woke up to the fact I was small you
took me back to heaven again  
  
And I remember the Indian summer how you held me how you loved me Loved me
loved me  
The world may give me a million reasons but reasons dont make it wrong  
Every lesson I learned has a price in return I was lost in my youth and to
tell you the truth  
I was empty and you filled me with a glow of love a loving loves may die  
Just to hear you that sees me through oh what Id give to relive all the
Indian Summers with you  
  
So many hearts have been broken Dum dumb dumb dumbby Do Wah  
You had no trouble with mine like a fool I was there for the taking but then  
It was only a matter of time you can lie in the sun with the warm wind blowing  
Just knowing youve already paid but you cant live alone in an Indian Summer
at 110 in the shade  
  
And I remember and I remember The Indian Summer  
How you held me in the moonlight  
  
We were riding along on a silver dream never dreaming it off our head  
and if Id known Id lose you the moment I found you Id love you all over
again  
  
cause Im still empty Im still empty Come fill me  Come fill me  
With a fire of love your flame will follow flame cause its all I want to do  
  
Oh what Id give to relive all the Indian Summers with you  
Oh what Id give to relive all the Indian Summers with you  
Oh what Id give to relive all the Indian Summers with you  
Oh what Id give to relive all the Indian Summers with youoooooooooooooooooo
