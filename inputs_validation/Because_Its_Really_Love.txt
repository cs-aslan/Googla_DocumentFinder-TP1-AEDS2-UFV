I used to be afraid  
That you were never gonna love me this way  
But I feel better now  
Noone could ever say  
To me Its such a shame youre a lonely guy  
Because your love is mine  
And now we know our love is ever so true  
I think we know it cause you feel the way I do  
I cant imagine me without you my dear  
And Im so glad about the reason that you came here  
  
Because its love  
Because its love  
Because its really love  
Because its love  
Because its all the way love  
Because its really love  
  
Ooo girl you gotta stay  
Cause I wanna fill your day with happiness  
Cause Im in love you see  
Theres so much I wanna say  
And youll hear the words to make you fall in love  
Deep in love with me  
I used to say I love you everyday  
To make you really know  
To trust in the things I say  
But look at me now and you can clearly see  
The love I feel for you  
You dont need words from me  
  
When you walked into the crowded room  
You sent my rocket to the moon  
But little did I know you would change my life  
But you kept saying Take it slow  
I love you for the things you know  
Cause Ill never spend another lonely nightat night  
  
I wanna be your friend  
After the lovin ends  
Its not over then  
You see it just begins  
And all anyone can say  
Is Ooo wee youve got it made  
And may the best of love always come your way  
  
And I dont worry how much I fall  
When the feelin starts to call  
Because its really love  
And all my worries fall into place  
When I think about your face  
Because its really love
