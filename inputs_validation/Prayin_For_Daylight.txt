I dont want to spend another lonely night Ooooh  
Ive got the lights turned up the door is locked  
The bedroom tvs on  
Doin the only thing that gets me through  
The night since youve been gone  
  
Prayin for daylight  
Waitin for that mornin sun  
So I can act like my whole life aint goin wrong  
Baby come back to me  
I swear Ill make it right  
Dont make me spend another lonely night  
Prayin for daylight Prayin for daylight  
  
I made a bad miscalculation bettin  
You would never leave Ooooh  
Cause if youre gettin on with your new life  
Then where does that leave me  
  
Prayin for daylight  
Waitin for that mornin sun  
So I can act like my whole life aint goin wrong  
Baby come back to me  
I swear Ill make it right  
Dont make me spend another lonely night spend another lonely night  
Prayin for daylight Prayin for daylight  
Prayin for daylight Prayin for daylight  
  
Prayin for daylight  
Hopin that I didnt wait too long I didnt wait too long  
But this is just the dark before the dawnOh  
  
Deep in my heart I know that you love me  
As much as I love you You know I love you girl  
And that you must be lyin somewhere  
Lookin up to heaven too  
  
Prayin for daylight  
Waitin for that mornin sun  
So I can act like my whole life aint goin wrong  
Baby come back to me  
I swear Ill make it right  
Dont make me spend another lonely night  
Make me spend another lonely night  
  
Prayin for daylight  
Waitin for that mornin sun  
So I can act like my whole life aint goin wrong  
Baby come back to me  
I swear Ill make it right  
Dont make me spend another lonely night another lonely night  
Prayin for daylight Prayin for daylight  
  
Prayin for daylight  
  
I dont want to spend another lonely night  
I dont want to spend another lonely night  
Prayin for daylight  
I dont want to spend another lonely night Ooooh  
Prayin for daylight
