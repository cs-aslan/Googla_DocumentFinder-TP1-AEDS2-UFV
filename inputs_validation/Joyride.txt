Hit the road out of nowhere I had to jump my car  
and be a rider in the love game following the stars  
dont need no book of wisdom I get no money talk at all  
She has a train going downtown shes got a club on the moon  
and shes telling all her secrets in a wonderful balloon  
  
Oh shes the heart of the funfair  
shes got me whistling her private tune  
And it all begins where it ends  
and shes all mine my magic friend  
  
She says Hello you fool I love you  
Cmon join the joyride join the joyride  
  
Shes a flower I can paint her shes a child of the sun  
were a part of this together could never turn around and run  
Dont need no fortune teller  
to know where my lucky love belongs oh no  
Cos it all begins again when it ends  
and were all magic friends  
  
She says hello you fool I love you  
Cmon join the joyride be a joyrider  
  
I take you on a skyride  
a feeling like youre spellbound  
The sunshine is a lady  
who rox you like a baby  
  
She says hello you fool I love you  
Cmon join the joyride join the joyride
