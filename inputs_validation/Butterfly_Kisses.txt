Theres two things I know for sure  
She was sent here from heaven and shes daddys little girl  
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night  
She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes  
And I thank God for all the joy in my life But most of all  
Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer  
Stickin little white flowers all up in her hair  
Walk beside the pony daddy its my first ride  
I know the cake looks funny daddy but I sure tried  
Oh with all that Ive done wrong I must have done something right  
To deserve a hug every morning and butterfly kisses at night  
Sweet sixteen today  
shes looking like her momma a little more every day  
One part woman the other part girl  
To perfume and makeup from ribbons and curls  
Trying her wings in a great big world But I remember  
Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer  
Stickin little white flowers all up in her hair  
You know how much I love you daddy but if you dont mind  
Im only going to kiss you on cheek this time  
With all that Ive done wrong I must have done something right  
To deserve a hug every morning and butterfly kisses at night  
All the precise time  
Like the wind the years go by  
Precious butterfly spread your wings and fly  
Shell change her name today  
Shell make a promise and Ill give her away  
Standing in the bride room just staring at her  
She asked me what Im thinking and I said Im not sure  
I just feel like Im losing my baby girl  
Then she leaned over and gave me  
Butterfly kisses with her mama there  
Stickin little white flowers all up in her hair  
Walk me down the aisle daddy its just about time  
Does my wedding gown look pretty daddy Daddy dont cry  
With all that Ive done wrong I must have done something right  
To deserve a hug every morning and butterfly kisses  
I couldnt ask God for more man this is what love is  
I know Ive gotta let her go but Ill always remember  
Every hug in the morning and butterfly kisses
