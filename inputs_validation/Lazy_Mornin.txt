Another lazy mornin no need to get down on anyone  
My son coffees in the kitchen woman on the run  
No need to get bothered Ill think about Monday  
When Monday comes its two for one  
Mister Hoot n Holler gotta make a dollar  
Another lazy mornin I took time to make town n stock a pint or two  
The most delicious brew  
Keepin up with the joneses I hope no one telephones us  
Id take a place in the country but for now the old back yard  
Looks to me like fifty acres of the roundest ground in town  
Another lazy mornin come supper time Im gonna light my barbecue  
Nothin new only that she loves me  
And nothin I know can change me no need to get bothered  
I do more livin than it might seem  
Some dream livin like a pauper bless my darlin daughter  
Id like to know what makes a man go over land and sea  
I guess it must get kinda lonesome thats the way I used to be  
Another lazy mornin no need to get down on anyone  
Such fun coffees in the kitchen woman on the run
