Ive got sunshine on a cloudy day  
When its cold outside Ive got the month of May  
I guess youd say  
What can make me feel this way  
My girl my girl my girl  
Talkin bout my girl my girl  
  
Ive got so much honey the bees envy me  
Ive got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees  
I guess youd say  
What can make me feel this way  
My girl my girl my girl  
Talkin bout my girl my girl  
  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Ooh  
  
I dont need no money fortune or fame  
Ive got all the riches baby one man can claim  
I guess youd say  
What can make me feel this way  
My girl my girl my girl  
Talkin bout my girl my girl  
  
Ive got sunshine on a cloudy day  
With my girl  
  
Ive even got the month of May  
With my girl
