The lonesome sound of the train goin by  
Makes me want to stop and cry  
I recall the day  
It took you away  
Im blue and Im lonesome too  
  
Well when I hear that whistle blow  
Well I want to pack my suitcase and go  
The lonesome sound of the train goin by  
Makes me want to stop and cry  
  
Instrumental solo  
  
In the still of the night and pale moonlight  
The wind blows and cry  
These lonesome blues  
I just cant loose  
Im blue and Im lonesome too  
  
Well when I hear that whistle blow  
Well I want to pack my suitcase and go  
The lonesome sound of the train goin by  
Makes me want to stop and cry  
  
These lonesome blues  
I just cant loose  
Im blue and Im lonesome too  
Im blue and Im lonesome too
