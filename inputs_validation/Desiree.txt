Its killin me to write the word goodbye  
Ive wadded up and tossed a thousand tries  
We both know the reason  
There aint nothing to explain  
But I know that my leavin  
Will spare us both the pain  
  
Chorus  
Desiree I cant hold you any longer  
Desiree you love his money more than me  
And the taxis at the gate  
I guess all thats left to say  
Is in teardrops at the bottom of the page  
I love you Desiree  
  
Itd be easier to leave if I were mad  
But its hard to lose the best youll ever have  
And to write this note to you  
Was the hardest thing to do  
But not as hard as bein a poor boy  
Who cant afford a girl like you  
  
Chorus  
  
God I love you Desiree  
But I just cant take it anymore  
I wont be around for your goodbye  
I wont be around for your goodbye  
You love his money more than me  
I wont be around for your goodbye  
You love his money more than me  
I wont be around for your goodbye  
Oh you love his money you love it more than me  
I was just a fool who couldnt see  
That you love his money you love it more than me
