I know a honey named Millie raised out in Philly  
Body so illy she make a grown man silly  
A brainiac really she pretend she dilly  
Like Why you always look at me like that you feel me  
  
Theres a girl named Wendy love black Bentleys  
Nails in her mouth stay tryin to tempt me  
She rolls with her sister and they both real friendly  
It wasnt like that when my pockets was empty  
  
Shorty named Suzie not quite a floozy  
Lets just say she has a problem bein choosy  
Scarf on her doobie when she in the jacuzzi  
On the celly with her man Love you Im at the movies  
  
Bird named Chyna baby where you find her  
Uptown she wrote a map down with eyeliner  
Hotness two or three girlfriends behind her  
On Amsterdam lay in the lane dippin despite her  
  
Chorus  
So after school I take a dip in the pool  
Which is really on the wall  
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball  
And we talkin bout checkbooks credit cards more money  
Than a sucker could ever spend  
But I couldnt give a what about them cats you with  
Get your friends baby jump in the Benz

Whylin out with the gavel and the silk pajamas lets go  
  
And then theres Tamika the sergeant gets deeper  
She turned the bass way up and wind on the speaker  
Girl named Kelly rhinestones in her belly  
Curly red hair crackin jokes in the telly  
Game concealed a female Machiavelli  
Hopin and prayin that I aint ready for the jelly

Can you feel it nothin can save ya  
Once again I got em catchin the vapors

The whole entire globe recognize the grill  
Walkin down the red carpet were chilly chill
