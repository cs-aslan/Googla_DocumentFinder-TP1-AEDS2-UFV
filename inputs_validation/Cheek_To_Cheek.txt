Heaven Im in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When were out together dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Heaven Im in heaven  
And the cares that hung around me through the week  
Seem to vanish like a gamblers lucky streak  
When were out together dancing swinging cheek to cheek  
  
Oh I love to climb a mountain  
And reach the highest peak  
But it doesnt thrill boot me half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Oh I love to go out fishing  
In a river or a creek  
But I dont enjoy it half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Now Mamma Dance with me  
I want my arms about you  
That Those charms about you  
Will carry me through  
  
Right up To heaven Im in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When were out together dancing out together dancing swinging  
Out together dancing cheek to cheek
