I cant believe the things Ive seen  
I wonder bout some things Ive heard  
Everybodys crying mercy  
When they dont know the meaning of the word  
  
A bad enough situation  
Is sure enough getting worse  
Everybodys crying justice  
Just as long as theres business first  
Toe to toe  
Touch and go  
Give a cheer  
Get your souvenir  
  
People running round in circles  
Dont know what theyre headed for  
Everybodys crying peace on Earth  
Just as soon as we win this war  
  
Straight ahead  
Knock em dead  
Pack your kid  
Choose your hypocrite  
  
Well you dont have to go to off Broadway  
To see something played absurd  
Everybodys crying mercy  
When they dont know the meaning of the word  
  
Nobody knows the meaning of the word  
When they dont know the meaning of the word  
Nobody knows the meaning of the word  
Nobody knows the meaning of the word
