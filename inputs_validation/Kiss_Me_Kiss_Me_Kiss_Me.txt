She said You never tell me that you love me anymore  
So I cant help but wonder if you do  
She said If things dont change youll see me walk right out that door  
Cause Ive done everything I know to do  
I said I dont know just what it is you want from me  
She said I only want us back the way we used to be   
Then she said  
  
Kiss me kiss me kiss me  
Hold me hold me like you want me  
Like youll never let me go  
She said Show me that you really love me  
And then tell me  
Cause I really need to know  
She said Kiss me kiss me kiss me  
  
I got down on my knees right there and I promised her Id change  
Cause deep inside I knew that she was right  
I said I know weve drifted and theres only me to blame  
But I dont want to waste another night  
And somewhere in the darkness there we found a brand new start  
As I took every word she whispered straight to heart  
When she said  
  
Kiss me kiss me kiss me  
Hold me hold me like you want me  
Like youll never let me go  
She said Show me that you really love me  
And then tell me  
Cause I really need to know  
She said Kiss me kiss me kiss me
