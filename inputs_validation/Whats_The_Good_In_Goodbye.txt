All my stars are upside down  
And youre there when I turn around  
I dont wanna be on my own  
And I dont wanna bring you down  
I just cant figure out  
  
Whats the good in goodbye  
When there are no reasons why  
When youre gone and I have nothing you know  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
When theres heaven in hello  
  
When you touch down remember this  
The more you leave behind  
The more I miss  
I dont wanna fall asleep  
And I dont wanna wake alone  
I just cant work it out  
  
Whats the good in goodbye  
When there are no reasons why  
When youre gone and I have nothing you know  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
When theres heaven in hello  
  
Did you have to go I dont wanna see you leave  
What good of memories distance stretch further with the time  
Every time I close my eyes youre fight off the sunrise  
Now were voices down the line tell me tell me why  
  
Whats the good in goodbye  
When there are no reasons why  
When youre gone and I have nothing you know  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
When theres heaven in hello when youre gone  
So long I dont know  
Whats the good in goodbye  
When there are no reasons why  
When theres heaven in hello  
Ill never know why you have to go
