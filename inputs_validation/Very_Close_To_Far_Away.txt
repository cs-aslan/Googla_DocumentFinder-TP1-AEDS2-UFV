Im very close to far away  
And I cant hear the words you say  
So take what you can take what you find  
Take it all into your mind  
  
Im very close to letting go  
Even closer than you know  
I need what you have need what you give  
I need your love to make me live  
So talk to me now talk to me slow  
Say the words I told you so  
I know you dont believe me  
Or all the things I say  
But if youd just receive me  
Were very close to far away  
  
Im very close to far away  
And I cant hear the words you say  
So take what you can take what you find  
Take it all into your mind  
  
I know you dont believe me  
Or all the things I say  
But if youd just receive me  
Were very close to far away  
Im very close to far away  
And I cant hear the words you say  
I need what you have need what you give  
I need your love to make me live  
  
Im very close to letting go  
Even closer than you know  
So take what you can  
Take what you find  
Take it all into your mind
