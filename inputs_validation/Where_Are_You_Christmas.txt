Where are you Christmas  
Why cant I find you  
Why have you gone away  
  
Where is the laughter  
You used to bring me  
Why cant I hear music play  
  
My world is changing  
Im rearranging  
Does that mean Christmas changes too  
  
Where are you Christmas  
Do you remember  
The one you used to know  
  
Im not the same one  
See what the time has done  
Is that why you have let me go  
  
Christmas is here everywhere  
Oh oh  
Christmas is here if you care  
Oh  
  
If there is love in your heart and your mind  
You will feel like Christmas all the time  
Oh  
  
I feel you Christmas  
I know I found you  
You never fade away  
Oh  
  
The joy of Christmas  
Stays here inside us  
Fills each and every heart  
With love  
  
Where are you Christmas  
Fill your heart with love
