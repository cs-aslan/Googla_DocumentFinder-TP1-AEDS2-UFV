CHORUS  
Do ya do ya have a secret friend  
Playin around hangin out again  
  
Your love has been like a stranger  
Your love is hiding behind a closed door  
Youre an ace at using deception  
Cause you dont want to let me go  
  
CHORUS  
  
Be ashamed to lose good lovin  
Chasin dreams in the night the way we do  
Theres no way you got to be honest  
Ill do anything to make it right for you  
  
CHORUS  
  
Cant you see its just an attraction  
He can feed you lies so easily  
I cant wait forever  
Girl let me go or come to me  
Tell me   
  
CHORUS
