Im packin up my old suitcases to go see old familiar faces  
Give me blue skies and sunny Texas weather  
I crave the smell of good ole saddle leather Ive got Texas in my heart  
Ive got a lotta friends in Amarrilo I like Dallas Forth Worth Houston San
Antone  
Got a pinin in my heart to be in Texas Ive said Ill wind up makin it my
home  
Im packin up my old suitcases to go see old familiar faces  
The Lone Star State has won my heart doggone it  
And long horn steak with lots of ketchup on it Ive got Texas in my heart  
 banjo   
I love the western way they grab in Texas where that Lone Star hat is mighty
plain  
You can bet your boots and saddle I love Texas gonna hang and to go back there
again  
Im packin up my old suitcases to go see old familiar faces  
Give me blue skies and sunny Texas weather  
I crave the smell of good old saddle leather Ive got Texas in my heart  
The eyes of Texas are upon you Ive got Texas in my heart
