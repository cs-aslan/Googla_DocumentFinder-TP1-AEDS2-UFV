Feel the power rushing forward it gets into your veins  
Almighty power building higher youll never be the same  
Im wanting more Im getting more of the feelings you cant tame  
Im the master youre the bastards are you glad you came  
  
The sign of life your blood is red  
Come with us and raise the dead  
  
Electric fusion no illusion terror in the night  
Screaming thunder white face murder we complete the fright  
The earth is shaking ground is breaking we complete the rite  
The time has come for you to run now take off in the night  
  
See the stone above his head  
Rise three days the prophet said  
The sign of life your blood is red  
Come with us and raise the dead  
  
Behind the headstone he is watching you  
Watching every move  
Behind the headstone see the body move  
Come to get fresh blood  
  
Are you glad you came  
Raise the Raise the Raise the  
Dead
