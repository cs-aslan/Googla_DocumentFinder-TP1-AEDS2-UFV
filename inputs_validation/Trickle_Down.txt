Old lions dying got left behind  
Cut your teeth lose your meat  
And man its just a matter of time  
Keys to the cuffs you might be king  
Thats it thats all thats everything  
  
Skeletons come here to dance  
Where barrooms beat their brothers  
Into a bloody trance  
Whats the deal what did I do  
Who cops all the cops is all I asked of you  
  
Lining up waiting on the trickle down  
Somethings up taking time to get around  
Belly up all the drinks are on the crown  
Its just a matter of trickle down  
  
Twenty miles before the crash  
Thats the style for a while  
And man I think its gonna last  
hit the brakes is all you can say  
Conductor says well save them  
For another rainy day
