Every time I end up getting to it  
Want some more

Verse 1 Nicki Minaj  
Im in this bitch Im getting money  
One minute they hate me then they love me  
Aint got nothing for me these dudes is funny  
Thats why Im throwing shade like its sunny  
Who had Eminem on the first album  
Who had Kanye saying She a problem  
Who the fuck came in the game made her own cologne  
Who made Lil Wayne give em five million  
Why the fuck I gotta say it though  
You niggas dont know it yet  
Football touchdown on the Boeing jet  
You my son but Im just not showing yet  
Miss Icy but it aint snowing yet  
You can tell Im the illest cause my dividend is the biggest  
Bitches aint sitting with us all my niggas in Margielas Oh

They think its sweet Oh these bitches got diabetes  
You seen that list It was me Baby Jay Z and Diddy

Verse 2 Nicki Minaj  
Yo Yo

Want it I get it I dont be wanting for nothing  
I mean I do what I do and it must be counting for something  
I dont be jumping from topic to topic stay in my pocket

You niggas apologize and a nigga diss you
