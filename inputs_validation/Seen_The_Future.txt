I freed my mind in the oxygen tent  
Sold my ass now my trousers fit again yeah yeah  
I blew my stash on hallucinogens  
You love my song well I dont know what it means no  
  
Man I need tv  
For when I got my morrissey  
Have you seen the future of rock and roll  
Have you seen the future of rock and roll  
Have you seen the future of rock and roll  
Have you seen the future of rock and roll  
  
All my friends do the model girl thing  
So I found one now she wears my nose ring  
Shes really beautiful  
But shes hung up on the chelsea kid  
And Im a renaissance man but she just cant dig it no  
  
Man I need tv  
For when I got my morrissey  
Have you seen the future of rock and roll  
Have you seen the future of rock and roll  
Have you seen the future of rock and roll  
Have you seen the future of rock and roll
