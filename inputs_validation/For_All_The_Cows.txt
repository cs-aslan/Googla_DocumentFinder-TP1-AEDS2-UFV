Im called a cow  
Im not about  
To blow it now  
For all the cows  
  
Its funny how money allows all to browse  
And be endowed  
This wish is true it falls into pieces new  
The cow is you  
  
My kind has all run out as if kinds could blend  
Some time if time allows everything worn in  
Like its a friend  
  
I said youre all a painted doll and it caused  
The walls to fall  
How far is he  
Impatiently  
Thats as far as far can be
