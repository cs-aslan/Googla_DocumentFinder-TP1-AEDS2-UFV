Mothers ruin she said to herself  
Im just screwing my own mental health  
But Fridays and Saturdays  
She walks down those alleyways  
A latter day lady of the lamp  
How you doing You aint from round here  
Wont you come in Im really not scared  
Cause Fridays and Saturdays  
I still do it anyways  
And anything is better than out there  
Now dont wake me up again  
Dont let me feel anything  
But when you go let me dream that I go with you  
So I wont cry myself dry anymore  
Mothers ruin their own little girls  
Keep them dreaming theres more to this world  
But turn her the other way  
And every day is Fathers Day  
He stays until theres nothing left to say  
But dont wake me up again  
Dont let me feel anything  
But when you go let me dream that I go with you  
Cause I cant take it round here anymore  
Now dont wake me up again  
Dont let me feel anything  
But when you go let me dream that I go with you  
So you wont make my heart ache anymore  
Leave the light on and dont shut the door
