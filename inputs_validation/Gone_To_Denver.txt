Ive thought Id take a trip to Denver and spend a little time  
I thought maybe out in Denver I might get you off my mind  
No want no want go with me just want to be alone  
I might find someone in Denver that can help me carry on  
Gone to Denver gone to Denver gone to mend a broken heart  
Now I was goin and if Im goin Id better be gone gone to Denver  
Well Ive known a quiet wild now Ive been losing you  
And Id rather might stay here and find out who I lost into  
Maybe I wont even miss you like I always thought I would  
Ive heard Denvers quite a city and it changed my do me good  
Gone to Denver gone to Denver gone to mend a broken heart  
Now I was goin and if Im goin Id better be gone gone to Denver  
Gone to Denver
