Make someone happy  
Make just one someone happy  
Make just one heart the heart you sing to  
One smile that cheers you  
One face that lights when its near you  
One girl youre everything to  
  
Fame if you win it  
Comes and goes in a minute  
Wheres the real stuff in life to cling to  
Love is the answer  
Someone to love is the answer  
Once youve found her  
Build your world around her  
Make someone happy  
Make just one someone happy  
And you will be happy too  
  
Yeah  
  
Once youve found her  
Now build your world build your world around her  
Make someone happy  
Make just one someone happy  
And you will be happy too  
Make someone happy oh  
And you will be happy too
