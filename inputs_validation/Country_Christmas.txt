Mommie pop the popcorn and we string it on the tree  
Apples nuts and candy oh what a Christmas feel  
Daddy play the organ and well all sing Silent Night  
Well have a good old country Christmas alright  
  
A good old country Christmas thats what its gonna be  
With all the family gathered round our pretty Christmas tree  
Well open up our presents Christmas Eve about midnight  
Well have a good old country Christmas alright  
 guitar   
Aunt Annie Belle will be here uncle Bill and darn our kids  
Well make ballets on the floor just like we always did  
Grandma bake the pies and cakes oh what a pretty sight  
Well have a good old country Christmas alright  
  
A good old country Christmas  
A good old country Christmas
