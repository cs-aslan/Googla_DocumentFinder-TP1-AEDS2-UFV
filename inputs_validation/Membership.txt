Whether laying down yourself beside it  
Or slipping into its cool and rushing effects  
Or drifting on it to where it broadens  
Your admiration for for its more elusive aspects  
  
Being drawn along by it  
Carried under carried away  
By its longterm membership  
  
By the time the icehuts hit the bottom  
We were already home in bed  
The most worthy men and the fiercest architects  
Couldnt fight the current they couldnt save They couldnt save the sheds  
  
Being drawn along by it  
Carried under carried away  
By its longterm membership  
  
Bring on the springtime bring on the houseflies  
Bring on the butterscotch river overspilling its banks  
If you got you some withering power to amuse  
Youll find its greatest frustration has its entertaining value  
  
Being drawn along by it  
Carried under carried away  
By its longterm membership  
  
River wide  
River wonder us
