Crazy rhythm heres the doorway  
Ill go my way youll go your way  
Crazy rhythm from now on were through  
  
Here is where we have a showdown  
Im too high and youre too low down  
Crazy rhythm heres goodbye to you  
  
They say that when a high brow meets a low brow  
Walking along Broadway  
Soon the high brow he has no brow  
Aint it a shame and youre to blame  
  
Whats the use of our mission  
You produce the same condition  
Crazy rhythm Ive gone crazy too  
  
They say that when a high brow meets a low brow  
Walking along Broadway  
Soon the high brow he has no brow  
Aint it a shame and youre to blame  
  
Whats the use of prohibition  
You produce the same condition  
Crazy rhythm Ive gone crazy too  
Crazy rhythm Ive gone crazy too  
Crazy rhythm Ive gone crazy too
