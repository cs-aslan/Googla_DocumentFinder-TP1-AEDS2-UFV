Sitting as the noonday sun  
Shines high up in a clear blue sky  
While warming me I drift away  
No memries of the times gone by  
Oh the moment that I lose my mind  
You come into my heart and say  
Im always here for you to love  
Surrender to me let me stay ay ay  
Oooo  
Oooo du du du du du du du  
  
Sinking deeper still inside  
I feel awakened from my dreams  
Resting in some golden flow  
Becoming part of you it seems  
  
Nothing separates my life  
From that which we have called our goal  
Its all in this external world  
As results from deep within my soulouloul  
Oooo  
Oooo du du du du du du du  
Oooo du du du du du du du  
  
As I open up my eyes  
The sky has changed into a glow  
My sense of time had disappeared  
I see the sun has sunken low  
  
I feel such joy and call your name  
Youre evrything my eyes could see  
Ill gladly kiss it all goodbye  
Stay ever in your companynyny  
Oooo  
Oooo du du du du du du du  
Oooo sri krishna  
Du du du du du du du  
Sat singing  
Sat sat
