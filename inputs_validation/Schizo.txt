Children gather round him  
Mystery surrounds him  
What terrible secret does he hide  
An ordinary man  
Doing what he can  
But what goes on inside his mind  
  
The night draws nigh  
With darkened skys  
Axe blade shines  
Midnight chimes  
  
Morning comes around  
Headless bodies found  
Our little friend just sits and smiles ha ha  
Take them home and love them  
Read the bible to them  
Be sure to kiss each one goodnight  
  
But come the night  
Youll freeze with fright  
Axe drawn high  
Another dies  
  
Creeping and searching for victims unknowing  
What fate doth await round each corner  
The take in the night  
Hes got you in his sight  
  
Now that I have warned you  
Always look behind you  
Youll never know just wholl be there  
That harmless looking dear  
May be the one to fear  
So never trust those you dont know  
  
But come the night  
Youll freeze with fright  
Axe drawn high  
The bastards die
