When the weight of all my dreams  
Is resting heavy on my head  
And the thoughtful words of help and hope  
Have all been nicely said  
But Im still hurting wondering if Ill ever be the one  
I think I amI think I am  
Then you gently reremind me  
That Youve made me from the first  
And the more I try to be the best  
The more I get the worst  
And I realize the good in me is only there because of who  
You are who You are  
And all I ever have to be is what  
Youve made me  
Any more or less would be a step out of Your plan  
As you daily recreate me help me always keep in mind  
That I only have to do what I can find  
And all I ever have to be  
All I have to be  
All I ever have to be is what Youve made me
