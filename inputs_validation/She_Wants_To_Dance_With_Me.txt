She wants to dance  
She wants to dance  
Hoo  
She wants to dance with me  
Mmm mmm mmm  
  
Theres a girl Ive been waiting to see  
And I really get the feeling that she likes me  
Cause she said so but not in so many words  
Ive got to tell you what I heard  
  
She dont want no wild romance  
When shes with me she only wants to dance  
  
Chorus  
She wants to dance with me  
Cause I hold her so tight next to me  
She wants to dance with me  
Cause I let her be what she wants to be  
  
Now I know Ive been out of touch  
But I never meant to hurt my baby oh so much  
Cause I love her and i think she loves me  
And thats the way its got to be  
  
When were together we never fight  
Weve got better things to do tonight  
  
She wants to dance with me  
Cause I hold her so tight next to me  
She wants to dance with me  
Cause I let her be what she wants to be  
  
She wants to dance  
She wants to dance  
  
Chorus To Fade
