I stayed up all night long  
Drinkin and thinkin bout you  
Is there anything left at all  
Is there anything that I can do  
Cause I dont know what to say anymore  
I dont know how to even the score with you with you  
Starin hard at that big front door  
Is it time now to find my shoes  
It aint the loss of love no more  
Im just tryin hard to live with you  
Cause I dont know what to say anymore  
And I dont know how to even the score with you with you  
With you with you  
Cause I dont know what to say anymore  
And I dont know how to even the score with you oh with you  
Is love a question whos weak whos strong  
I cant see it wheres a compromise  
Its so confusin where this thing has gone  
Its gotta stop youve gotta realize  
Cause I dont know what to say anymore  
And I dont know how to even the score with you oh with you  
Yes with you oh with you  
Cause I dont know what to say anymore  
And I dont know how to even the score with you oh with you  
Yes with you oh with you  
I dont know what to say anymore  
And I dont know how to even the score with you oh with you  
Yes with you oh with you
