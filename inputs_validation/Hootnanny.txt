Now I done banged a heap of Betties in various modes of transport  
n told them as they exit be sure that they close the damn door  
The quiet country types is usually those Im scared for  
Some scared at first but usually those demand more  
Really aint conceited I just call myself the cutterbug  
A horny little parasite that all the women love to love  
Tell you what it is today I aint concerned with what it was  
Bubba fixin to get it done I put that on my brother  
Hear them in the closet in the kitchen justa whisperin  
Bubba so psst psst knowing that Im listening  
I aint gotta chain boy my peck is all thats glistenin  
Whachu steamin on folk yall aint even disciplined  
I aint leaving nothin this the house me and my people built  
Huggin me and dappin me buddy I can see your guilt  
Its cold when youre wrong and you lookin like you need a quilt  
Yall matter less everytime this margarita tilt

A lot of yall was thinkin that Bubba would probably disappear  
Get some show money from ugly and buy a keg of beer  
And another pig to give my other pigs some company  
Rent a doublewide and just live it out in luxary  
In due time but theres business left to attend to  
I need another farm to bequeath my next of kin to  
And another Before my great aunt Missy  
Yea Ive been drinkin but I aint that pissy  
Thinkin back to when my daddy told me what its all about  
He said no matter what I do in life some of yallll pout  
I can deal with that long as all my folks is eatin good  
Let that channel pass over more than any Easter could  
Im on the roll again and I aint talkin ecstacy  
Tell them folks at Interscope they fixin to write some checks to me  
Soon as me and Timmy finish up this latest pig schlop  
Man I think you right it aint nothing but some hen

Im back off in the saddle with smile and that cajolery  
Mama always knew how big a stallion I would grow to be  
Way beyond these suckers both lyrically and vocally  
I doubted for a moment now its clear to me Im supposed to be  
An uncanny whit plus a time that is impeccable  
Make the sharpest cat feel his mind is just a vegetable  
How does Bubba do it you wont find it in a manual  
Confused them all at first so this time is understandable  
Staring at the ceiling fan pondering my future now  
Wondering what the hell to do with all this loot I found  
Got my tractor polished up and Im as drunk as Cooter Brown  
Navigating yet another one of Timmys supersounds  
  
I could go number one ten times
