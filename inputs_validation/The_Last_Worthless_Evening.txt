I know you broke up with him  
And your hearts still on the shelf  
Its been over two years for me  
And Im still not quite myself  
  
You cant be with someone new  
And you cant go back to him  
Youre beginning to realize  
That its sink or swim  
  
I see you around sometimes  
And my heart just melts  
Youre lookin like if you had your wish  
Youd be somewhere else  
  
And it just breaks my heart  
To see you here this way  
Someday Ill get the nerve  
To walk up to you and say  
  
This is the last worthless evening  
That youll have to spend  
Just gimme a chance  
To show you how to love again  
  
This is the last worthless evening  
That youll have to spend  
Cause Ill be there  
When your broken heart is on the mend  
  
Every night its the same old crowd  
In smoky rooms  
You catch a faint glimpse of love sometimes  
But it never blooms  
  
Ive been around this block a time or two  
And Ive made some big mistakes  
But girl I promise you I promise you  
That this is the worthless evening  
  
That youll have to spend  
Just gimme a chance  
To show you how to love again  
This is the last worthless evening  
  
That youll have to spend  
Cause it wont be long  
Til your little heart is on the mend  
People inside their houses  
  
With the shades pulled down  
God knows we could use some romance  
In this sleepy bedroom town  
I know youre still afraid to rush into anything  
  
But therere just so many summers  
And just so many springs  
And this is the last worthless evening  
That youll have to spend  
  
Just gimme a chance to show you how  
To love again  
This is the last worthless evening  
That youll have to spend baby  
  
Cause Ill be there when your broken heart  
Is on the mend  
This is the last worthless evening  
That youll have to spend  
  
Just gimme a chance gimme a chance  
To show you how to love again  
This is the last worthless evening  
That youll have to spend cause it wont be long  
  
Til your little heart is on the mend
