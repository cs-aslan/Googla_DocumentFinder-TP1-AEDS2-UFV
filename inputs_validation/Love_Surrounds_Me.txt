On my own again left alone  
To remember when  
Her love filled my life  
Made my life alive her love  
Love around me  
How can I cope without the love  
That I had  
all around me love surrounds me  
Surround me  
The love that I lost was more than  
I could hope to find  
love surround me all around me  
Around me  
Did I have love or did love have me  
Oo love around me  
But theres no  
Theres no love of my own  
Mmm mmmmm mmmmmmmmm  
Mm  
I gave up our love  
But it wont disappear  
Oo love around me  
Desire  
Seems as though  
Everywhere I go  
Oo love around me  
Put your arms around me  
Huggin and akissin  
Making the love Ive been missin  
All around me  
But theres no  
Theres no love of my own  
Love around me love surround me  
No love of my own  
Love around me love surround me  
No love of my own  
Love surround me love around me  
No love of my own  
Love surround me love around me  
Put your love around me
