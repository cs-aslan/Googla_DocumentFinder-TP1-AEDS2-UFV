I know  
That my love for  
You is real  
Its somethin true  
That we do  
Just somethin natural  
That I feel  
When you walk in the room  
When youre near  
I feel my heart skips a beat  
The whole world disappears  
And theres just you and me  
Falling head over feet  
Lets take a chance together  
  
Chorus  
I know I know I know I know  
Were gonna make it  
Cause no one else can  
Make me feel the way that you do  
I promise you  
I know I know I know I know  
Were gonna get there  
Today tomorrow  
And forever we will stay true  
I promise you  
  
They say  
That were just too young to know  
But Im sure heart and soul  
That Im never letting you go  
When its right its right  
And this is it  
Cause Im walking on air  
Every single time that we kiss  
You make the angels sing  
You give the songbird wings  
You make everything better  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill never let you down  
Ill always hear you out  
There is nothing you can mount  
Come and fight  
You listen when I speak  
You make my knees go weak  
And I just want you by side  
  
Chorus  
  
Were gonna make  
I promise you yeah yeah yeah  
I promise you  
I promise you  
I promise you
