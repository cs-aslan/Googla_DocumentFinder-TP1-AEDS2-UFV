Id like to be the one to see your loving mind at the start  
But I get claustrophobia cause theres too many boys in your heart  
Id like to know how far youd go to use those lips of wine  
But I get claustrophobia cause theres too many boys on your mind  
  
Oh one two three and now theres me  
You practice to deceive  
You lead me on another one  
Ive got no room to breathe  
  
So bye bye you who cant be true Im leaving you behind  
Cause I get claustrophobia cause theres too many boys on your mind  
  
I get claustrophobia cause theres too many boys on your mind  
  
Oh one two three and now theres me  
You practice to deceive  
You lead me on  another one  
Ive got no room to breathe  
  
So bye bye you who cant be true  Im leaving you behind  
Cause I get claustrophobia cause theres too many boys on your mind  
Too many boys on your mind  
Too many boys on your mind
