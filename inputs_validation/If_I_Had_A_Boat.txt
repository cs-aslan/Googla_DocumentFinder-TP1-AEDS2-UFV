If I had a boat  
Id go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
Id ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat  
  
If I were Roy Rogers  
Id sure enough be single  
I couldnt bring myself to marrying old Dale  
Itd just be me and trigger  
Wed go riding through them movies  
Then wed buy a boat and on the sea wed sail  
  
And if I had a boat  
Id go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
Id ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat  
  
The mystery masked man was smart  
He got himself a Tonto  
Cause Tonto did the dirty work for free  
But Tonto he was smarter  
And one day said kemo sabe  
Kiss my ass I bought a boat  
Im going out to sea  
  
And if I had a boat  
Id go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
Id ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat  
  
And if I were like lightning  
I wouldnt need no sneakers  
Id come and go wherever I would please  
And Id scare em by the shade tree  
And Id scare em by the light pole  
But I would not scare my pony on my boat out on the sea  
  
And if I had a boat  
Id go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
Id ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat
