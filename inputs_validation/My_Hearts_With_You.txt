I know youre leaving  
I wont ask you to stay  
I wont hold you back  
I wont stand in your way  
If thats what youve gotta do I understand  
Its not that easy setting you free  
But thats how its gotta be  
And as youre walking away  
As Im watching you go  
Theres one thing I want you to know  
Just remember my hearts with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no ones there to hold and youre all alone  
Take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find you ever need me someday  
Im just a heartbeat away  
Saying goodbye isnt saying were through  
Just know through it all Im still here for you  
Light a light in the window  
When your lost in the dark ooh  
These arms would be happy to hold you again  
If ever you miss me or when you  
Start thinking about  
All the nights that we shared  
Darling you know Ill be there  
Just remember my hearts with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no ones there to hold and youre all alone  
Take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find you ever need me someday  
You walk to the door with nothing to say  
I look in your eyes and you look away  
Youre leaving me now but darling I hope  
Hope that youll look back someday  
And remember my hearts with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no ones there to hold when youre all alone  
Baby take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find that youre all alone  
Just remember my hearts with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no ones there to hold and youre all alone  
Take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find that youre all alone
