Sister Sadie to Jesse  
  
Strip off your things  
And bow to your queen  
And cleanse the sins of your life  
Get on your knees  
Gonna beg and bleed  
No one hears you  you belong to me  
Reaper of your sorrows seed  
Black habits tonight  
Your only sin  
Was coming into Sadies life  
  
Jesse to Sister Sadie  
  
Sister of No Mercy please  
Im praying to die  
Can I cleanse my orphan sins  
And save my soul tonight  when  
  
I dont believe  
I dont believe  
In a God of love  
I wont deceive  
I dont conceive at all  
  
I dont believe  
I dont believe  
In a God above  
I dont believe  
I wont receive no more  
  
Sister Sadie to Jesse  
  
What I do to thee  
Is what was done to me  
Sins of the fathers lives  
And do you feel  
Theres a God for real  
Ooh your only God is me  
  
Jesse to Sister Sadie  
  
Reaper of my sorrows seed  
And my screams in the night  
My only sin was coming into Sadies life  
Sister of No Mercy please  
Im praying to die  
Can I cleanse my orphan sins  
And save my soul tonight  when  
  
Im fucked for life  
Blind and tied nobody sees  
Im fucked for life  
Im the child no mother needs  
Im fucked for life  
The cries of night for all Sadies needs  
Im fucked for life  
Im the child nobody sees  
  
Sister Sadie to Jesse  
  
Oh you Ill make you think youre dying  
This room cleansing time again  
Ill take you to this House of Sorrows  
Ill break your Neon Heart of sin  
  
Jesse to Sister Sadie  
  
Oh are you mad  
Im going fast  
Habits in black  
No coming back  
No Mercy me  
This Hell is real  
Why me ya see  
Shes here killing me
