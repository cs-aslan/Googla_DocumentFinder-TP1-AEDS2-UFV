She dont care about my car  
She dont care about my money  
And thats real good because I dont got a lot to spend  
But if I did it wouldnt mean nothin  
She likes me for me  
Not because I look like Tyson Beckford  
With the charm of Robert Redford  
Oozing out my ears  
But what she sees  
Are my faults and indecisions  
My insecure conditions  
And the tears upon the pillow that I shed  
She dont care about my big screen  
Or my collection of dvds  
Things like that just never mattered much to her  
Plus she dont watch to much T V  
And she dont care that I can fly her  
To places she aint never been  
But if she really wants to go  
I think deep down she knows that  
All she has to say is when  
She likes me for me  
Not because I hang with Leonardo  
Or that guy who played in Fargo  
I think his name is Steve  
Shes the one for me  
  
And I just cant live without her  
My arms belong around her  
And Im so glad I found her once again  
And Im so glad I found her once again  
And Im so glad I found her once again  
Gazing at the ceiling  
As we entertain our feelings in the dark  
The things that were afraid of are gonna show us  
What were made of in the end  
She likes me for me  
Not because I sing like Pavarotti  
Or because I am such a hottie  
I like her for her  
Not because shes phat like Cindy Crawford  
She has got so much to offer  
Why does she waste all her time with me  
There must be something there that I dont see  
She likes me for me  
Not because Im tough like Dirty Hairy  
Make her laugh just like Jim Carrey  
Unlike the Cable Guy  
But what she sees  
Is that I cant live without her  
My arms belong around her  
And Im so glad I found her once again  
Found her once again  
Im so glad I found her once again  
On again
