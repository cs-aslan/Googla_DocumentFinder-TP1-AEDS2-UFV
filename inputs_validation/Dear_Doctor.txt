Oh help me please doctor Im damaged  
Theres a pain where there once was a heart  
Its sleepin its a beatin  
Cant ya please tear it out and preserve it  
Right there in that jar  
  
Oh help me please mama Im sickning  
Its today thats the day of the plunge  
Oh the gal Im to marry  
Is a bowlegged sow  
Ive been soakin up drink like a sponge  
  
Dont ya worry get dressed cried my mother  
As she plied me with bourbon so sour  
Pull your socks up put your suit on  
Comb your long hair down  
For you will be wed in the hour  
  
So help me please doctor Im damaged  
Theres a pain where there once was a heart  
Im sleepin its a beatin  
Cant ya please take it out and preserve it  
Right there in that jar  
  
Oh help me please doctor Im damaged  
Theres a pain where there once was a heart  
Its sleepin its a beatin  
Cant ya please tear it out and preserve it  
Right there in that jar  
  
I was tremblin as I put on my jacket  
It had creases as sharp as a knife  
I put the ring in my pocket  
But there was a note  
And my heart it jumped into my mouth  
  
It read Darlin Im sorry to hurt you  
But I have no courage to speak to your face  
But Im down in Virginia with your cousin Lou  
There be no wedding today  
  
So help me please doctor Im damaged  
You can put back my heart in its hole  
Oh mama Im cryin  
Tears of relief  
And my pulse is now under control
