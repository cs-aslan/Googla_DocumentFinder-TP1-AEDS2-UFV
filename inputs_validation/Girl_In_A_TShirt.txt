Some girls gotta get coco chanel  
Some get the luck of the draw  
I got a girl lookin naturally well  
Hippest chick you ever saw  
She like wearin powder and paint  
Wheelin in a big Seville  
Shes big cheese with the maitre Ds  
Down at the bar and grill  
Just a girl in a tshirt  
Girl in a tshirt  
Her reputation precedes her  
In every boutique around  
They get down on their knees to please her  
Shes throwin that money down  
Now dont get it wrong please understand  
Shes barely keepin up with the rent  
But the finer labels and her car phone  
Keep her down to her very last cent  
Just a girl in a tshirt  
Girl in a tshirt  
Everybody digs her everybody try  
Once you get past that femme fatale  
Everybody knows shes fine  
I had to get it and quit it and keep a cool head  
It took me a pass or two  
But her codes done cracked I want you to know  
Shes my baby through and through  
Just a girl in a tshirt  
Girl in a tshirt
