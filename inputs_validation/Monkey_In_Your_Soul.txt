I got one and you want four  
Its so hard to help you  
I cant keep up with you no more  
And you treat me like its a sin  
But you cant lock me in  
You want me here with you right to the end  
No thank you my friend  
I fear the monkey in your soul  
  
Wont you turn that bebop down  
I cant hear my heart beat  
Wheres that fatback chord I found  
Honey dont you think it was wrong  
To interrupt my song  
Ill pack my things and run so far from here  
Goodbye dear  
  
I fear the monkey in your soul
