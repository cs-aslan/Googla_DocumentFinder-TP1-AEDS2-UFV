Take a thousand pinup girls to stepney to bombay  
Take me to fancy restaurants to be amongst the whole milay  
And all the blueeyed gals of 6 foot 3  
Are gonna leave you broken down on your knees  
Cause in the golden locks and their fluttering lashes  
You say I told you all day long  
  
Never never trust a blonde  
Yeah never never trust a blonde  
Just when you thought it was safe to get it on  
Watch out for their teeth boys you never trust a blonde  
  
I been dreaming of clinches  
With scene stealing wenches  
And stars of hollywood and Vine  
Too many goofs and hamfisted moves and blaming it on the wine  
Now your best bets a hung lovin brunette  
Make it quick boys cause I aint got long  
And turn your back on the girl in black  
You never trust a blonde  
  
Never never trust a blonde  
Yeah never never trust a blonde  
Forget all that stuff about admen like my own father  
My daddy said rocky dont even trust your mom  
  
They all queue in line they wanna see me hung drawn and quartered  
Sure as anight on the moon shine a recipe for leaving me slaughtered  
So beware of the smell and the lies they all tell  
One line from a fair blues song  
Im telling you mate when the hour gets late  
You cannot trust a blonde  
  
Never never trust a blonde  
Yeah never never trust a blonde  
You think you can hide behind peroxide then you got it wrong so wrong  
Watch out for their teeth boys never trust a blonde  
  
Here comes another never trust a blonde  
She could be a mother never trust a blonde  
Even in China they never trust a blonde  
She minght be a blinder never trust a blonde  
Never ever rush em never trust a blonde  
Its best if I crush em never trust a blonde  
One more for good luck never trust a blonde  
Squeeze in another never trust a blonde
