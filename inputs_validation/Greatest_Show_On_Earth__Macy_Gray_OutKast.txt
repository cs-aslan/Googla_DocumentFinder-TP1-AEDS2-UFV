How yall feelin tonight  
I dont give a damn  
  
Mama I leavin way from home  
To join the circus  
And Papa Im going to that place  
Where the clowns get down  
Sister I know that there are lions  
Tigers and Bears  
Ill be safe fo sure call you when I get there  
  
Chorus  
Aint nothin like the  
Greatest Show On Earth  
What you want What you need  
Wanna drank wanna cheat  
I got it I got it  
  
Mama Im movin up to  and cotton candy  
And Papanext week theyll let me sit  
On the trapeez  
Uncle you should see all these dancing girls and every night I get to sleep
under the big top  
  
Chorus
