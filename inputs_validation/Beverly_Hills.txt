Where I come from isnt all that great  
My automobile is a piece of crap  
My fashion sense is a little whack  
And my friends are just as screwy as me  
  
I didnt go to boarding schools  
Preppie girls never looked at me  
Why should they  
I aint nobody got nothing in my pocket  
  
Beverly Hills thats where I want to be  
Livin in Beverly Hills  
Beverly Hills rolling like a celebrity  
Livin in Beverly Hills  
  
Look at all those movie stars  
Theyre all so beautiful and clean  
When the housemaids scrub the floors  
They get the spaces in between  
  
I want to live a life like that  
I want to be just like a king  
Take my picture by the pool  
Cause Im the next big thing  
  
Beverly Hills thats where I want to be  
Livin in Beverly Hills  
Beverly Hills rolling like a celebrity  
Livin in Beverly Hills  
  
The truth is I dont stand a chance  
Its something that youre born into  
And I just dont belong  
  
No I dont Im just a noclass beat down fool  
And I will always be that way  
I might as well enjoy my life  
And watch the stars play  
  
Beverly Hills thats where I want to be  
Livin in Beverly Hills  
Beverly Hills  rolling like a celebrity  
Livin in Beverly Hills  
  
Beverly Hills Beverly Hills  
Beverly Hills Beverly Hills livin in Beverly Hills
