Its just heartbreaking  
I should have known that it would let me down  
Its just a mind aching  
I used to dream about this town  
It was a sight to see the place to be  
Where the living is easy  
And the kicks can always be found  
  
Its such a shame about it  
I used to think that it would feel so good  
But whos to blame about it  
So many creeps in Hollywood  
Im in this dumb motel near the Taco Bell  
Without a hope in hell I cant believe that Im still around  
  
Aint nothing new in my life today  
Aint nothing true its all gone away  
  
Ive had too much cryin seen too much grief  
Im sick of tryin its beyond belief  
Im tired of talking on the telephone  
Theyre trying to tell me that theyre not at home  
  
Aint nothing new in my life today  
Im tired of walking from place to place  
Ive yet to come across a friendly face  
And now the words sound familiar as them slam the door  
Youre not what were looking for  
  
Aint nothing new in my life today  
Aint nothing true its all gone away  
  
If we only had time only had time for you  
If we only had time only had time for you  
If we only had time only had time for you  
  
It was a heartbreaking  
Now I ride in the big fine car  
It was mind aching  
Im the talk of the boulevard  
So keep your chin up boy forget the pain  
I know youll make it if you try again  
Theres no use in quitting  
When the world is waiting for you
