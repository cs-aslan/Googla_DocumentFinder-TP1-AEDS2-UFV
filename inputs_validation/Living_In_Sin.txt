I dont need no license  
To sign on no line  
And I dont need no preacher  
To tell me youre mine  
I dont need no diamonds  
I dont need no new bride  
I just need you baby  
To look me in the eye  
I know they have a hard time  
And your Daddy dont approve  
But I dont need you Daddy  
Telling us what we should do  
  
Now theres a million questions  
I could ask about our lives  
But I only need one answer  
To get me thought the night  
So I say  
  
Baby can you tell me  
Just where we fit in  
I call it love  
They call it living in sin  
Is it you and me  
Or just this world we live in  
I say were living on love  
They say were living in sin  
  
Is it right for both our parents  
Who fight it out most nights  
Then pray for Gods forgiveness  
When they both turn out the lights  
Or wear that ring of diamonds  
When you heart is made of stone  
You can talk but still say nothing  
You stay together but alone  
  
Or is it right to hold you  
And kiss your lips goodnight  
They say the promise is forever  
If you sign it on the dotted line  
  
Oh baby can you tell me  
Just where we fit in  
I call it love  
They call it living in sin  
Is it you and me or  
Just this world we live in  
I say were living on love  
They say were living in sin  
  
Baby can you tell me  
Just where we fit in  
I call it love  
They call it living in sin  
Is it you and me or  
Just this world we live in  
I call it love  
They call it living in sin  
I dont know where to begin  
I dont know where we fit in  
Living in sin
