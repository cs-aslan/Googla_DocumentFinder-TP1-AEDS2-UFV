Ive got you rainbows seen your sunbeams  
I know a place where heaven breathes  
And its through her window  
Your baby girls window  
  
I know youre happy where you are  
Singing to the moon talking to the stars  
Through her window  
Your baby girls window  
  
Theres fingermarks around her soul  
But your laughter fills the hole  
Through her window  
Your baby girls window  
  
Aaah I wish you would stay  
Aaah to see what she made of herself  
  
People say you were gone too soon  
I see your face when flowers bloom  
Through her window  
Your baby girls window  
Im looking for the words to say  
Something to take her pain away  
Through her window  
Aaah I wish you would stay  
Aaah to see what she made of herself
