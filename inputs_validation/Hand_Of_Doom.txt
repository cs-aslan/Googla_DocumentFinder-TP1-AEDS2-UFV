What you gonna do Times caught up with you  
Now you wait your turn you know theres no return  
  
Take your written rules you join the other fools  
Turn to something new now its killing you  
First it was the bomb Vietnam napalm  
Disillusioning you push the needle in  
From life you escape realitys that way  
Colours in your mind satisfy your time  
  
Youre having a good time  
But that wont last  
You make a fool of things  
Youre living too fast  
Go on and destroy yourself  
Dont bottle it in  
You need someone to help you  
To put the needle in yeah  
  
Now you know the scene your skin starts turning green  
Your eyes no longer see lifes reality  
Push the needle in face deaths sickly grin  
Holes are in your skin caused by deadly pin  
  
Head starts spinning round you fall down to the ground  
Feel your body heave Deaths hands starts to weave  
Its too late to turn you dont want to learn  
Price of life its high now youre gonna die
