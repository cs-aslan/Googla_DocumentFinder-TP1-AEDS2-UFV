Every time you go  
This much I know  
That it didnt mean nothing  
Cause Ive closed the back door  
Every night apart  
You were in my heart  
So dont you worry  
Cause Im ready for this love to restart  
There is a reason  
We came together  
Rain or shine  
Ill love you all my life  
Well weather the seasons  
Well laugh and cry  
Rain or shine  
Im yours youre mine  
Ill love you all my life  
When I feel afraid  
In my own parade  
That marches through me  
And I dont recognize a single face  
You drew a line in the sand  
Then you took my hand  
And we crossed over  
Now I finally understand that  
There is a reason  
We came together  
Rain or shine  
Ill love you all my life  
Well weather the seasons  
Well laugh and cry  
Rain or shine  
Im yours youre mine  
Ill love you all my life
