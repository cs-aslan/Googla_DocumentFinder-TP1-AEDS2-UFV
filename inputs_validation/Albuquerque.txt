Well they say that Santa Fe is less than ninety miles away  
And I got time to roll a number and rent a car  
Oh Albuquerque  
  
Ive been flyin down the road and Ive been starvin to be alone  
And independent from the scene that Ive known  
Albuquerque  
  
So Ill stop when I can find some fried eggs and country ham  
Ill find somewhere where they dont care who I am  
Oh Albuquerque  
Albuquerque
