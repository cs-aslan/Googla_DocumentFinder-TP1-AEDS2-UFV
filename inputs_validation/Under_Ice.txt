Its wonderful  
Everywhere so white  
The river has frozen over  
Not a soul on the ice  
Only me skating fast  
Im speeding past trees  
Leaving little lines in the ice  
Cotting out little lines in the ice  
Splitting splitting sound  
Silver heels spitting spitting snow  
  
Sonar says  deep   
  
Theres something moving under  
Under the ice moving  
Under ice through water  
Trying to  
Its me  
Get out of the cold water  
Its me  
Something  
Its me  
Someone help them  
  
Wake up
