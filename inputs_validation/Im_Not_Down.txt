If its true that a rich man leads a sad life  
N thats what they from day to day  
Then what do all the poor do with their lives  
Have nothing to say on judgment day  
  
Ive been beat up Ive been thrown  
Out but Im not down Im not down  
Ive been shown up but Ive grown up  
And Im not down Im not down  
  
On my own I faced a gang of jeering in strange streets  
When my nerves were pumping and I  
Fought my fear in I did not run  
I was not done  
  
And I have lived that kind of day  
When one of your sorrows will go away  
It goes down and down and hit the floor  
Down and down and down some more  
Depression  
But I now therell be some way  
When I can swing everything back my way  
Like skyscrapers rising up  
Floor by floor Im not giving up  
  
So you rock around and think that  
Youre the toughest  
In the world the whole wide world  
But youre streets away from where  
It gets the roughest  
You aint been there
