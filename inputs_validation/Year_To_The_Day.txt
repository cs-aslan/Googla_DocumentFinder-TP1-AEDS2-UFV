I woke up to yet another day  
Grown to expect expect more of the same  
Except for for a subtle change  
And that is Im slowly fading away  
Harvest moon soon will pass  
Crop is gone left only chaff  
A bitter pill and an overcast  
A flag unfurled at half mast  
Ahhhhh  
  
A year to the day  
Since you went away  
A moment in time  
When you were last mine  
Im here standing still  
Yeah With more time to kill  
Hey I barely survived  
Yeah I barely survived  
  
Like pouring salt on an open wound  
Memory filling filling this empty room  
Im as bare Im as bare as a barren womb  
Still like the air in a whitewash tomb  
Ahhhhh  
  
A year to the day  
Since you went away  
A moment in time  
When you were last mine  
Im here standing still  
Hey With more time to kill  
I barely survived  
Yes I barely survived  
  
Ahhhhh  
  
A year to the day  
Since you went away  
A moment in time  
When you were last mine  
Im here standing still  
Been standin still With more time to kill  
Hey I barely survived  
I barely survived  
  
A year to the day  
Year to the day  
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah  
A year to the day  
Three sixtyfive  
Three sixtyfive five fiiive  
  
Ahhhhh
