If I didnt try how would I know how would I know  
If I didnt try how would I know how would I know  
Sometimes I think I must be crazy for doing this  
Think Im never gonna win  
But how would I know its a losing cause  
If I didnt try if I didnt try  
If I didnt try if I didnt try  
If I didnt care nothing would hurt nothing would hurt  
If I didnt care hope for the best expect the worst  
Sometimes it feels like my whole life has been leading to this  
Wish that I could hide somewhere  
But how would I know how it feels to live  
If I didnt care if I didnt care  
If I didnt care if I didnt care  
Sometimes I think I must be crazy for doing this  
You can never run away  
But how would I know its a losing cause  
If I didnt try if I didnt try  
If I didnt try if I didnt try
