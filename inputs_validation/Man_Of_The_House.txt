Well I aint proud of what Im about to do  
All alone up here with you  
With the picture of your man  
Face down upon the night stand so he cant see  
And I dont like running all the red lights here  
Every time the coast is clear  
Any time you need my lovin  
You know Ill come running faithfully  
  
Chorus  
Cause he stays so busy with his money  
And you you get so lonely when hes gone  
And me Im just your temporary lover  
Til your blues are gone  
Im the man of the house whenever he aint home  
  
Now the statues on the side of that big gate  
Theyre laughing as I drive away  
And I cant keep from thinking  
Are they laughing at your old man or at me  
And the only part that I dont like to play  
Is the part when I get up and go away  
I find it mighty hard  
Just keeping this old heart tucked away  
Cause he stays  
  
Chorus  
  
Im the man of the house  
When your other man aint home
