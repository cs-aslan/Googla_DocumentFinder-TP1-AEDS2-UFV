Aint much for promises  
But Im a fool for your sweet caress  
Dont mean to be obsessed  
But all that I can do is guess  
And when I miss you  
I try to keep my head  
But when I kiss you  
My heart speaks out instead  
Say do you say wont you say you love me  
Say do you say that you need me still  
Say wont you say that well stay together  
Say we always will  
And if its someone else  
Id rather be just by myself  
Your honesty would help  
Right now it seems so hard to tell  
Dont wanna worry  
But is our love alive  
Im in a hurry  
My feelings I cant hide  
Say do you say wont you say you love me  
Say do you say that you need me still  
Say wont you say that well stay together  
Say we always will  
Faithfully yours my love is real babe  
If that is what you want then Ill be there  
Cause I feel so sure this is the real thing  
My heart with you will stay yeah  
Say do you say  
Say do you say  
Say wont you say that well stay together  
Say we always will  
And when I miss you  
I try to keep my head  
Cause when I kiss you  
My heart speaks out instead  
Say do you say wont you say you love me  
Say do you say that you need me still  
Say wont you say that well stay together  
Say we always will  
Say do you say wont you say you love me  
Say do you say that you need me still  
Say wont you say that well stay together  
Say we always will  
Say do you say  
Say do you say  
Say wont you say that well stay together  
Say we always will  
Say do you say wont you say you love me
