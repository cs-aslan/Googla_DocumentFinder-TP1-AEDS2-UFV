Wildflowers grow everywhere  
Vibrations flow things will have to change  
good evening madam Its a recording Yes  
Strange new ideas fill the air  
Some people leave others grieve  
Some were bare but things will change  
Old concepts go new ones grow  
All at once the world begins to love again

Seeds of hatred  
Plant them and soon they will breed
