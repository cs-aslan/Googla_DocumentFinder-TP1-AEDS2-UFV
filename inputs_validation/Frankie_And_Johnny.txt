Now Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts oh Lord how they could love  
Swore to be true to each other true as the stars above  
He was her man but he wasnt doin her wrong  
Now Frankie went down to the corner just for a bucket of beer  
She said Mr Bartender has my loving Johnny been here  
Hes my man he wouldnt do me wrong  
I dont want to cause you no trouble woman I aint gonna lie  
But I saw your lover an hour ago with a girl named Nellie Blie  
Hes your man but hes doin you wrong  
Now Frankie looked over with transom she saw to her surprise  
There on the cab sat Johnny making love to Nellie Blie  
Hes my man but hes doin me wrong  
Frankie went back to comoda took out her little 44  
Rutty tootoo three times she shot right through that hardwood door  
Shot her man he was doin her wrong  
  
Now bring out your rubber tied hearses bring out the rubber tied hatch  
Im taken said the man to the graveyard but only six of em called him back  
He was my man but he done me wrong  
Bring round a thousand policemen bring em around today  
To lock me down in that dungeon cell and throw that key away  
I shot my man he was doin me wrong  
Now Frankie she said to the warden what are they goin to do  
The warden he said to Frankie its the electric chair for you  
You shot your man he was doin you wrong

This story just goes to show that there aint no good in man  
He was her man but he done her wong
