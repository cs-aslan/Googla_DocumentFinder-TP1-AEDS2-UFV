Im confessin that I love you  
Tell me do you love me too  
Im confessin that I need you  
Honest I do need you every moment  
In your eyes I read such strange things  
But your lips deny theyre true  
Will your answer really change things  
Making me blue  
  
Im afraid some day youll leave me  
Saying cant we still be friends  
If you go you know youll grieve me  
All in life on you depends  
Am I guessin that you love me  
Dreaming dreams of you in vain  
Im confessin that I love you over again
