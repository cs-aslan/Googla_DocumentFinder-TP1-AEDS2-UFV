Road trippin with my two favorite allies  
Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies  
Its time to leave this town  
Its time to steal away  
Lets go get lost  
Anywhere in the USA  
  
Lets go get lost  
Lets go get lost  
  
Chorus  
Blue you sit so pretty  
West of the one  
Sparkles light with yellow icing  
Just a mirror for the sun  
Just a mirror for the sun  
Just a mirror for the sun  
  
These Smiling eyes are just a mirror for  
So much as come before those battles lost and won  
This life is shining more forever in the sun  
Now let us check our heads  
And let us check the surf  
Staying high and drys  
More trouble than its worth  
In the sun  
  
Just a mirror for the sun  
Just a mirror for the sun  
Just a mirror for the sun  
  
These Smiling eyes are just a mirror for  
In Big Sur we take some time to linger on  
We three hunky dorys got our snake finger on  
Now let us drink the stars  
Its time to steal away  
Lets go get lost  
Right here in the USA  
  
Chorus  
  
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for  
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for  
Your smiling eyes are just a mirror for
