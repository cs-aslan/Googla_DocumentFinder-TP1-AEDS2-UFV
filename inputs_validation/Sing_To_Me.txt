Sundown summer is fading  
Run now here the winter comes  
Deep down in some snowdrift  
Frozen fire thought you found the lift  
  
Its a showdown its a Mexican standoff  
And the river is the prize  
To float away on her current  
To the sea lover to the sea  
  
And I know theres a song in the wind to the sky  
And I know theres a song somewhere for you and I  
What I dont know is if well hear it  
Im losin spirit woman sing to me
