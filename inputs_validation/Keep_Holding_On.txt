Your sad eyes never told me  
No paradise here for the lonely  
But I hold on half a heart here in my hands  
Been so long would you know me  
Whose holding you whose gonna hold me  
If you want me then Ill be your man  
  
And I keep holding on  
Holding on till you come back to me  
And I keep holding on  
Holding on till you run to me  
Can you take me to heaven  
Show me the way cause Im no angel  
I am lost and  
Can I hold you one more time  
I guess me holding you was holding you down  
  
Will I have your memory  
Or will your memory have me  
I dont know only time  
Knows if Ill ever know peace of mind  
Only time knows if youre mine if youre mine  
  
And I keep holding on  
Holding on till you come back to me  
And I keep holding on  
Holding on till you run to me  
All I can hold is a shadow of a heart thats gone  
And left me shattered  
Im lost and  
Can I hold you one more time  
I guess me holding you was holding you down Repeat x2
