If a ship of dreams bid me come would I board it  
If I had their gold in my hands would I hoard it  
If I knew the trials I must face would I carry on at all  
Sail into tomorrow living day to day  
  
Thats all I can afford to do and all Ill ever pay  
Is a song to sing to thank you for making me alive  
And a prayer to bring me comfortLord help us to survive  
If his pretty eyes shone my way would I leave you  
  
If I wasnt sure he would stay would I deceive you  
If I had to melt you with promises would they stand or fall  
Sail into tomorrow living day to day  
Thats all I can afford to do and all Ill ever pay  
  
Is a song to sing to thank you for making me alive  
And a prayer to bring you comfortLord help us to survive  
If time should call me a fool would I laugh or would I care  
Sail into tomorrow living day to day  
  
Thats all I can afford to do and all Ill ever pay  
Is a song to sing to thank you for making me alive  
And a prayer to bring you comfortLord help us to survive
