The wind is in from Africa  
Last night I couldnt sleep  
Oh you know it sure is hard to leave here Carey  
But its really not my home  
My fingernails are filthy I got beach tar on my feet  
And I miss my clean white linen and my fancy French cologne  
  
Oh Carey get out your cane  
And Ill put on some silver  
Oh youre a mean old Daddy but I like you fine  
  
Come on down to the Mermaid Cafe and I will buy you a bottle of wine  
And well laugh and toast to nothing and smash our empty glasses down  
Lets have a round for these freaks and these soldiers  
A round for these friends of mine  
Lets have another round for the bright red devil  
Who keeps me in this tourist town  
  
Come on Carey get out your cane  
Ill put on some silver  
Oh youre a mean old Daddy but I like you  
  
Maybe Ill go to Amsterdam  
Or maybe Ill go to Rome  
And rent me a grand piano and put some flowers round my room  
But lets not talk about faretheewelIs now  
The night is a starry dome  
And theyre playin that scratchy rock and roll  
Beneath the Matalla Moon  
  
Come on Carey get out your cane  
And Ill put on some silver  
Youre a mean old Daddy but I like you  
  
The wind is in from Africa  
Last night I couldnt sleep  
Oh you know it sure is hard to leave here  
But its really not my home  
Maybe its been too long a time  
Since I was scramblin down in the street  
Now they got me used to that clean white linen  
And that fancy French cologne  
  
Oh Carey get out your cane  
Ill put on my finest silver  
Well go to the Mermaid Cafe  
Have fun tonight  
I said Oh youre a mean old Daddy but youre out of sight
