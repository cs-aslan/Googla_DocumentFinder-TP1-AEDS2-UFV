I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong  
To crash the critics saying is it right or is it wrong  
If only fame had an IV baby could I bear  
Being away from you I found the vein put it in here  
  
I live for the applause applause applause  
I live for the applauseplause live for the applauseplause  
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me  
The applause applause applause  
  
Give me that thing that I love Turn the lights on  
Put your hands up make em touch touch Make it real loud  
Give me that thing that I love Turn the lights on  
Put your hands up make em touch touch Make it real loud  
  
APPLAUSE Make it real loud  
Put your hands up make em touch touch  
APPLAUSE Make it real loud  
Put your hands up make em touch touch  
  
Ive overheard your theory  
Nostalgias for geeks  
I guess sir if you say so  
Some of us just like to read  
  
One second Im a Kunst  
Then suddenly the Kunst is me  
Pop culture was in art  
Now arts in pop culture in me  
  
I live for the applause applause applause  
I live for the applauseplause live for the applauseplause  
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me  
The applause applause applause  
  
Give me that thing that I love Turn the lights on
