Out of time  
Out of luck  
Thought I was just dreamin  
Then I woke up  
You said it was over  
The end of the line  
Im telling everybody Im fine  
But Im just  
  
Climbing up mount everest  
I swear its like  
Crawling from here to Memphis  
Knocked senseless like  
Digging a hole to china to find  
You dont love me anymore  
  
Night after night  
I come home  
Watch it on the news who else was overthrown  
I dont understand it  
As hard as I try  
But I keep crossing over the great divide  
And its like  
  
Climbing up mount everest  
I swear its like  
Crawling from here to Memphis  
Knocked senseless like  
Digging a hole to china to find  
You dont love me anymore  
  
Shine the light  
Ring the bell  
I guess you dont love me  
Well well  
Ill go on  
Ill survive  
I dont know how but Ill try  
Taken from real as I want to bealbum leaflet by sunny
