Ive been waitin for this scene to end  
I dont need somebody baby I need a friend  
I work all day just like doin time  
Ive stood tall through the fires of hell  
And Ive walked through enemy lines  
  
So now youve gone and built a wall around you  
Its gonna take a heart to knock it down too  
Deep cuts the night when youre without love  
Deep cuts the night when youre without love  
Deep cuts the night and its bringing me down its bringing me down  
  
If I could be the hero in your masquerade  
I could sweep you off your feet and take you far away  
There aint no saviors in the real world  
Theres only broken hearts and souls for you and me girl  
  
Now youve gone and built a wall around you  
Its gonna take a heart to knock it down too  
Deep cuts the night when youre without love  
Deep cuts the night when youre without love  
Deep cuts the night when youre without love  
Deep cuts the night well its bringing me down  
  
So load your guns and fire away  
All it takes is one fair shot to blow your world away  
  
Deep cuts the night when youre without love  
Deep cuts the night when youre without love  
Deep cuts the night and its bringin me down its bringin me down
