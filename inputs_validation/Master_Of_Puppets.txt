End of passion play crumbling away  
Im your source of selfdestruction  
Veins that pump with fear sucking darkest clear  
Leading on your deaths construction  
  
Taste me you will see  
More is all you need  
Dedicated to  
How Im killing you  
  
Come crawling faster  
Obey your master  
Your life burns faster  
Obey your master  
Master  
  
Master of puppets Im pulling your strings  
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams  
Blinded by me you cant see a thing  
Just call my name cause Ill hear you scream  
Master  
Master  
Just call my name cause Ill hear you scream  
Master  
Master  
  
Needlework the way never you betray  
Life of death becoming clearer  
Pain monopoly ritual misery  
Chop your breakfast on a mirror  
  
Taste me you will see  
More is all you need  
Youre dedicated to  
How Im killing you  
  
Come crawling faster  
Obey your master  
Your life burns faster  
Obey your master  
Master  
  
Master of puppets Im pulling your strings  
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams  
Blinded by me you cant see a thing  
Just call my name cause Ill hear you scream  
Master  
Master  
Just call my name cause Ill hear you scream  
Master  
Master  
  
Master master wheres the dreams that Ive been after  
Master master you promised only lies  
Laughter laughter all I hear or see is laughter  
Laughter laughter laughing at my cries  
Fix Me  
  
Hell is worth all that natural habitat  
Just a rhyme without a reason  
Never ending maze drift on numbered days  
Now your life is out of season  
  
I will occupy  
I will help you die  
I will run through you  
Now I rule you too  
  
Come crawling faster  
Obey your master  
Your life burns faster  
Obey your master  
Master  
  
Master of puppets Im pulling your strings  
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams  
Blinded by me you cant see a thing  
Just call my name cause Ill hear you scream  
Master  
Master  
Just call my name cause Ill hear you scream  
Master  
Master
