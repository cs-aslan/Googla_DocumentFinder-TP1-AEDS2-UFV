Why does she sing  
Her sad songs for me  
Im not the one  
To tenderly bring  
Her soft sympathy  
Ive just begun  
To see my way clear  
And its plain  
If I stop I will fall  
I can lay down a tear  
For her pain  
Just a tear and thats all  
  
What does she want me to do  
She says that she knows  
That moments are rare  
I suppose that its true  
Then on she goes  
To say I dont care  
And she knows  
That I do  
  
Maybe she just has to sing for the sake of the song  
And who do I think that I am to decide that shes wrong  
  
Shed like to think that Im cruel  
But she knows thats a lie  
For I would be  
No more than a tool  
If I allowed her to cry  
All over me  
  
Oh my sorrow is real  
Even though  
I cant change my plan  
If she could see how I feel  
Then I know  
That shed understand  
  
Oh does she actually think Im to blame  
Does she really believe  
That some word of mine  
Can relieve  
All her pain  
Cant she see that she grieves  
Just because shes been blindly deceived  
By her shame  
  
Nothins what it seems  
Maybe shell start someday  
To realize  
If she abandons her dreams  
Then all the words she can say  
Are only lies  
When will she see  
That to gain  
Is only to lose  
All that she offers me  
Are her chains  
I got to refuse  
  
Oh but its only to herself that shes lied  
She likes to pretend  
Its something that she must defend  
With her pride  
And I dont intend  
To stand her and be the friend  
From whom she must hide
