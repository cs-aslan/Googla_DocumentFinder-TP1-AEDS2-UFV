You better watch out  
Im tellin you why  
Just when you least expect it  
Just when you feel at ease  
Thats when you get selected  
Thats when theyll come youll see  
So many stray transmissions  
Theres nothing you can do  
So many liquid rhythms  
Theyd fill a swimming pool  
Beamed from the highest mountain  
Nowhere left for you to go  
Theyll take you even higher  
Than youve ever been before  
But theres no need to worry  
First youll dip into a dream  
And in your mind its comin  
Like so many bright ideas  
Its all about the happen  
Its way beyond fantastic  
Its useless to resist it  
When youre finally hit with  
Pink jazz trancers  
Jazz trance for you  
Wait just for a minute  
Lay down here next to me  
Jazz trance for you  
No need for you to hurry  
Turn on the cable TV  
Jazz trance for you  
Lets close our eyes together  
Now cant you see how good  
Its gonna be
