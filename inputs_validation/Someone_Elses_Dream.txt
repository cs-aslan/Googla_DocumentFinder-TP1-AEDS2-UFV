Her mommas still got that sequin gown that she wore in 68  
She taught her early how to smile that smile and wave from the parade  
It took a whole lot of years and tears  
For her momma to finally admit  
No matter how many stitches and pins  
That old dress was never gonna fit  
  
She was daddys little girl  
Mommas little angel  
Teachers pet pageant queen  
She said All my life Ive been pleasin everyone but me  
Living someone elses dream  
  
Her daddy used to say Youll make a lovely bride someday  
Hell ride up on big white horse and just carry you away  
It took twentyfive years and some broken vows  
Before theyd finally see  
Theres a little more to love and life  
Then fairy tales and hand me down dreams  
  
She was daddys little girl  
Mommas little angel  
Teachers pet pageant queen  
She said All my life Ive been pleasin everyone but me  
Living someone elses dream  
  
Now shes got twentyseven candles on her cake  
And she means to make her life her own  
Before theres twentyeight  
  
She was daddys little girl  
Mommas little angel  
Teachers pet pageant queen  
She said All my life Ive been pleasin everyone but me  
Living someone elses dream  
  
She was daddys little girl  
Mommas little angel  
Teachers pet pageant queen  
She said All my life Ive been pleasin everyone but me  
Living someone elses dream
