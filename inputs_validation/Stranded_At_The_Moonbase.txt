A long way up in lightyears  
Just a pinpoint in space  
In a century of planetary storms  
Stranded at the moonbase  
The air is getting low  
The air is getting low  
Looking out at the roofwindow  
Ive seen many strange things  
From shooting stars to Stars n Stripes  
Thought Id caught a glimpse of golden wings  
The air is getting low  
The air is getting low  
The air is getting low  
The air is getting low  
I got the vision of a big white dove  
Ive heard the creaking of the pearly gates above  
Im wondring why the big white dove  
Is keeping me waiting keeping me waiting  
Keeping me waiting keeping me waiting  
Keeping me waiting keeping me waiting  
Looking way down below me  
The worlds are all awhirlwhirly  
Wont you come along beside  
This place waits for company  
The air is getting low  
The air is getting low  
I leave my limbs behind me  
As Im being lifted  
Out into the into the  
Spiritual boomboom abyss  
The air is getting low  
The air is getting low  
The air is getting low  
The air is getting low  
I got the vision of a big white dove  
Ive heard the creaking of the pearly gates above  
Im wondring why the big white dove  
Is keeping me waiting keeping me waiting  
Keeping me waiting keeping me waiting  
Keeping me waiting keeping me waiting
