He sits behind his microphone  
Johnny Carson  
He speaks in such a manly tone  
Johnny Carson  
Ed McMahon comes on and says Heres Johnny  
Every night at eleven thirty hes so funny  
Its nice to have you on the show tonight  
Ive seen your act in Vegas out of sight  
When guests are boring he fills up the slack  
Johnny Carson  
The network makes him break his back  
Johnny Carson  
Ed McMahon comes on and says Heres Johnny  
Every night at eleven thirty hes so funny  
Dont you think hes such a natural guy  
The way hes kept it up could make you cry  
Whos a man that we admire  
Johnny Carson is a real live wire  
Whos a man that we admire  
Johnny Carson is a real live wire  
Whos a man that we admire  
Johnny Carson is a real live wire  
Whos the man that we admire  
Johnny Carson is a real live wire
