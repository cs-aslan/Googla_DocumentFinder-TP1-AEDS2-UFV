Its too late to change your mind  
Even though this fragile world  
Is tearing apart at the seams  
We cant wash these sins away  
This sinking feeling everyday  
Im waking up in someone elses life  
  
Is it so hard for you  
Cause its so hard for me  
To believe that what we dreamed  
Could ever come to life again  
Cause I cannot erase this lie  
  
Not gonna let this day go by  
Im gonna save this wasted life  
And nothing can stand in my way  
Not enough to say goodbye  
Burn it til theres nothing left  
Im drowning in the mess that I have made  
  
Is it so hard for you  
Cause its so hard for me  
To believe that what we dreamed  
Could ever come to life again  
Cause I cannot erase this lie  
  
The waters rising around us  
There is no other way down  
I only have myself to blame for it all  
  
Is it so hard for you  
Cause its so hard for me  
To believe that what we dreamed  
Could ever come to life again  
If I could just erase my mind  
But I cannot erase this lie
