Once again you tried to show me  
What my eyes refused to see  
In the lines between the painful scene were in  
With the silence falling coldly  
On a world of makebelieve  
And the ending that I still dont understand  
  
Chorus  
Its a bad love story  
That Ive had to learn by heart  
Cause Ive lived these lines so many times before  
And its a shame the way the same old ending  
Still tears me apart  
Where the lady still dont love me anymore  
  
I can see the truth before me  
Like a mirror on the wall  
With a crack or two for every fool Ive been  
And I see the lady waiting  
For her countdown curtain call  
And its looking like the place that I came in  
  
Chorus
