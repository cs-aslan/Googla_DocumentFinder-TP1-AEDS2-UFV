Hello blue stranger sittin there all alone  
With your glass of sorrow you seem so far from home  
Maybe you will let me buy a round or two  
Im a blue stranger too  
  
Well hello blue stranger I havent seen your around  
But I know every reason for leavin town  
We might know each other before the night is through  
Im a blue stranger too  
  
And strangers fall in love all the time  
All lovers were strangers once  
Just like us a little unsure chattin out his  
  
Well hello blue stranger will you take a chance  
Well I might be mistaken but I see meaning in your glance  
Maybe this could be the start of something new  
Im a blue stranger too  
  
And strangers fall in love everyday  
All lovers were strangers once  
Just like us a little unsure of our little ways  
  
Well hello blue stranger sittin there all alone  
With your glass of sorrow you seem so far from home  
Maybe you will let me buy you a round or two  
Im a blue stranger too  
  
Hello blue stranger Hello blue stranger  
Hello blue stranger
