I had a friend who spoke of fate  
And he knew of another place in space and time  
He told of how me and my lady  
Could look but we would never find  
Said if you please I beg your pardon  
Sometimes the things you see they just aint so  
Your life can be an avant garden  
Cause loves what makes your garden grow  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our worlds collide  
We wont be denied  
Here inside our avant garden  
Sometimes my life aint what its seemin  
Right from the start its what your hearts believin  
Could all this just be lucid dreamin  
But dreams just aint enough for me  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our worlds collide  
We wont be denied  
Here inside our avant garden  
You know it just aint right  
To deal with others shite  
No one should ever be so broken hearted  
Dont never be afraid  
Cause when you got it made  
Yeah you dont even have to try  
So Ill be waiting in your garden  
Ffffwatching all your flowers grow  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our worlds collide  
Youll know weve arrived  
Here inside our avant gardenyeah yeah  
The sun brings the rain  
The moon needs the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
Beware of the lies  
A word to the wise  
Theres sweet cherry pies  
And truth inside our avant gardenooh ah yea  
Do it do it  
Do it do it  
You can spend your whole lifetime  
Under my skin  
You can be never more mine  
Under my skin
