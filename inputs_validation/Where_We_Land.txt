Treat me beneath this clear night sky  
And I will lie with you  
I start to feel those butterflies  
When Im next to you  
  
Tell me your secrets  
Give me a friend  
Let all the good times flood in  
  
Do I love you Do I hate you  
I cant make up my mind  
So lets free fall  
And see where we land  
  
Its been this way since we were young  
Well fight and then make up  
Ill breathe your air into my lungs  
When I feel your touch  
  
Tell me your secrets  
Give me a friend  
Let all the good times flood in  
  
Do I love you Do I hate you  
I cant make up my mind  
So lets free fall  
And see where we land  
  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
  
Tell me your secrets  
Give me a friend  
Let all the good times flood in  
  
Do I love you Do I hate you  
I cant make up my mind  
So lets free fall  
And see where we land
