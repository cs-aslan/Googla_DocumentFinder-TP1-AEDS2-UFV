What is happening here  
Somethings going on thats not quite clear  
Somebody turn on the lights  
Were gonna have a party  
Its starting tonight  
  
Chorus  
Oh what a feeling  
When were dancing on the ceiling  
Oh what a feeling  
When were dancing on the ceiling  
  
The room is hot and thats good  
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood  
The people startin a climb the walls  
Ooh it looks like everybody is having a ball  
  
Oh what a feeling  
When were dancing on the ceiling  
Oh what a feeling  
When were dancing on the ceiling  
  
Oh what a feeling  
When were dancing on the ceiling  
Oh what a feeling  
When were dancing on the ceiling  
  
Come on  
  
Everybody start to lose control  
When the music is right  
If you see somebody hangin around  
Dont get uptight  
The only thing we want to do tonight  
Is go round and round  
And turn upside down  
Come on Lets get down  
  
So come on Lets get loose  
Dont hold back  
Cause aint no use  
Hard to keep your feet on the ground  
Cause when we like to party  
We only want to get down  
  
Oh what a feeling  
When were dancing on the ceiling  
Oh what a feeling  
When were dancing on the ceiling  
  
Oh what a feeling  
When were dancing on the ceiling  
Oh what a feeling  
When were dancing on the ceiling  
  
Say what  
Cant stop now  
Just getting started  
Everybody clap your hands  
Come on  
Everybody lets dance  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh what a feeling  
When were dancing on the ceiling  
Oh what a feeling  
When were dancing on the ceiling  
  
Oh what a feeling  
When were dancing on the ceiling baby baby  
We gonna dance all night
