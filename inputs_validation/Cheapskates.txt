I have been a washer up  
An he has been a scrubber up  
An I seen him a picking up  
Dog ends in the rain  
An he has never read a book  
Though I told him to take a look  
He lifted his pool hall cue  
For another game  
But it aint no modern miracle  
That we found the golden rule  
What you cant buy you gotta steal  
An what you say cant steal you better leave  
  
I dont like to hang about  
In this lonely room  
Cause London is for going out  
And trying to hear a tune  
But people come pouncing up to me  
And say what are you doing here  
Youre supposed to be a star  
Not a cheapskate bleeding queer  
  
Like a load of rats from a sinking ship  
You slag us down to save your hip  
But you dont give me the benefit  
Of your doubt  
Cause Ill bite it off and spit it out  
  
Were cheapskates anythingll do  
Were cheapskates what are we supposed to do  
An we can rock  
Hey hey lets roll  
An we can walk  
An do the stroll  
  
Just because were in a group  
You think were stinking rich  
N we all got model girls  
Shedding every stitch  
N You think the cocaines flowing  
Like a river up our noses  
N every sea will part for us  
Like the red one did for Moses  
  
Well I hope you make it one day  
Just like you always said you would some day  
And Ill get out my money and make a bet  
That Ill be seein you down the launderette
