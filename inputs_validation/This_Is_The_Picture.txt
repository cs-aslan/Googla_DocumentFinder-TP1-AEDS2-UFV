Excellent birds  
  
Flying birds  
Excellent birds  
Watch them fly there they go  
Falling snow  
Excellent snow  
Here it comes Watch it fall  
  
Long words  
Excellent words  
I can hear them now  
  
This is the picture this is the picture  
This is the picture this is the picture  
  
Im sitting by the window  
Watching the snow fall  
Im looking out  
And Im moving turning in time  
Catching up Moving in  
Jump up I can land on my feet Look out  
  
This is the picture this is the picture  
This is the picture this is the picture  
  
Looking out Watching out  
When I see the future I close my eyes  
I can see it now  
  
I see pictures of people rising up  
Pictures of people falling down  
I see pictures of people  
Theyre standing on their heads theyre ready  
Theyre looking out look out  
Theyre watching out watch out  
Theyre looking out look out  
Theyre watching out watch out  
  
I see pictures of people  
I see pictures of people
