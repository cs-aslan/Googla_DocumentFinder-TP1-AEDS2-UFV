Sometimes I think of all the places where I dont want to go  
Then I think of all the things I dont want to do  
And when I think of all the people I dont want to meet  
I close my eyes and go to sleep  
  
Tully baby youre trapped behind your golden bars  
Im the prince of poverty hangin out in bars  
Your lifes a Mercedes a mansion with a pool  
My lifes on a bus stop just waiting for some fuel  
  
Your obviousness disgusts me I see through your macho lies  
Ill fight everything you stand for  
Theres something in your purse baby my head is getting sore  
Maybe what we had was just green corn
