Well did you ever have something you want the whole wide world to know
about  
Its that something I must tell you that you just cant live without  
Ten times your fingers and double your toes  
Thats how much I love you and how much it shows  
  
CHORUS  
You know that I am  hooked on love  
Ill tell you what I am  hooked on love  
Believe me when I say it  hooked on love  
Hooked on love ohhhh   
  
My brothers and sisters hear what I say  
Im gonna love you to my dying day  
When I tell you that I love you well at least I tried  
I want you to believe me this aint no lie  
  
CHORUS  
  
Satisfy my need in life now let me hear you say  
Youll be lovin me alright until your dyin day

Satisfy my need in life now let me hear you say  
Youll be lovin me alright until your dyin day  
Just say it a little bit louder now Im startin to get in your groove yeah  
Youve got nothing to worry about your love is on the move  
I hope some day the light of love shines bright upon your face  
I dont care who you are I love the human race
