You cant let it get you down  
No no no no no  
No no no no no  
No no oh no no  
Dont let it get you down  
You cant let it get you down  
Just when everything seems to be going alright  
Some unexpected misery enters your life  
Then you ask your self how could this be  
Wondering why Ive been there  
You see your whole world come crashing down  
All at one time  
Your bodies weak from all the worrying  
And so is you mind  
Your walking down that rocky road  
But things will get better  
Cause trouble wont last forever  
Cant let it get you down  
Not now  
Come to far to turn around  
Gotta walk with your head up high  
Believing you can reach the sky  
Cant let it get you down  
Have you ever felt the need to get away from it all  
The person that you care about the most just broke your heart  
Just to be in the same room with them you cant stand the thought  
Ive been there yeah yeah yeah  
You dont know if your relationship is worth holding on  
How much longer can you take being treated so wrong  
Youre confused on what to do but no matter what you do  
Youre gonna make it through yeah  
Cant let it get you down  
Not now  
Come to far to turn around  
Gotta walk with your head up high  
Believing you can reach the sky  
Cant let it get you down  
Oh take it from me  
The only thing you need is a little faith  
The size of a mustard seed  
You may cry through the night but hold on  
Cause joy comes in the morning oh yeah  
In the morning  
Joy comes in the morning  
Have a little faith  
Just a little faith  
And you can make it  
So dont you give up  
Cant let it get you down  
Not now  
Come to far to turn around  
Gotta walk with your head up high  
Believing you can reach the sky  
Cant let it get you down  
Cant let it get you down  
Not now  
Come to far to turn around  
Gotta walk with your head up high  
Believing you can reach the sky  
Cant let it get you down  
Cant let it get you down  
Not now  
Come to far to turn around  
Gotta walk with your head up high  
Believing you can reach the sky  
Cant let it get you down  
Cant let it get you down  
Not now  
Come to far to turn around  
Gotta walk with your head up high  
Believing you can reach the sky  
Cant let it get you down
