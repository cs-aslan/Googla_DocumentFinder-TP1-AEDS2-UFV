Oh baby I dont know why  
But somehow I always seem to  
Get tangled up in my pride  
But oh baby were not that blind  
Deep down inside you know  
This loves worth one more try  
Dont push it all aside  
  
Cause I want to be good for you  
I didnt mean to be bad  
But darling Im still the best  
That you ever had  
Just give me a chance  
To let me show you how much  
I want to give you my love touch  
Love touch  
  
Why cant I climb your walls  
And find somewhere to hide  
Cant I knock down your door  
And drag myself inside  
Ill light your candles baby  
And maybe Ill light your life  
I want to feel the breathless end  
You come to every night  
This ever changing love  
Is pushing me too far  
I feel the need to reach you  
Right now wherever you are  
These empty arms are getting stronger  
  
Every day  
Believe me baby  
They wont let you get away  
No they wont let you get away  
  
Cause I want to be good for you  
I didnt mean to be bad  
But darlin Im still the best  
That you ever had  
Just give me a chance  
To let me show you how much  
I want to give you my love touch  
Love touch  
  
You know it dont matter  
Whos right whos wrong  
Think were gonna find out  
If the love is strong  
Just give me a chance  
To win back your trust  
I want to give you my love touch  
Love touch  
Oh youre gonna get a oh youre gonna get a big love touch
