Try to envision you as the oldest living someone  
Being every night and day all alone  
Going through ages and ages places and spaces  
With never finding that someone to call your own  
  
Like a treasure chest of dreams long forgotten  
Hidden for good in a stolen lost and found  
But just when fate was calling quits  
Love appeared in the midst of despair came and turned your life around  
  
Im new new like the first day of spring  
New like a nightingale thats just learned to sing  
Im new new like the very start of dawn  
Like a child thats first born with your love Im new  
  
Youre standing amongst a crowd of six billion people  
Crying out for help but no one understands  
Cause much to your dismay youve been taken far away  
To a land where joy is pain and sorrows a happy man  
  
Where an aching hearts the sign of the mighty  
And a lovefilled heart looks down upon with fault and shame  
But at the very instant all was through lady lucks appears says love can
do  
And changed you like a Christian whos been born again  
  
Im new new like the fresh morning dew  
New like a work of art thats finally through  
Im new new like a first flight of a dove  
So safe and secure with your love Im new  
  
Love took a long time coming to me  
But Ive gotta say  
I owe my thanks to him for sending you my way hey  
  
Cause Im new new like the first winter snow  
Like the start of forever with infinity to go  
Im new new like the birth of the sun  
Forever young I will be  
  
Cause with your love Im new  
New like from a restful night of sleep  
New like a starving man thats had food to eat  
  
Im new nothing compares nor can compete  
Sharing with you the sweetness of your love Im new
