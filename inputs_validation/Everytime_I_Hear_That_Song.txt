I heard cowboys should never cry  
But there are some things that bring tears to my eyes  
Some old movies theyve shown  
Some old people all alone  
And everytime I hear that song  
  
Everytime I hear that song  
I think of someone who is gone  
And the hurtin starts comin on real strong  
Everytime I hear that song  
  
What makes big old boys like me  
Get down on bended knee  
And todays girl whos moving ahead  
Stay at home all night crying in bed  
Its those old loves that linger on  
Just like some of those good old songs  
  
Everytime I hear that song  
I think of someone who is gone  
And the hurtin starts comin on real strong  
Everytime I hear that song
