Mr Cab Driver wont you stop to let me in  
Mr Cab Driver dont you like my kind of skin  
Mr Cab Driver youre never gonna win  
  
Mr Cab Driver wont stop to pick me up  
Mr Cab Driver I might need some help  
Mr Cab Driver only thinks about himself  
  
Mr Cab Driver  
Mr Cab Driver  
  
Mr Cab Driver dont like to way I look  
He dont like dreads he thinks were all crooks  
Mr Cab Driver reads too many story books  
  
Mr Cab Driver pass me up with eyes of fire  
Mr Cab Driver thinks were all 165ers  
Mr Cab Driver fuck you Im a survivor

Mr Cab Driver  
Mr Cab Driver
