Im taking a ride  
With my best friend  
I hope he never lets me down again  
He knows where hes taking me  
Taking me where I want to be  
Im taking a ride  
With my best friend  
Were flying high  
Were watching the world pass us by  
Never want to come down  
Never want to put my feet back down  
On the ground  
Im taking a ride  
With my best friend  
I hope he never lets me down again  
Promises me Im as safe as houses  
As long as I remember whos wearing the trousers  
I hope he never lets me down again  
Never let me down  
See the stars theyre shining bright  
Everythings alright tonight
