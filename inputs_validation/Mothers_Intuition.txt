Its a mothers intuition to make a little space  
Its her quiet mission to tidy up her place  
A mothers intuition is like a kangaroos  
She hops around she mops the ground she fusses over you  
A mother with her intuition  
Will know just what to do  
Its a mothers intuition to wash her baby  
Well she wont forget behind the ears  
And the extra soap suds on the tail  
A mothers into cleaning shell clean until shes through  
Shes smart enough shes wise enough to add up two and two  
A mother with her intuition  
Will know just what to do  
A mother has a feeling she pays special attention  
If someone is concealing if someones playing tricks  
She rubs and scrubs and scours the secrets  
Until the answer clicks  
Then she takes a brush and polishes your teeth  
Shell make you shine and sparkle new  
Until she finds the real you underneath  
Isnt it charming  
Just mommy and little roo  
Fresh as a daisy  
Sparkling just like new  
Its a mothers intuition  
Its a mothers intuition  
Its a mothers intuition
