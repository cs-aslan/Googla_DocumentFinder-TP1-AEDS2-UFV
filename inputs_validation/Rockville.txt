Looking at your watch a third time waiting in the station for a bus  
Going to a place thats far so far away and if thats not enough  
Going where nobody says hello they dont talk to anybody they dont know  
Youll wind up in some factory thats full time filth and nowhere left to go  
Walk home to an empty house sit around all by yourself  
I know it might sound strange but I believe  
Youll be coming back before too long  
  
Dont go back to Rockville  
And waste another year  
  
At night I drink myself to sleep and pretend  
I dont care if youre not here with me  
Cause its so much easier to handle  
All my problems if Im too far out to sea  
But something better happen soon  
Or its gonna be too late to bring you back  
  
Its not as though I really need you  
If you were here Id only bleed you  
But everybody else in town only wants to bring you down and  
Thats not how it ought to be  
I know it might sound strange but I believe  
Youll be coming back before too long
