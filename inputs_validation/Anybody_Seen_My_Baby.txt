She confessed her love to me  
Then she vanished  
On the breeze  
Trying to hold on to that  
Was just impossible  
  
She was more than beautiful  
Closer to ethereal  
With a kind of  
Down to earth flavor  
  
Close my eyes  
Its three in the afternoon  
Then I realize  
That shes really  
Gone for good  
  
Anybody seen my baby  
Anybody seen her around  
Love has gone  
And made me blind  
Ive looked but I just cant find  
She has gotten lost  
In the crowd  
  
I was flippin magazines  
In that place on Mercer Street  
When I thought I spotted her  
  
Getting on a motor bike  
Looking rather lady like  
Didnt she just give me a wave  
  
Salty tears  
Its three in the afternoon  
Has she disappeared  
Is she really gone for good  
  
Anybody seen my baby  
Anybody seen her around  
If I just close my eyes  
I reach out  
And touch the prize  
Anybody seen her around  
  
Rap  
Anybody seen my baby  
Anybody seen her around  
If I just close my eyes  
I reach out  
And touch the prize  
Anybody seen her around  
  
Lost lost and never found  
I must have called her  
A thousand times  
Sometimes I think  
Shes just in my imagination  
  
Lost in the crowd
