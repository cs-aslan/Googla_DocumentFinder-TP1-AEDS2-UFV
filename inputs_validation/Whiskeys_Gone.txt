Theres a note on the table  
Said I aint coming back  
Til your sorry ass is gone  
Im tired of the cheating and running around  
I never saw the wrong in anything youve done  
  
Whiskeys gone but I aint leaving  
Theres got to be a bottle in the back  
Whiskeys gone but I aint leaving  
Got to get this devil off my back  
  
Well I stumble my way into my local bar  
Where I saw the devil in my glass  
The bartender told me it was time to go  
I told him that he could lick my sack  
  
Whiskeys gone but I aint leaving  
Theres got to be a bottle in the back  
Whiskeys gone but I aint leaving  
Got to get this devil off my back  
  
Kentucky Tennessee you better find Whiskey  
Not leaving thats a fact  
Small batch sour mash  
Red nose red face gonna wreck the whole place  
Looking through the bare glass  
Bald head chapped ass gone  
Its gone gone gone gone gone gone  
Lord its a hard thing to overcome to wake up and find the  
Whiskeys gone  
  
Whiskeys gone but I aint leaving  
Theres got to be a bottle of Jim Black  
Whiskeys gone but I aint leaving  
Got to get this devil off my back
