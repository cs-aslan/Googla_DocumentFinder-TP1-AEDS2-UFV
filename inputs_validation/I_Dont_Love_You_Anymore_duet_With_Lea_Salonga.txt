Ive been thinking  
It seems were going nowhere  
You dont share my feelings  
It doesnt seem fair  
I guess theres nothing  
Much more I can do  
I know Ive got to try  
And make it without you  
I dont love you anymore  
Cant you see its just no good  
Ive gotta walk out that door  
Theres nothing left to say  
Ive gotta go my way  
Try and understand

Weve had bad times  
But thats no reason to go  
I cant live without you  
I need you dont you know  
That I still love you  
Dont dont do this to me  
You know I wont make it alone  
Cant you see  
L I dont love you anymore  
A Dont do this to me  
L Cant you see its just no good  
Ive gotta walk out that door  
A Thats no reason to go  
L Theres nothing left to say  
A I cant live without you  
L I ve gotta go my way  
A Oh no  
L I dont love you anymore  
A Dont do this to me  
L Cant you see its just no good  
Ive gotta walk out that door  
A Thats no reason to go  
L Theres nothing left to say  
A I cant live without you  
L I ve gotta go my way  
Try and understand  
A Okay  
If theres no other way  
Then go
