Heaven is a shadow of your live  
Im a lonesome alcoholic for your kiss  
Should I sit around  
And wait  
Well I had a chance  
I hesitate  
To ask you for the pleasure of your company  
What would you say  
Would you think about it  
Would you think about it  
Right now  
  
Ive been put upon  
Ive been passed round  
For ever and Im waiting for  
The thirteenth of never  
Should I swear to be true  
Should you give a damn  
What I say or do  
Well Im asking for the pleasure of your company  
What would you say  
Would you think about it  
Would you think about it  
Right now  
  
Love a cheat  
Ive got everything you need  
And Im asking for the pleasure of your company  
What do you say  
Baby oh  
Cause its been a long time  
Baby  
Think about it
