So you think  
You got it all worked out  
And what youre searching for  
Isnt what you found  
  
Up in this world  
Thats on the run  
A lot of hits but only  
A few number ones  
Im making love for fun  
  
Are you looking for a holiday  
Im making love for fun  
Why would you do it  
Any other way  
  
Im making good  
On everything I said  
So baby just relax  
And let me do my thing  
  
Up in my world  
You better run  
Theres only room  
For the few who can come  
  
When you dont have  
A place to go  
When everything  
Feels the same  
I can change what  
  
You think you know  
Making love my way
