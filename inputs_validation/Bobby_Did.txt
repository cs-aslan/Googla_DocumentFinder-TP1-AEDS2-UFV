Everybody says Im better off without him  
And Bobby never was my kind of boy  
I must have heard a hundred times  
How smart I was to leave that guy  
But I know that  
I was fooling everyone but me  
OOOh  
But how am I supposed to make them see  
That I didnt say goodbye  
Bobby did Bobby did  
Every time somebody says congratulations  
I just want to find a place for me to hide  
Cause when its him theyre talking of  
That talks about the boy I love  
Oh yeah  
To think Im the one who put him down  
OOOh  
But it was just the other way around  
No I never said goodbye  
Bobby did Bobby did  
Cause when its him theyre talking of  
That talks about the boy I love  
Oh yeah  
To think Im the one who put him down  
OOOh  
But it was just the other way around  
No I never said goodbye  
Bobby did Bobby did  
Oh Bobby did  
Bobby did  
Oh Bobby did
