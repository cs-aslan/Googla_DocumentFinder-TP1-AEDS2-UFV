Now Listen  
Not a dime I cant pay my rent  
I can barely make it through the week  
Saturday night Id like to make my girl  
But right now I cant make ends meet  
  
Im always workin slavin every day  
Gotta get a break from that same old same old  
I need a chance just to get away  
If you could hear me think this is what Id say  
  
Chorus  
Dont need nothin but a good time  
How can I resist  
Aint lookin for nothin but a good time  
And it dont get better than this  
  
They say I spend my money on women and wine  
But I couldnt tell you where I spent last night  
Im really sorry about the shape Im in  
I just like my fun every now and then  
  
Im always workin slavin every day  
Gotta get a break from that same old same old  
I need a chance just to get away  
If you could hear me think this is what Id say  
  
Chorus  
  
You see I raise a toast to all of us  
Who are breakin our backs every day  
If wantin the good life is such a crime  
Lord then put me away  
Heres to ya  
  
Chorus x3
