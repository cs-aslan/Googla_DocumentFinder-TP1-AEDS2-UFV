Maybe Im still hurting  
I cant turn the other cheek  
But you know that I still love you  
Its just that I cant speak  
I looked for you in everyone  
And they called me on that too  
I lived alone but I was only  
Coming back to you  
Ah theyre shutting down the factory now  
Just when all the bills are due  
And the fields theyre under lock and key  
Though the rain and the sun come through  
And springtime starts but then it stops  
In the name of something new  
And all the senses rise against this  
Coming back to you  
And theyre handing down my sentence now  
And I know what I must do  
Another mile of silence while Im  
Coming back to you  
There are many in your life  
And many still to be  
Since you are a shining light  
Theres many that youll see  
But I have to deal with envy  
When you choose the precious few  
Whove left their pride on the other side of  
Coming back to you  
Even in your arms I know  
Ill never get it right  
Even when you bend  
To give me comfort in the night  
Ive got to have your word on this  
Or none of it is true  
And all Ive said was just instead of  
Coming back to you
