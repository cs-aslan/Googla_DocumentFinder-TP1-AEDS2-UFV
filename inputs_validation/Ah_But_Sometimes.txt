Im a moody and swirling pool lost in some dark wood  
Angry at a million things and more  
I can do no good  
Ah but sometimes   
  
Sometimes Im a growing blade of grass  
Washed by the rain bent by the wind  
  
Im a deeply wounded lonely tree  
Lost in my own way  
Brooding on the saddest things and worse  
Ive seen my better day  
  
Im an old and broken tumbleweed  
Lost on faded sands  
Dreaming of my yesterdays before  
I watch the heat waves dance
