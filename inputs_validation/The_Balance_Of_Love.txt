Price of your loves too much to pay  
Ill save myself for another day  
You want my love but you dont want me  
You sell your goods with no guarantee  
Youre taxing me at your highest rate  
You want my heart served on a plate  
The balance of love is in the red  
Theres more to me than this double bed  
  
The balance of love is now in the red  
Im fed up of empty promises  
I wont let the grass grow under my feet  
Ive done my best to make our song complete  
  
Your interest rate is much too low  
You think that Ive no life of my own  
The days have gone for your macho values  
I wont be walking in your shadows  
Youre taxing me at your highest rate  
You want my heart served on a plate  
The balance of love is in the red  
Theres more to me than this double bed  
  
Plenty of fish are left in the sea  
I seem to have picked a shark for me  
The balance of love is now in the red  
Im fed up with the empty things you said  
  
Its as if youve never heard of give and take  
Must stop messing up me life make no mistake  
Its as if youve never heard of give and take  
  
Make no mistake  
Give and take  
  
Price of your kiss too much to pay  
Ill save myself for another day  
You want my love but you dont want me  
You say its a gift but its just a loan  
You thing that Ive no life of my own  
The balance of love is in the red  
  
Plenty of fish are left in the sea  
I seem to have picked a shark for me  
The balance of love is now in the red  
Im fed up with the empty things you said  
  
Its as if youve never heard of give and take  
Must stop messing up my life make no mistake  
Its as if youve never heard of give and take
