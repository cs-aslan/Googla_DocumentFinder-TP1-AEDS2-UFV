We are running out of time  
Weve got one foot on the rock and one foot over the line  
This love this loves not turning back  
Well I dont know about you but me Im following that  
  
Late at night watching you sleep and I know inside Im over the edge  
  
Im goin down down down in a blaze of love in a blaze of love  
Im goin down down down in a blaze of love in a blaze of love  
  
Oh you you can run away  
You can shatter my world scatter my dreams all over the place  
But I Ive grown to love these chains  
You can tear em apart but I dont want to escape  
  
I close my eyes picture your smile and I know inside Im over the edge  
  
Im goin down down down in a blaze of love in a blaze of love  
Im goin down down down in a blaze of love blaze of love  
Blaze of love  
Blaze of love  
  
Oh Im over the edgein a blaze of love  
  
Down down down blaze of love Blaze of love  
Down down down In a blaze of love in a blaze of love  
Im goin down down down down down down  
In a blaze of love Blaze of love  
Down down down in a blaze of love
