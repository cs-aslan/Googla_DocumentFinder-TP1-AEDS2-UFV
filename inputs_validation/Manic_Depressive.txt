Verse  Violent J  
In my minds eye  
You throw wickedness at me  
Im just a toy to you  
I bring no real joy to you  
The way I see it  
You dont want me here no more  
You want a hole in my forehead  
And blood pourin on the floor  
Cause Im so dirty  
Fuckin dirty and shoddy  
I want up out of this body  
Thats hated by everybody  
Sometimes I dont know why  
I continue to try  
Its so much easier to die  
Than to get by  
And to get by  
And to get by  
Verse  Violent J  
If Im gonna die  
Im taking you with me  
Get you and get me  
We can be bloody  
If Im gonna fly  
Im gonna succeed  
Take you and get me  
We can be bloody  
Sometimes I dont know why  
I continue to try  
Its so much easier to die  
Than to get by  
And to get by  
And to get by  
Verse  Shaggy 2 Dope  
I dont want to leave my house  
Dont want to open my mouth  
Dont want to read my mail  
Dont want to meet with pals  
I dont want to fuck shit up  
Dont want to fuckin get up  
Dont want to take up space  
Dont want your time to waste  
I dont want to fight this back  
Just want to fade to black  
Dont want to turn to faith  
Or want to burn at stakes  
I dont want to build my life  
I want to bloody my knife  
Dont want to grab the phone  
Dont want to leave this room  
I dont want to talk with you  
Im fuckin stalkin you  
Dont want to fix myself  
I want to nix myself  
I dont want to try to change  
Just want to fry my brains  
Dont want to slow shit down  
I want to throw shit around  
I dont want to run nowhere  
Dont want no one to care  
Dont want another crack at it  
Id rather be a crack addict  
I dont want to look for help  
Dont want to help myself  
I dont want to even try  
To get by  
To get by
