Hook  
Im black and Jewish  
Dont be so foolish  
Im black and Jewish  
Its a Mitzvah  
  
Verse  
Please dont forget Im black please dont forget Im Jewish  
I play ball like Lebron and I know what a W2 is  
Chillin in Boca Raton with my mensch Lenny Kravitz  
The only purple drink we sip is purple Manischewitz  
At my show you wont simply put your hands in the air  
We can also raise a chair or recite a Jewish prayer  
  
Interlude  
Like Baruch  Yisrael  
 Kim Kardashian Kanye West amen  
I eat Hova with nova knishes with my bitches  
A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy his name is Weezy  
Do not go to Feingolds though  
The pickles are rubber  
And I will not be harmin yah  
I read the Old Testament okra and matzahball Ill eat the rest of it  
I celebrate Hanukkah dated Rihannakah  
Birth right in Israel mama from Canada  
Daddy from Africa  
Both of best worlds when youre Jewish with black in ya  
Challah
