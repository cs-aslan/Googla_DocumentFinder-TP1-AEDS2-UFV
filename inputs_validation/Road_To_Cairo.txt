A fella told me  
This here road leads to Cairo  
I got to get me a ride  
I got to go back  
Go back to my children  
I got to see my little bride  
  
I been travellin  
Gone a long long time  
Dont know what Ill find  
Scared of what Ill find  
But I just got to see them again  
  
Hey thanks for stoppin  
Are you headed down to Cairo  
I wrecked my Lincoln in Saint Jo  
Why to little old Cairo  
No special reason  
Look up some folks I used to know  
  
Me I travel some  
Have my share of fun  
Now thats a life a man can live  
Sure Ive played and lost  
But who minds the cost  
You got to take more than you give  
  
Hey you got another cigar  
Son I sure like this car  
Oh from your daddy as a gift  
Say on second thought  
Theres gifts I havent bought  
Just drop me here  
Thanks for the lift  
  
Yes Ive travelled some  
Yes Ive been a bum  
Never have a dime for gin  
Left to make my way  
Told her I cant stay  
To see my children poor as sin  
  
I know this road  
It leads straight into Cairo  
Twentytwo miles straight ahead  
I cant I cant walk down this road to Cairo  
Theyre better thinkin Im dead  
  
I been travellin  
Gone a long long time  
Dont know what Id find  
Scared of what Id find  
I cant I just cant walk down this road
