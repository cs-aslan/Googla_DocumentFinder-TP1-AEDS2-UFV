I was young when I left home  
And I been out aramblin round  
And I never wrote a letter to my home  
To my home Lord to my home  
And I never wrote a letter to my home  
  
It was just the other day  
I was drinkin on my pay  
When I met an old friend I used to know  
He said your mothers dead and gone  
Your baby sisters all gone wrong  
And your daddy needs you home right away  
  
Not a shirt on my back  
Not a penny on my name  
Well I cant go home this away  
This away Lord Lord Lord  
I cant go home this away  
  
If you miss the train Im on  
Count the days Im gone  
And youll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles  
A hundred miles a hundred baby  
Lord Lord Lord  
And youll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles  
  
When Is playin on the track  
Maw would come and whip me back  
On them tressles down by ol Jim McKays  
  
When I pay the debt I owe  
To the commissary store  
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home  
Oh home Lord Lord Lord  
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home  
  
I used to tell my Maw sometimes  
When I see them ridin blinds  
Gonna make me a home out in the wind  
In the wind Lord in the wind  
Make me a home out in the wind  
  
I dont like it in the wind  
I want to go back home again  
But I cant go home this away  
This away Lord Lord Lord  
And I cant go home this away  
  
I was young when I left home  
And I been all a ramblin round  
And I never wrote a letter to my home  
To my home Lord Lord Lord  
And I never wrote a letter to my home
