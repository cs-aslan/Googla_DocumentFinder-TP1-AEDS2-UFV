Lazy stadium night  
Catfish on the mound  
Strike three the umpire said  
Batter have to go back and sit down  
  
Catfish milliondollarman  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can  
  
Used to work on Mr Finleys farm  
But the old man wouldnt pay  
So he packed his glove and took his arm  
An one day he just ran away  
  
Catfish milliondollarman  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can  
  
Come up where the Yankees are  
Dress up in a pinstripe suit  
Smoke a custommade cigar  
Wear an alligator boot  
  
Catfish milliondollarman  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can  
  
Carolina born and bred  
Love to hunt the little quail  
Got a hundredacre spread  
Got some huntin dogs for sale  
  
Catfish milliondollarman  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can  
  
Reggie Jackson at the plate  
Seein nothin but the curve  
Swing too early or too late  
Got to eat what Catfish serve  
  
Catfish milliondollarman  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can  
  
Even Billy Martin grins  
When the Fish is in the game  
Every season twenty wins  
Gonna make the Hall of Fame  
  
Catfish milliondollarman  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can
