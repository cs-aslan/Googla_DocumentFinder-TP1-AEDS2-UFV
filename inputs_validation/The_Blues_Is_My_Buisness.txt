I got a heart full of trouble a house full of sin  
And things are bad as they ever been  
If trouble were money  
Id have more money than any man should  
  
Im open for business in your neighborhood  
The blues is my business and business is good  
  
If I had a dollar for every broken heart  
Id be drinkin fine wine and eatin caviar  
If trouble were money  
Id have more money than any man should  
  
Im open for business in your neighborhood  
The blues is my business and business is good  
  
Well business the business is good  
The blues is my business and business is good  
The blues is my business the blues is my business  
Im open for business in your neighborhood  
The blues is my business and business is good  
  
Licks   
  
Its a world full of trouble and a world full of pain  
Ill take the problem but I wont take no blame  
If trouble were money  
Id have more money than any man should  
  
Im open for business in your neighborhood  
The blues is my business and business is good  
  
The blues is my business and business is good  
The blues is my business and business is good  
The blues is my business the blues is my business
