She took a walk on a Saturday  
And all of the people were gone  
The building were down and all the birds had flown away  
But she just kept singing her song  
Lazy days  
Just time and space  
Isnt it wonderful   
  
Impossible  
To believe shes the only one  
And isnt it incredible  
In the blink of a eye it was done  
Shes the girl who fell out with the sun  
And got stuck on the moon  
  
She started digging for sunshine  
And wound up with dirt in her nails  
Building her house on the edge of divine  
No wonder she never fails  
The pain is gone  
But theres no way home  
Time and space  
Theres a million ways  
To feel beautiful   
  
Impossible  
To believe shes the only one  
And isnt it incredible  
In the blink of a eye it was done  
Shes the girl who fell out with the sun  
And got stuck on the moon  
  
Nothing to prove  
And whats left to stay  
When all that you know has been taken away  
Put your feet up  
Turn your problems down  
Take every day as its coming around  
  
Theres a million ways to feel  
Beautiful  
  
Impossible  
To believe shes the only one  
And isnt it incredible  
Shes the girl who fell out with the sun  
Impossible  
In the blink of a eye it was done  
Shes the girl who fell out with the sun  
And got stuck on the moon
