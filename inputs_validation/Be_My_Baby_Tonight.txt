Shes got a certain style  
In everything she does  
Shes someone to know  
Just because  
Yeah  
Just because  
Yeah  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah  
Come on  
Be my little baby tonight  
Shes seen everywhere  
Looking like Venus too  
Emotional suicide  
She couldnt give a damn  
No  
Guess she shows  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah  
Come on  
Be my little baby tonight  
Shes got a heart of gold  
And nerves of steel  
Feels like broken glass  
Shes unreal  
Shes got a velvet touch  
Igniting a frozen heart  
Shes indispensable  
Tear your soul apart  
Yeah yeah  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah  
Come on  
Be my little baby tonight  
Yeah come on come on come on  
Come on and  
Be my little baby tonight
