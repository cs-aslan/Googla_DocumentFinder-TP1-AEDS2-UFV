Look at all the people  
Looking at their dreams  
Smiles upon their faces  
Tell me what they see  
  
Look at all the people  
Have they gone astray  
Living for tomorrow  
With dreams of yesterday  
  
Lovely lady  
Tell me what you feel  
As a child were you mild  
Does it make it so unreal  
  
Lovely lady  
Feel so insecure  
When you give all yourself  
How can you be sure  
  
What has come between us  
What has made us sad  
Childhoods forgotten  
Yet its hiding in the past  
  
What has come between us  
Theres something in ourselves  
Lines upon our faces  
Saying no more time for rest  
  
Lovely lady  
Tell me what you feel  
As a child were you mild  
Does it make it so unreal  
  
Lovely lady  
Feel so insecure  
When you give all yourself  
How can you be sure  
  
Lovely lady  
Tell me what you feel  
As a child were you mild  
Does it make it so unreal  
  
Lovely lady  
Feel so insecure  
When you give all yourself  
How can you be sure  
  
Lovely lady  
Feel so insecure  
When you give all yourself  
How can you be sure  
  
Lovely lady  
Tell me what you feel  
As a child were you mild  
Does it make it so unreal  
  
Lovely lady  
Feel so insecure  
When you give all yourself  
How can you be sure
