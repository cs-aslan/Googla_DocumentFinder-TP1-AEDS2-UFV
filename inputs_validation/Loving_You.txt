Hello August moon where are the stars of the night  
You promised me too soon cause its been cloudy all night  
And the weatherman said if youre not well stay in bed  
Cause Ive been feeling down and blue and its cloudy in my head  
Instead of going out to some restaurant I stay home in bed  
  
But Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
  
Hello midnight lover youre the one I adore  
And Ill be thinking of you til the stars are no more  
If its cloudy or blue Ill stay here with you  
Well make a wish and then well kiss a love forever true  
Instead of going out to some restaurant Ill stay here with you  
  
But Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
  
It seems you dont know we reached the hightened mountain  
Every time I seem to disappear  
And together we will fly well dance up in the heaven  
I can really feel it when youre near  
  
And the weatherman said if youre not well stay in bed  
Cause Ive been feeling down and blue and its cloudy in my head  
Instead of going out to some restaurant I stay home in bed  
  
But Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
  
But Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
  
But Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
  
But Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
  
But Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
  
But Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
Ill be loving you thats what I want to do  
  
Loving you thats what I want to do
