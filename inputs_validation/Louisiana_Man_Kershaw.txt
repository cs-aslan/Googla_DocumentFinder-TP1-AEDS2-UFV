At first Mama Papa called the little boy Ned  
Raised him on the banks of the riverbed  
A houseboat tied to a big tall tree  
A home for my Papa and my Mama and me  
The clock strikes three Papa jumps to his feet  
Already Mamas cookin Papa somethin to eat  
At half past Papa hes aready to go  
He jumps in his bireau headin down the bayou  
  
Hes got a fishin line strung across the Louisiana River  
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat  
He sets his traps catchin anythin he can  
Gotta make a livin hes a Louisiana Man  
Gotta make a livin hes a Louisiana Man  
  
Muskrat hides hangin by the dozen  
Even got a lady makes a muscrat Cousin  
Papa has em dryin in the hot hot sun  
Tomorrow Papas gonna turn em to mon  
  
Call my Mama Riiita and my Daddy Jack  
Little boy brother on the fioor is Matt  
Green and Lynn are the family twins  
Big brother Eds on the bayou fishin  
On the river floats Papas great big boat  
Thats how my papa goes into town  
Takes every bit of the night and day  
To even reachthe place where the people stay  
  
I can hardly wait till tomorrow comes around  
Thats the day my Papa takes his furs to town  
Papa promised me that I could go  
Hed even let me see a cowboy show  
Id seen the cowboys and Indians for the first time then  
Told my Papagotta go again  
Papa said Son we got a life to run  
Wed come back again cause theres work to be done  
  
Hes got a fishin line strung across the Louisiana River  
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat  
He sets his traps catchin anythin he can  
Gotta make a livin hes a Louisiana Man  
Gotta make a livin hes a Louisiana Man
