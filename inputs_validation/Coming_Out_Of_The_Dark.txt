Why be afraid if Im not alone  
Though life is never easy the rest is unknown  
Up to now for me its been hands against stone  
Spent each and every moment  
Searching for what to believe  
  
Coming out of the dark I finally see the light now  
Its shining on me  
Coming out of the dark I know the love that saved me  
Youre sharing with me  
  
Starting again is part of the plan  
And Ill be so much stronger holding your hand  
Step by step Ill make it through I know I can  
It may not make it easier but I have felt you  
Near all the way  
  
Coming out of the dark i finally see the light now  
And its shining on me  I see the light I see the light  
See the light  
Coming out of the dark I know the love that saved me  
Youre sharing with me  
  
Forever forever I stand on the rock of your love  
Forever and ever Ill stand on the rock  
Cant nobody stop me from watching  
Forever forever I stand on the rock of your love  
Love is all it takes no matter what we face  
  
Coming out of the dark Coming out of the dark  
I see the light I feel love shinning on me Shining shining  
Shining on me  
Coming out of the dark I know the love that saved me  
Youre sharing youre sharing with me sharing with me sharing with me  
  
Coming out of the dark  
Making it into the light  
Your love shining on me shining on me shining on me  
Coming out of the dark  
I see the light I see the light  
Shining shining shining on me  
Shining shining  
Coming out of the dark  
I see the light now  
Yes I see the light
