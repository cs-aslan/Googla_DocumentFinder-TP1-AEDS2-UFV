Damn you ure so fine  
Seems 2 happen 2 me each and every time we make love  
I cant hold back  
Its like having a hundred million little heart attacks  
Damn you baby ure so fine  
Damn this kooky love affair  
All I ever want 2 do is play in your hair  
2 people crazy in love  
Into 1 another like a hand in a glove  
Damn this kooky love affair

Like animals just born 2 breed  
Come 2 think about cha baby

Im on fire til you come and put me out  
All Im trying 2 say is that my psychadelic shouts  
When you damn me  
Damn you  
When Im in your arms its all that I can do  
When were makin love I cant hold back  
Its like having a hundred million little heart attacks  
Damn you baby ure so fine

Pimprag check pimprag  
Just once will you talk to me  
Tootsie pop check tootsie pop  
Not at me not around me not through me  
Raise your cane cane

Who is your God  
You  
Is this reality or just another facade
