Everybody says you let me down I should be ashamed to take you round  
Makes no difference what you used to do darling I could never be ashamed of
you  
  
Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way  
In my heart I know that youll come true darling I could never be ashamed of
you  
  
All the happiness Ive ever known came the day you said youd be my own  
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you  
  
Maybe youve been cheated in the past and perhaps those memories will always
last  
Even though you prove to be untrue darling I could never be ashamed of you
