Im having myself a time  
I mean Im having what I want  
Wanting what I have  
Doing what I like  
And liking what I do  
And Im having myself a time  
  
I never could save a dime  
And so Im living like a lord  
Acting like a loon  
Lying in the sun  
And sighing in the moon  
And Im having myself a lime  
  
When I hum songs  
Theyre all dumb songs  
Without reason nor rhyme  
But Im certainly in my prime  
I friend Im happy as a bird flying up above  
Walk a little love and get a little love  
And Im having myself a time  
  
But Im certainly in my prime  
I mean Im happy as a bird flying up above  
Walk a little love and get a little love  
And Im having myself a time
