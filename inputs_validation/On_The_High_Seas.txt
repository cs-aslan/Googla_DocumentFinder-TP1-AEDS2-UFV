Was it someone she met thats so hard to forget  
Was it some kind of an ocean of changes  
I dont remember where she said she would be  
And since I dont know let me guess  
Was it somewhere in Michigan or the Lake of the Woods  
Up in old Montreal or Toronto the good  
Somewhere in Reno or somewhere in Rome  
And when all is said and done  
Will she leave me alone  
  
I dont want to get so low  
And as for my sadness it comes and it goes  
I dont remember where she said she would be  
Back in the city or on the high seas  
  
Was it up in Hornpayne where the trains run on time  
Was she drinking champagne when she made up her mind  
North of the border or down in South Bend  
And when all is said and done  
Is there no rainbows end  
  
I dont want to own the key  
To some ghostly mansion where souls are set free  
I dont remember where she said she would go  
Straight for the highway or down the low road  
I dont remember where she said she would be  
Back in the city or on the high seas
