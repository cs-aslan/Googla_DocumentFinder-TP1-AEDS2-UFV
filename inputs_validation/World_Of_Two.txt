I dont want to hear you whisper  
I dont want to orbit your world of two  
  
Theres only room for you  
In your world of two  
  
I dont like to hang around you  
I dont want to live in your world of two  
  
Theres only room for you  
In your world of two  
  
Its not that I dont like you  
But its not that I dont love you  
Its not that I dont think you are  
Two of the most  
Perfectly  
Beautiful  
People in your world  
  
In your world of two  
Theres only room for you  
In your world of two  
Theres only room for you  
In your world of two  
In your world of two  
Theres only room  
Theres only room  
Theres only room  
For you
