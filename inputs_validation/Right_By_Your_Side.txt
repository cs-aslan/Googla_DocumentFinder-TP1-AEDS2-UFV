Everyday we go through different things  
We may not know what tomorrow may bring  
But I know that Ill be okay  
Baby come what may  
And everyone has their share of ups and downs  
Never so sure of what fate will allow  
But I know somehow well make it through  
Just me and you  
When its time to cry we can cry together  
Know that Ill be with you  
With you through whatever  
When the times get rough  
Know that I will be right by your side  
Ill be right by your side  
Ooh  
I know that you have been hurt before  
Feelin like you couldnt trust anymore  
But its always good to know that  
Theres someone there for you  
Although sometimes things may not turn out right  
Ill be right here you dont have to hide  
Whatever you feel inside well make it through  
Just me and you  
Well share the laughter  
And you know well also share the tears  
And when times are bad  
Just know that Ill always be here  
Just remember   
When its time to cry we can cry together  
Know that Ill be with you  
With you through whatever  
When the times get rough  
Know that I will be right by your side  
Ill be right by your side  
Ooh  
Ill never go away  
I will be right here beside you  
Ill be with you all the way  
And Ill be here to stay with you  
Come what may  
Just remember   
When its time to cry we can cry together  
Know that Ill be with you  
With you through whatever  
When the times get rough  
Know that I will be right by your side  
Ill be right by your side ooh repeat  
I will be right by your side  
I will be right by your side  
I will be right by your side  
I will be right by your side fade
