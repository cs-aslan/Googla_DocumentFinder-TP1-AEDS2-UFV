How is your heart little darling  
I didnt mean to get so mad  
Let me just hold you closely  
How did things get so bad  
I know how to pick on you  
You pushed me over the edge  
We caused so much agony  
We cant seem to move ahead  
  
This is such a pity  
We should give all our love to each other  
Not this hate that destroys us  
This is such a pity  
This is a pity  
  
What kind of future will we have  
Will we we ever find peace  
Everybody thinks were crazy  
Theyre about to call the police  
I dont want to be a chump  
You think Im a fascist pig  
Right now everything is black  
I dont think well get it  
  
This is such a pity  
We should give all our love to each other  
Not this hate that destroys us  
This is such a pity  
This is a pity  
  
This is such a pity  
We should give all our love to each other  
Not this hate that destroys us  
This is such a pity  
This is a pity
