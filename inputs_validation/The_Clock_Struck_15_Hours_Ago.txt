And the clock struck fifteen hours ago it is shining  
And the man who is wasting on the wall  
Looks a lot like Jesus  
And a little bit resembling  
the man in the mirror in the hall  
  
And I rosetrayed sailors  
And you still shining  
And Im till waiting to got  
And I lied for sailors  
And I lied for certain  
And I lied to everyone I know  
  
Oh Id believe in God and Id believe in loving  
but I dont speak to anyone who knows  
And I need four 50s and three yellow lemons  
And someone to take me home  
  
And Id forgotten the one who was sailing  
on the water down beside where you dont go  
And its strange to tell  
that the one who is shining  
is someone I forgot I used to know  
  
And the clock struck fifteen hours ago
