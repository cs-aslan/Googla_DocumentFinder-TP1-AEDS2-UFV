Ive used hammers made out of wood  
I have played games with pieces and rules  
Ive deciphered tricks at the bar  
But now youre gone  
I havent figured out why  
Ive come up with riddles  
And jokes about war  
Ive figured out numbers and what there for  
Ive understood feelings  
And Ive understood words  
But how could you be taken away  
  
And wherever youve gone  
And where ever we might go  
It dont seem fair  
Today just disappeared  
Your lights reflected now  
Reflected from a far  
We were but stones  
Your light made us stars  
  
With heavy breath  
Awakens regrets  
Back pages and days alone the couldve been spent  
Together but we were miles apart  
Every inch between becomes light years now  
No time to be void  
Or save up on life  
Uh youve got to spend it all  
  
And wherever youve gone  
And where ever we might go  
It dont seem fair  
You seem to like it here  
Your lights reflected now  
Reflected from a far  
We were but stones  
Your light made us stars  
  
And wherever youve gone  
And wherever we might go  
It dont seem fair  
Today just disappeared  
Your lights reflected now  
Reflected from a far  
We were but stones  
Your light made us stars  
  
Repeat till end
