Over the river  
And through the woods  
To Grandmothers house  
We go  
The horse knows the way  
To carry the sleigh  
Through white  
And drifted snow  
  
Over the river  
And through the woods  
Oh  
How the wind does blow  
It stings the toes  
And bites the nose  
As over the ground we go  
  
Over the river  
And through the woods  
To have a full day of play  
Oh hear the bells  
Ringing tingalingling  
For it is Christmas Day  
  
Over the river  
And through the woods  
Trot fast my dapple gray  
Spring oer the ground  
Just like a hound  
For this is Christmas Day  
  
Over the river  
And through the woods  
And straight through  
The barnyard gate  
It seems that we go  
So dreadfully slow  
It is so hard to wait  
  
Over the river  
And through the woods  
Now Grandmas cap I spy  
Hurrah for fun  
The puddings done  
Hurrah for the pumpkin pie
