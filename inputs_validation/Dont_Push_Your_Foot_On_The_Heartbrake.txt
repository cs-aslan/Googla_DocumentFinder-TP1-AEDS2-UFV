Emmas come down  
Shes stopped the light  
Shining out of her eyes  
  
Emmas been run out on  
Shes breaking down  
In so many places  
Stuck in low gear  
Because of her fears  
  
Of the skidding wheels  
The skid of her wheels she feels  
Skidding wheels  
The skid of her wheels she feels  
Spinning wheels  
Wheelskidding feeling  
  
Her heart is there  
But theyve greased the road  
Her heart is out there  
But shes no control  
  
Oh come on youve got to use your flow  
You know what its like and you know you want to go  
Dont drive too slowly  
Dont put your blues where your shoes should be  
Dont put your foot on the heartbrake  
  
Shes losing shes losing shes losing shes losing  
Shes losing that inner flame  
It was burning bright  
But shes losing the light fast  
  
Shes only herself to blame  
Well take care of yourself  
And remember Georgie  
But shes so ODd on weeping  
She can hardly see  
  
That shes dropping beads  
Red red glass is bleeding  
Dropping beads  
Red red glass is bleeding  
Dropping beads  
Red red on the parquet  
  
Her heart is there  
But theyve greased the road  
Her heart is out there  
But shes no control  
  
Oh come on youve got to use your flow  
You know what its like and you know you want to go  
Dont drive too slowly  
Dont put your blues where your shoes should be  
Dont put your foot on the heartbrake
