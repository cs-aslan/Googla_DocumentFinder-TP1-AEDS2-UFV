My lullabyhung out to dry  
Whats up with that  
Its over  
Where are you dad  
Mums lookin sad  
Whats up with that  
Its dark in here  
Why bleeding is breathing  
Youre hiding  underneath the smoke in the room  
Try  bleeding is believing  
I used to  
My mouth is dry  
Forgot how to cry  
Whats up with that  
Youre hurting me  
Im running fast  
Cant hide the past  
Whats up with that  
Youre pushing me  
Why  bleeding is breathing  
Youre hiding  underneath the smoke in the room  
Try  bleeding is believing  
I used to  
I used to  
Why  bleeding is breathing  
Youre hiding  underneath the smoke in the room  
Try  bleeding is breathing  
I saw you crawling on the floor  
Why  bleeding is breathing  
Youre hiding  underneath the smoke in the room  
Try  bleeding is breathing  
I saw you crawling to the door  
Why  bleeding is breathing  
Youre hiding  underneath the smoke in the room  
Try  bleeding is breathing  
I saw you falling on the floor
