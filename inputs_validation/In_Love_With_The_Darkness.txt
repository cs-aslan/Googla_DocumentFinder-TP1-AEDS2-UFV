No more tears  
Im out of fears  
Im out of pain  
Im out in the rain  
  
It will gently wash away  
The light of the day  
  
Im in love with the darkness of the night  
Im in love with all thats out of sight  
Im in love with the magic of the new  
And the darkness loves me too  
  
Finally  
It covers me  
It makes me taste  
Its sure embrace  
  
It will gently take away  
The sorrows of the day  
  
Come out come out wherever you are  
Dont hide dont hide near or far  
Dont hide
