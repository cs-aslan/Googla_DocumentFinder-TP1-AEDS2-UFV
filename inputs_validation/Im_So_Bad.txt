Cant seem to find my way  
Someone tell me what to say  
Where am I going  
Where did I come from  
I dont know I dont know  
Almost got to paradise  
But the smoke always gets  
In my eyes  
Everything I do is wrong  
Im so bad    so bad  
Late at night theyre asleep  
Im awake get the urge  
Hit the street jump a curb  
Alleyway dark and wet  
Set the trap I forget  
Who I am But I know  
Ill get you   Im so bad  
I was born inside a cage  
Never knew anything but rage  
Although I tried so hard to adjust  
Love is something I dont understand  
Take what I need and I get what I can  
OH    Im so bad  
I wake up in the morning so tired  
Dreamt that I was walking through fire  
The fire didnt hurt me though  
Were old friends  
Cant seem to find my way  
Someone tell me what to say  
Everything I do is wrong  
Pass the time lie in bed  
Hotel room TV set  
Got to move might be dead  
Catch a ride Im awake  
Join a crowd hidden blade  
Buy a drink you better pray  
I dont get you  
Im so bad    so bad
