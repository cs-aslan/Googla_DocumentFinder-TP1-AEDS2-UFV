Well they say that Im too country the way I look and sound  
They wanna to make me over just a little more uptown  
Say I need to change my image now tell me whats that mean  
Dont they know Ive got country in my genes  
  
Well I cant help the way I talk I wouldnt change it if I could  
Sophisticated aint my style but country fits me good  
I aint ashamed to wear whats been handed down to me  
Lord Ive got country in my genes  
  
Ive got country in my genes country in my blood  
It goes back generations Its something Im proud of  
Its something I was born with what you get is what you see  
Im just an old hillybilly with a country song to sing  
Lord Ive got country in my genes  
  
Oh that Earl Scruggs  
  
If countrys hit the big time me Im still the same  
I aint above my raisin and I aint about to change  
I wouldnt trade my Wranglers for the finest gaberdine  
Lord Ive got country in my genes  
  
Ive got country in my genes country in my blood  
It goes back generations Its something Im proud of  
Its something I was born with what you get is what you see  
Im just an old hillybilly with a country song to sing  
Lord Ive got country in my genes  
  
Ive got country in my genes country in my blood  
It goes back generations Its something Im proud of  
Its something I was born with what you get is what you see  
Im an old Kentucky hillybilly with a country song to sing  
Lord Ive got country in my genes  
  
Lord Ive got country in my genes
