Guess I was a fool to let you see  
Vanity got the better of me  
The losers got to love  
Caught up in a fantasy  
Im screaming at the gates of Heaven  
  
Tell it to me one more time  
Till youre blind in the face  
Gotta have some peace of mind  
Its OK good to be angry  
I never meant to make you cry  
See you hurt in this way  
The love grabbed a passion fatigue  
  
Threw me a line to pull me in  
Tripping upon a flight of fancy  
Until the break of dawn  
I never thought to call  
Im stranded at the gates of Heaven  
  
Tell it to me one more time  
Till youre blind in the face  
Gotta have some peace of mind  
Its OK good to be angry  
I never meant to make you cry  
See you hurt in this way  
The love grabbed a passion fatigue  
  
The losers got to love  
Caught up in a fantasy  
Im screaming at the gates of Heaven  
  
Tell it to me one more time  
Till youre blind in the face  
Gotta have some peace of mind  
Its OK good to be angry  
I never meant to make you cry  
See you hurt in this way  
The love grabbed a passion fatigue  
  
Tell it to me one more time  
Till youre blind in the face  
Stop me messing with your mind  
Its OK good to be angry  
I never meant to make you cry  
See you hurt in this way  
The love grabbed a passion fatigue  
The love grabbed a passion fatigue
