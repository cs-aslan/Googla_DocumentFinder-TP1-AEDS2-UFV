Alas my love you did me wrong  
To cast me out discourteously  
For I have loved you so long  
Delighting in your very company  
Now if you intend to show me disdain  
Dont you know it all the more enraptures me  
For even so I still remain your lover in captivity  
Green sleeves youre all alone  
The leaves have fallen the men have gone  
Green sleeves theres no one home  
Not even the Lady Green Sleeves  
  
I sang my songs I told my lies  
To lie between your matchless thighs  
And aint it fine aint it wild  
To finally end our exercise  
Then I saw you naked in the early dawn  
Oh I hoped you would be someone new  
I reached for you but you were gone  
So lady Im going too  
  
Green sleeves youre all alone  
  
Green sleeves youre all alone  
The leaves have fallen the men have all gone home  
Green sleeves its so easily done  
Leaving the Lady Green Sleeves
