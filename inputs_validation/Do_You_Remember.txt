Little Richard sang it and Dick Clark brought it to life  
Danny And The Juniors hit a groove stuck as sharp as a knife  
Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll  
  
Chuck Berrys gotta be the greatest thing thats come along  
hum diddy waddy hum diddy wadda  
He made the guitar beats and wrote the alltime greatest song  
hum diddy waddy hum diddy wadda  
Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll  
hum diddy waddy doo  
  
Elvis Presley is the king  
Hes the giant of the day  
Paved the way for the rock and roll stars  
Yeah the critics kept a knockin  
But the stars kept a rockin  
And the choppin didnt get very far  
  
Goodness gracious great balls of fire  
Nothins really movin till the saxophones ready to blow  
do you remember do you remember  
And the beats not jumpin till the drummer says hes ready to go  
do you remember do you remember  
Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll  
do you remember  
  
Lets hear the high voice wail oooooooooo  
And hear the voice down low wahah ahah  
Lets hear the background  
Um diddy wadda um diddy wadda  
Um diddy wadda um diddy wadda  
They gave us rock and roll  
Um diddy wadda um diddy wadda  
They gave us rock and roll  
Um diddy wadda um diddy wadda  
They gave us rock and roll
