When I was just a boy  
The devil took my hand  
Took me from my home  
He made me a man  
So dont talk to me about sympathy now  
Cause you cant dance if you  
Take a chance on your rosary  
  
Im going down down down down down  
On the homebound train  
  
Its been a millions years  
That I been gone  
I been everywhere now Im heading home  
Been a lot of girls but  
Theres a woman I know  
Said dont take no plane  
Better take a train  
Cause I like it real slow  
  
All the way back home  
On the homebound train  
Im going down down down down down  
On the homebound train  
  
Im on my way  
Im heading home  
To be with my baby  
Where I belong  
Coming down the tracks now  
See I done my time  
Im going back now  
To that home of mine  
Well here I come baby  
  
Here I come baby  
Here I come baby  
  
All the way back home  
On that homebound train  
Im going down down down down down  
On that homebound train
