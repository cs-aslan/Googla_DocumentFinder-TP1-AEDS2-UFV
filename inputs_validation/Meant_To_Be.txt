Ive been searching  
all my life  
Ive been hurting  
living lies  
in the dark  
trying to find true love  
in my heart  
no time to lose goodbye to blues  
why cant you see  
we were meant to be  
were walking through fire  
were stronger than steel  
weve joined our souls  
now were free  
weve reached our souls  
we finally see  
yesterday we lived in sorrow  
we live today for tomorrow  
no time to lose goodbye to blues  
why cant you see  
we were meant to be  
were walking through fire  
were stronger than steel
