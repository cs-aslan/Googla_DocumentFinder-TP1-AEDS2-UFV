Lord I give my all to You  
Every day Im living for Your Name  
  
I dont care what comes my way  
Im gonna lay my life down every day  
  
My life is not my own  
Lord Jesus take control  
I give You everything  
You are the reason I sing  
  
Take my life God every part  
Im reaching out to give You my heart  
One thing I wanna let You know  
Youre my hero  
  
Jesus there is none like You  
No one else can make me feel this way  
  
There is power in Your Name  
To live a life of freedom everyday  
  
You are everything to me  
More than the air I breathe  
Youre everything I need  
Youre my hero
