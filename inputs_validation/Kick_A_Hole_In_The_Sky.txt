Walks like a crooked tooth  
And sleeps with a Dexedrine smile  
Keeps finding the holes where old memory can go  
And wash it down liquefied  
Keep that old door swinging  
Cause you can be the freeloader  
When its closing time  
When its closing time  
What you gonna do Its nothing to see  
But somethings got you down on your knees  
Im crawling through the dirt to see where it hurts  
And it aint falling down by degrees  
I think Im gonna die  
From trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Your walls are plastered with hamfist drunks  
And fagans wrapped in denim and smoke  
So tell me what chance did you happen to dance  
With the step that kicked your feet in the boat  
Loose band on the radio  
All static and clashin a hobnailed hint  
Youre never losing ground  
Its just the way it sounds  
What you gonna do Its nothing you see  
But somethings got you down on your knees  
Im crawling through the dirt to see where it hurts yeah  
And it aint falling down by degrees  
I think Im gonna die  
From trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
You cover me like the sunshine kisses the day  
But a pulse starts in my gut now  
And its gonna make us pay  
What you gonna do Its nothing to see  
But somethings got you down on your knees  
Im crawling through the dirt to see where it hurts  
And it aint falling down by degrees  
I think Im gonna die  
From trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
From trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Oh bring it on
