Yeah  
Thank you Jesus for the song  
Hey Hey hey hey  
Dont do it dont do it  
  
Dont go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Dont go and put a bullet in your head  
  
Im gonna get it  
But workin nine to five just doesnt let it  
I feel Im wastin time and I regret it  
Cant even feed my kids and my wife  
  
Oh Im longing to find it  
A taste of the sweeter life oh my  
Only takes a little time  
No dont do it  
  
Dont go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Dont go and put a bullet in your head  
  
Oh my oh my  
Aint got no credit  
Cant even pay my rent  
Where will I get it   
  
Theres a liquor store right down the block Ill get it  
Cant even feed the pain in my heart  
Oh Im longing to find  
 Im longing to find   
  
A piece of the bigger pie oh my  
 A different kind   
Only it takes a little time  
 A little time   
No dont do it  
  
Dont go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Dont go and put a bullet in your head  
  
Oh my oh my oh my   
  
Dont go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Dont go and put a bullet in your head  
Put a bullet in your head oh my  
  
Oh my put a bullet in your head oh my  
Dont go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Dont go and put a bullet in your head  
Oh my oh my oh my
