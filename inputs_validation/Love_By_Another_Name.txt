Somewhere past midnight  
When the moment is just right  
We ride the streets of desire  
We take it slow and  
Always get where were goin  
Cause where theres smoke theres a fire  
  
Theres no denying  
We dont need to keep trying  
Lets face the music and dance  
  
Well its all semantic  
What we never say  
But what we feel aint goin away  
  
So I wonder how could we be feeling  
More than this  
Tell me true  
What it is cause  
  
Something has to make us feel this way  
Love by another name  
Doesnt matter cause its still the same love  
Wont depend upon the words we say  
Love by another name  
Something happens when were making love  
  
Si ce nest pas lamour  
Questce que cest  
  
Were superstitious  
When every day is like Christmas  
No promise spoken  
Hearts dont have to get broken  
More than a four letter word  
  
If were just pretending  
We can write a new ending  
If we dont like where it leads  
  
Well its new romantic  
Action over words  
The sweetest nothings that Ive heard  
  
I cant tell you everything Im feeling  
More than this  
Do you know  
What it is cause  
  
I know that I cant describe  
What Im feeling inside  
Maybe Ill learn  
I guess I live with the fear  
This could all disappear  
If I try to put it in words
