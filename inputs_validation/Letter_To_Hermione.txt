The hand that wrote this letter  
Sweeps the pillow clean  
So rest your head and read a treasured dream  
I care for no one else but you  
I tear my soul to cease the pain  
I think maybe you feel the same  
What can we do  
Im not quite sure what were supposed to do  
So Ive been writing just for you  
  
They say your life is going very well  
They say you sparkle like a different girl  
But something tells me that you hide  
When all the world is warm and tired  
You cry a little in the dark  
Well so do I  
Im not quite sure what youre supposed to say  
But I can see its not okay  
  
He makes you laugh  
He brings you out in style  
He treats you well  
And makes you up real fine  
And when hes strong  
Hes strong for you  
And when you kiss  
Its something new  
But did you ever call my name  
Just by mistake  
Im not quite sure what Im supposed to do  
So Ill just write some love to you
