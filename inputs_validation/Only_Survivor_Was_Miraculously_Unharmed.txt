Someone has sewn me shut  
And tied me to a bed  
They locked me up locked me up  
Oh God  
  
This is where they all  
Throw me to the wolves  
Dragged behind and trampled on  
I cant keep clawing at the jaws of hell  
The silence is killing me  
  
Nothing to calm the nerve  
Nothing to calm the nerve  
Write down my thoughts  
And read me my rights  
Repeat repeat repent and repeat  
  
The cycle never really ends  
Till they admit that its real  
The cycle never really ends  
Till they admit they admit that its real  
  
Everything everything is leaving me wondering  
I hate that Im questioning everything everything  
  
This is how it seems to me  
Ive drowned myself in selfregret  
This is how I wanna be  
This cant be how I wanna be  
  
This is spinning perfect little circles  
And thats all that they know  
They just spin in perfect little circles  
And thats all that they know all that they know  
  
Repeat x3  
Nothings right just left alone  
Sinking in will be just fine  
None of them will ever know  
None of them will ever know
