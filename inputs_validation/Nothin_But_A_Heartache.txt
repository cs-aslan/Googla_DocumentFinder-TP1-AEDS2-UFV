So you tell him to say no more  
You dont want to know why or where  
Where hes been all these lonely nights  
You know whats wrong and dont care whats right  
As long as he comes back to you  
Someone to love him all his life  
It aint nothin but a heartache  
Darling youll get over it  
It aint nothing but a heartache  
Darling youll get over it  
Theres always there comes a day  
When love just goes away  
When theres no caring no words to say  
Theres no forgiving no games to play  
When all you know will get you through  
Seems like youve known it all your life  
It aint nothin but a heartache  
Darling youll get over it  
It aint nothin but a heartache  
Darling youll get over it
