Clap until your hands hurt  
Standing ovations or boobooboos  
Wawawatch us until we blur  
Walk off into the sunset  
Tell RocknRoll Im alone again  
I wanna put the midwest home again  
Your time has passed  
They say never means never  
So the fast dance wont last  
But never means forever  
Never means forever
