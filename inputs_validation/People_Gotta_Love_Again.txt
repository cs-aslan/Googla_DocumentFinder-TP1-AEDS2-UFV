Wake up everybody  
Take a good look around  
Theres far too many reasons  
For all the troubles goin down  
Jesus is watchin  
And the devil is alive  
Buddha is cryin  
And Allah is mystified  
Brothers killin brothers  
And our children in the streets  
We gotta change the times  
We gotta change the times  
The world is watchin just look at the shape were in  
There aint no doubt about it people gotta love again  
Down on every corner  
We got children sellin dope  
Whos gonna send a message  
And try to give em hope  
Jesus is watchin  
And the devil is alive  
Buddha is cryin  
And Allah is mystified  
Brothers killin brothers  
And our children in the streets  
We gotta change the times  
We gotta change the times  
The world is watchin just look at the shape were in  
There aint no doubt about it people gotta love again  
I said Oh what a shame when they try to pretend  
All my brothers and sisters people gotta love again  
Cant buy love with a paycheck  
It means nothin to a boy and girl  
You need universal love of all mankind  
To change whats wrong with the world  
The world is watchin look at the shape were in  
There aint no doubt about it people gotta love again  
I said Oh what a shame when they try to pretend  
All my brothers and sisters people gotta love again  
The world is watchin look at the shape were in  
There aint no doubt about it people gotta love again  
I said Oh what a shame when they try to pretend  
All my brothers and sisters people gotta love again
