I cant sleep tonight  
Everybodys saying everything is alright  
Still I cant close my eyes  
Im seeing a tunnel at the end of all of these lights  
Sunny days where have you gone  
I get the strangest feeling you belong  
  
Why does it always rain on me  
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen  
Why does it always rain on me  
Even when the sun is shinning I cant avoid the lightning  
  
I cant stand myself  
Im being held up by invisible men  
Still life on a shelf when  
Ive got my mind on something else  
Sunny days oh where have you gone  
I get the strangest feeling you belong  
  
Why does it always rain on me  
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen  
Why does it always rain on me  
Even when the sun is shinning I cant avoid the lightning  
  
Middle eight  
Oh where did the blue sky go  
Oh why is it raining so  
Its so cold  
  
I cant sleep tonight  
Everybodys saying everything is alright  
Still I cant close my eyes  
Im seeing a tunnel at the end of all of these lights  
Sunny days where have you gone  
I get the strangest feeling you belong  
  
Why does it always rain on me  
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen  
Why does it always rain on me  
Even when the sun is shinning I cant avoid the lightning  
  
Oh where did the blue sky go oh why is it raining so  
Its so cold  
  
Why does it always rain on me  
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen  
Why does it always rain on me  
Even when the sun is shinning I cant avoid the lightning  
Why does it always rain on me  
Why does it always rain on
