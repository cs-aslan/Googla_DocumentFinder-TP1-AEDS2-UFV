I didnt come in here to fight  
I didnt come to ruin your night  
I came to see the future mister me  
I didnt come to mess things up  
I only want to wish you luck  
And shake the hand of the future mister me  
  
I only want a chance  
To see the man wholl be the man to please my baby  
The one wholl lay beside you  
And hold you just the way I used to do  
I want to know youre happy  
And I want to know he treats you like a lady  
And if I can see youre in good hands  
Maybe I can make it without you  
  
You look so happy by his side  
And Im sure youll make a lovely bride  
And he loves you any fool can plainly see  
The pain is just too much for me  
So Ill just leave and let you be  
All alone with the future mister me  
  
Youll be alone here with the future mister me
