Sun is still shining look at the view  
Moon is still dining with me and you  
Now that were out here open your heart  
To the universe of which were a part  
Everythings turning turning around  
See with your mind leave your body behind  
Now that were out here open your heart  
To the Universe of which were a part  
But if you want to play  
Stay right back on Earth  
Waiting for rebirth  
Sun is still shining look at the view  
Moon is still dining with me and you  
Now that were out here open your heart  
To the universe of which were a part  
But if you want to play  
Stay right back on Earth  
Waiting for rebirth
