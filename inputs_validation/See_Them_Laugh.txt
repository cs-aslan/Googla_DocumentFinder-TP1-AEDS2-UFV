See them laugh  
Watch them stare watch them stare  
They always do when Im with you  
See they say our love will never hold  
That youre too young and Im too old  
And just the same I dont feel blue  
Cause I have you III have you  
See them laugh  
Why wont they why wont they  
Give us a chance for our romance  
See although our age is not the same  
I love you so I cant explain  
Cause it dont matter what they say or do  
III do See
