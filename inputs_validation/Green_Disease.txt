GareEED  
Its a disease and theyre all green  
It emanates from their being  
A satiation with occupation  
And like weeds with big leaves  
Stealing light from whats beneath  
Where they have more  
Still they take more  
I know then I dont  
Theres a stowaway with my throat  
Its deceiving I dont believe him  
We can scream out our doors  
Behind the wall a fat man snores  
In his dreams hes choking ti leaves  
Well I guess theres nothing wrong with what you say  
But dont sell me there cant be better ways  
Tell the captain the boats not safe and were drowning  
Turns out hes the one making waves waves waves  
I said theres nothing wrong with what you say  
Believe me Im just asking you to sway  
No white or black just grey  
Can you feel this world with your heart and not your brain  
Brain
