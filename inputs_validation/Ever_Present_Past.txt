Ive got too much on my plate  
Dont have no time to be a decent lover  
I hope it isnt too late  
Searching for the time that has gone so fast  
The time that I thought would last  
My ever present past  
  
Ive got too much on my mind  
I think of everything to be discovered  
I hope theres something to find  
Searching for the time that has gone so fast  
The time that I thought would last  
My ever present past  
  
The things I think I did  
I did I did I did  
The things I think I did  
When I was a kid  
  
I couldnt understand a word that they were saying  
But still I hung around and took it all in  
I wouldnt join in with the games that they were playing  
It went by it went by in a flash  
It flew by it flew by in a flash  
  
Theres far too much on my plate  
Dont have no time to be a decent lover  
I hope its never too late  
Searching for the time that has gone so fast  
The time that I thought would last  
My ever present past  
  
The things I think I did  
I did I did I did  
The things I think I did  
When I was a kid  
When I was a   
  
The things I think I did  
I did I did I did  
The things I think I did  
When I was a kid  
When I was a kid
