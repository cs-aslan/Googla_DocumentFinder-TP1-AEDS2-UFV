Do I imagine it or do I see your stare  
Is there still longing there  
Oh I hate myself and I feel crazy  
Such a classic tale  
Current girl friend ex girlfriend Im trying to be cool  
Am I being paranoid am I seeing things  
Am I just insecure  
  
I want to believe  
Its just you and me  
Sometimes it feels like theres three  
Of us in here baby  
  
So I wait for you to call  
And I try to act natural  
Have you been thinking bout her about me  
And while I wait  
I put on my perfume yeah I want it all over you  
Im gonna mark my territory  
  
Ill never tell tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume  
Ill never tell tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume  
I hide it well hope you can tell but I hope she smells my perfume  
I hide it well hope you can tell but I hope she smells my perfume  
  
I wanna fill the room when shes in it with you  
Please dont forget me  
Do I imagine it or catch these moments  
I know you got history  
  
But Im your girlfriend now Im your girlfriend  
Trying to be cool  
I hope Im paranoid that Im just seeing things  
That Im just insecure  
  
I want to believe

Sometimes it feels like theres three  
Of us in here baby
