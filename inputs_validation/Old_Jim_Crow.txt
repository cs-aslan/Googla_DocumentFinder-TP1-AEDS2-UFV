Old Jim Crow  
Where you been baby  
Down Mississippi and back again  
Old Jim Crow dont you know  
Its all over now  
  
Old Jim Crow  
Whats wrong with you  
It aint your name  
Its the things you do  
Old Jim Crow dont you know  
Its all over now  
  
Old Jim Crow  
Youve been around too long  
Gotta work the devil  
Til your dead and gone  
  
Old Jim Crow  
Yes dont you know  
Its all over now  
Its all over now  
  
Old Jim Crow  
You know its true  
When you hurt my brother  
You hurt me too  
Old Jim Crow dont you know  
Its all over now  
  
Old Jim Crow  
I thought I had you beat  
Now I see you walkin  
And talkin up and down my street  
Old Jim Crow dont you know  
Its all over now  
  
Old Jim Crow  
Youve been around too long  
Gotta work the devil  
Til your dead and gone  
  
Old Jim Crow dont you know  
Its all over  
All over  
Oh Lord its all over  
  
All over  
Its all over  
Its all over  
Its all over now
