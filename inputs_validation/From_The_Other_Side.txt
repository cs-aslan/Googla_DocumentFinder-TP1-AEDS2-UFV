I dont know if Im dead or alive  
All I know is Im running out of time  
Oh Im leaving my body Oh leaving it behind  
  
From the other side looking down I know that its me  
From the other side looking fown its the devil I see  
  
Someone down there is saving my life  
I see a tear being shed by THE EYE  
Oh Im drifting much higher Oh into the light  
  
From the other side looking down I know that its me  
From the other side looking fown its the devil I see  
  
I see the strangest faces  
Faces that Ive never seen before  
They see me through empty spaces  
Spaces that do not exist no more  
  
I swear by the moon and the devil  
Ill be their guardian if they will be mine  
  
Theres a demon with red glowing eyes  
Hes invading the body that was mine  
Oh is there still time Oh Time to return  
  
From the other side looking down I know that its me  
From the other side looking fown its the devil I see  
  
I guess I wasnt ready yet  
Cause someone there is calling me back from the dead  
  
Demon demon are you there  
Demon demon leave my lair  
  
From the other side looking down I know that its me  
From the other side looking fown its the devil I see  
WAKE UP
