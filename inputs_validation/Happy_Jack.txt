Happy Jack wasnt old but he was a man  
He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man  
The kids would all sing he would take the wrong key  
So they rode on his head on their furry donkey  
  
The kids couldnt hurt Jack  
They tried and tried and tried  
They dropped things on his back  
And lied and lied and lied and lied and lied  
  
But they couldnt stop Jack or the waters lapping  
And they couldnt prevent Jack from feeling happy  
  
But they couldnt stop Jack or the waters lapping  
And they couldnt prevent Jack from feeling happy  
  
The kids couldnt hurt Jack  
They tried and tried and tried  
They dropped things on his back  
And lied and lied and lied and lied and lied  
  
But they couldnt stop Jack or the waters lapping  
And they couldnt prevent Jack from feeling happy  
  
I saw ya
