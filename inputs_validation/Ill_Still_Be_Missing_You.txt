Ill still be missing you  
Just as long as the sun shines through  
No matter what I do Ill still be missing you  
I told myself when I walked out your door  
Dont look back you dont need him anymore  
Out there somewhere a new world youre gonna find  
So walk away and leave the rest of time  
Ill still be missing you  
Just as long as the sun shines through  
Pretending that Im not blue Ill still be missing you  
  
What a fool I was  
To think that I could lead a way of life already built in me  
Now all those times that used to seem so bad  
I know now were the best Ive ever had  
Ill still be missing you
