Lay down  
Lay down  
Lay your sweet lovely on the ground  
Lay your love on the track  
Were gonna break the monsters back  
Yes we are  
Lay down your treasure  
Lay it down now brother  
You dont have time  
For a jealous lover  
  
As you enter this life  
I pray you depart  
With a wrinkled face  
And a brand new heart  
  
I dont know if I can take it  
Im not easy on my knees  
Heres my heart you can break it  
  
I need some release release release  
  
We need  
Love and peace  
Love and peace  
  
Lay down  
Lay down your guns  
All your daughters of Zion  
All your Abraham sons  
  
I dont know if I can make it  
Im not easy on my knees  
Heres my heart and you can break it  
I need some release release release  
  
We need  
Love and peace  
Love and peace  
  
Baby dont fight  
We can talk this thing through  
Its not a big problem  
Its just me and you  
You can call or Ill phone  
The TV is still on  
But the sound is turned down  
And the troops on the ground  
Are about to dig in  
  
And I wonder where is the love  
Where is the love  
Where is the love  
Where is the love  
Love and peace
