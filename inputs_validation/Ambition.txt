Im the kind of girl  
I want that whole wide world  
Nothing more nothing less  
I dont want second best  
  
Ah but my associates  
Why theyre no more than opiates  
Always dragging me down  
Dash my hopes to the ground  
  
But they must be kidding  
Or wishful thinking  
Adding fuel to the fire  
Of my ambition  
  
Ill make a date  
Oh no I wont be late  
And why of course hell be there  
Hell promise hell swear  
  
But all I ever find  
Been spun that same old line  
Its happened time and time again before  
But these things and more  
Widen the score  
  
And its one up for ambition  
I really have a go  
You know youve got to hand it to me  
Ive got a heart of gold  
But Im a wolf in muttons clothes  
  
Someday my time will come  
Ill feel I cant go on  
I may not care or even know its there  
But then Ill have my fun  
  
So till then just press on  
Dont lose your grip  
Dont lose ambition
