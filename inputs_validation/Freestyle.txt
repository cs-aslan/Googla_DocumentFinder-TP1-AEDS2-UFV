Ha ha 2000 and 1  
ZRo the motherfucking Mo City Don  
Getting off my chest know Im saying  
Cut these all the way off people feel me  
Yeah this how it go fa sho  
  
Ten nine eight seven six five fo  
Ima come down its your partna ZRo  
Never been a hoe never been a broad  
Every night fore I go to sleep I gotta talk to God  
One time gotta keep it real  
Got gold and diamonds in my grill  
Im for real doing it like a song  
Bleeding on the boulevard all day long  
Gots to get paid in this damn rap game  
Gotta get my feddy gotta get my change  
Me and my partna PRoy doing it every day in the struggle  
Hold up my nigga one day we gon bubble  
Nigga well shine we gon put it down  
Ima pimp my motherfucking pen one time  
Hold up nothing but syrup in my cup  
Riding on tre buck and I dont give a fuck  
About the law nigga fuck the FED  
Im up in the game just to stack a big head  
Family getting fed me and my wife wed  
Ima come down Im a Southside vet  
  
Chorus  
Hold it down like the sun were gonna shine  
And let it all swing out I ride with Southside  
Hold it down like the sun were gonna shine  
And let it all swing out I ride for Southside  
  
Like a drama bull plus I got pull  
When you see me on the damn scene you know Im fool  
Popping handle bars popping a X  
I dont give a fuck its feeling warm in my chest  
And I hope that God bless me to get a platinum plack  
Aint no turning back once I get the stack  
Once I aint cutting no slack up in the game  
Said it one time now everybody know my name  
Hollin Ro do another show  
Wanted me to swang down on another 4  
Charge twenty grand for a show  
Plus I want half of the do  
In this rap game to get all the do  
Ima come down I got my shine on glow  
Hollin at the Big Steve Mafio  
RIP to the Fat Pat though  
  
Hold up cause we balling  
See us coming down looking good and we crawling  
Aint falling I aint stalling  
Coming down outta town birds Im hauling  
To get paid nigga I got my family on my mind  
Ima put it down thats why Ima shine  
All in they face like a motherfucking moon  
A star a sun and my uzi weigh a ton  
Sitting in the microphone booth going off  
Working with the hard working with the soft  
In the motherfucking game stacking my change  
Im in the motherfucking zone mayn  
On my motherfucking block it go down  
Im the thoedest and the coldest nigga there is in HTown  
Know Im saying I aint playing steady spraying  
  
Chorus x3
