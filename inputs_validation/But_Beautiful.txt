Love is funny or its sad  
Or its quiet or its mad  
Its a good thing or its bad  
But beautiful  
  
Beautiful to take a chance  
And if you fall you fall  
And Im thinkin  
I wouldnt mind at all  
  
Love is tearful or its gay  
Its a problem or its play  
Its a heartache either way  
But beautiful  
  
And Im thinkin if you were mine  
Id never let you go  
And that would be just beautiful I know  
Beautiful to take a chance  
And if you fall you fall  
And Im thinkin  
I wouldnt mind at all  
  
Love is tearful or its gay  
Its a problem or its play  
Its a heartache either way  
But beautiful  
  
And Im thinking if you were mine  
I would never let you go  
And that would be so beautiful  
Yes that would be but beautiful  
I know
