See the sound  
It crashes in  
All around  
It gets in  
Now take your hands  
And raise them up  
Into to the air  
Thats all around ya  
Now bring them down  
Like a clock at two  
Shake your head  
You know what to do  
They want to put  
Guns in the sky  
Someone out there  
Aint gonna like it  
  
But it could be good  
Make us love each other  
Have to realise  
I own the future  
  
Guns in the sky  
  
Guns in the sky  
  
Guns in the sky  
  
Guns in the sky  
  
Guns in the sky  
Child grows up to see  
Guns in the sky  
Used to be on TV  
  
want to change  
Forgot the joke  
Its great to see you  
Im running late  
Lend me a ten  
I love your big house  
  
Could you spare a dime  
  
Well Im sick of it  
Its a load of shit  
We could stop the world  
And let off all the fools  
And let them go live  
With their guns in the sky  
  
Guns in the sky Repeat x9
