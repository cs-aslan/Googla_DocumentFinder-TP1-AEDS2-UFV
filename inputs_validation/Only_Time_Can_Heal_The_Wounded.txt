You hear a sound as shes leaving  
Youll hear your heart pound so hard  
Youll miss her warm touch and the way things once were  
Its such a cold town when you miss her  
  
Its not the same place no more  
When its hard to mend whats broken  
And you still cant let her go  
Beyond the storm theres an answer  
  
Beyond the nights you spend alone  
Beyond the headlights and the highways you go  
Youll take a long ride without her  
Until the tears dry away  
  
In every way you try to reason  
When theres no reason left to hold  
Only time can heal the wounded of love  
Any day now time will tell  
  
Only love can turn it all around again  
Theres no heart that time cant heal  
Whatever pieces youre missing  
Whatever you leave behind  
  
However you look at things they do change  
Its not the same conversation  
Its not the way that it was  
Therell be one less tear tomorrow  
Therell be one less night alone  
  
Only time can heal the wounded of love  
Any day now time will tell  
Only love can turn it all around again  
Theres no heart that time cant heal  
Only time can heal the wounded of love  
Theres no heart that time cant heal
