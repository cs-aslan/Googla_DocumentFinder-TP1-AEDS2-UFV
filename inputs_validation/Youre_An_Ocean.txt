Can you make it easier for me to understand  
How youre holding my heart in your trembling hands  
Eyes that rise to meet me half way up among the stars  
You may be from Venus but Im definitely not from Mars  
  
Chorus  
Youre An Ocean Youre An Ocean  
Settle Down Settle Down  
Whats the commotion  
Im an island but youre an ocean  
Its a stormy sea of love and emotion  
Youve got me suspended motionless in time  
  
Make the warm winds circle round my head just like you do  
If I could do it Id be doing it to you  
I believe Id buy whatever you would sell to me  
Nothing in my life ever came with a guarantee  
  
Chorus  
  
I believe Id buy whatever you would sell to me  
Nothing in my life ever came with a guarantee  
  
Youre An Ocean Youre An Ocean  
Settle Down Settle Down  
Whats the commotion  
Im an island but youre an ocean  
Its a stormy sea of love and emotion  
Youve got me suspended motionless in time
