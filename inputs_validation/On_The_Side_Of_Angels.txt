Ive never been so certain  
Ive never been so sure  
Were on the side of angels  
If we believe this love is pure  
  
Is it so hard to trust it  
Cause weve been wrong before  
There comes a time in every life  
We find the heart were waiting for  
  
After all the mighthavebeens  
The close and distant calls  
After all the tryagains  
Dont be afraid to fall  
Were on the side of angels after all  
  
Every time you touch me  
Dont you feel it too  
The gentle hand thats guiding us  
You to me me to you  
  
After all the mighthavebeens  
The close and distant calls  
After all the tryagains  
Dont be afraid to fall  
Were on the side of angels after all  
  
Heaven only knows  
Why this took so long  
But only Heaven knows  
A love is right or wrong  
  
After all the mighthavebeens  
The close and distant calls  
After all the tryagains  
Dont be afraid to fall  
Were on the side of angels  
On the side of angels  
  
Were on the side of angels  
After all  
Oh yeah  
On the side of Angels  
Oh
