Whats the matter here  
Something aint right  
Tell me its not true  
Tell me its all right  
  
There was time Id run around for you  
Get down on my knees  
I swear its true  
But you came in the night  
And you took my heart  
To Draculas Castle  
In the Dark  
  
Now Ive gotta tell you  
Now youve gotta know  
I want you to stay  
But youre gonna go  
  
Dont leave me alone  
Youll tear me apart  
Youre in control  
  
So goodbye love  
You were not real  
You came to stay  
But now you leave  
  
I cant explain  
The way you feel  
We once stood high  
But now we kneel  
  
You cant keep on running  
How fard you think youll get  
You got the world if you want it  
I aint done with you yet  
  
I work hard just to keep you by my side  
Every day and almost every night  
In the end you took away my heart  
Left me alone  
  
So goodbye love  
You were not real  
You came to stay  
But now you leave  
  
I cant explain  
The way you feel  
We once stood high  
But now we kneel  
  
So goodbye love  
You were not real  
You came to stay  
But now you leave  
  
I cant explain  
The way you feel  
We once stood high  
But now we kneel
