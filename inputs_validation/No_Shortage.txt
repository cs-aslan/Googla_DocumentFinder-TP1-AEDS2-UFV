Theres a shortage on corn  
And theres a shortage on wheat  
Theres a shortage on beans  
And theres a shortage on meat  
Things that were needing we just cant hardly buy  
Soon well be asking if were all gonna die  
But I know a great thing that theres no shortage of  
Theres no shortage on Gods mercy  
Theres no shortage on Gods love  
  
Verse 2  
Theres a shortage on fuel oil  
And theres a shortage on gas  
Theres a shortage on wood  
And theres a shortage on glass  
Things that weve wasted are now precious to buy  
You know theres even a shortage on the air in the sky  
But I know a good thing that theres no shortage of  
Theres no shortage on Gods mercy  
Theres no shortage on Gods love  
  
Chorus  
God is love and mercy unending  
His precious love will lead you no doubt  
When from Satan you need defending  
God has supply that will never run out  
  
Theres a shortage on friendship  
Theres a shortage on smiles  
Theres a shortage on neighbors  
Though theres millions for miles  
Thank Heaven for one thing that theres no shortage of  
Theres no shortage on Gods mercy  
Theres no shortage on Gods love  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres no shortage  
Theres no shortage ad lib
