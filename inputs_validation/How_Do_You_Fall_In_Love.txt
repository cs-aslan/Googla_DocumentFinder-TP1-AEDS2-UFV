How do you fall in love  
When do you say I do  
When is the perfect time  
To spend the rest of your life  
  
Seasons may come and go  
And sometimes it rains and snows  
And there will be highs and lows  
So only you will know  
  
You never know just where it will find you  
Cause it can come on you so fast  
Seems like it takes forever  
When you want it so bad  
But dont ever take it for granted  
Cause its more than sowing some seeds  
It takes sun and water  
So give it what it needs  
  
And thats how you fall in love  
Thats when you say I do  
Thats when you know its time  
To spend the rest of your life  
  
Now seasons may come and go  
And sometimes it rains and snows  
There will be highs and lows  
So only you will know  
There will be highs and lows  
So only you will know
