I have a dream about a lazy river  
After a drink or two  
I see myself in the water like a mirror  
But I dont see you  
  
So Ill meet you at the royal infirmary  
We can be together have some fun  
At the royal infirmary  
Maybe we can get along  
  
I had a dream about a bad connection  
I just couldnt get through  
I left a message with the operator  
A time to place a rendez vous  
  
Ill meet you at the royal infirmary  
We can be together have some fun  
At the royal infirmary  
Maybe we can get along  
  
Well be dancing and singing  
Practise mudslinging  
And when things get scary  
Well say three hail marys  
Drink till the morning then  
Off with the fairies  
  
Ill meet you at the royal infirmary  
We can be together have some fun  
At the royal infirmary  
Maybe we can get along
