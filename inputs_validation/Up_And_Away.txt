Everyday everyday with you  
Every little thing you do the way you do  
Little darlin in your eyes  
Got me all up and away  
You get me high  
  
I saw you there since then everyday  
Its like Im lost and thinking of you in every way  
Since I fell into your eyes  
All I know is that you get me high  
You get me high  
  
Like Im gone ooo  
Oh up and away  
You take me baby  
Oh you take me baby  
  
And then you walk the way you walk  
You blow my mind to know the way you walk in my way  
Then I fall into your eyes  
Up up and away the way you rise  
Oh baby  
The way you make me high  
  
Before you came you know I never cared  
Its just the game I play  
All up and away  
Oh all up and away  
You take me baby  
  
Up for you Id give it all  
Cause when Im thinking of you  
When Im flying above the world  
How I wish I was drowning in you  
I must admit that Im oh so in love you know  
Please dont ever let me go  
Youve done nothing to me but up up and away you go  
All up and away  
Oh you take me baby  
Yeah  
Mmmmm baby  
Awwww baby
