Its a fairytale so tragic  
Theres no prince to break the spell  
I dont believe in the magic  
But for you I will for you I will  
If Im a fool Ill be a fool  
Darlin for you  
  
Im countin on a miracle  
Baby Im countin on a miracle  
Darlin Im countin on miracle  
To come through  
  
There aint no storybook story  
Theres no neverending song  
Our happily ever after Darlin  
Forever come and gone  
Im movin on  
If Im gonna believe  
Ill put my faith  
Darlin in you  
  
Im countin on a miracle  
Baby Im countin on a miracle  
Darlin Im countin on miracle  
To come through  
  
Sleeping beauty awakes from her dream  
With her lovers kiss on her lips  
Your kiss was taken from me  
Now all I have is this  
  
Your kiss your kiss your touch your touch  
Your heart your heart your strength your strength  
Your hope your hope your faith your faith  
Your face your face your love your love  
Your dream your dream your life your life  
  
Im runnin through the forest  
With the wolf at my heels  
My king is lost at midnight  
When the tower bells peal  
Weve got no fairytale ending  
In Gods hands our fate is complete  
Your heavens here in my heart  
Our loves this dust beneath my feet  
Just this dust beneath my feet  
If Im gonna live  
Ill lift my life  
Darlin to you  
  
Im countin on a miracle  
Baby Im countin on a miracle  
Darlin Im countin on miracle  
To come through
