Something somewhere  
Is calling out your name  
In the middle of the night  
Your eyes go wide  
I see your legs shaking  
  
You dont believe its happening  
Oppressor man ye  
  
Dont tell me you are scared now  
Its not the end of your life  
But its the end of your kingdom  
Its not the end of your life  
But its the end of your shitty kingdom  
  
Oppressor man you running  
Your kingdom is falling  
Your kingdom is falling  
Your kingdom is falling  
Yo Yo Yo Yo  
  
You run for your gun  
To your surprise its empty  
Cause we had those bullets  
For breakfast Jah children did ye ye ye  
Teargas wont make me cry anymore  
Your handcuffs wont hurt my arms anymore  
  
Its not the end of your life but its the end of your kingdom  
Its not the end of your life  
But its the end of your shitty kingdom  
  
Oppressor man you running  
Your Kingdoms falling  
Your Kingdoms falling  
Your Kingdoms falling  
  
I wont do to you  
What you did to my people ye  
Four hundred years ago  
Four hundred years ago  
Turning them to slaves  
Making them your prisoners  
  
You can run but you cant hide  
Your time has come now now now  
  
Oppressor man you running  
Your kingdoms falling
