Con Te Partiro  
  
Stranded alone on a sea of emotion  
You found me  
Your love was a light  
In the darkness that shone  
So profoundly  
Say that youll stay  
Do not be afraid afraid  
You youre my breath  
The air I breathe  
You are my imagination  
Su le finesse  
Song of my heart  
Secrets Im not afraid to whisper  
  
Con te partiro  
Ill go where you lead me  
Wherever you are  
forever and ever well stay  
In love together  
I will go with you  
Ill go where you lead me  
Forever true  
forever and ever well stay  
In love together  
  
Stranded alone on a sea of emotion  
You found me  
Its you who first found me  
Come here come here  
Put your arms around me  
Come here  
Its you who surrounds me  
Come here come here  
Come here  
Come here  
You youre my breath  
The air I breathe  
You are my imagination  
Su le finesse  
Song of my heart  
Secrets Im not afraid to whisper  
  
I will go with you  
Ill go where you lead me  
Forever true  
forever and ever well stay  
In love together  
Con te partiro  
Ill go where you lead me  
Wherever you are  
forever and ever well stay  
In love together  
I will go with you  
Ill go where you lead me  
Forever true  
forever and ever well stay  
In love together  
  
Con te partiro  
Ill go where you lead me  
Wherever you are  
I will go with you  
Ill go where you lead me  
Forever true  
In my  
Heart
