Ive been with you boy for years is quite a while  
But getting to sensual is really not my style  
You know I love you and I like it just like this  
Sometimes I feel like giving you more than just a kiss  
  
But baby its wrong  
Baby its not my kind of game  
If I give it to you now our love will never be the same  
It wont be long We gotta play our love just right  
I know you know the time will come  
But baby for tonight  
  
Chorus  
Lets take it slow so slow  
Anywhere you want to go  
Baby for you Ill lay it on the line  
You oughtta know oughtta know boy I aint got no where to go Ill give it
to you only to you  
We gotta take it real slow  
  
We got together you know I feel the fire  
Burns up inside me all the natural desire  
I know that you feel it too I know you want to flow  
Dreaming about it and the fire starts to grow  
  
But baby its wrong  
Baby its not my kind of game  
If I give it to you now our love will never be the same  
It wont be long We gotta play our love just right  
I know you know the time will come  
but baby for tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
And know tomorrow it will still be you and me savin it all for you especially  
Trusting it baby when I say this to you if we wait a little longer our love
will be forever true  
  
Chorus
