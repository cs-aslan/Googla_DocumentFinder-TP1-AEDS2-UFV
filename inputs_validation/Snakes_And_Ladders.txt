I could stand but I dont like the feeling  
I could fall but Im always on the floor  
You could make a million staring at the ceiling  
You could break your back and still be poor  
  
One for the liar  
One for the cheat  
One for the man who youll never meet  
Piece of the action and a portion of pie  
Theyll be there waiting when your big chance comes by  
  
Theres a snake on top of every ladder  
Who will tell you that hes your best friend  
Everyone important needs an adder  
But subtraction gets you in the end  
  
One for the liar  
One for the cheat  
One for the man who youll never meet  
Piece of the action and a portion of pie  
Theyll be there waiting when your big chance comes by  
  
They dont care they dont mind  
The inbetweens will steal you blind  
I dont know I cant say  
It seems its always been this way  
You wont feel or complain  
The gentle leech will cause no pain
