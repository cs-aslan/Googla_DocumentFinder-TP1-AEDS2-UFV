Seeest la belle la Louise Anne te va fomma faire ma faume  
Ta jolie a ta meion a ta pas bon  
Why did you go and leave me in Lousiana sweet Susannah  
You left me for a fella who wore a big black umbrella  
He came to the sticks to buy some antiques  
He was a wheeler and a dealer the woman stealer  
Seeest la belle la Louise Anne  
Oh sweet Susannah youre a loser  
You ran off and you left me for a California boozer  
You stole all his goods and left him in the woods  
I hope you store in a bore you flirty girlie  
Seeest la belle la Louise Anne  
 fiddle   
Please come back to Lousiana sweet Susannah  
Since you left nothings right and the catfish dont bite  
I cant pay my rent cause you stole every cent  
And I cant stand to see my landlord cry  
Seeest la belle la Louise Anne
