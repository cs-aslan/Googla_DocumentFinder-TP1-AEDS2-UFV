Im gonna go out tonight  
Gonna feel alright  
If it tears me right in two  
Cause I just cant stay feeling this way  
With a heart thats full of you  
Im gonna go right down  
To a part of town  
Where Ive never been before  
And in some small place  
Find a brand new face  
And step out on the floor  
  
And Ill be dancing round and round  
And Ill be satisfied if I can just hold my ground  
And if he helps me to keep your memory down  
Ill be dancing round and round  
  
Well you put some distance round you  
I know I meant to see  
Theres a space inside for someone  
But I know it isnt me  
So among the boys who are searching  
And the girls who hope theyre found  
If you look for me Im the one youll see  
Whos dancing round and round  
  
And Ill be dancing round and round  
And Ill be satisfied if I can just hold my ground  
And if he helps me to keep your memory down  
Ill be dancing round and round  
  
Come on music wash my tears away  
Come on darkness cover up the day  
  
Dancing round and round  
And Ill be satisfied if I can just hold my ground  
And if he helps me to keep your memory down  
Ill be dancing round and round  
Ill be dancing round and round
