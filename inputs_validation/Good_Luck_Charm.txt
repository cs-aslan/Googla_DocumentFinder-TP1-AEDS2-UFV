If a black cat crossed your path little woman  
Would you walk along with me  
Dont have to worry bout a thing girl  
Its all right you see  
Cause Im a good luck charm  
Honey dont worry bout me  
If you aint got no money baby  
Thats all right too  
As long as you stick to me  
Some will come to you  
Im a good luck charm  
Honey dont you worry bout me  
If a black cat crossed your path little woman  
Would you walk along with me  
Dont have to worry bout a thing girl  
Its all right you see  
Im a good luck charm  
Honey dont worry bout me  
Im a good luck charm  
Honey dont worry bout me
