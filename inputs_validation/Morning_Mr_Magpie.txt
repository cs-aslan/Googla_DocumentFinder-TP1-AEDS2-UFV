You got some nerve coming here  
You got some nerve coming here  
You stole it all  
Give it back  
You stole it all  
Give it back  
  
Good morning Mr Magpie  
How are we today  
Now youve stolen all the magic  
I turn my back walk away  
  
You know you should  
But you dont  
You know you should  
But you dont  
  
Good morning Mr Magpie  
How are we today  
Now youve stolen all the magic  
Took my melody
