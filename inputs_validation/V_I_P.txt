Shut up talking out your ass  
With your fakeass grin and your backstage pass  
Front row at every single show  
But your hearts in the wrong place  
  
Its in the rat race  
I dont know what youre trying to prove  
Always fucking at my band  
When were laying down a fat groove  
  
I got no jealously not towards security  
Why are you always bringing me  
Stay the fuck away from me  
Im talking to you VIP  
  
Im talking to you  
I know the power you possess  
Playing cool rock for the all access  
Big which its jealousy  
  
I see that your hearts in the wrong place  
You cant follow me  
I dont know why youre kissing my ass  
Cause as soon as I turn my back you start stabbin  
  
Im reality you cant just even bother me  
Im the one they came to see  
Stay the fuck away from me  
Im talking to you VIP
