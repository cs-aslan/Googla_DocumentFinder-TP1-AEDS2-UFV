Just Like That  
Violent J  
Jump out of bed and I head for the grapenuts  
Eat em quick or they soggy and that sucks  
Trying to find a clean pair of socks and a shirt  
Still sporting the same drawers even though they hurt  
In the fridge theres a Faygo it tastes ill  
cause its flatter then a bitch on a big wheel  
I got a few money back and a little change  
So Im heading to the store when the phone rings  
What up man check it out I know this bitch  
Shes got another friend with her and her dads rich  
If we find us a ride out to Wyandotte  
guaranteed we can fuck em both on the spot  
Oh shit let me call Bill Bill  
I want to let my nuts through the windmill  
He aint home fuck Ill call Mike Clark  
cause I know he can get the fuckin Skylark  
He said he can but hes broke and it needs gas  
But I want to buy these Faygo think fast  
I know my brother Jump Steadys got a few bones  
But thats going through his shit when he aint home  
Nevermind J Legs loned me a ten  
No need to get punched in your head again  
Tell Mike to scoop me up right away  
And its Faygo and neden hoes all day  
Fuck yeah I throw my Pro Winds on my feet  
Lock the house and wait for em in the street  
I wish I had a piece of gum or something fuck  
My mouth still kind of tastes grapenuts  
Here they come nope wasnt them  
Seems like the same cars driving by again  
It pulls up hey man youre outta luck  
What what ya say man  
gunshot  
Fuck
