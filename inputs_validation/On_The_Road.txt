I left New York in 1949  
To go across the country without a bad blame dime  
Montana in the cold cold fall  
Found my father in the gambling hall  
  
Father Father where you been  
Ive been out in the world and Im only ten  
Father Father where you been  
Ive been out in the world and Im only ten  
  
Dont worry about me if I should die of pleurisy  
  
Across to Mississippi across to Tennessee  
Across the Niagara home Ill never be  
Home in ol Medora home in Ol Truckee  
Apalachicola home Ill never be  
  
Better or for worse thick and thin  
Like being married to the Little poor man  
God he loves me God he loves me  
Just like I love him just like I love him  
I want you to do I want you to do  
Just the same for him just the same for him yeah  
  
Well the worms eat away but dont worry watch the wind  
So I left Montana on an old freight train on an old freight train  
The night my father died in the cold cold rain in the cold cold rain  
  
Road to Opelousas road to Wounded Knee  
Road to Ogallala home Ill never be  
Road to Oklahoma road to El Cahon  
Road to Tahachapi road to San Antone  
  
Hey hey  
  
Road to Opelousas road to Wounded Knee  
Road to Ogallala home Ill never be  
Road to Oklahoma road to El Cahon  
Road to Tahachapi road to San Antone  
  
Home Ill never be home Ill never be  
Home Ill never be home Ill never be  
Home Ill never be home Ill never be
