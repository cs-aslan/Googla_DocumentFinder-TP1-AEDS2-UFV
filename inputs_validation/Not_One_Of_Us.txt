Its only water  
In a strangers tear  
Looks are deceptive  
But distinctions are clear  
A foreign body  
And a foreign mind  
Never welcome  
In the land of the blind  
You may look like we do  
Talk like we do  
But you know how it is  
  
Youre not one of us  
Not one of us  
No youre not one of us  
Not one of us  
Not one of us  
No youre not one of us  
  
Theres safety in numbers  
When you learn to divide  
How can we be in  
If there is no outside  
All shades of opinion  
Feed an open mind  
But your values are twisted  
Let us help you unwind  
You may look like we do  
Talk like we do  
But you know how it is  
  
Youre not one of us  
Not one of us  
No youre not one of us  
Youre not one of us  
Not one of us  
No youre not one of us  
  
Not one of us  
Youre not one of us  
Not one of us  
Youre not one of us  
Not one of us  
Youre not one of us
