Love will always find you  
No matter where you hide  
Love is gonna find you  
And its only just a matter of time  
  
Loves our common hero  
It always gets its man  
Cause love is so much stronger  
Dont you know it will win in the end  
Love will always find you  
  
Love will always find you  
No matter where you are  
Love is gonna reach you  
Cause its never really that far  
  
No no man is a island  
We werent born to be alone  
Life is made for sharing  
And love is gonna find you home  
  
I spent my time waiting  
I lost my faith in love  
Just as i was hurting  
Well then you just turned up  
  
So never give up hoping  
You cant see you around the bend  
Well you be sure of one thing  
Loves waiting at the end  
  
Love will always find you  
No matter where you hide yeah now  
Love is gonna find you  
Its only just a matter of time  
  
Loves our common hero  
It always gets its man  
Love is so much stronger  
Dont you know it will win in the end  
  
Love will always find you  
No matter where you hide oh yeah  
Love is gonna find you  
Its only just a matter of time  
  
Loves our common hero  
It always gets its man  
Love is so much stronger  
Its only just a matter of time
