Wheres that diamond ring you promised  
My fingers looking bare  
Wheres that valentine be honest  
The postman didnt bring it here  
The thing I wasnt looking for  
I found in your bedroom drawer  
The letter that you loved her better  
Made me want you even more  
  
And too much loves not good for you  
Your heart can get too full  
And too much loves an iou  
And if I give you that youll  
Send me the blues  
  
Ooohhhh yeah  
  
Where is all that time you promised  
The first hands on the three  
Wheres the second hand Im bothered  
To see it stroking on her knee  
The thing I wasnt looking for  
I found in your bedroom drawer  
The letter that you loved her better  
Made me want you even more  
  
Chorus
