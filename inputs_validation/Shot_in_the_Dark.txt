Ive been left out alone like a damn criminal  
Ive been praying for help cause I cant take it all  
Im not done  
Its not over  
  
Now Im fighting this war since the day of the fall  
And Im desperately holding on to it all  
But Im lost  
Im so damn lost  
  
Oh I wish it was over  
And I wish you were here  
Still Im hoping that somehow  
  
Cause your soul is on fire  
A shot in the dark  
What did they aim for when they missed your heart  
  
I breathe underwater  
Its all in my hands  
What can I do  
Dont let it fall apart  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
  
In the blink of an eye  
I can see through your eyes  
As Im lying awake Im still hearing the cries  
And it hurts  
Hurts me so bad  
  
And Im wondering why I still fight in this life  
Cause Ive lost all my faith in this damn bitter strife  
And its sad  
Its so damn sad  
  
Oh I wish it was over  
And I wish you were here  
Still Im hoping that somehow  
  
Cause your soul is on fire  
A shot in the dark  
What did they aim for when they missed your heart  
  
I breathe underwater  
Its all in my hands  
What can I do  
Dont let it fall apart  
A shot in the dark  
  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
  
A shot in the dark  
  
I feel you fading away  
I feel you fading away  
I feel you fading away  
I feel you fading away  
  
Cause your soul is on fire  
A shot in the dark  
What did they aim for when they missed your heart  
  
I breathe underwater  
Its all in my hands  
What can I do  
Dont let it fall apart  
Oh your soul is on fire  
A shot in the dark  
What did they aim for when they missed your heart  
  
I breathe underwater  
Its all in my hands  
What can I do  
Dont let it fall apart  
A shot in the dark  
  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
  
A shot in the dark
