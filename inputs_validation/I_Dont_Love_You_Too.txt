Its the morning after last night  
I got in late and you were up for a fight  
Oh I brought up some things that you didnt like  
You said get out I said that I just might  
  
Sometimes I feel like were not gonna make it  
Sometimes we act like we really hate this  
But we couldnt replace this  
  
Lets face it its true  
Yeah we can both be cruel  
Yeah we could both be fools  
I play that game as well as you  
And you you treat me the way you do  
And act like you never knew  
That I pretend that I dont love you too  
I dont love you too  
I dont love you too  
You know I do  
  
Why is it when we fight that you look your best  
I know its hot but could you wear any less  
Well I wont be there so who you trying to impress  
Youre making damn sure that I dont have to guess  
Sometimes I swear that we just wanna break  
Sometimes I swear that were not gonna take it  
Yeah I might as well face it  
We might as well face it  
  
Its true  
Yeah we can both be cruel  
Yeah we could both be fools  
I play that game as well as you  
And you you treat me the way you do  
And act like you never knew  
That I pretend that I dont love you too  
  
We play the roles  
Yeah we put on a show  
Both of us act like were ready to let go  
But I know I miss it all  
And its too far to fall  
  
You know its true  
Yeah we can both be cruel  
Yeah we could both be fools  
I play that game as well as you  
And you you treat me the way you do  
And act like you never knew  
That I pretend that I dont love you too  
I dont love you too  
I dont love you too  
But I do you know I do yeah yeah  
You know that I woahohoh  
You know that I woahohoh  
You know that I do I do love you
