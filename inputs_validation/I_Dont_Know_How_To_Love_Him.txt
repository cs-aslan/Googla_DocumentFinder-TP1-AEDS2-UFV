Tina  
I dont know how to love him  
What to do how to move him  
Ive been changed yes really changed  
In these past few days when Ive seen myself  
I seem like someone else  
I dont know how to take this  
I dont see why he moves me  
Hes a man Hes just a man  
And Ive had so many men before  
In very many ways  
Hes just one more  
  
Should I bring him down  
Should I scream and shout  
Should I speak of love  
Let my feelings out  
I never thought Id come to this  
Whats it all about  
  
Dont you think its rather funny  
I should be in this position  
Im the one whos always been  
So calm so cool no lovers fool  
Running every show  
He scares me so  
  
I never thought Id come to this  
Whats it all about  
Whats it all about  
Yet if he said he loved me  
Id be lost Id be frightened  
I couldnt cope just couldnt cope  
Id turn my head Id back away  
I wouldnt want to know  
He scares me so  
Ooh I want him so  
I love him so
