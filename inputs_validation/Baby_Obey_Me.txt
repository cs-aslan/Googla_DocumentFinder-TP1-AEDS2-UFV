When I say give me love well dont be meager  
Gee cant you see that Im over eager  
Oh baby oh baby obey me  
And when my lonely arms need a build up  
Well get in my arms and keep them filled up  
Oh baby oh baby obey me  
Facts are facts and Im mad about your caress  
So relax theres only one word for yes  
My love just lives for you why be lonely  
I want you for my one and only  
Oh baby oh baby obey me do  
Songs are writ to tell you what the lovers say  
And theyre a hit when people believe that way  
So darling dont be shy dont be gentle  
cause I want you close and continental  
Oh baby oh baby obey me  
No maybe hey baby you slay me  
Oh baby obey me do
