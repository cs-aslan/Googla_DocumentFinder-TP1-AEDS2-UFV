You let me paint  
The colours of your mind  
The love that remains wont fade over time  
Youll be alright  
So baby dont cry  
Ill be the sunset in your sky  
Ill be the soft winds you feel passing by  
So chin up my darlin  
Ill be there on that distant horizon  
That hurts me so  
But I must go  
  
You let me be the person that I am  
Through my confusion you helped me stand  
Ill be alright  
So baby dont cry  
Ill be the sunset in your sky  
Ill be the soft winds you feel passing by  
So chin up my darling  
Ill be there on that distant horizon  
That hurts me so  
But I must go  
  
So chin up my darlin  
Ill be there on that distant horizon  
It hurts be so  
But I must go  
I must go  
  
I will search every star till I find where you are  
And take you home  
So chin up my darlin  
Ill be there on that distant horizon  
It hurts me so  
But I must go  
  
I must go
