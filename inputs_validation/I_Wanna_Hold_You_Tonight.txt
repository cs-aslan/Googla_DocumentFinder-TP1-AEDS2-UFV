Hard as a diamonds eye  
Soft as a last goodbye  
These are the things we learn to be  
  
Calm as a distant light  
That shines on an island night  
These are the thoughts that say  
Its not too late to tell you  
I know I wanna tell you  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there to catch you from falling  
  
Cold as the arctic ice  
Hot as a passions rise  
These are the days I spend alone  
Pure as an infants heart  
That beats through the light and dark  
These are the pictures of you  
Always getting closer  
I wanna hold you closer  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there when love starts calling  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there to catch you from falling  
  
I only wish my heart  
Could fly like it does  
When I sit and dream  
Ill never wake again  
As I hold you tenderly  
My thoughts were real  
And being with you now is the only  
Thought thats strong  
Its a lonely night and Im trying  
To hold on  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there when love starts calling  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there to catch you from falling
