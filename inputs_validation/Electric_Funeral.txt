Reflex in the sky warn you youre gonna die  
Storm coming youd better hide from the atomic tide  
Flashes in the sky turns houses into sties  
Turns people into clay radiation minds decay  
  
Robot minds of robot slaves lead them to atomic rage  
Plastic flowers melting sun fading moon falls upon  
Dying world of radiation victims of mad frustration  
Burning globe of oxyn fire like electric funeral pyre  
  
Buildings crashing down to a cracking ground  
Rivers turn to wood ice melting to flood  
Earth lies in death bed clouds cry water dead  
Tearing life away heres the burning pay  
  
Electric Funeral  
Electric Funeral  
Electric Funeral  
Electric Funeral  
  
And so in the sky shines the electric eye  
Supernatural king takes earth under his wing  
Heavens golden chorus sings Hells angels flap their wings  
Evil souls fall to Hell ever trapped in burning cells
