Had an epiphany and this what it seems  
These smoking mirrors dont wanna believe  
For far too long theyve been plottin on me  
The stories unfolding now its a conspiracy  
  
Hook  
Starting to feel like a deja vu  
I remember being here must be a glitch in the matrix  
Look around they all got the same face on  
Im standing by the phone someone call me  
  
Chorus  
Bring me to life show me how to live  
Cause I lose control feeling like Neo  
In the matrix I just wanna live  
I just wanna live oh woah  
  
I took a red and a blue pill now I  
Cant decide whats make believe or real  
Am I awake or am I still asleep  
Its killing me  
Until the oracle I wanted to know  
What I was supposed to do she said I see on my own  
And the craziest thing is that you already know  
How to decipher the signs on the side of the road oh woah  
  
Hook  
Starting to feel like a deja vu  
I remember being here must be a glitch in the matrix  
Look around they all got the same face on  
Im standing by the phone someone call me  
  
Chorus  
Bring me to life show me how to live  
Cause I lose control feeling like Neo  
In the matrix I just wanna live  
I just wanna live oh woah  
  
I took a red and a blue pill now I cant decide whats make believe or real  
Am I awake or am I still asleep  
Its killing me  
I need you you gotta help me  
Im part human part android  
I need your power so you cant judge me  
Judge me oh woah stuck in the matrix  
Oh bring me to life  
  
Chorus  
Bring me to life show me how to live  
Cause I lose control feeling like Neo  
In the matrix I just wanna live  
I just wanna live oh woah
