Thats the two we are you and me  
I cant make you talk Ill make you see  
Us and them just cant agree  
We cant write the songs we want  
To make it up to eachother  
So well just take it out on our brothers  
Ill see you round the world  
See you round the world  
Make your mother proud yeah  
Never a blemish on your face  
Skinniest guy I could never replace  
Well drag another round yeah  
And create another problem  
And spill it out on our favourite album  
Is it be cool if I grab a little of your time  
I feel my heart over crowded  
Steal everything you say and make it mine  
If my head would allow it  
Never trust anybody with a clear face  
Shouldnt have to shout it  
Your the enemy I know Id never replace  
See you round the world
