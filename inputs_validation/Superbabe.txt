I made love to a superbabe  
I kinda wondered how I did  
It may be pointless to describe her  
But she has the power of gravity  
She used a voodoo force on me  
  
Big tits high ass  
Long legs flat stomach  
Helped her cover all my dreams with sleep  
Shes using mojo energy  
Snake hips full lips  
Strong things green eyes  
Superbabe  
White teeth fresh meat  
Just like the TV  
Superbabe  
  
Shes got the wild stuff  
Makes love for good luck  
Superbabe  
Dont miss with her kiss  
Wont duck from a whoa  
Superbabe  
Superbabe  
  
I made love to a superbabe  
So tell me what else could I do  
Untill I couldnt do no more  
Or even know what for  
Forever and a day  
Im gonna jump on superbabe  
  
Fame drugs and money cannot save me  
And evils everywhere  
But here comes superbabe  
Shes USA prime all the way  
One two three four  
Who the fuck are we for  
Superbabe  
  
Five six seven eight  
I can relate superbabe  
Dont miss with her kiss  
Wont duck from a woaaaw  
Superbabe  
  
Shes got the wild stuff  
Makes love for good luck  
Superbabe  
Superbabe  
Superbabe  
  
Fame drugs and money cannot save me  
Superbabe  
Superbabe  
  
It may be pointless to describe her  
Superbabe
