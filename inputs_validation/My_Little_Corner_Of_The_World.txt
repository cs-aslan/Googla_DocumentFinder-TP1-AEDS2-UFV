Come along with me  
To my little corner of the world  
Dream a little dream  
In my little corner of the world  
Youll soon forget  
That theres any other place  
Tonight my love  
Well share a sweet embrace  
And if you care to stay  
In my little corner of the world  
Well ride away  
In my little corner of the world  
I always knew that Id find someone like you  
So hop oer to my little corner of the world  
  
And if you care to stay  
In our little corner of the world  
We could hide away  
In our little corner of the world  
We always knew that wed find someone like you  
So hop oer to our little corner of the world
