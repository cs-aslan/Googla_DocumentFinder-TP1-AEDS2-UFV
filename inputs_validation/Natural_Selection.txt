Intro  
Mmmm yeah  
Mmmm yeah  
  
Verse 1  
People thought all animals  
Arrived here unrelated  
The world began and then came man  
All perfectly created  
  
Verse 2  
But then someone looked up a tree  
And said That monkey looks just like me  
So it really was a mystery  
What Id learned in natural history  
  
Verse 3  
So I joined HMS Beagle  
Watched the eagle and the seagull  
We studied rock and plants  
Flowers trees and bees and ants  
  
Verse 4  
Slept on hammocks without pillows  
Eating rats and armadillos  
Till I realised on reflection  
Its natural selection Yeah  
  
Verse 5  
Natural selection means  
Each animal evolved  
To blend with its surroundings  
Chchchanges were involved  
  
Verse 6  
So birds with different foods to seek  
Seem to have developed different beaks  
  
Verse 7  
And over time theyd  
Modified  
So just the fittest  
Of them all survived  
  
Verse 8  
On the Isles of Galapagos  
I noted the giant tortoise  
Had interesting shells  
And I rode on them as well  
  
Verse 9  
Iguanas land and swimming  
Meant my new theory was winning  
It all led in the direction  
Of natural selection  
  
Verse 10  
My findings went with outrage  
From the chchchchchurch of England  
And from me  
  
Verse 11  
The idea that we came from chchchimps  
Questioned my own Christianity  
But it was hard to disagree  
  
Verse 12  
Every species new mutation  
Had a perfect explanation  
It seems the worlds inception  
Must predate common perception  
  
Verse 13  
And if lack of adaptation  
Means a fatal limitation  
So each creatures imperfection  
Over time gets a correction  
  
Verse 14  
Meaning animal collections  
Grow unique means of protection  
And to fail natures inspection  
Means immediate rejection  
Which all leads to the detection  
Of natural selection  
Natural selection
