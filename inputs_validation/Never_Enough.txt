Verse 1 Liam  
Wanna pull an all nighter and get into something well never forget  
Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit  
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge  
Wanna wake up with you and say baby lets do it all over again  
  
PreChorus Niall  
Lips so good I forget my name  
I swear I could give you everything  
  
Chorus All  
I dont need my love you can take it you can take it take it  
I dont need my heart you can break it you can break it break it  
I just cant get too much of you baby its never its never enough  
Never enough its never enough never enough  
Come on come on
