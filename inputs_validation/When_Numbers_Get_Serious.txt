I have a number in my head  
Thought I dont know why its there  
When numbers get serious  
You see their shape everywhere  
Dividing and multiplying  
Exchanging with ease  
When times are mysterious  
Serious numbers are eager to please  
  
Take my address  
Take my phone  
Call me if you can  
Heres my address  
Heres my phone  
Please dont give it to some madman  
Hey hey whoa whoa  
Complicated life  
Numbers swirling thick and curious  
You can cut them with a knife  
You can cut them with a knife  
  
Two times two is twentytwo  
Four times four is fortyfour  
When numbers get serious  
They leave a mark on your door  
Urgent Urgent  
A telephone ringing in the hallways  
When times are mysterious  
Serious numbers will speak to us always  
  
That is why a man with numbers  
Can put your mind at ease  
Weve got numbers by the trillions  
Here and overseas  
Hey hey whoa whoa  
Look at the stink about Japan  
All those numbers waiting patiently  
Dont you understand  
Dont you understand  
  
So wrap me  
Wrap me  
Wrap me do  
In the shelter of your arms  
I am ever your volunteer  
I wont do you any harm  
I will love you innumerably  
You can count on my word  
When times are mysterious  
Serious numbers will always be heard  
  
And after all is said and done  
And the numbers all come home  
The four rolls into three  
The three turns into two  
And the two becomes a  
One
