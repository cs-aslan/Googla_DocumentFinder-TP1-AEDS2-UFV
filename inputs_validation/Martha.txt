Operator number please  
Its been so many years  
And shell remember my old voice  
While I fight the tears  
Hello hello there is this Martha  
This is old tom frost  
And I am calling long distance  
Dont worry about the cost  
Its been 40 years or more  
Now Martha please recall  
And meet me out for coffee  
Where well talk about it all  
And those were days of roses  
Poetry and prose and Martha  
And all I had was you and all you had was me  
And there was no tomorrows  
As we packed away our sorrows  
And we saved it for a rainy day  
And I feel so much older now  
And youre much older too  
Oh hows the husband hows the kids  
You know that I got married too  
Oh lucky that ya found someone  
To make ya feel secure  
Oh cause we were all so young and foolish  
And now we are mature  
And those were days of roses  
Poetry and prose and Martha  
And all I had was you and all you had was me  
And there was no tomorrows  
As we packed away our sorrows  
And we saved it for a rainy day  
And I was so impulsive  
I guess that I still am  
But all that really mattered then  
Was that I was a man  
I guess that our being together  
Was never meant to be  
Oh but Martha Martha I love you  
Cant you see  
And those were days of roses  
Poetry and prose and Martha  
And all I had was you and all you had was me  
And there was no tomorrows  
As we packed away our sorrows  
And we saved it for a rainy day  
And I remember quiet evenings  
Trembling close to you
