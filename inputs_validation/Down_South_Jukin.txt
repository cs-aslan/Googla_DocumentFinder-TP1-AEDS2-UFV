Well Billy Joe told me said everythings lookin fine  
Hes got the place all secured got the icebox full of wine  
He said hurry on over and dont be late  
He got three lovely ladies who just wont wait  
Do some down south jukin  
And lookin for a peace of mind  
Now put your Sunday pants on lets get out on on the road  
We been workin all week and thinkin its time we let go  
I got three fine mamas sittin all alone gonna sip my wine and get it on  
And do some down south jukin  
Lookin for a peace of mind  
Now come Monday morn well be headin out to the field  
And well be doin our thing for Papa and ol Uncle Bill  
Lord but then come Friday night well be headin to town  
Tryin to pick up any woman hanging around  
And do some down south jukin  
Lookin for a peace of mind
