What can they all be thinkin  
Wanna take the cross off of the hill  
Put away the pledge of allegiance  
Lord just the thought gives me a chill  
They can take god off our money but in the end o aint it funny  
How were all gonna see him on the judgment day  
So sing it loud  
  
Chorus  
One more time  
Hear what you say  
When you got the truth inside now they cant take that away  
One more time  
cause it aint too late  
Hold on to what you believe cause they cant take that  
They cant take that away  
  
They want to change somethin somewhere for everybody  
Right now a change aint what we need  
Just like my fathers father before him  
They held on with pride to everything they believed  
They can take god off our money but in the end o aint it funny  
How were all gonna see him on the judgment day  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a fire that burns forever  
Come a day we aint gonna take no more  
  
Chorus
