Waltz The pagan master  
Waltz His evil shines  
Waltz To the Devils depot  
Waltz Its gonna be so great  
  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Go  
  
Waltz Into the darkest feeling  
Waltz Without a blink I go  
Waltz To the Devils ballet  
Waltz To Mephisto  
  
Waltz The Devils dance  
Waltz And in twilight gray  
Waltz Darkness grows much faster  
Waltz Its gonna be so great  
  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Go  
  
Waltz The pagan master  
Waltz His evil shines  
Waltz To the Devils depot  
Waltz Its gonna be so great  
  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Oh  
  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Oh  
  
Go Go Go  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Go  
  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Whoah oh oh  
Go  
  
Waltz  
Waltz
