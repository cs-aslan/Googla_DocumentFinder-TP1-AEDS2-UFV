Old Friend in your room  
With your ticker  
Feeling thicker  
You get sicker but  
DieHard  
DieHard  
DieHard  
DieHard  
Old Friend in this World  
With your crucifix  
You think its fixed  
And yet you  
DieHard  
DieHard  
DieHard  
DieHard  
To heal you we have love  
To heal you we have love  
To heal you we have love  
I dont wanna  
I dont wanna  
I dont wanna  
I dont wanna  
To heal you we have love  
To heal you we have love  
To heal you we have love  
I dont wanna  
I dont wanna  
I dont wanna  
I dont wanna
