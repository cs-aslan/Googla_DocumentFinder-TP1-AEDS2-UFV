Long night its a long night my friend  
The barrooms and the back streets dead end  
Sometimes I thought I saw the sunrise and good times in the air  
It was just it was just another big town with midnights neon glare  
  
Long night its a long night I know  
The bus rides and the nowhere to go  
  
Ive seen what the street corners do to things like love and dreams  
Seen what the bottle can do to a man with his hopes and his schemes  
  
A long night what a long night it has been  
The wheelers and the dealers they win  
Ive tasted the 90proof gin and chased it away with the blues  
I rarely paid debts that I owed but I sure have paid my dues  
  
No daylight just a long night for me
