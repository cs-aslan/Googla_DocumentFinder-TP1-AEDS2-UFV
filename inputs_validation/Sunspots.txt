Sunspots cast a glare in my eyes  
Sometimes I forget Im alive  
I feel it coming and Ive gotta get out of its way  
I hear it calling and I come cause I cant disobey  
I should not listen and I shouldnt believe  
But I do yes I do  
  
She turns me on  
She makes it real  
I have to to apologize  
For the way I feel  
  
My life it seems has taken a turn  
Why in the name of God would I ever want to return  
  
Peel off our skin were gonna burn what we were to the ground  
Fuck in the fire and well spread all the ashes around  
I want to kill away the rest of whats left  
And I do yes I do  
  
She turns me on  
She makes it real  
I have to to apologize  
For the way I feel  
  
And nothing can stop me now  
There is nothing to fear  
And everything that ever was  
Is inside us here  
  
Whoa whoa whoa  
Inside us here  
  
Now I just stare into the sun  
And I see everything Ive done  
I think I couldve been someone  
But I cant stop what has begun  
When everythings been said and done  
And there is no place left to run  
I think I have to be someone  
Now I just stare into the sun
