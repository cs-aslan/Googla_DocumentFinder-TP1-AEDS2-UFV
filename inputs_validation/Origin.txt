Long lost words whisper slowly to me  
Still cant find what keeps me here  
And all this time Ive been so hollow inside  
  
And I know youre still there  
  
Watching me  
Wanting me  
I can feel you pull me down  
Fearing you  
Loving you  
I know Ill find you somehow  
  
Hunting you  
I can smell you  
alive  
Your heart pounding in my head  
  
Calling me  
Killing me  
I wont let you pull me down  
Saving me  
Raping me  
Watching me  
  
Watching me  
Wanting me  
I can feel you hold me down  
Fearing you  
Loving you  
I wont let you hold me down  
  
Watching me  
Wanting me  
I can feel you pull me down  
Fearing you  
Loving you  
I wont let you hold me down
