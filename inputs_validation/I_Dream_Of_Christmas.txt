Christine Bendebel  
  
I dream of Christmas  
I dream of you  
I dream of all the holidays  
That weve been through  
The cold December nights  
The way you hold me tight  
Under the mistletoe wed kiss  
And the world would be in the state of bliss  
  
I dream of Christmas  
I dream of you  
  
I think of all the love weve shared all these years  
Wed light the Christmas tree  
While the carolers are singing  
And bells would be ringing  
Because of all the love that youve been giving  
  
Christmas and you  
Should always be togethers  
Ill spend Christmas with you  
In any kind of weather  
You are the reason  
For my wonderful season  
When I dream of Christmas  
I dream of you  
  
I dream of Christmas  
I dream of you  
I dream of all the Christmass that well go through  
Santas bringing holiday cheers  
To all the little children  
While you bring me joy  
Youre my gift youre my joy
