Soon the pines will be falling everywhere  
As the village children fight each other for their share  
And the sixonine goes roaring past the creek  
As Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week  
  
I saw Grandma yesterday down at the store  
Well shes really doing fine for eightyfour  
And she asked me if sometime I could fix her barn  
The poor old girl she needs a hand to run that farm  
  
Chorus  
And its good old country comfort in my bones  
Its the sweetest sound these ears have ever known  
Its just an oldfashioned feeling fullygrown  
Country comfort and a truck thats goin back home  
Oh its goin back home  
  
Down at the well theyve got a new machine  
The foreman says itll cut manpower by fifteen  
Hey but that aint natural old Clay would say  
You see hes a horsedrawn man until his dying day  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Country comfort and a truck thats goin back home  
Whoa its goin back home  
Hey take me back home  
And a truck and a truck thats goin back home  
Any truck
