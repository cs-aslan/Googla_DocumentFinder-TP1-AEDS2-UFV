Take a silver dollar and put it in your pocket  
Never let it slip away  
Always be a man not a boy gone astray  
When ya get half crazy from the August heat  
Or on a frozen rotted road  
With no one to complain to about your achin feet  
  
Chorus  
Youre gonna walk that endless highway  
Walk that highway till you die  
All you children goin my way  
Better tell your homelife sweet goodbye  
  
When I see a detour up ahead  
Well I leave it far behind  
Who knows what youre apt to find there  
With the cost of livin and the price of dyin  
Well it look like tme this time I wont be buyin  
  
Chorus  
  
When they get a scapegoat by the throat  
its hard labour and cold beans  
If ya get away real quick  
Youll be eatin from the poison peanut machine  
Well I sing by night wander by day  
Im on the road and it looks like Im here to stay  
  
Chorus
