When I woke up this morning things were lookin bad  
Seem like total silence was the only friend I had  
Bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down and won  
And it was twelve oclock before I realized  
That I was havin no fun  
  
Chorus  
But fortunately I have the key to escape reality  
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile  
It dont cost very much but it lasts a long while  
Wont you please tell the man I didnt kill anyone  
No Im just tryin to have me some fun  
  
Last time I checked my bankroll  
It was gettin thin  
Sometimes it seems like the bottom  
Is the only place Ive been  
I Chased a rainbow down a oneway street dead end  
And all my friends turned out to be insurance salesmen  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I sat down in my closet with all my overalls  
Tryin to get away  
From all the ears inside my walls  
I dreamed the police heard  
Everything I thought what then  
Well I went to court  
And the judges name was Hoffman  
  
Ah but fortunately I have the key to escape reality  
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile  
It dont cost very much but it lasts a long while  
Wont you please tell the man I didnt kill anyone  
No Im just tryin to have me some fun  
Well done hot dog bun my sisters a nun
