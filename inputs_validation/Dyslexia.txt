Sometimes my world goes upside down  
Sometimes I see things backwards  
When I go walking in town cant get back home  
Someimes I see things right to left  
  
And I know thats not right at all  
But since I bumped into you I bump into walls  
And no one knows whats wrong with me  
They think that I got dropsie  
  
Is dis love  
Or is dyslexia  
Dyslexia  
Dyslexia  
  
Ive got these glasses real thick and green  
Just like the bottoms of coke bottles  
I stumble round my house so strange to me
