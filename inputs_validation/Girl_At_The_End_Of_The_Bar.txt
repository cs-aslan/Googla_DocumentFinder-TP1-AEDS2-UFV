If youd ever been drinking  
I know that youd seen her  
At the end of the bar all alone  
She knows what youre thinking  
When you try to approach her  
And anything you say might be wrong  
  
Shes not there for company  
She dont like to remember  
She once let herself go too far  
Shes not there to complain  
She just wants to remain  
The girl at the end of the bar  
  
The girl at the end of the bar  
Who once let herself go too far  
Now carries love like a scar  
The girl at the end of the bar  
  
She had so many hard knocks  
She dont play the jukebox  
Shes lived all those sad songs first hand  
Whats made her so bitter  
And why love has quit her  
Is because she has loved the wrong man  
  
The smile shes not wearing  
Is the sign shes not caring  
And the part of her permanence call  
Shes not there to complain  
She just wants to remain  
The girl at the end of the bar  
  
Shes the girl at the end of the bar
