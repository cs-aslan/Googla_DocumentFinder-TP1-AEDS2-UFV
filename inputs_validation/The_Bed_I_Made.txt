All the ways I cared for you  
Are working like you want them to  
As I break down and you stay strong  
I write my own forgiveness song  
  
I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug  
But its not your concern  
Another night and its only right  
I toss and I turn in the bed I made  
  
The wine dark room the flashing eyes  
That hung me from my string of lies  
You said you were numb from wondering  
I guess I wasnt listening  
  
I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug  
But youre not concerned  
Another night and its only right  
That I toss and I turn in the bed I made  
  
With my own hands  
I fashioned this frame  
And into the wood  
I carved out my name  
  
I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug  
But youre not concerned  
Another night and its only right  
That I toss and I turn in the bed I made  
  
And its only right  
That I toss and I turn  
In the bed I made  
  
The bed I made  
The bed I made
