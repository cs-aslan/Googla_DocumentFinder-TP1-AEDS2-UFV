I havent listened to a word youve said  
Ive been wandering inside my head  
Dont care what you think of me  
You only see what you want to see  
So here I am in my paradise  
In my heaven everything is alright  
Only the young stay young I said  
Speaks the kid inside my head  
Only the young stay young inside  
Only the young  only the young  
Only the young  only the young  
Ive been around for a long time  
Losing my way but not my mind  
So I drink and play you along  
But who cares when the fire burns on  
So Im out here in my paradise  
Its my heaven and it feels so right  
Only the young stay young I said  
Speaks the kid inside my head  
Only the young stay young inside  
Only the young stay young I said  
Speaks the kid inside my head  
Only the young stay young at heart  
Only the young  only the young  
Only the young  only the young  
Live your life  in this time  
Weve only today  drink lifes wine  
Dont be fooled  
Dont believe what they say  
Dont believe what they say  
I havent listened to a word youve said  
Say what you like  
Youre not in my head  
Time goes with each breath we take  
It rules the world the day we awake  
So here I sit here in my paradise  
Dont give a damn everything is alright
