I was lost in darkness all alone  
On the streets no place that I  
I could call my own  
  
Times so hard  
Rain everywhere down below  
Until the day I heard your voice  
Telling me which way to go  
  
Come on out into the life  
Hold on love its alright  
  
Its a wonderful life  
Now that you made me see  
My lifes complete  
Its in harmony  
  
Its a wonderful life  
Now that youre here with me  
I cant believe Im in ecstacy  
  
I was blind but love made me see  
Its everything I was searchin for  
Was right in front of me  
  
Loving you made me very strong  
You gave me the strength I needed  
So I could carry on  
  
Come on out into the light  
Hold on love its alright  
  
Its a wonderful life  
You made me see  
My lifes complete  
Its in harmony  
  
Its a wonderful life  
Now that youre here with me  
I cant believe Im in ecstacy  
  
I feel light as a feather  
Every days beautiful weather  
In your arms I remain  
Forever and ever  
  
Its a wonderful life  
That you made me see  
My lifes complete  
Its in harmony  
  
Its a wonderful life  
Now that youre here with me  
I cant believe Im in ecstacy  
  
Its a wonderful life  
You made me see  
My lifes complete  
Its in harmony  
  
Its a wonderful life  
Now that youre here with me  
I cant believe Im in ecstacy
