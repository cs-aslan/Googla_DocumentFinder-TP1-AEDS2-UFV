Well would you want me in your afternoons  
If I seduced ya in your Mills and Boons  
Well Ill be the master if youll be the mate  
But dont you get those headaches  
In another life  
  
Ill bring your milk tray from a parachute  
Ill play the Hollywood hunk you can dye your roots  
Or Ill be your Burton if youll be my Liz  
And there might be flying pigs  
In another life  
  
Thats how were built love  
Dont let it wilt love  
Ill take your flat feet  
Well if youll take my habits it all works out in the end  
Ah but in another life  
  
Ill be the stranger in your horoscope  
The cheeky builder calling with his quote  
Or maybe a Chippendale on girls night out  
Make mine the biggest pouch  
In another life  
  
Thats how were built love  
Dont let it wilt love  
Ill take your mood swings  
Well if youll take my hobbies it all works out in the end  
Ah but in another life  
  
Well Ill be your Burton if youll be my Liz  
There might be flying pigs  
In another life  
And youd give up the cigs  
In another life  
And beer tastes good in tins  
Test matches we might win  
And your mother buys her gin
