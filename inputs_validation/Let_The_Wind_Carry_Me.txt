Papas faith is people  
Mama she believes in cleaning  
Papas faith is in people  
Mama shes always cleaning  
Papa brought home the sugar  
Mama taught me the deeper meaning  
She dont like my kick pleat skirt  
She dont like my eyelids painted green  
She dont like me staying up late  
In my highheeled shoes  
Living for that RocknRoll dancing scene  
Papa says Leave the girl alone Mother  
Shes looking like a Movie Queen  
  
Mama thinks she spoilt me  
Papa knows somehow he set me free  
Mama thinks she spoilt me rotten  
She blames herself  
But papa he blesses me  
Its a rough road to travel  
Mama let go now  
Its always called for me  
Sometimes I get that feeling  
And I want to settle  
And raise a child up with somebody  
I get that strong longing  
And I want to settle  
And raise a child up with somebody  
But it passes like the summer  
Im a wild seed again  
Let the wind carry me
