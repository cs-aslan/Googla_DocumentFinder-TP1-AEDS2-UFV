Young dumb dont see a problem  
Bloodshot stare like a hoodlum  
Simple as this Im in love with the risk  
I know what Ive done but tell me what did I miss  
So please dont save something waste not save nothing  
Lose the halo dont need to resist  
A lick of the lips and a grip on your hips  
  
Sick sick sick  
Dont resist  
Sick sick sick  
Dont resist  
  
First thing we succumb to  
Shout erase and undo  
Days are unreleased if theres no release  
Please just let me do whatever fits you  
Make something make someone  
Beg on a knee baby baby please  
Pout your bottom lip  
While cracking the whip  
You know what we want  
Its candy to cum to  
  
Sick sick sick  
Dont resist  
Sick sick sick  
Dont resist  
Sick sick sick  
Dont resist  
Sick sick sick  
Dont resist  
  
A total eclipse in the teeth of the risk  
The tongue is a twist  
Perpetual bliss  
Forever midnight  
Forever midnight  
Forever midnight  
Forever  
  
Sick sick sick  
Dont resist  
Sick sick sick  
Dont resist  
Sick sick sick Im gonna take  
Dont resist I dont wanna choose  
Sick sick sick Im gonna take  
Dont resist I dont wanna change  
  
Sick sick sick Im gonna take  
Dont resist I dont wanna choose  
Sick sick sick Im gonna take  
Dont resist I dont wanna change  
Sick sick sick Im gonna take  
Dont resist I dont wanna choose  
Sick sick sick Im gonna take  
Dont resist I dont wanna change
