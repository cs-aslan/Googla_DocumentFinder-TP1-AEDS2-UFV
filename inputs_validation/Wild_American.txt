Wild American  
Youre the one they never tamed  
Cause you stood your ground  
And they could not make you change  
Youre the warning they still dont understand  
Watch your back boy theyll kill you if they can  
  
When they burn your brother down in the name of freedom  
I dont care if its left or right  
Its wrong  
If thats all they can do then you dont need em  
Youre the one Wild American
