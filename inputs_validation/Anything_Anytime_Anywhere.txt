Tomorrow may come it usually does  
Dont know what it will bring to the two of us  
I just want you to know  
What Im ready to do  
  
Anything anytime anywhere  
For you  
  
When Im holding you tight you give me the power  
To burn like a torch in the darkest hour  
Tell me what you need  
I will surely come through  
  
Anything anytime anywhere  
For you  
  
Passion runs deep its scary sometimes  
When its larger than life or your peace of mind  
Its got me all the same  
And Im not sorry thats true  
  
Anything anytime anywhere  
For you  
Anything anytime anywhere  
For you  
Anything anytime anywhere  
For you
