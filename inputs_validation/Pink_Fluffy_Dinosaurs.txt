Electro screens of light  
And poppycolored brights  
Im floating on air  
Pink fluffy dinosaurs  
Tremendously hardcore  
Im floating again  
This fake fir place  
Wont warm my soul nor face  
But still Im floating  
Again  
Hypnosis releases brakes  
Make you do things you usually fake  
It makes you float  
Again  
Those bitten by the wild  
Will live on  
But those who used to bite  
Have gone  
Golden mirror on the wall  
Will make our lives less dull  
Well be floating through the day  
All our moneys almost gone  
But still we live the life we want  
We are floating through the day  
Those bitten by the wild  
Will live on  
But those who used to bite  
Have gone
