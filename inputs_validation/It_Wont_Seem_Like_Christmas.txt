Everybodys busy decorating Christmas trees  
And outside icicles hanging from the eaves  
And the snowlakes are flyin just as far as I can see  
But it wont seem like Christmas to me  
No it wont seem like Christmas youll be there and Ill be here  
So Ill decorate a heartache with my tears  
So have a merry merry Christmas wherever you may be  
Oh but it wont seem like Christmas to me  
No it wont seem like Christmas what Christmas without you  
Ill be lonely but my darling Ill be true  
So have a merry merry Christmas wherever you may be  
Oh but it wont seem like Christmas to me  
No it wont seem like Christmas to me
