Im a do my thing  
Im a do Im a do Im a do my thing  
  
I was born at the end of december  
Not afraid that the cold of the winter  
Would keep me inside hey  
Ever since mama left me at home  
I had to search for a class of my own  
And go there in my mind  
  
I had a dream like dr King  
I had a song I had to sing  
And I knew it wasnt make believe  
When the teacher said to me  
Baby who do you wanna be  
Said I dont know but I know that Im a gonna leave  
  
Im so gone just you  
All I do is walk alone just me  
Im so gone just you  
I can make it on my own just me  
Alright  
  
Everybody wanna follow the crowd  
But I belong in the front singing loud  
And Ill go solo hey  
But the fame is a hell of a temptress  
Not my wife but I guess shes a mistress oh  
Can I let her go  
  
She can play tricks on your mind  
Have you leave your soul behind  
Shes turned some niggas out  
But she cant keep her spell on me  
She cant keep back mailing me  
Im free to leave to be just me  
  
Im so gone just you  
All I do is walk alone just me  
Im so gone just you  
I can make it on my own just me  
  
So many so many people tryna be somebody else  
Tryna be somebody else or whatever sells  
Ive got my own lane Ive got my own lane Im driving by myself  
Hope you wish my well  
  
Im so gone just you  
All I do is walk alone just me  
Im so gone just you  
I can make it on my own just me  
  
Im so gone just you  
All I do is walk alone just me  
Im so gone just you  
I can make it on my own just me  
  
If I fall then let me fall yea yea yea  
Oh cause I only got myself to blame  
Oh its just me  
All I do is walk alone
