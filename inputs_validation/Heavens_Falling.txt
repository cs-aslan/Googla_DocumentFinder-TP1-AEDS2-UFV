I will believe  
What I want to believe  
Nobody needs  
To do my thinkin for me  
I know the score Im always out of line  
Its as if I was born in the wrong place in time  
And nobody understands just whats in my mind  
But when I face the light  
Somehow it all seems right  
Dont you know it feels like  
Heavens falling  
Down on me  
And I can hear the  
Angels calling  
Calling me  
Speak your mind  
You know youve got the right  
Youre not afraid  
Youre goin with me tonight  
Everybody stops they whisper and stare  
Cause tonight were free to do  
The things they wouldnt dare  
But they will never know  
The little secrets we share  
And when you squeeze my hand  
I know you understand  
Dont you know it feels like  
Heavens falling  
Down on me  
And I can hear the  
Angels calling  
Calling me  
In a world only for lovers and fools  
Schemers and dreamers  
Who dont follow the rules  
We gotta run  
Our legs are still young  
We gotta run  
Until our heaven comes  
And when we face the light  
Somehow it all seems right  
Dont you know it feels like  
Heavens falling  
Down on me  
And I can hear the  
Angels calling  
Calling me  
dont you know it feels like  
Heavens falling  
Down on me  
And I can hear the  
Angels calling  
Calling me  
Heavens falling down on me  
Angels calling calling me  
Angels calling calling me  
Angels calling calling me
