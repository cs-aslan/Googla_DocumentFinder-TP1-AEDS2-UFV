Well you can say what you want  
But you wont get a thing from me  
And if you dont understand  
Thats its not in your hands you need  
  
Let there be love  
Let there be love  
Let there be love  
Let there be love  
  
But you can say what you feel  
And it might never steal from me  
And then you must understand  
That its all in your hands what you need  
  
Let there be love  
Let there be love

And I never knew  
But all the things that youve done  
Are coming right back to you  
But everybody knows that its no crime  
  
But does it make you feel ashamed  
You never said what you done  
And theres no need to blame  
But everybody knows yeah everybody knows  
Everybody knows that its no crime its no crime  
  
So you can say what you want  
But youll not get a thought from me  
But if you say what you mean  
Then you might get a thing from me

You sit around and you sold  
And youre passing the blame  
But everybody knows  
Yeah everybody knows  
Everybody knows that its a crime
