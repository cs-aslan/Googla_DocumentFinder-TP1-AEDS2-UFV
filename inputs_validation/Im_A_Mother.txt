Im a mother  
Treat me like a mother  
You want to suck on my breast  
Its no surprise you do  
Im the source and the force  
You owe your life to brother  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Im a mother  
And I take like a mother  
I understand blood  
And I understand pain  
There can be no life without it  
Never doubt it  
Im a mother  
  
I gave you all my money  
To help the family  
But what you do to me  
Dont humiliate me  
Remember  
Im a lifelong member  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Im a mother  
Treat me like a mother  
In the middle of the night  
I be deep in a dream  
You fancy little company  
You only have to scream  
Loud brother  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Im a mother  
And I fake like a mother  
I understand time  
And it isnt on my side  
But to service mankind  
I have to suffer his pride  
Like a mother  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
You say your protection  
Is proof of your affection  
If I need security  
Ill keep a gun on me  
Oh  
Dont barter with me  
Dont barter with me  
  
Little sacrifices  
Go straight to heaven  
But hunting seasons over  
This is the 20th century  
Oh  
Dont barter with me  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Im a mother  
And I ache like a mother  
If theres a terrible crash  
And bodies thrown everywhere  
Ill wrap em up and carry em  
If someone has to bury them  
Brother  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Call upon mother  
  
Im the vessel of life  
I got the trauma here to prove it  
When its time for me to labor for you  
Everybody move it  
Like a mother  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh
