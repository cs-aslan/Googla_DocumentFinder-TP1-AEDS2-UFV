Vince  
When I fall youre my place to land  
I lose my touch youre my hands  
The one I hold on to  
If you run out of reason to try  
Ill love enough for both you and I  
Ill be the one you can run to  
Barbra  
Id rather go through any pain love puts us through  
Than to spend one day without you by my side  
Both  
If you ever leave me will you take me with you  
If youre ever lonely I want to be lonely too  
My homes beside you no matter where you may go  
My loves inside you even more than you know  
  
Barbra  
In a world of anger and lies  
I find peace in your eyes  
A flame in the darkness  
  
Both  
Ooh And through all space and time  
Til every star refuses to shine  
  
Barbra  
You know where my heart is  
Id rather go through any pain love puts us through  
  
Both  
Than to spend one day without you by my side  
If you ever leave me will you take me with you  
If youre ever lonely I want to be lonely too Woah  
My homes beside you no matter where you may go  
  
Barbra  
Where you may go  
  
Both  
My loves inside you even more than you know  
  
And I cant remember life without you  
The way it used to be  
Feels like a million years away  
  
Vince  
Well Hold me til the angels sing  
  
Barbra  
Tell me every little thing  
  
Both  
Promise me forever from this day  
  
If you ever leave me will you take me with you  
If youre ever lonely I want to be lonely too Woah  
My homes beside you no matter where you may go  
  
Vince  
Where you may go  
  
Both  
My loves inside you even more than you know  
  
Barbra  
Even more than you know  
  
Vince  
Even more than you know  
  
Both  
Even more than you know  
Even more than you know
