Whaaaaaat  
  
I dont understand how niggas insist to knows bout  
How we spend car money to glist our rolls out  
Play bars and buy the cris and moes out  
Flash benjies just to twist the hoes out  
Fabolous the one from the menatti mix  
Known to have more kicks than karate flicks  
Slim nigga in a big body six  
Wit enough dough and pull to Gotti fixed  
If I wasnt rappin Id have a  
Down south in a town you never heard before  
Dealin wit weight Columbians would murder for  
 Cats I keep burnin for furthermore  
Im the nigga every freak press be in a sleek S  
Thats gon need week rest after greekfest  
Jump in private jets just to sneak west  
Bet these calico shots rip through ya weak flesh  
  
Chorus  
Niggas want it  
Now they get it  
Bitches on it  
Now they wit it  
Flooded up and custom fitted  
Tinted up and bb kinted  
Yall gon wonder how we did it  
Yall gon wonder how we get it  
Yall gon wonder how we did it  
Yall gon wonder how we get it  
  
Now sports the kind of nigga you could spot everyday  
Sip lots of cherry Ze in a hot chevy Le  
I knows a few niggas that plot to bury J  
Wanna scar my face put a shot in my derrier  
What you gon do when we send shots from every way  
We got perion while yall got perrier  
I strut past in diamonds that could cut glass  
Wit dime bitches thatll make a nigga nut fast  
Now I gotta fiend bout to throw some chrome on a quarter  
Cop a crown and put stones on a border  
Smoke the trees now thats grown underwater  
Still keep 9s thatll put ya bones out of order  
  
Got the condo cats will leave ya dead for  
Chicks givin sarges and crucial head for  
That make local cops go to feds for  
Anything you want nigga now I got the bread for

In Avirexs light gray lexus  
Rockin white diamonds wit a gray necklace  
Fuck and bounce dont even stay for breakfast  
We doin shit thatll make maid neck twist  
Wit a fancy chick we pay to pet kiss  
Fuck studs Im bout to throw bagettes in my ear  
And be getting head from brunettes in a lear  
If you aint talkin money I dont wanna chit chat  
Throwin partys in Jamaica when I hit plat  
Receivin chips thugs catch cases for  
Make bitches beat me til my waist is sore  
Sport come through nigga like checks on the first  
Doin the bump drivin a lex in reverse  
Now we dont pop it unless its a hundred a wop  
And Ima keep hittin yall like an abusive pops
