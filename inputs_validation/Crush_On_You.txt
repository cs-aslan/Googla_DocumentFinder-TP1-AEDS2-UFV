Im a zombie in the moonlight  
Im sleepin when its daylight  
I really should be alright  
But Im feelin kinda uptight  
Im messin with a neighbour  
Who killed my amp and fender  
He looked to sweet and tender  
Its hard to tell his gender  
Got coffee on the paper  
My dogs an alligator  
I want you now and later  
I got a crush got a crush on you  
Got a crush got a crush on you  
  
Im rentin the wrong movie  
Im laughin at the wrong guy  
Im drivin on the wrong side  
My brain is gettin cockeyed  
The flag is never chequered  
Cant find my fbeat records  
God give a little lovin  
The moneys in the oven  
Got dead flies in my scotch with ice  
My talents always vaporize  
I want your bird of paradise  
I got a crush got a crush on you  
Got a crush got a crush on you  
  
Crush Crush We got a good thing goin on  
Crush Crush Such a good thing goin on  
  
Im freezin in the summer  
Im sweatin in the winter  
No middle in the centre  
No colours in the printer  
No treatment at the pharmacy  
No lessons learned from history  
No future in the factory  
No meaning in the poetry  
No changin in the weather  
No elvis in the leather  
I want you now or never  
I got a crush got a crush on you  
Got a crush got a crush on you
