Shaggy  
The end is coming  
Repent now or forever burn  
The end of the world is here  
The signs are everywhere  
Its alllll over  
  
Violent J  
Holy fck its hot outside extra hot  
The sun is closer then its ever got  
The skys polluted its raining crud  
Pandemonium throughout the hood  
Every hour the planet shakes  
Buildings collapse from the earthquakes  
Freeways are packed horns are blowing  
Nobody really knowing where the fck theyre going  
  
Tidal waves swallowing the shores  
Coffins pushing up through your floors  
Its suddenly freezing we fall to peices  
Pray for allah and call to Jesus  
Some stay home and hold their wives  
Others flip out and end their lives  
Me I climb the roof of my house  
Spread my arms out and sing  
  
Its all over Here we go in the air we go x2  
  
Huh walking along my path  
The city has morphed into a blood bath  
Some are looting others shooting  
The devils in the sky and hes recruiting  
  
Tornados twisting through downtown  
Throwing buses and trucks around  
Its snowing hailing and burning up  
I rock my headphones and turnem up  
Folks dying crying dead and crawlin  
Run to the curch cant fit em all in  
Watch the groundscape crack in half  
A bottemless pit down Gratiot ave  
Some stay home and welcome death  
Appreciating each additional breath  
Me I climb the roof of my house  
Spread my arms out and sing  
  
Its all over Here we go in the air we go x2  
  
Fire Ice Lava Winds  
Hurricanes Earthquakes  
Taking it all in Boom Pow x3  
  
Acid rain lighting sin  
Earth shattering  
Taking it all in Boom Pow x2  
  
Boulders fcking fall from the sky  
Death with no clue when or why  
The sun explodes and we absorb it  
Our planet spins right out of orbit  
Aliens show up and eat mankind  
A virus spreads with no cure to find  
God has had enough of our shit  
A nuclear war breaks out and thats it  
  
To be on this planet living your life  
To see it all end would be alright  
You cant complain you wouldnt die alone  
You can die with loved ones and die at home  
And youre not missing anything when youre gone  
Plus seeing it all end and what goes on  
To see this great world come to an end  
Would be the next best to seeing it begin  
  
Its all over Here we go in the air we go x2  
  
Implosions  
Explosions  
Corrosion  
Burnt up and frozen  
The sky is falling  
The gods are calling  
Its all appalling  
This shit we alllll in
