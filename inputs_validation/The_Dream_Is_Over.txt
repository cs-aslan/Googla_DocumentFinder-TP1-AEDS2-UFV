Psst hey come on man wake up  
Oh yeah yeah  
I see the power  
Changin hands  
Risin from the streets  
A self made businessman  
Knows how the system can be beat  
Oh were the lost generation  
Have no place to go  
The road to destruction  
Is all we need to know  
Cause its a rip off  
Were stripped drawn and cheated  
Were flat stone cold lied to  
But were not defeated nooo sir  
Easy money  
Its your way out  
Join the Family  
No middleman  
No IRS  
Your ticket out of poverty  
Oh were the lost generation  
I hold fate from a string  
Lookin for direction  
Reachin out for anything so  
Dream another dream  
This dream is over oooh oooh oh

Flat stone cold lied to
