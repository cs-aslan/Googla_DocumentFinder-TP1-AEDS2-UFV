  
  
  
  
Gotta get back  
  
Gotta figure out a way  
  
Im losing my senses to you  
  
Whered it go the bluebird I should follow  
  
Back home But where is home  
  
Guess it wont amount to much  
  
Wont be long before I crush  
  
Ill stand in line  
  
Dont believe a thing they say today  
  
Seems we all get lost amongst the pigeons and the crumbs  
  
All alone  
  
But Im in a crowded room  
  
Im sinking in quicksand tonight  
  
You pick me up  and I shine across the sky till morning  then you  
  
colour me in  
  
Guess it wont amount  
  
to much  
  
Seems to me Ive lost my touch  
  
Im back in line  
  
Dont believe a thing they say today  
  
Turn around and walk away  
  
Everything will go your way  I pray  
  
Seems we all get lost amongst the pigeons and the crumbs
