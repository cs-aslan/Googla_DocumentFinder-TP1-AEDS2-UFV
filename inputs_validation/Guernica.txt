Guernica is in fact made of stone backwards  
Watch me at war really up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
Were hard with fear hard speak up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
Were whores sit down  
Were whores thats us  
He wanted us he swore and all weve got  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
Were hard with fear hard speak up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
Were whores sit down  
Were whores thats us  
Simple lives yeah we dont have  
We pack up in truth it seems this  
Peacemakers has arms that hold fear  
See gargoyles can you see the wonder  
Yes I fear the carbine  
What does never wrong mean  
Thats right  
Every one of us he swore so hurry up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
Were hard with fear hard speak up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
Both of us are stitched up now  
Were whores sit down  
Were whores  
That must mean sinful eyes that maim of fear  
Its the look that stings I fear boy  
Being distrusting I trust no one  
Theyve been back down for nothing  
It was never shared its ours  
We will know those names who follow
