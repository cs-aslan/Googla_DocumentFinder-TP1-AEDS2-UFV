People always comin up to me and askin  
Dolly whats your secret  
With all you do your attitude  
Just seems to be so good  
How do you keep it  
Well Im not the Dalai Lama but Ill try  
To offer up a few words of advice  
  
Chorus  
You better get to livin givin  
Dont forget to throw in a little forgivin  
And lovin on the way  
You better get to knowin showin  
A little bit more concerned about where youre goin  
Just a word unto the wise  
You better get to livin  
  
A girlfriend came to my house  
Started cryin on my shoulder Sunday evening  
She was spinnin such a sad tale  
I could not believe the yarn that she was weavin  
So negative the words she had to say  
I said if I had a violin Id play  
  
I said youd better get to livin givin  
Be willing and forgivin  
Cause all healing has to start with you  
You better stop whining pining  
Get your dreams in line  
And then just shine design refine  
Until they come true  
  
And you better get to livin  
  
Your lifes a wreck your house is mess  
And your wardrobe way outdated  
All your plans just keep on falling through  
Overweight and under paid under appreciated  
Im no guru but Ill tell you  
This I know is true  
  
You better get to livin givin  
A little more thought about bein  
A little more willin to make a better way  
Dont sweat the small stuff  
Keep your chin up  
Just hang tough  
And if it gets too rough  
Fall on your knees and pray  
And do that everyday  
Then youll get to livin  
  
The day were born we start to die  
Dont waste one minute of this life  
Get to livin  
Share your dreams and share your laughter  
Make some points for the great hereafter  
  
Better start carin  
Better start sharin  
Better start tryin  
Better start smiling  
And you better get to livin
