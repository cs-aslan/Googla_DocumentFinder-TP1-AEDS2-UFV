I dont want you to be high  
I dont want you to be down  
Dont want to tell you no lie  
Just want you to be around  
  
Please come right up to my ears  
You will be able to hear what I say  
  
Dont want you out in my world  
Just you be my backstreet girl  
  
Please dont be part of my life  
Please keep yourself to yourself  
Please dont you bother my wife  
That way you wont get no help  
  
Dont try to ride on my horse  
Youre rather common and coarse anyway  
  
Dont want you out in my world  
Just you be my backstreet girl  
  
Please dont you call me at home  
Please dont come knocking at night  
Please never ring on the phone  
Your manners are never quite right  
  
Please take the favors I grant  
Curtsy and look nonchalant just for me  
  
Dont want you part of my world  
Just you be my backstreet girl
