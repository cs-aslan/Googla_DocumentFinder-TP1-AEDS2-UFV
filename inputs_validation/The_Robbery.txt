Thenardier assembling his gang  
  
Thenardier  
Everyone here you know your place  
Brujon Babet Claqusous  
You Montparnasse watch for the law  
With Eponine take care  
You turn on the tears  
No mistakes my dears  
  
Mme Thenardier  
These bloody students on our street  
Here they come slumming once again  
Our Eponine would kiss their feet  
She never had a scrap of brain  
  
Marius

Eponine  
Here you can always catch me in  
  
Marius  
Mind the police dont catch you out  
  
Eponine  
Here whatcher doing with all them books  
I could have been a student too  
Dont judge a girl on how she looks  
I know a lot of things I do  
  
Marius  
Poor Eponine the things you know  
You wouldnt find in books like these  
  
Eponine  
I like the way you grow your hair  
  
Marius  
I like the way you always tease  
  
Eponine  
Little he knows  
Little he sees  
  
Valjean arrives with Cosette now grown up  
  
Mme Thenardier  
Heres the old boy Stay on the job and watch out for  
The law  
  
Eponine

Marius  
But Eponine  
  
Eponine

Youll be in the clear  
  
She pushes Marius away  
  
Marius  
Who is that man  
  
Eponine  
Leave me alone  
  
Marius  
Why is he here Hey Eponine  
  
He begins to follow her and bumps into Cosette  
  
I didnt see you there forgive me  
  
Thenardier  
Please Msieur come this way  
Heres a child that aint eaten today  
Save a life spare a sou  
God rewards all the good that you do  
Wait a bit Know that face  
Aint the world a remarkable place  
Men like me dont forget  
Youre the bastard that borrowed Cosette  
  
Thenardier grabs Valjean and rips open his shirt revealing the number on his
chest  
  
Valjean  
What is this Are you mad  
No Monsieur you dont know what you do  
  
Thenardier
