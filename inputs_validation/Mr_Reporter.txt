Hey Mr Reporter  
How bout talking about yourself  
Do you like what youre doing  
Or is it that you can do nothing else  
  
Hey Mr Reporter  
Ill believe all that you put down  
Ill believe the sun is going up  
Even though its going down  
  
Hey Mr Reporter  
Dont you twist my words around  
Ill kill you I wont let you  
Distort my simple sound  
  
Hey Mr Reporter  
How bout talking about yourself  
Do you like what youre doing  
Or is it that you can do nothing else  
  
Hey Mr Reporter  
How bout talking about yourself  
Do you like what youre doing  
Or is it that you can do nothing else  
  
Did your daddy stop you playing  
With your friends when you were young  
And is that why you run down  
All the young folks have their fun   
  
The reason I am stupid  
Is because I read you every day  
You misquote all of the true things  
Because they rub you the wrong way  
  
Hey Mr Reporter  
How bout talking about yourself  
Do you like what youre doing  
Or is it that you can do nothing else
