Theres a house behind a house  
Theres a dream behind a dream  
Theres a heart outside a heart  
Theres a hope behind a hope  
  
When two people know that its time to go  
When do they give in  
At what point in time do they really find  
They must let it end  
  
Lonely faces everywhere  
Watch them starin at their hands  
As the walls keep closin in  
As the days go on and on  
  
When two people see it can never be  
When do they give up  
When do they concede they must let it be  
Now theyve had enough Theyve had enough  
  
Lonely faces everywhere  
Watch them starin at their hands  
Theres a house behind a house  
Theres a dream behind a dream
