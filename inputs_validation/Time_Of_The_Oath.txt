In a circle of fire  
On a cold winter night  
I spoke out my desire  
Made a promise  
I couldnt hide no  
  
In a dream  
He came along and told me  
Your time has come  
Your mind belongs to me  
  
Its the time of the oath  
The time of the oath  
My sweetest memories die in the cold  
Its the time of the oath  
  
See me covered with sadness  
And Ill soon wish to die  
When that overcoming madness  
Is eating up my mind  
  
Here and now  
I look back at a good time  
No more lie  I slowly say goodbye  
Its the time of the oath  
The time of the oath  
My sweetest memories die in the cold  
Its the time of the oath  
  
In a dream  
He came along and told me  
Your time has come  
Just slowly say goodbye  
Its the time of the oath  
The time of the oath  
My sweetest memories die in the cold  
Its the time of the oath  
  
Dies irae dies illa  
Solvet saecium in favilla  
Quantus tremor est futurus  
Quando judex est venturus
