Through the window I slip away  
Into the darkness time has come  
I must use caution summer nights are here Ill race  
For the shadows Ill make a trail  
No one can follow and all I feel  
Is the breeze rushin by my face  
  
Runnin free through the night in the street  
Like it best when I feel the heat  
I know my babys waitin just for me  
  
Creepin through her neighborhood  
I hope nobody has seen or heard  
My intentions are driven by this flame inside  
  
I see her light on her silhouettes  
In the window shes waiting for  
My arrival on this summer night  
  
Runnin free through the night in the street  
Like it best when I feel the heat  
Runnin free through the night in the street  
I know my babys waiting just for me  
Runnin free through the night in the street  
I like it best when I fell the heat oh yeah  
  
Through her window she slips away  
I hear her heartbeat  
High emotion takes us where weve never been before
