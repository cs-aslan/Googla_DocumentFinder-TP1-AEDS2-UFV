Hey Kid  
Wanna have some fun  
Choose a side  
And heres your gun  
  
Brought up  
Knowing right from wrong  
Squash the meek  
Inherit the strong  
  
Just try and  
Cross the line  
Dont even bother  
To waste my time  
  
Whats that  
Look in your eyes  
Its time I cut you  
Down to size  
  
This world aint  
Big enough for two  
And Ive got my  
Sights on you  
  
Would you like to be  
Im a warhead  
Youre a warhead  
A warhead just like me  
Hes a warhead  
Shes a warhead  
Watch em scream m yell  
Would you like to be  
A warhead too  
When I blow them  
Straight to hell  
  
Ramboy  
Its us and them  
Just like your Daddy  
In Vietnam  
Monkey see  
Monkey do  
Your boys grown up  
Just like you  
  
This world aint  
Big enough for two  
And Ive got my  
Sights on you  
  
Would you like to be  
Im a warhead  
Youre a warhead  
A warhead just like me  
Hes a warhead  
Shes a warhead  
Watch em scream n yell  
Would you like to be  
A warhead too  
When I blow them  
Straight to hell  
  
Ive seen Black heads  
White heads  
Red heads  
Dead heads  
Big heads  
Shit heads  
But theres no heads  
Like warheads
