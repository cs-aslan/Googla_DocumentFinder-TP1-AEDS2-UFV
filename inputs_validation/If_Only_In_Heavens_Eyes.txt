I never thought you were a fairweather friend  
You never let me down youre true to the end  
For in the darkest hour when all was lost  
Somehow you left the light on  
You faced the wrong and showed the world a thing or two  
Stood up for me and for you  
  
And you should know  
Some say it wasnt worth the things we went through things wewent through  
I say it aint worth losing you losingyou  
I hope you know how much youve changed all our lives  
SomedaySomeday youll see  
If only through heavens eyes  
Only through heavens  
  
I still remember the things that you said  
I keep your words alive I could never forget  
Cause in the final hour you made me proud  
So proud that I could know you  
Told the world its time that they believed in you  
You stood for right and truth  
  
And you should know  
Some say it wasnt worth the things we went through things wewent through  
I say it aint worth losing youlosing you  
I hope you know how much youve changed all our lives  
SomedaySomeday youll see  
If on ly through heavens eyes  
Only through heavens eyes  
  
And so we cant forget  
Weve got to keep remembering  
Them allthem all  
The ones who took the fall  
They did it for us all  
  
And we should learn from it  
Stand up if you believe in it  
Youve got to face the world be strong  
  
Some say it wasnt worth the things we went through  things wewent through  
I say it aint worth losing you  losing you   
I hope you know how much youve changed all our lives  
SomedaySomeday youll see  
If only through heavens eyes  
Only through heavens  
  
Some say it wasnt worth the things we went through things wewent through  
I say it aint worth losing you losing you  
I hope you know how much youve changed all our lives  
Someday Someday youll see  
If only through heavens eyes  
Only through heavens
