500000 halos   
Outshined the mud and history  
We washed and drank in  
Gods tears of joy  
And for onceand for everyone  
The truth was not a mystery  
  
Love called to allmusic is magic  
As we passed over and beyond the walls of nay  
Hand in hand as we lived and  
Made real the dreams of peaceful men  
  
We came togetherdanced with  
The pearls of rainy weather  
Riding the waves of music and  
Spacemusic is magic  
Magic is life  
Love as never loved before  
Harmony to son and daughterman and wife
