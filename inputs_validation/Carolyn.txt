The summer swept Chicago  
Left us with a little bit of rain  
We are trembling glistening  
Listening to the rumble of the elevated train  
  
And I have never been afraid  
Of opening myself up to a dream  
And now youve filled me like a bubble  
And the trouble is Im bursting at the seams  
  
I cant leave you Carolyn  
It has never been so quiet  
My heart will never beat this loud again  
I cant leave you Carolyn  
And walk back out amongst the strangers  
Strangers whove grown closer than my friends  
They grow closer than my friends  
  
A square of sunlight on the bedspread  
And I stagger through the silence til you wake  
We kiss away the morning  
Wishing that the morning lasted all day  
  
Well I have never been afraid  
Of opening myself up to a girl  
But now Ive let you in  
You begin to shake my precarious world  
  
I cant leave you Carolyn  
It has never been so quiet  
My heart will never beat this loud again  
I cant leave you Carolyn  
I walk back out amongst the strangers  
Strangers whove grown closer than my friends  
  
Sometimes love can be so  
Sometimes love can be so lonely  
Sometimes love can be so  
Sometimes love leaves you alone  
  
Carolyn  
I cant leave you Carolyn  
I cant leave you Carolyn  
I cant leave you Carolyn  
I cant leave you Carolyn  
I dont ever want to be lonely lonely Carolyn  
I dont ever want to be lonely lonely Carolyn  
I dont ever want to be lonely lonely Carolyn  
I dont ever want to be lonely lonely Carolyn  
Carolyn  
Carolyn
