Dont ever try to fool me  
Cause I can see right through you  
Its in your eyes  
You are the devil in disguise  
Hold me feel me  
Wound and heal me  
Mend this broken heart  
Though youre near me  
You cant hear me  
But you tear my soul apart  
I cant beat you  
Cant defeat you  
You just make me cry inside  
Dont even try to fool me  
Cause I can see right through you  
Its in your eyes  
You are the devil in disguise  
My rage is growing stronger  
And I cant wait no longer  
Its in your eyes  
You are the devil in disguise  
Never learning  
Vengeance is burning  
Deep inside your mind  
Time will come to  
When Ill make you  
Stumbling like blind leading the blind
