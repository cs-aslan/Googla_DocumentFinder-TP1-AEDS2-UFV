I dont know  
Man I just got here  
You got me thinking  
Im about to leave  
  
Some say maybe tomorrow  
New direction hello  
What I know know know  
What I know know know  
  
I walk tall  
I walk in the wild wind  
I love to stare  
I love to watch myself grow  
  
Someday maybe tomorrow  
New direction hello  
Well I know know know  
Well I know know know  
  
Street mission  
Street mission  
Street mission  
Street mission  
  
And Im promising nothing  
Im just living a smile  
I casually arrange it  
I knowwell I know know know  
  
Street mission  
Street mission  
Street mission  
Street mission  
  
I walk tall  
I walk in the wild wind  
I live an image  
Of plastic and gold  
  
Some say maybe tomorrow  
A resurrection hello  
Well I know know know  
Well I know know know  
Well I know know know  
Well I know know know

Ohi need something

Ohive got something

Street mission

Street mission  
Good night
