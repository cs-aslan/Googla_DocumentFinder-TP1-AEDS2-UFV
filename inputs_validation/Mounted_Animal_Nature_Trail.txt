On the Mounted Animal Nature Trail youll be sure to see  
All Mother Natures favourite pets all sitting rigidly  
Theyre never hungry any more their last meal left them stuffed  
Dont worry they wont walk away if you try and pet their fluff  
  
And the dog goes  
And the cow goes  
And the bear goes  
And the pig goes  
And the crow goes caw I guess it was alive  
You can see all this  
On the Mounted Animal Nature Trail  
  
The Mounted Animal Nature Trail its great for Mom and Dad  
Where else can Grandma and the kids see the silence of the lambs  
Dont have to walk a hundred miles ore climb the steepest hill  
And the only fearsome sound youll hear is the ringing of the till  
  
And the dog goes  
And the cow goes  
And the bear goes  
And the pig goes  
And the crow goes caw I guess it was alive  
You can see all this  
On the Mounted Animal Nature Trail  
  
The only things that bite are the bugs Oww  
And unlike other theme parks the mice wont say Hello  
And if youre having troubles with your own family pet  
You can bring him and add him to the trail  
  
Everyone and the dog goes  
And the cow goes  
And the bear goes  
And the pig goes  
And the crow goes caw I guess it was alive  
You can see all this
