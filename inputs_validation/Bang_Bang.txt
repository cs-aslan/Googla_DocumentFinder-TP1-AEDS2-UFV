Bang bang  
  
Bang bang  
  
Bang bang  
I shot you down bang bang  
You hit the ground bang bang  
That aweful sound bang bang  
I used to shoot you down  
  
Dont nobody want to die but everybody want to ball  
Somebody gotta go when them killas call  
You know its in us all you just gotta find it and use it  
You can get away with it if you dont abuse it  
The streets talk the beats mark cause that heat comin  
And if they know that you did it you better keep runnin  
I think I see sumthin there go my enemy  
Only lord knows where this nigga fnd to be  
Tennakee still the price is as real if you look it  
Might give it to you for 5 depend on if I took it  
Nigga anything goes my shop never close  
From the nickels and the dimes to the whole kilo  
The real niggas feel me the haters want to kill me  
But Im holdin down my city me and this 9 milli  
While your throwin bricks and hidin ya heads  
Homie I know where you hang  
Aint no thang to walk up and let that chopper go  
  
Bang bang  
I shot you down bang bang  
You hit the ground bang bang  
That awefull sound bang bang  
I used to shoot you down  
  
Now all the gangstas pray  
Lord forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
Lord forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
  
Just think if I aint empty the clip and he killed me  
Would I still be livin would my homeboys miss me  
How many niggas bust they gun when they have to  
Dont need no ski mask when its time to get at you  
Im glad you done seen what it look like when we left  
Brain fragments from shotgun blastsll take a nigga breathe  
Its death before dishonesty dope deals and robbery  
Poppa wasnt around but that shit didnt bother me  
Id probably be in the penitentary  
But I played the cards the dead lord sent to me  
The whole truth I use this booth to speak to my thug niggas  
Why you mad at me the governments the drug dealers  
Before I let this police kid harass me  
This rookie ass cop gon have to blast me  
He asked me for identification I looked at him and laughed  
He made a move and I heard a blast  
Thats what you get bitch  
  
Bang bang  
I shot you down bang bang  
You hit the ground bang bang  
That awefull sound bang bang  
I used to shoot you down  
  
Now all the gangstas pray  
Lord forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
Lord forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
  
Its goin down around here nigga  
Get ya muthafuckin head bust  
Them muthafuckin street lights go out  
And them real niggas come out  
All the bitch niggas go in the house  
Just not a game man  
Dont fuck around and lose your brain  
And hey all my real niggas pray  
  
Lord forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
Lord forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
  
Lord forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
Lord forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me
