Are you waiting on something profound in your life  
Something to touch your core  
Making up for what seems millions of years  
Reaping the goods but not sure  
  
Come along come along  
Can you see theres more  
Not just defeat vain attempts to do things right  
More than the toil to endure each day  
Or the ache you forget and leave behind  
  
If creatures roamed the space in heaven  
Theyre angels beasts or supermen  
Do they ease attaining things  
No one believed youd achieve  
So once you may ascend to heaven  
Someone there has made it so  
You could be the one theyve been waiting for  
  
Still running about seeking sense in your life  
What you couldnt make count before  
Taking much of your time is grieving about things  
Well you could care less whats that for  
  
Come along come along  
Can you see theres more  
Not just defeat vain attempts to do things right  
More than the toil to endure each day  
Or the ache you forget and leave behind  
  
Come along come along  
Can you see theres more  
Not just defeat vain attempts to do things right  
More than the toil to endure each day  
Or the ache you forget and leave behind

Theyre angels beasts or supermen  
Do they ease attaining things  
No one believed youd achieve  
So once you may ascend to heaven  
Someone there has made it so  
You could be the one theyve been waiting for
