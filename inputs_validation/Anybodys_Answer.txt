If you find yourself looking for someone  
To make good the bad things that youve done  
Now do you think youre looking straight ahead  
And will you find the answer when youre dead  
  
Well then you should listen now to me  
And Ill tell you how I think it should be  
No one tells you why youre here to live  
And this is why its you who must forgive  
  
No You cant kill your brother  
No Because you love each other  
No You cant steal his pennies  
No Cause you didnt leave him any  
  
Ah  
Ah  
Ah  
Ah  
  
And if reason tells you not to live  
But you feel theres something left to give  
You cant leave this place until its done  
So youll see one more rising of the sun  
  
Sun  
Sun youre just gonna see it one more time  
Sun oh you cant get away from it  
Sun youre gonna see it oh just one more time Oh
