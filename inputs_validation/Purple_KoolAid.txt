Woke up I wiped the sleepers from my eye  
Looked up to see     
      too  
Up in the    with you  
They call themselves the purple koolaid cult  
They lost their head and claim its all my fault  
Im fed koolaid intravenously  
I must regain my own autonomy  
Prechorus  
The purple koolaid cult is back Im paranoid again  
Would someone please appease all the stress of my  
Chorus  
Sorry friend theres no way I can stay  
Wish I could explain the reason why  
Im being chased so please pardon my haste  
Please appease the stress of my brown head  
They turned their backs and I began to run  
Looked back for a flash and I began to shout  
Ive got to find a passage out of here  
Im not too certain that the futures clear  
And now Im alone and to what type too wear  
And then they set upon a skinny chair  
Theyre gathering now around a sugar throne  
Its red and round and speaks of miracles  
Prechorus  
He says    him  
Weird ritual for you and I to mate  
I see a door   I see astray  
I pick up a furious pace so I can get away  
Dont smile a purple pleasure hangs the cape  
Oh Me Oh My It was the great escape  
The situation its still to me a bit of a scandal  
Every time I see a purple smile within my underwear  
Prechorus  
Chorus  
Four years and as many days float on by  
 carry out that silicone  atacious left behind  
Im going next door to celebrate I say  
 purple  koolaid  is the punch thats got me drunk today  
Next thing I know Im standing on a chair  
whipping my arms around the friendly air  
I preached the words around a year ago  
I now surrender to the certain glow  
Prechorus  
Chorus  
Ohhohohohohoh  
Im being  
Im being chased by seven kids high on koolaid  
But then theyre not crazy cause theyre high on koolaid  
But then theyre not crazy theyre just high on koolaid
