Daddy dont go out tonight  
Just stay home till morning light  
Me and mama dont feel right  
Please hold us tight  
Daddy why did you go to work  
When you know just how much we love you so  
Please come back tomorrow  
  
Chorus  
Theyre giving out guns in the ghetto  
Theyre saying they will set you free  
One day Ill have children of my own  
But Im afraid they wont have me  
  
Mama is Daddy home  
Why are you crying all alone  
Grandmas tears have turned to stone  
And Im all alone  
  
Mama isnt daddy back  
Im getting scared and thats a fact  
Why are we all dressed like that  
All in black  
  
Chorus  
  
Daddy dont go out tonight  
Please stay home till morning light  
Me and mama dont feel right  
Please hold us tight  
  
Daddy why did you go to work  
When you know just how much we love you so  
Please come back tomorrow  
  
Chorus  
  
Mama is Daddy home  
Why are you crying all alone  
Grandmas tears have turned to stone  
And Im chilled to the bone  
  
Mama isnt daddy back  
Im getting scared and thats a fact  
Why are we all dressed like that  
All in black  
  
Chorus x4
