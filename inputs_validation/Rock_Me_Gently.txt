Past five in the morning feeling worse for the weather it seems  
But what a feeling what an endless night this has been  
  
And we cant stay here cause we wont be forever young  
Well have to go down before innocence is lost  
  
And I dream youre with me  
You hold me sweetly  
And rock me gently to sleep  
In your arms  
  
Woah woah  
  
Ive been getting used to all the crying and the games that you play  
And if I carry on Im going to end up with a hole in my head  
  
And theres more to life than thrills and spills and dollar bills  
Well have to get through some way and somehow  
  
And I dream Im with you  
You hold me sweetly  
And rock me gently to sleep  
In your arms  
  
I dream youre with me  
You hold me sweetly  
And rock me gently to sleep  
In your arms  
Woah woah  
  
And I dream Im with you  
You hold me sweetly  
And rock me gently to sleep  
In your arms  
  
I dream youre with me  
You hold me sweetly  
And rock me gently to sleep  
In your arms
