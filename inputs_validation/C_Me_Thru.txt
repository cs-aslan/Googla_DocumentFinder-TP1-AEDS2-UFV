Im living in a perfect world  
Embedded in a perfect game  
Cant get enough of all this stuff  
But everything is quite the same  
And all the cigarettes and pills  
All the visions all the thrills  
They seem to come second hand  
I wonder if you understand  
The mirror is a brilliant place  
To lose myself within a maze  
They moved the moon when I looked down  
And then they turned the stars around  
I try to speak but whats the use  
Instead I scream Im so confused  
And when I tried to touch your face  
You disappeared without a trace  
Just see me through  
And please believe me what Im telling you  
you disappeared without a trace  
Dont bring me down  
Im standing naked here in front of u  
Just when I tried to touch your face  
Just come on here  
What do you think that i can do for you  
I might have lied so many times before  
But this time Ill be true  
  
These days are fast they seem like glass  
They rushing in and then they pass  
They have no value anymore  
They seem like clones or metaphors  
And honesty is what we hate  
Its what were trying to escape from  
I wash my hands a million times  
Like Pilate when he did his crimes  
When we are young were wild and free  
When we get old were history  
I struggled hard to fit the mold  
I hope I die before youre old  
It doesnt matter what we gain  
When all our does or dies are in vain  
And when the music fades away  
Our memories just go astray  
Just see me through  
And please believe me what Im telling you  
and when the music fades away  
Dont bring me down  
Im standing naked here in front of you  
your memories just go astray  
Just come on here  
What do you think that I can do for you  
I might have lied so many times before  
But this time Ill be true
