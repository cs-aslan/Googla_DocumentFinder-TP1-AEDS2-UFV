Come on baby dry your eyes wipe your tears  
Never like to see you cry please forgive me  
I wouldnt ever try to hurt you I just needed  
Someone to hold me to fill the void while you were gone  
To fill this space of emptiness  
Im only human of flesh and blood Im made  
Ooh human born to make mistakes  
If five boys in the house say it loud  
If five boys in the house check it out  
When I lay upon my bed I reminisce then I wish  
That I got you by my side with the cherry red kiss  
Hit me off make it soft hold me tight throughout the night  
You know Im gonna fight cos the thing we had was right  
But if you go all I know I cant go a day without you  
Here in my arms hypnotized with your charms now  
Im feeling for you baby aint you hearing the alarms  
You cant stop all that love that I got  
Wanna rewind time to better days that were hot check it  
Bring back the better days for me baby  
You gotta bring em back cos Im going crazy  
I go insane with your name up in my brain  
Things will never be the same you aint up in my frame  
So what you gonna do what you gonna say  
Tell me that youre gonna push your loving back my way  
Im only human of flesh and blood Im made  
Ooh human born to make mistakes  
If five boys in the house say it loud  
If five boys in the house check it out
