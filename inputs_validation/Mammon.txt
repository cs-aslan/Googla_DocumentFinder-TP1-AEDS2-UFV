What was yours to give  
Was also yours to sell  
Theres the haystack  
Can you spin it into gold  
  
Halo on your head  
A tail and cloven hoof  
You set sail upon a sea of open wallet  
  
And when youre played out  
Youll coast for miles  
Fueled by smiles  
  
You run in circles  
With industry professionals  
You climb the ladder  
That leads you to the temple gates  
The evil god there will welcome you with open arms  
  
What was yours to give  
Was also yours to sell  
But wheres the haystack now  
And wheres the pot of gold
