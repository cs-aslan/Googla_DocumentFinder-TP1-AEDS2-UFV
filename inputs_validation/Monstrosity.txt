If we followed your warning signs  
Children would swim alphabetically  
Mountaintops would all fall in line  
Singlefile by height  
If this was the only way daydreaming would stop at 5 oclock  
And the corner flashes off from left to right  
  
Lies lies  
You dont always get your way  
  
Saturday slow to wake Bugs Bunny love  
Thought those people would never go home guess its the price we pay  
If everyday were Saturday  
Oh most people couldnt even go it alone  
  
Lies lies  
We dont always get our ways  
  
Oh and its time time to sleep  
Nightdreaming starts with hands held high  
Maybe then well finally turn it on  
Like a brand new   
  
Lies lies  
We dont always get our ways  
Turn it on  
Turn it on  
Gentle  
Fragile
