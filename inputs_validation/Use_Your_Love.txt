I know you know my boyfriend is out of town  
So have a drink lets talk it over  
So many things I shouldnt be sayin now  
You know I like my boys a little bit older  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight  
I dont wanna lose your love tonight  
  
All my girls are nowhere to be found  
They all split when Im in trouble  
But Ill tell you all my secrets if you stick around  
The undercoverlovers under the covers  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight  
I dont wanna lose your love tonight  
  
I just wanna use your love love  
I just wanna use your love love  
I just wanna use your love love love  
  
try to keep my head from spinning  
Too much to drink not making sense  
Been a while since Ive been with someone new  
But I cant stop the way Im feeling  
  
As you leave please would you just close the door  
Now that our love affair is over  
Youre exactly what I was looking for  
Well go find a shoulder to cry upon  
  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight  
I dont wanna lose your love tonight  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight  
I dont wanna lose your love tonight  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight  
I dont wanna lose your love tonight  
  
You dont mean nothing at all to me  
You dont mean nothing at all to me  
You dont mean nothing at all to me  
You dont mean nothing at all to me  
You dont mean nothing at all  
  
I think Im done fuckn singing this song  
I think Im done fuckn singing this song  
I think Im done fuckn singing this song  
Singing this song song song song
