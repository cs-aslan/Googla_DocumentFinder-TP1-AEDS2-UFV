Lyricsbosson music bosson  
Gonna tell the world that Ive fallen for you  
Ive got a secret I cant hold it back anymore  
Ive got to share it with everyone I know  
Its a lifetime waiting for someone like you  
Im falling a feeling too good to be true so true  
I write you a song on the radio  
I want them to know that Ill die for you  
Chorus  
This is the right time oh oh this is the moment  
Im gonna tell the world that Ive fallen for you x2  
I never thought that there was a space inside me  
But you found it a place where you wanted to be  
Im happy you gave me time to see  
Im falling for the first time I feel that Im free  
I write you a song on the radio  
I want them to know that Ill die for you  
Chorus  
Ill write you a poem in the magazine  
Ill buy some time in the 7 oclock news  
I run through the city naked shout and scream  
Heeyoo heyoooooo  
Ill drop some flyers from an aeroplane  
Im making a movie where Im singing in the rain  
I send out the message to the outer space  
Calling earth ground control do you read me  
I read you over  
Weve got a small problem up here  
We found a guy who says hes got a message for the world  
I think hes really fallen in loveover and out  
Chorus  
Ohooo heeyooooo  
Ohooo cant hold it back no more  
Ohooo heeyooooo  
Ohooo gonna tell the world  
Chorus
