You are a moron  
Im glad to be here  
Seeing the sight of you  
Smelling the smell of you  
  
You most deplorable glaring example  
Of a degenerate narcotic influence  
My seething hate is driving me nuts  
What can I do to obliterate you  
  
I snub you  
I really hope youre one of a kind  
You dont care who you brutalize  
You are a bully plain and simple  
  
You are a beast you are a pig  
Youve been a pig for long enough now  
Im making my move  
Im making an end to you  
  
I snub you  
And when I snub  
I really snub  
I snub you finally forever  
  
Is she really going out with him  
Now is the time  
Im playing my ate  
Ill give you a mouthful you cant swallow  
  
Unquestionably Ive been lacking in taste  
Youre being cheerful but not for long  
Your Mum and Dad they sure made a mess  
Youre going to look like watercress  
  
When I snub you  
He snubs you  
We snub you  
Dogs snub you  
I snub you
