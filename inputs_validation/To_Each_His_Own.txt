A rose must remain with the sun and the rain  
Or its lovely promise wont come true  
To each his own to each his own  
And my own is you  
  
What good is a song if the words just dont belong  
And a dream must be a dream for two  
No good alone to each his own  
For me theres you  
  
If a flame is to grow there must be a glow  
To open each door theres a key  
And I need you I know I cant let you go  
Your touch means too much to me  
  
Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed  
Or theyll never know what love can do  
To each his own Ive found my own  
One and only you  
  
If a flame is to grow there must be a glow  
To open each door theres a key  
I need you I know I cant let you go  
Your touch means too much to me  
  
Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed  
Or theyll never know what love can do  
To each his own Ive found my own  
One and only you
