Youve got a plan that could never go wrong  
You took advantage and the damage done  
It all comes back to me baby  
It all comes back to me  
  
I played the fool and I went off the track  
And when I think of all it cost  
When the dice was cast  
You know I had to be crazy  
You know I had to be  
  
Ive been telling lies  
And you forgive me but my heart still cries  
And you can understand  
  
Im just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan  
No one to show me the signs  
Im just a creature of habit  
In a complicated world  
Nowhere to run to  
Nowhere to hide to hide to hide to hide  
  
I know I let you down in so many ways  
I know that sorry doesnt tell you  
What you need me to say  
But I would die for you baby  
Yes I would die for you  
  
Ive been in disguise  
And you forgive me and our love will rise  
And you can understand  
  
Im just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan  
No one to show me the light  
Ahyes Im weary from battle  
But Ive just begun to fight  
Nowhere to run to  
Nowhere to hide  
  
Im just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan  
No one to show me the signs  
Im just a creature of habit  
In a complicated world  
Nowhere to run to  
Nowhere to hide to hide to hide  
  
Im just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan  
No one to show me the light  
Ah yes Im weary from battle  
But Ive just begun to fight  
Nowhere to run to  
Nowhere to hide  
  
Im just the man in the middle  
The only man  
The fool of a man in the middle  
Nowhere to run to  
Nowhere to hide  
  
Im just the man  
The only man  
That stupid man  
Nowhere to run to  
Nowhere to hide to hide to hide
