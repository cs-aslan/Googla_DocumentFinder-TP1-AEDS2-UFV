Its all in your head she said  
You know its right there in you mind  
Soul food is brain food so you get back payment in kind  
Stroll up to the cash desk push you trolley up that ramp  
The changell do you good she said  
And you even get Green Stamps  
  
Were just waiting for the story to end  
The credits will be rolling again  
If you make love to your enemies  
You masturbate your friends and thats the end  
  
Its all there in the past she said  
When the Merry Pranksters rolled  
The cats and dogs in harmony  
And the ppigs do what theyre told  
Get back on the bus she said lovin Kenny Kesey Jones  
The streets are paved with daisies  
Coz we made them on our own
