Oh yes  
A kiss in the dark  
A certain time I can call you  
A letter of love  
But no name did you sign  
Pretending to all  
That we were just friends when I saw you

For your To be  
  
Your secret love  
Why cant we tell somebody  
Cause secret loves  
Never last as long  
Your secret love  
Will never be your true love
