How did I drink in here playing the same song  
Eating potato skins  
Theres nowhere to go  
Were still in Ohio  
Mountain dew  
  
Drinking CocaCola eating cheeseburgers  
Where the french fries are  
Hungry for my life and putrefactive  
Mountain dew  
  
Every time I drank it all at once  
At the restaurant  
Thats my name  
I could make it after all  
Even if I drank again  
  
Every night I slept  
My face dont wanna turn red  
All I want to do  
I thank my friends to meet  
That I had to dream  
Mountain dew  
  
Every time I drank it all at once  
At the restaurant  
Thats my name  
I could make it after all  
Even if I drank again  
  
How did I drink in here playing the same song  
Not another thing  
I think Im grown up  
Making pizza crust  
Mountain dew  
Mountain dew
