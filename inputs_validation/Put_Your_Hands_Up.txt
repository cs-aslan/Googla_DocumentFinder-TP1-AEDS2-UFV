I look around I see a million different faces  
But no ones lookin in my eyes  
It takes a minute when Im in these different places  
To realize  
All we need is love in this life its true  
All I need is the love I get from you  
And I wanna scream it out  
If you hear what Im sayin  
Put your hands up  
If youre feelin love tonight  
If youre feelin love  
Now put your hands up  
If youre feelin love tonight  
If youre feelin love  
No matter what were gonna take this moment  
Now come on baby you can show me  
So put your hands up  
If youre feelin love tonight  
If youre feelin love  
Everybody knows how life can get so twisted  
But I wont let it bring me down  
And theres no point in ever tryin to resist it  
Just work it out  
All we need is love in this life its true  
All I need is the love I get from you  
So put your hands up  
If youre feelin love tonight  
If youre feelin love  
Now put your hands up  
If youre feelin love tonight  
If youre feelin love  
No matter what were gonna take this moment  
Now come on baby you can show me  
So put your hands up  
If youre feelin love tonight  
If youre feelin love  
If youre comin out tonight  
Let me hear it now  
Said if youre comin out tonight  
Let me hear it  
Now put your hands up  
If youre feelin love  
Now put your hands up  
If youre feelin love  
So put your hands up  
If youre feelin love tonight  
If youre feelin love  
Now put your hands up  
If youre feelin love tonight

No matter what were gonna take this moment  
Now come on baby you can show me  
So put your hands up
