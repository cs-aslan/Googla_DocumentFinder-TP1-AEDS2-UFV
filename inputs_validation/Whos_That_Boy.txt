I wanna get you by yourself  
Yeah have you to myself  
I dont need nobody else  
Dont want nobody else  
Hes special I know  
His smile it glows  
Hes perfect it shows lets go  
  
Ive been starin at ya  
And I could do it all night  
Youre looking like an angel  
With that kinda body needs a spotlight  
  
Aint no body know your name  
But looking like you do could be famous  
I could see us makin waves  
From the back of the club  
To a bed in the shade  
  
Chorus  
Now I dont know who you are  
But you look like a star  
And everybody here be thinkin  
Whos that boy  
Wanna take you home  
And get you all alone  
And everybody here is thinkin  
Whos that boy  
  
Oh he got me  
No Ive never seen  
No one like him  
Damn hes everything  
Girls they want him  
Guys they want to be  
Whos that boy whos that boy  
  
You could say that Im distracted  
But ah you got me so attracted  
But boy Ill tell you what the fact is  
Is no one else in this room  
That could rock it like you you do  
  
Aint no body know your name  
But looking like you do could be famous  
I could see us makin waves  
From the back of the club  
To a bed in the shade  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh he got me  
No Ive never seen  
No one like him  
Damn hes everything  
Girls they want him

Whos that boy whos that boy  
  
Everybody in the club turn around sayin  
Whos that whos that  
Beautiful boy with them big brown eyes tell me  
Whos that whos that

Cant get him off my mind  
Hes one of a kind  
The cherry to my pie  
I just wanna get him close  
  
Wanna make him mine  
Come hold my hand and dance away the night  
Give me the green light kiss my lips  
Whos that boy watching my hips  
I I I wanna know who you are  
My name is Dev and you can be my star  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh he got me  
No Ive never seen  
No one like him  
Damn hes everything  
Girls they want him  
Guys they want to be  
Whos that boy whos that boy
