Ive been looking for a driver who is qualified  
So if you think that youre the one step into my ride  
Im a fine cool supersonics speed machine  
Got a sunroof top and a gangster lead  
  
So if you feel it let me know know know  
Come on now what youre waiting for for for  
My engines ready to explode explode explode  
So start me up and watch me go go go  
  
Chorus  
Get you where you wanna go if you know what I mean  
Got a ride thats smoother than a limousine  
Can you handle the curves can you run all the lights  
If you can baby boy than we can go all night  
Cause its zero to sixty in three point five  
Baby you got the keys  
Now shut up and drive drive drive  
Shut up and drive drive drive  
  
I got class like a fiftyseven Cadillac  
Start over drive with a whole lot of boom in the back  
You look like you can handle whats under my hood  
You keeping saying that you will boy I wish you would  
  
So if you feel it let me know know know  
Come on now what youre waiting for for for  
My engines ready to explode explode explode  
So start me up and watch me go go go  
  
Chorus  
  
You play that game got what I got  
Get it get it dont stop its a sure shot  
Aint a Ferrari huh boy Im sorry  
I aint need to worry so step inside  
And ride ride ride  
  
So if you feel it let me know know know  
Come on now what youre waiting for for for  
My engines ready to explode explode explode  
So start me up and watch me go go go  
  
Chorus  
  
Shut up and drive drive drive  
Shut up and drive drive drive  
Drive drive drive
