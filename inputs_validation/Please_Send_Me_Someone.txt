Some people said if I could only care for you  
Some people said he will never love again  
Some people said you can see it in his eyes  
He keeps it all inside and yet    
Some people say in time we all teach ourselves to live this way  
  
And for a thousand days I was lost  
I thought never to be found  
Underground  
And dont you think Im ready now  
So please send me someone to love   
  
Please send me someone someone to love  
As much as I loved you  
The way I loved you darlin  
Please please send me someone someone to love  
Please send me someone  
  
Any time any day any time any day now  
Any time any day any time any day now  
Please please send me someone  
Just to hold me now that youre gone  
  
Some people say  I hope you know Im there for you  
Some of the people said  nothing  
And nothing was just fine  
You know how I get sometimes   
  
And for a thousand days I was lost  
I said  Heaven knows Im ready to be found  
Underground  
But I think Im ready now  
So please send me someone to love  
  
Please send me someone someone to love  
As much as I loved you  
Please please send me someone someone to love  
Please send me someone

Any time any day any time any day now

So say that you will because the nights are long  
Without our song to sing  
Just search the clouds until  Until  
So say that you will  
Show me right from wrong  
Without our song to sing  
Just search the clouds until  Until  
And Darlin darlin though I cant replace you theres a  
Space in my heart  
A space that you left in my heart  
Just give me something that will pull me back from the blue  
  
Oh send me someone like you  
  
Darlin darlin no I cant replace you theres a space in my heart  
A space that you left in my heart  
Just give me something that will pull me back from the blue  
  
Please send me someone to love
