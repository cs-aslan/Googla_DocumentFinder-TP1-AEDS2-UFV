Right lets get the whole thing cooking  
  
I try to run in a different race  
But every time I seem to loose face  
Making it hard its easy  
But I got to keep trying to lessen my pace  
  
I try to walk down a citystreet  
I say hello to the people I meet  
Theyre walking their way and thinking Im crazy  
But I have so much trouble just to keeping the beat  
  
Well my way of life is simple  
Cause I just do what I please  
Whatever I was blessing  
Well it wornt to laugh at me  
  
Maybe Im just a country boy  
Hinging life bringing no joy  
Well its bringing me down its making me lonely  
You see Im fooling with a life and it aint no toy  
  
Well my way of life is simple  
Cause I just do what I please  
And whenever I got problems  
I just call upon Aries  
  
Here she comes  
Here she comes
