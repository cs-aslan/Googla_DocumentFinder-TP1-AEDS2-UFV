He stays out every night  
And leaves me all alone  
He never tells me where he goes  
Im not the only lonely one  
Just ask a woman who knows  
We used to share our troubles  
And the good times too  
  
Now Im left with all the woes  
Im not the only sorry one  
Just ask a woman who knows  
The days are long  
  
Oh but the nights are longer  
I got the lonesomest blues  
You know my only consolation  
Is I aint got nothing more to lose  
So there you have the story  
Of a love gone wrong  
  
That used to blossom like a rose  
Oh Im not the only broken heart  
Just ask a woman who knows  
  
Well my only consolation  
Is that I got nothing more to lose  
So there you have the story  
Of a love gone wrong  
  
That used to blossom like a rose  
But Im not the only broken heart  
Just ask a woman  
And Im a woman  
Just ask a woman who knows  
Oh yeah  
Ask a woman ask a woman  
And Im a woman  
Who knows
