Get back the fact is that their giving me slack cause Im the  
prophet of naught and the gospel aphrodisiac Give me  
sorrow I break it into love You gotta follow Im holding our  
people above No time to wait theres the gate proceed

musical instrument the public embarrassment the hand  
around your neck and your money unspent

Make you giddy in you stomach like your sisters are ba ra  
bop And now you met your match as I drain out your power  
and make you stop like a Seiko sports watch

fan Its the Quarashi plan taken from the Koran They beat  
us up and they wait till we break but in the end this is just  
another earthquake Repent and your lost forget with all  
cost Its a malady a sickness you cant floss You gotta  
leave it behind look around find a sign get back on the  
track and walk the fine line

motherfucking weirdo

Please stay a little longer and youre gonna get some from  
the man from the crew little boy blue Wait until its dark  
and well be home for you Now you may fuck up you

the whole world sick thats it Making me ill you know
