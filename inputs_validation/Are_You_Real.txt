No ones alive  
You could almost be me  
What do you mean  
Oh nothing nothing at all  
Room eight top floor  
Ive seen this man before  
Are you real  
  
Is it me is it you  
Cold metal voice  
Of no ones friend it could be mine  
My reflection  
Is no longer me at all  
Am I a fake  
Of the man and are you of me  
Are you real  
  
Is it me is it you  
Relax in a backroom  
Oh me oh my oh wouldnt you  
I know your face  
Your connection is broken boy  
Nothing is new  
Remember Ive got no time  
Are you real  
  
Is it me is it you  
Real  
Real  
Real
