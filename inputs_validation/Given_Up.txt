Wake in a sweat again  
Another days been laid to waste  
In my disgrace  
Stuck in my head again  
Feels like Ill never leave this place  
Theres no escape  
Im my own worst enemy  
  
Chorus  
Ive given up  
Im sick of feeling  
Is there nothing you can say  
Take this all away  
Im suffocating  
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me  
  
I dont know what to take  
Thought I was focused but Im scared  
Im not prepared  
I hyperventilate  
Looking for help somehow somewhere  
And no one cares  
Im my own worst enemy  
  
Chorus  
  
God  
  
Put me out of my misery  
Put me out of my misery  
Put me out of my  
Put me out of my fucking misery  
  
Chorus
