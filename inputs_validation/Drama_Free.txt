Chorus  
Oh no Im not the one you see  
So dont you go confusing me  
Ive got a different mentality  
Im trying to be drama free  
You stress me out and thats the truth  
I dont want no substitute  
For the peace of my mind that comes to me  
Cause Im living drama free  
Can you give me one bit of rest  
Gotta say you didnt pass the test  
I thought about it but you aint Gods best  
Youre just not what I need  
Tried to run a stupid game on me  
Im not blind I see quite clearly  
Cant have you disrespecting me  
So Im gone just like the breeze  
Can you give me just one bit of space  
Girl I love you but youre driving me insane  
Gossiping always into trouble and then  
You want me to justify  
Tired of hearing stories he said she said  
Tired of hearing bout the crazy things you did  
Would you listen to me just once or twice  
Make a difference in your life  
But you dont now  
Bridge  
Ive made changes I know you see  
No more old this is my new leaf  
Leaving behind all thats stressing me  
Needlessly drama free  
Oh oh oh Can you hear me  
Oh oh oh Can you feel me  
Its not that I dont care about it  
Its just that Ive got to do without it  
One My choice to just be done  
Two Hope I made it clear to you  
Three Something that works for me  
Four dont want the drama no more
