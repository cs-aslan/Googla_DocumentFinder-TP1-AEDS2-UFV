Take a look at these hands  
Take a look at these hands  
The hand speaks the hand of a government man  
Well Im a tumbler born under punches Im so thin  
  
All I want is to breathe  
Im too thin  
Wont you breathe with me  
Find a little space so we move inbetween  
Inbetween it  
And keep one step ahead of yourself  
  
Dont you miss it dont you miss it  
Some of you people just about missed it  
Last time to make plans  
And Im a tumbler Im a government man  
  
Never seen anything like that before  
Falling bodies tumble cross the floor  
Well Im a tumbler  
When you get to where you wanna be  
Thank you Thank you  
When you get to where you wanna be  
Well dont even mention it  
  
Oh take a look at these hands theyre passing inbetween us  
Take a look at these hands  
Take a look at these hands you dont have to mention it  
No thanks Im a government man  
  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
And the heat goes on where the hand has been  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
  
And the heat goes on  
I got time  
And the heat goes on  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
And the heat goes on where the hand has been  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
  
Im not a drowning man  
And Im not a burning building Im a tumbler  
Drowning cannot hurt a man  
Fire cannot hurt a man not the government man  
  
All I want is to breathe  
Thank you thank you  
Wont you breathe with me  
Find a little space so we move inbetween  
Im so thin  
And keep one step ahead of yourself  
Im catching up with myself  
  
All I want is to breathe  
Wont you breathe with me  
Hands of a government man  
Find a little space so we move inbetween  
And keep one step ahead of yourself  
Dont you miss it Dont you miss it  
  
All I want is to breathe  
Wont you breathe with me
