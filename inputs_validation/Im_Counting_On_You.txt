Im counting on you  
Ever since we met darling  
Ive been keeping score  
Every day I count your charms  
Every day I love you more  
Its plain to see why youre the lover I waited for  
  
Im counting the different ways you melt me  
Your smile your voice your touch  
Im counting the little things you tell me  
That move me oh so much  
Im counting your kisses and caresses  
And cause I thrill as I do  
For Im counting on you  
  
Im counting the hours since I found you  
The days and nights divine  
Im counting the dreams I built around you  
Because your love is mine  
Im counting on happiness forever  
Oh lover always be true  
For Im counting on you  
  
Im counting on you  
Im counting on you  
Im counting on you
