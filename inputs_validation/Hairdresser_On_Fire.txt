Here is London giddy of London  
Is it home of the free  
Or what  
  
Can you squeeze me  
Into an empty page of your diary  
And psychologically save me  
Ive got faith in you  
I sense the power  
Within the fingers  
Within an hour the power  
Could totally destroy me  
Or it could save my life  
  
Oh here is London  
Home of the brash outrageous and free  
You are repressed  
But youre remarkably dressed  
Is it real  
And youre always busy  
  
Really busy  
Busy busy  
Oh hairdresser on fire  
All around Sloane Square  
And youre just so busy  
Busy busy  
Busy scissors  
Oh hairdresser on fire  
Only the other day  
  
Was a client overcautious  
He made you nervous  
And when he said  
Im gonna sue you  
Oh I really felt for you  
  
So can you squeeze me  
Into an empty page of your diary  
And supernaturally change me  
Change me change  
Oh here in London  
Home of the brash outrageous and free  
You are repressed  
But youre remarkably dressed  
Is it real  
And youre always busy  
  
Really busy  
Busy clippers  
Oh hairdresser on fire  
All around Sloane Square  
  
And youre just too busy  
To see me  
Busy clippers  
Oh hairdresser on fire  
Only the other day
