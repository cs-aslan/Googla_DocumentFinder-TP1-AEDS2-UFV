I wanna run away  
Dont come out looking round  
Too busy dealing with it on my own  
Hes right behind me  
Please God I cant be found  
Dont cast another stone  
Feel out the night until the sunrise  
The city tells me not to go til dawn  
And if he wakes thats when my heart breaks  
And Im as good as gone  
  
How do I lie awake now  
When I know Ive got to be moving on  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothings right and nothings wrong  
  
And in the end  
Will we make our amends  
Just like were face to face another dawn  
And in the light or when the moon shines  
Will you take me on home  
  
How do I lie awake now  
When I know Ive got to be moving on  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothings right and nothings wrong  
  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothings right and nothings wrong  
How do I lie awake now  
When I know Ive got to be moving on  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothings right and nothings wrong
