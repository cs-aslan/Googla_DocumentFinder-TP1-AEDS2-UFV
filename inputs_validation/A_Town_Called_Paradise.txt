Copycats ripped off my words  
Copycats ripped off my songs  
Copycats ripped off my melody  
It doesnt matter what they say  
It doesnt matter what they do  
All that matters is my relationship to you  
  
Gonna take you out  
Get you in my car  
Were going for a long long long drive  
Were going down to a town called Paradise  
Down where we can be free  
Were gonna drink that wine  
Were gonna jump for joy  
In a town called Paradise  
  
Were going up the mountainside  
Child you can look for miles  
And see the vision on the west  
Were gonna swing round  
And look north south and east to west  
And go round in a circle too  
  
And were gonna start dancing  
Like weve never done before  
Im gonna take you in my arms  
Im gonna squeeze you tight  
Everything will be alright  
Were gonna get that squealin feelin  
Take you down to a town called Paradise  
Down where we we can be free  
  
It doesnt matter what they say  
It doesnt matter what they do  
All that matters is my relationship to you  
By the river we will linger  
As we drive down to be free  
Were gonna ride all night long  
All along the ancient highway  
Gonna be there for the mornin comes
