I just walked in and you were gone  
To your mamas I suppose  
It looks like you wont be back so I thought youd ought to know  
I found that note you left today  
It only took you half a page  
Im gonna grab my old guitar take a pencil from the jar fill in the empty
space  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna tell you how I feel straightup genuine and real  
Open a bottle of ninetyproof and write a song for you  
Like Kristofferson would do  
  
In each line youre gonna hear its my fault and I miss you  
I know it wont be in time it may not even rhyme  
But all it has to be is true  
  
Im gonna tell you how I feel straightup genuine and real  
Open a bottle of ninetyproof and write a song for you  
Like Kristofferson would do  
  
Im gonna tell you how I feel straightup genuine and real  
Open a bottle of ninetyproof and write a song for you  
Like Kristofferson would do  
  
Im gonna drink this bottle of ninetyproof and sing this song for you  
Like Kristofferson would do
