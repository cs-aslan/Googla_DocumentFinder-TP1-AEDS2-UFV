A mix of pain and happiness  
Surrounds us even now  
A mix of pain and happiness  
I dont know why or how  
Its still here  
Its outlasted every year  
Were still here  
Just like you say  
  
A mix of pain and happiness  
Between a woman and a man  
A mix of pain and happiness  
Replaced every plan  
Love is true  
Or it is between me and you  
Love is all  
I have to say  
  
I saw your face I heard your voice  
I was a prisoner I had no choice  
  
I saw your face I heard your voice  
I was a prisoner I had no choice  
  
A mix of pain and happiness  
Tumbles us downhill  
A mix of pain and happiness  
Takes us where it will  
It cant last  
Its over much too fast  
Let it last  
Another day
