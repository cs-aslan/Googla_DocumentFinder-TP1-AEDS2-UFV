You work like a slave for the kids and Id go to my grave for the kids  
But we watched our love fade as we suffered that state  
With this bargain we made for the kids  
Divorce is a curse for the kids but this intentions much worse for the kids  
Yes theyre now old enough and they made the strongest stuff  
Still its gonna be rough for the kids  
These teardrops that fall for the kids you know theyre really not all for the
kids  
But I know you dont care and the only love there  
Is the love thatd be shared for the kids  
Find a new love you should for the kids and I hope that hes good for the kids  
And though Im now out of singht if he dont treat them right  
Ill be right back and Ill fight for the kids  
But I see you dont care the home that we shared  
All our hopes and our prayers for the kids
