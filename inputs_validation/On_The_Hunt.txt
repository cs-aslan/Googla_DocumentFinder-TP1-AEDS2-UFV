I said baby mama I dont know your name  
But I said baby sugar I can play your game  
Every night when we leave the hall  
I see you hanging around  
You want to ride in my big black car baby  
Want to go uptown  
  
Chorus  
I know who you are baby  
I know what they call you girl  
Never put you down baby  
Im just like you baby Im on the hunt  
  
I know lady  
People gonna talk about you and me  
Let me say one thing mama sugar I do as I please  
And if you want to love me baby Im your man  
And all those highfalutin society people  
I dont care if they dont understand  
  
Chorus  
  
My daddy told me a long time ago  
Said theres two things son  
Two things you should know  
And in these two things you must take pride  
Thats a horse and woman yeah  
Well both of them you ride
