Did you see me coming  
Was I that obvious  
For all of a sudden  
There were just two of us  
  
You dont have be in Whos Who to know whats what  
You dont have to be a highflyer to catch your slot  
The night we met was cold and wet  
I needed a drink or two  
I saw you standing there and I knew  
Id love to be loved by you  
  
Did you see me coming  
Was I that obvious  
For all of a sudden  
There were just two of us  
  
You dont have to be whats what to know whos who  
You dont need the DNA to find the proof  
Then and there my life made sense  
You were the evidence  
  
Did you see me coming  
Was I that obvious  
For all of a sudden  
There were just two of us  
Did you see me coming  
I thought Id have to make  
All of the running  
I was all yours to take  
  
Am I superstitious or really religious  
Just to thyself be true  
But now I think Im starting to believe in fate  
Because it delivered you  
  
Did you see me coming  
Was I that obvious  
For all of a sudden  
There were just two of us  
Did you see me coming  
I thought Id have to make  
All of the running  
I was all yours to take
