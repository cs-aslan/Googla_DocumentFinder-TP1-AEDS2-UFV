Driving over the bridge to give you my kiss  
I know you dont love me I know it aint easy  
Friends become lovers and lovers lose friends  
Thats when the fog rolls in  
Oh oh oh  
Im losing you  
Oh oh oh  
Youre losing me too  
  
In through the kitchen where we used to laugh  
Smells of your cooking sounds of the past  
Somehow we got older the air just got colder  
Thats when the fog rolls in  
Oh oh oh  
Im losing you  
Oh oh oh  
Youre losing me too  
  
So much for sowing up  
So this is growing up  
Everything is going up for sale  
The fog kept on rolling in  
The time came to sink or swim  
They say its better to try and fail  
And we tried like hell  
  
I take a deep breath with my hand on the door  
Afraid cause Im not gonna see you anymore  
These were our tender years this was our street  
All of our stop lights and all our concrete  
Now its all somebody elses to take  
Until the fog rolls in
