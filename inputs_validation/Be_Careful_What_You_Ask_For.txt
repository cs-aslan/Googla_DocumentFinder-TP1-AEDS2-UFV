We burn out in the dark  
We are invisible stars  
We are a question mark  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
We are broken bet  
We never had a chance  
We want what we dont have  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
We will never die  
Put your hope in the sky  
To burn a perfect light  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
Im sorry we are living in the car  
This isnt what you wanted  
When you gave me your heart  
Im sorry I got lazy in need  
This isnt what you wanted  
When you married me  
  
Life looks better when you waste the day away  
Life looks better when you make it all again  
Life looks better when you drink away the pain  
Life looks better when you look away  
  
We burn out in the dark  
We are invisible stars  
We are a question mark  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
We are broken bet  
We never had a chance  
We want what we dont have  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
I know you get mad at me  
When your card gets denied  
At the market down the street  
I know that you wanna leave  
Yeah this isnt what you wanted  
When you married me  
  
Life looks better when you waste the day away  
Life looks better when you make it all again  
Life looks better when you drink away the pain  
Life looks better when you look away  
  
We burn out in the dark  
We are invisible stars  
We are a question mark  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
We are broken bet  
We never had a chance  
We want what we dont have  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
You wanna believe  
The world can be perfect  
That anyone can be redeemed  
The getters always better than bad  
Thats where it all goes bad  
Just when you think  
That everything is gonna be alright  
Thats where it all goes bad  
Just when you think  
That everything is gonna be alright  
Thats where it all goes bad  
  
We burn out in the dark  
We are invisible stars  
We are a question mark  
Be careful what you ask for  
No guess whos around  
Be careful what you ask for  
This isnt what I asked for  
Be careful what you ask for  
This isnt what I wanted to see  
Be careful what you ask for  
This isnt what I asked for  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
Life looks better  
When you look the other way  
Baby look away  
Baby do yourself a favor  
Look the other way
