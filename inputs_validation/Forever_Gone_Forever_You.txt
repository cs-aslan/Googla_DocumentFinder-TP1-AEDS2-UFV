I wanted you to be with me  
For so long I dont even know by now  
But now that Ive given up on you  
Defiantly you see me  
  
Walking away I see the pain  
You put me through  
I see through you  
Lost in your game to change the same  
Forever gone forever you  
  
Theres something very wrong about this  
I think you knew all along somehow  
Youll only take me to change my mind  
Lonely broken and defeated  
  
So far away I see the truth  
I see through you  
I see through you  
Now that I know the way you play  
I dont want to  
  
Walking away I see the pain  
You put me through  
I see through you  
Lost in your game to change the same  
Forever gone forever you  
  
So far away I see the truth  
I see through you  
I see through you  
Now that I know the way you play  
I dont want to  
  
Walking away I see the pain  
You put me through  
I see through you  
Lost in your game to change the same  
Forever gone forever you
