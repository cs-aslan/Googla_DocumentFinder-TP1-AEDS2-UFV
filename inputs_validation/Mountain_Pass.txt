Well Im runnin down this mountain pass at midnight  
Those truckers they all flash their lights at me  
This highway aint the very best companion  
Cause I know theres somewhere else Id rather be  
  
The moonlight on the snow just sets me thinking  
Bout the way your smile shines upon your face  
And I know this aint the last beer Ill be drinking  
Before I reach my final resting place  
  
Oh I wish that I was in your arms a sleeping  
Dreaming of the sweet love we just made  
But Im runnin down this mountain pass at midnight  
Wishin I was in your arms again  
  
Oh my wheels are running hard against this mountain  
I finally crossed the Archuleta line  
Another hour and Ill be with my darlin  
To dry those lonesome tears that shes been cryin  
  
Oh I wish that I was in your arms a sleeping  
Dreaming of the sweet love we just made  
But Im runnin down this mountain pass at midnight  
Wishin I was in your arms again  
  
Im runnin down this mountain pass at midnight  
Those truckers they all flash their lights at me  
Well this highway aint the very best companion  
Cause I know theres somewhere else Id rather be  
Oh I wish that I was in your arms a sleeping  
Dreaming of the sweet love we just made  
But Im runnin down this mountain pass at midnight  
Wishin I was in your arms again  
I am runnin down this mountain pass at midnight  
Wishin I was in your arms again
