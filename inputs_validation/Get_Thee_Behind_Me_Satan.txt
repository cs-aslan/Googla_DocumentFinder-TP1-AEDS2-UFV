Get thee behind me satan  
I want to resist  
But the moon is low and I cant say no  
Get thee behind me  
  
Get thee behind me satan  
I mustnt be kissed  
But the moon is low and I may let go  
Get thee behind me  
  
Someone Im mad about  
Is waiting in the night for me  
Someone that I mustnt see  
Satan get thee behind me  
  
He promised to wait  
But I wont appear and he may come here  
Satan hes at my gate  
Get thee behind me  
Stay where you are  
Its too late
