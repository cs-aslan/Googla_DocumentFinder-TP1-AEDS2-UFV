VERSE 1  
Ive been the girl with her skirt pulled high  
Been the outcast never running with mascara eyes  
Now I see the world as a candy store  
With a cigarette smile saying things you cant ignore  
Like Mommy I love you  
Daddy I hate you  
Brother I need you  
Lover hey fuck you  
I can see everything here with my third eye  
Like the blue in the sky  
  
CHORUS  
If God is a DJ  
Life is a dance floor  
Love is the rhythm  
You are the music  
If God is a DJ  
Life is a dance floor  
You get what youre given  
Its all how you use it  
  
Verse 2  
Ive been the girl middle finger in the air  
Unaffected by rumors the truth I dont care  
So open your mouth and stick out your tongue  
You might as well let go you cant take back what youve done  
So find a new lifestyle  
A new reason to smile  
Look for Nirvana  
Under the strobe lights  
Sequins and sex dreams  
You whisper to me  
Theres no reason to cry  
  
CHORUS  
If God is a DJ  
Life is a dance floor  
Love is the rhythm  
You are the music  
If God is a DJ  
Life is a dance floor  
You get what youre given  
Its all how you use it  
  
BRIDGE  
You take what you get and you get what you give  
I say dont run from yourself man thats no way to live  
Ive got a record in my bag you should give it a spin  
Lift your hands in the air so that life can begin  
  
If God Is a DJ If God  
If God is a DJ life is a dance floor  
Get your ass on the dance floor  
  
CHORUS 2X  
If God is a DJ  
Life is a dance floor  
Love is the rhythm  
You are the music  
If God is a DJ  
Life is a dance floor  
You get what youre given  
Its all how you use it
