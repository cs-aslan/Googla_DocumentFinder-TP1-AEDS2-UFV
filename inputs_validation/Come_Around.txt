Have you seen the little pieces of the people we have been  
Little pieces blowing gently on the wind  
They have flown down California  
They have landed in LA  
Little pieces slowly settling on the waves  
  
Im one of a million pieces fallen on the ground  
Its one of the reasons when we say goodbye  
Well still come around We will come around  
  
I have waited for tomorrow from December til today  
I have started loving sorrow along the way  
I am calling from some city  
And I wont be there too long  
I could wait and I could waste away  
But what comes back is I hear you say were gone  
  
For all of the times that I go spinning up and down  
When all of the things have died between us  
Well well still come around We will come around  
  
After Ive been missing for a while  
And you hear that summers song  
Havent all the fading lines lingered on  
  
What I know is shes going  
When you know it its alright  
So you put yourself between you and your pride  
If you wait for whats coming  
And you listen to her lies  
Then shell say the things you need to hear  
And the only one wholl disappear is you  
  
And one of the million lies she said  
Is All of the things you love are dead  
But Ive seen what she thinks is love  
And it leaves me laughing so well still come around
