Its been a long long day  
I got some rundown shoes  
Aint got no place to stay  
But any old place will be okay  
Its been a long long day  
I sure been on this road  
Done nearly fourteen years  
Cant say my names well known  
You dont see my face in rolling stone  
But I sure been on this road  
Slow motion  
Half a dollar bill  
Jukebox in the corner  
Shooting to kill  
And its been a  
Its been a long long day  
I sure could use a friend  
Dont know what else to say  
I hate to abuse an old cliche  
But its been a long long day  
Its been a long long day
