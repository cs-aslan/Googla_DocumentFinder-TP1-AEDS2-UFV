Wake up Wont you listen to me  
Wake up Wont you listen to me  
Wont you listen to me  
Wake up Wont you listen to me  
Wake up Wont you listen to me  
Wont you listen to me  
  
Big brothers watching we watch him back  
We see right through his disguise  
He tries to scare us with angry words  
But we all know that theyre lies  
Whole world is waiting  
Just see the fear in their eyes  
  
Whole world is watching observing every move  
Is it beginning or the end  
Just like a chess game but so intense  
That I just dont understand  
Anticipation  
Its much to big to pretend  
  
Chorus  
wake up its 1984  
wake up but weve been here before  
wake up its 1984  
wake up but weve been here before here before  
  
Big brothers screaming but we dont care  
Cause hes got nothing to say  
Think of the future think of the prophecy  
Think of the children of today  
Big brothers marching  
So we all stand in his way  
Open your eyes sisters and brothers  
Neatly disguised so far away  
Open your heart try to remember  
Two worlds apart but so close  
  
wake up its 1984  
But weve been here before  
wake up its 1984  
But weve been here before  
All our lives leading up to this day watching and waiting  
  
Wake up Wake up  
Wake up Wake up  
  
Open your eyes sisters and brothers  
Neatly disguised so far away  
Open your heart try to remember  
Two worlds apart but so close  
  
Chorus  
  
Whole world is watching  
Anticipating  
Big brothers marching  
Is it beginning or the end  
  
Chorus
