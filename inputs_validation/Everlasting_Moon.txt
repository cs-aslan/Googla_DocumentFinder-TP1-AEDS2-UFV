This is a little song called Everlasting Moon about what some people did to
preserve the environment  
  
The sky revealed the rumor  
In a misty gray cocoon  
Some angry babyboomers  
Stole the everlasting moon  
  
They found a new location  
Clear and poison free  
In a distant constellation  
Oh they called it lunacy  
  
Chorus  
Hangin in the sky  
The perfect alibi  
Baby come outside with me  
Theres a moon youve got to see  
Smiling every place  
With his laserpainted face  
Light of love in each moonbeam  
Want you step into my dream  
Everlasting moon everlasting moon everlasting moon  
  
Back when nature ruled the heavens  
Oh gypsies fools and loons  
Were dragged across the ocean  
By that everlasting moon  
  
When it goes from full to crescent  
I move in and out of tune  
Its the envy of the Kremlin  
Its our everlasting moon  
  
Chorus  
  
Shinin in the sky  
The perfect alibi  
Baby come outside with me  
Theres this moon youve got to see  
Smiling every place  
With his laserpainted face  
Light of love in each moonbeam  
Want you step into my dream  
Everlasting moon everlasting moon  
Everlasting moon everlasting moon
