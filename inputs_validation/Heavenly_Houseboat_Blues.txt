Im building a houseboat in heaven  
To sail those deep and holy seas  
Im building a houseboat in heaven  
And its welcome aboard you sweet peace  
  
The bow she is made of solid silver  
And the hall she is made of solid gold  
She aint much long the lines afloating  
But shes yours babe to have and to hold  
  
I rode my old guitar to heaven  
But heaven didnt feel too much like home  
So Im headed out on to them lonesome oceans  
In my rubystudded houseboat to roam
