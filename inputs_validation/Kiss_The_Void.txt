Im losin power and I dont know why  
Not really sure if Ill live or die  
I wanna leave but I cant get away  
Its a strange sensation  
Out of control bein by myself  
I feel this gravitation  
Caught like a magnet and Im bein pulled Into the void  
I wanna get away get away Into the void  
Im bein pulled Im bein pulled down Into the void  
This place is spinnin spinnin around Into the void  
Fell like Im bein pulled into a black hole  
This crazy feelins screwin with my head  
Im overloadin and my gauges are red  
State of confusions got a hold on me  
I feel a hesitation  
Im bein drugged fallen out of the track  
Dont like the situation  
Caught like a magnet and Im bein pulled Into the void  
I wanna get away get away Into the void  
My head is spinnin spinnin around round Into the void  
This force is gettin gettin stronger Into the void  
Fell like Im bein pulled into a black hole Into the void  
Im bein pulled bein pulled down down  
Down down  
I wanna really get away Into the void  
Dont like this feelin Im bein pulled down Into the void  
I wanna get away get away Into the void  
Feel like its spinnin spinnin around Into the void  
Im being pulled bein pulled down down  
Down down Into the void  
Get away get away Into the void  
Fell like Im bein pulled into a black hole Into the void
