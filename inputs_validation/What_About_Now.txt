Shadows fill an empty heart  
As love is fading  
From all the things that we are  
But are not saying  
Can we see beyond the stars  
And make it to the dawn  
  
Change the colors of the sky  
And open up to  
The ways you made me feel alive  
The ways I loved you  
For all the things that never died  
To make it through the night  
Love will find you  
  
What about now  
What about today  
What if youre making me all that I was meant to be  
What if our love never went away  
  
What if its lost behind words we could never find  
Baby before its too late  
What about now  
  
The sun is breaking in your eyes  
To start a new day  
This broken heart can still survive  
With a touch of your grace  
Shadows fade into the light  
I am by your side  
Where love will find you  
  
What about now  
What about today  
What if youre making me all that I was meant to be  
What if our love had never went away  
What if its lost behind words we could never find  
Baby before its too late  
What about now  
  
Now that were here  
Now that weve come this far  
Just hold on  
There is nothing to fear  
For I am right beside you  
For all my life  
I am yours  
  
What about now  
What about today  
What if youre making me all that I was meant to be  
What if our love had never went away  
What if its lost behind words we could never find  
  
What about now  
What about today  
What if youre making me all that I was meant to be  
What if our love had never went away  
What if its lost behind words we could never find  
Baby before its too late  
Baby before its too late  
Baby before its too late  
What about now
