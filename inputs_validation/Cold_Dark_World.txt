I can watch little girl  
From the back of my car  
I see you and show  
At the place that you are  
Groceries spillin up  
Out of your bag  
Thinkin youll end up  
A penniless hag  
  
But I see the girl  
That you are deep inside  
Wont you allow me  
To give you a ride  
I can console you  
And give you kiss  
Show you that you can do  
Better than this  
  
Chorus  
Angel girl  
In a cold dark world  
Im gonna be your man  
Angel girl  
In a cold dark world  
Ill make you understand  
  
I know  
That youre thinkin  
Im trying to score  
But deep in your heart  
You know that Im more  
Than a cat or a scoundrel  
Now that Ive found you  
I dont want to lose you  
How can I prove  
You know that I am sincere  
You dont need to fear  
Im not like the others  
Ill be like a brother  
I will protect you  
Never disrespect you  
But if you love  
Then Ill be here  
To sex you  
  
Chorus  
  
It might take awhile  
To get with the style  
Life at the end  
Of the miracle mile  
But youre gonna love  
The rising above  
All the trash  
That is sweeping  
You under the rug  
  
Im gonna be there
