Leave me out get away  
I gotta go a long way home  
Cant see through the trees  
Leave me out get away  
Better run fast as I can  
From the man the dirty man the old man  
  
In my song run away fly away  
Long way home  
Through the fields the burning fields  
Call my name when you knock on the door  
Go insane  
When you knock on the door in my head  
And its beatin like a drum  
  
Chorus  
Tell me  
Is it more of the same and  
Where can I find it  
Tell me  
Is she fighting for air and  
Where does she come from  
Tell  
  
Leave me out get away  
I gotta go a long way home  
Cant see through the trees  
Leave me out get away  
Better run fast as I can  
From the man the dirty man  
Run away when hes knocking on the door  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Repeat x2  
Whats she runnin from I really dont know  
Keep her runnin its a long way home  
I hear the music the songs we know  
Its out of time and the beats too slow
