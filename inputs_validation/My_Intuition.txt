Ive read your pretty speaches  
And I must admit they touched my heart  
I dont know where you borrow them  
But most of them are works of art  
  
No school boy with his Valentines  
Was ever more sincere  
Ive tried to read between the lines  
To make the meaning clear  
  
But theres a little voice that whispers  
Softly as I fall asleep  
You better look before you leap  
  
My intuition says to me  
Dont ever give your heart away  
And so I simply must obey my intuition  
  
My intuition says to me  
Those pretty words may not be true  
So what am I supposed to do in my position  
  
Id like to trust my heart  
Believe in just my heart  
But it is much too young to know  
  
So though it may be bad advice  
I guess Ill have to string along  
Until you prove my intuition  
Can be wrong  
  
My intuition goes like this  
Im playing poker with a bunch  
And all at once I get a hunch  
Thats intuition  
  
Im playing aces back to back  
And I can see a pair of kings  
But if theres one more of those things  
Whats my position  
  
Well if you get the cards  
Then you should bet the cards  
At least thats what Ive always heard  
  
You have your hunch Ill have mine  
Suppose we both we both just string along  
Until we prove our intuition can be wrong
