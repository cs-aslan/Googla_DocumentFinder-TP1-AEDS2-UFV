Cheated by  
The opposite of love  
Held on high  
From up up up above  
Kept my high  
From the second one  
Kept my eye  
On the first one  
  
Now take these rings  
And stow them safe away  
Ill wear them on  
Another rainy day  
Take these rings  
And stow them safe away  
Ill wear them on  
Another rainy day  
  
Take these rings  
And stow them safe away  
Ill wear them on  
Another rainy day  
Take these rings  
And stow them safe away  
Ill wear them on  
Another rainy day  
  
Well Im  
Takatakatakatakatakin it off  
And shes  
Takatakatakatakatakin it off  
And hes  
Takatakatakatakatakin it off  
And were  
Takatakatakatakatakin it off  
  
Sometimes  
I think that Im bigger  
Than the sound  
I think that Im bigger  
Than the sound  
I think that Im bigger  
Than the sound  
I think that Im bigger  
Than the sound  
  
Shell take on high

Well sometimes  
I think that Im bigger  
Than the sound  
I think that Im bigger  
Than the sound  
I think that Im bigger  
Than the sound  
Well I think that Im bigger  
Than the sound
