I dont care if my ladys gone  
As long as you give me just what I want  
Ive been losin my direction  
Got to find a new connection  
  
You have wasted the love I tasted  
Now Im really gettin hungry more and more  
Been a long time had a bad sign  
Tell me what am I fighting for  
  
Let me know you feel it  
You know I really need it  
Keep on pushin for more  
Lay down stay down  
I got something to find  
Theres one thing I really need  
Im gonna tell you right now  
Lay down stay down  
  
Lookin for trouble I guess thats right  
When I was young I was taught to fight  
Its been long gone since I had known  
Now Im headin for some more  
  
Let me know you feel it  
You know I really need it  
Keep on pushin for more  
Lay down stay down  
I got something to find  
Theres one thing I really need  
Im gonna tell you right now  
Lay down stay down  
  
Let me know you feel it  
You know I really need it  
Keep on pushin for more  
Lay down stay down  
I got something to find  
Theres one thing I really need  
Im gonna tell you right now  
Lay down stay down
