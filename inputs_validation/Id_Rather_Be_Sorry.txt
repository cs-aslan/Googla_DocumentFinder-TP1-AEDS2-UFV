If you hurt me you wont be the first or the last in the lifetime of many
mistakes  
But I wont spend tomorrow regreting the past for the chances that I didnt
take  
Cause Ill never know till its over if Im right or Im wrong loving you  
But Id rather be sorry for something Ive done than for something that I
didnt do  
When you touch me its easy to make me believe tomorrow wont take you away  
But Ill gamble whatever tomorrow might bring for the life that Im living
today  
Cause Ill never know
