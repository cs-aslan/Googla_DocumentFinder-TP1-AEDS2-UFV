Shes got eyes like Zapruder  
And a mouth like heroin  
She wants me to be  
Perfect like Kennedy  
This isnt god this isnt god  
God is just a statistic  
God is just a statistic  
Say  
show me the dead stars  
All of them sing  
This is a riot  
Religious and clean  
  
God is a number you cannot count to  
You are post human and hardwired  
  
Shes pilgrim and pagan  
Softworn and social  
In all of her dreams  
Shes a saint like Jackieo  
  
This isnt god this isnt god  
God is just a statistic  
God is just a statistic  
Say  
Show me the dead stars  
All of them sing  
This is a riot  
Religious and clean  
  
All that glitters is cold all that glitters is cold
