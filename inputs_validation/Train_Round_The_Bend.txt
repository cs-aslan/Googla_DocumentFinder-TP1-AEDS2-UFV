Train round the bend  
Takin me away from my country  
Im sick of the trees  
Take me to the city  
Train comin round the bend  
Oh train comin round the bend  
  
Been in the country  
Oh much too long  
Trying to be a farmer  
But nothing that I planted  
Never seems to grow  
Train comin round the bend  
Train comin round the bend  
  
Hey I am just a city boy  
And really not the country kind  
Oh I need the city streets  
And I need your light  
To see bend comin round the bend  
The train comin round the bend  
  
Alright  
Ooh Ohh  
  
Once  
Shes going twice  
Shes going to the loop  
Up and down  
Shes going twice  
Shes going the train  
Comin round the bend  
You know the train  
Comin round the bend  
  
And Im out of nowhere  
Takin me back where I belong  
Ive been here once  
And I dont take it tonight  
For the train comin round the bend  
The train comin round the bend  
Oh alright
