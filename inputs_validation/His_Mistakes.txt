Do I remind you of the pain  
That he put you through girl  
Is that the reason Im to blame  
Before I do it  
  
Is it because he treated you badly  
I always stand accused  
Protecting yourself from somebody else  
Im not whos hurting you girl  
  
Chorus  
And its killing me girl knowing you compare me to him  
Always guilty before the sin  
I cant win I cant win no  
Ill do anything to prove I love you  
Baby girl but I refuse to  
Pay for something I didnt do  
I love you girl  
But I refuse to stay  
Paying for his mistakes  
  
He left a scar across your heart  
I understand girl  
Dont let his wrongs tear us apart  
Cause girl Im your man  
  
Just because he did  
You swear Im cheating  
You think I just dont care  
Why must I do time  
For another mans crime  
Girl you know that aint fair  
  
Chorus  
  
I know he did you wrong  
But tell me what does that have to do with me  
Trying to show you something real  
Figure out what is going on  
Before you look up and Ill be gone  
  
Ill do anything to prove I love you  
Baby girl but I refuse  
To pay for something I didnt do girl  
I love you and I love you I love you  
  
Ill do anything to prove I love you  
Baby girl but I refuse  
To pay for something I didnt do no  
I love you girl  
But I refuse to stay  
Paying for his mistakes
