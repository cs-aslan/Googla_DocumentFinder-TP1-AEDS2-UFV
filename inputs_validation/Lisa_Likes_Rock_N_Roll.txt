Theres a wangotango  
At the peppermint inn  
Im gonna be there  
Shakin my thing  
Be bop a lula  
Little Peggy Sue  
We both got company  
Dont know what to do  
But thats alright  
Yeah thats OK  
In the middle of the night  
Heres Lisa  
  
Chorus  
Lisa likes rock n roll  
She plays it every day  
Down by the drugstore  
Everybody   
She turnin on the radio  
Shes shootin up the stereo  
Puttin on a video  
Shes sayin lets go lets go  
  
Lisa wont marry me  
She says shes only four  
Her mum dont like me  
She says Im too mature  
Down at the disco  
I go solo  
And the girls dont want to know  
Ive been too slow  
And thats alright  
And thats OK  
In the middle of the night  
Heres Lisa  
  
Chorus  
  
And when you see her  
You wish you could  her  
Aint no one can beat her  
She goes yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah
