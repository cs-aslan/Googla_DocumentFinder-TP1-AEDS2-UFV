Being here together  
Is like dreaming wide awake  
Once youve found perfection  
You know its no mistake  
Too many times  
Ive tried too hard  
To make love become real  
You showed me how  
My life can change  
When love is meant to be  
  
Its undeniable  
Your love is undeniable  
Its undeniable  
True love is undeniable  
Its undeniable  
  
You can change direction  
You can change your mind  
Cold sky and close your eyes  
But the suns still gonna shine  
Cause when the magic comes your way  
And you say it isnt real  
Yeah  
Theres no use to try to lie  
About the way you make me feel  
  
Its undeniable  
Your love is undeniable  
Its undeniable  
True love is undeniable  
Its undeniable  
  
I cant turn it down  
I cant turn it down  
No one else can turn it around  
Its the truest thing Ive ever found  
  
Its undeniable  
Your love is undeniable  
Its undeniable  
True love is undeniable  
Its undeniable
