Spread the word around  
The rat is leaving town  
The message is a song  
The misery is gone  
  
Once I had a dream  
To sing before the queen  
She didnt want to know  
She wouldnt see the show  
  
What a fright  
I couldnt do it right  
Oh what a night  
  
Mystic demons fly  
All about the sk  
With memories of a clown  
The saddest show in town  
  
When I was seventeen  
Me mother said to me  
Be careful what you touch  
You shouldnt take so much  
  
I blew my mind  
She was so kind  
I could have cried  
  
In my mind  
I had to fin  
A kind of new way  
Of being oh so cool  
Like a blue blooded  
Well studded  
English fool  
  
Speak about the past  
Times are changing fast  
Once I was so weak  
I couldnt even speak  
  
Shaking put a curse  
Nothing could be worse  
Walking through the door  
Who could ask for more  
  
Now Im free  
And I can see  
That I am me  
  
Spread the word around  
The rat is leaving town  
The message is a song  
The misery is gone  
  
Shaking out a curse  
Nothing could be worse  
Walking through the door  
Who could ask for more  
  
Now Im free  
And I can see  
That I am me  
  
Please stay away
