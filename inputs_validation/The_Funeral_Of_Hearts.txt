loves the funeral of hearts  
an ode for cruelty  
when angels cry blood  
on flowers of evil in bloom  
  
The funeral of hearts  
And a plea for mercy  
When love is a gun  
Separating me from you  
  
She was the sun  
Shining upon  
The tomb of your hopes and dreams so frail  
He was the moon  
Painting you  
With its glow so vulnerable and pale  
  
Loves the funeral of hearts  
And an ode for cruelty  
When angels cry blood  
On flowers of evil in bloom  
  
The funeral of hearts  
And a plea for mercy  
When love is a gun  
Separating me from you  
  
She was the wind carrying in  
All the troubles and fears youve for years tried to forget  
He was the fire restless and wild  
And you were like a moth to that flame  
  
The heretic seal beyond divine  
A prayer to a god whos deaf and blind  
The last rites for souls on fire  
Three little words and a question why  
  
Loves the funeral of hearts  
And an ode for cruelty  
When angels cry blood  
On flowers of evil in bloom  
  
The funeral of hearts  
And a plea for mercy  
When love is a gun  
Separating me from you
