The first time we met you were a kennel maid  
You gave me a tip I got me forecast paid  
You were holding a greyhound in trap number one  
Your white coat was shining in the afternoon sun  
  
Now were both together  
Were never gonna break apart no no  
Cause were a happy couple you and me  
With a greyhound at either knee  
  
Ill have ten shillings to win on Camera Flash young man

There was nothing in my life bigger than beer  
Ceptin you little darling

Were a happy couple you and me  
With a greyhound at either knee  
  
We go to the dog track on Saturday night  
We put all our money on a dog that we like  
A kiss and a cuddle a hot meat pie  
Two dollar tickets and a starry sky  
  
There was nothing in my life bigger than beer  
There was nothing in my life bigger than beer  
Ceptin you little darling

Were a happy couple you and me  
With a baby on either knee
