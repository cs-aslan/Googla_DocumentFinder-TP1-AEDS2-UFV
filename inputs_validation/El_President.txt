It came from the skies  
It burst throught the gates  
With no mercy or disguise  
With their hearts set out in flames  
I know Ive seen the master plan  
  
Well Im just a man  
Im not giving in  
All the people understand  
For they all fell down and prayed  
I know Ive seen the master plan  
  
Theyve killed the president  
Theyve killed the president  
  
It came from the skies  
In all shades of green  
We can always justify  
We can measure up your dreams  
I know Ive seen the master plan  
  
Theyve killed the president  
Theyve killed the president  
Theyve killed the president  
Theyve killed the president  
Theyve killed the president  
Theyve killed the president  
  
Im just a man
