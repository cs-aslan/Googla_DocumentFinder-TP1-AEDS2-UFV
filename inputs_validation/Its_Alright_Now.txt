People came from miles around  
To pay respects with painted frowns  
Hanging round to see the old man down  
Underneath the ground  
  
Brother Luke he turned away  
And uncle john refused to stay  
Doctor tom said dont cry hell get by  
Hell see another day  
  
Alright its alright  
Im gonna get to see you  
Alright its alright  
Im gonna get to see you  
  
But the old mans not so blind  
Faked the day so he could find  
The only tear to rest upon his hand  
They didnt understand  
  
Alright its alright  
Im gonna get to see you  
Alright its alright  
Im gonna get to see you
