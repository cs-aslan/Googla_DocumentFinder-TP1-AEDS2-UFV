Get ready for the lady  
Shes gonna be a treat  
Simmer slightly til ready  
Make her soft too  
Make her sweet  
  
I kiss the tears off from your chest  
I felt the poison fright thats in your breath  
I knew your precious life and I know your death  
I squeeze the love out of your soul  
All the perfect love thats in your soul  
Youre just another spirit on parole
