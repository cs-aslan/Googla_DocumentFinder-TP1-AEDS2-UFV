CC Waterback one tequila sunrise  
Ones for my aching head the others for my bloodshot eyes  
Last night I let it all hang out I guess thats how my head got sore  
CC Waterback I cant stand the pain no more  
  
Last night we got invited to a party at the Jones place  
For fun and games and booze and things I guess I must drunk a case  
But that lady of mine drank warm red wine til she couldnt even find the door  
She wound up on the Jones bed and I wound up on the floor
