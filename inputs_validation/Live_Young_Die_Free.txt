The distant sound of mercy ringing in my eyes  
Far from the masses fades away  
Closed my eyes and waited for the pain to pass  
Recalled a little story heard today  
  
Yeah Im feeling trapped  
So locked away  
Caught in a downward spiral  
In into the black  
I wont be back  
Yeah Ill be here a while  
  
Dont need to see your face  
Dont need to hear a word you say  
Dont need to know your name  
Or why youre here  
  
Shadows of the past appear in front of me  
Into the masses disappear  
The sound of silence ringing for a greater good  
To this point I cant believe my ears  
  
Yeah coming unwrapped  
Starting to fray  
Walking the final mile  
In into the black  
I wont back  
Choose to be here a while  
  
Then I saw your face  
And I heard the words you said  
Then I recalled your name  
And why Im here  
  
When I look into your eyes an saw how much you cried  
An I had a revelation  
The pain wouldnt pass the scars they would last  
Into Gods creation  
Blessed secrets holding me  
Then we all closed our eyes an laid down and sighed  
  
Live young die free  
  
A distant chime of mercy ringing one last time  
Into the masses turns to clay  
Molded into what is now the greater good  
To close the story yesterday  
  
Dont need to see your face  
Dont need to hear a word you say  
Dont need to know your name  
Or why youre here  
  
Then a child of a liar put his hands into the fire  
Called it discontention  
And a man with the word repeated what he heard  
Led to mass confusion  
Blessed secrets agony  
Then the child closed his eyes and laid down and died  
  
Live young die free
