Tried everything I know  
Held my hand but now Ive got to show  
Trying to understand the things youve learned  
But you dont seem to be concerned at all  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna keep on keepin on  
Aint gonna leave you alone  
Keep on keepin on  
  
Aint gonna leave you alone  
Gonna get you to love me  
Sometimes it seems like theres just no way at all  
You just keep drifting and drifting away  
  
You aint never home when I call you on the telephone  
But Im gonna fool around get you back someday  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont care what everybodys gotta say  
Im gonna love you anyway  
Even if you dont care any longer  
My little bit of love keeps getting stronger  
  
Chorus  
  
Lord Im gonna keep on keepin on  
Gonna make you mine Love me yeah
