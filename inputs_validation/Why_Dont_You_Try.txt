Why dont you try to do without him  
Why dont you try to live alone  
Do you really need his hands for your passion  
Do you really need his heart for your throne  
Do you need his labour for your baby  
Do you need his beast for the bone  
Do you need to hold a leash to be a lady  
I know youre going to make make it on your own  
Why dont your try to forget him  
Just open up your dainty little hand  
You know this life is filled with many sweet companions  
Many satisfying onenight stands  
Do you want to be the ditch around a tower  
Do you want to be the moonlight in his cave  
Do you want to give your blessing to his power  
As he goes whistling past his daddy past his daddys grave  
  
Id like to take you take you to the ceremony  
Well that is if I remember the way  
You see Jack and Jill theyre going to join their misery  
Im afraid its time for everyone to pray  
You can see theyve finally taken cover  
Theyre willing yeah theyre willing to obey  
Their vows are difficult theyre for each other  
So let nobody put a loophole a loophole in their way
