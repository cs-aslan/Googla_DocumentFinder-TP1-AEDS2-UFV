So many voices calling out to me  
To sell me something tell me what I need But they dont know about the
treasure Ive found A gift from heaven I cant live without  
Its a kingdom and its hidden deep inside I will be living for much more
than meets the eye  
CHORUS  
Cause I need the deeper life where the love of God runs far and wide I need
the deeper life I will give him all my heart and mind I wont be swept away
by every changing tide  
I believe in the deeper life  
I got my telephone Got my radio  
I got a lotta places I can go  
But where I want to be is off the deep end My Jesus meets me when I dive
right in  
Dont want to slip slide on the surface of this life My soul will search
untilthis thirst is satisfied  
 CHORUS  
I will be seeking first the kingdom of my God I want everything hes got  
CHORUS
