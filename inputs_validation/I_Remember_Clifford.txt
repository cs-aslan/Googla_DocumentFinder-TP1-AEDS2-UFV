I know hell never be forgotten  
He was a king uncrowned  
I know Ill always remember  
The warmth of his sound  
Linger so long Im sure hes still around  
For those who heard they respect him yet  
So those who hear wont forget  
The sound of each phrase  
Echoes the time uncountable by days  
The things he played are with us now  
And theyll endure should time allow  
Oh yes I remember Clifford  
I seem to always feel him near somehow  
Every day I hear his lovely tone  
In every trumpet sound that has a beauty all its own  
So how can we say someone so real has really gone away  
I hear him now and always will  
Believe me I remember Clifford still
