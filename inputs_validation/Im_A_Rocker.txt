I got a 007 watch and its a one and only  
Its got a ISpy beeper that tells me when youre lonely  
I got a Batmobile so I can reach ya in a fast shake  
When your worlds in crisis of an impendin heartbreak  
  
Now dont you call James Bond or Secret Agent Man  
Cause they cant do it like I can  
Im a rocker baby Im a rocker  every day  
Im a rocker baby Im a rocker  
  
If youre hanging from a cliff or youre tied to the tracks girl  
Columbo split and you cant find Kojak  
True love is broken and your tears are fallin faster  
Youre sufferin from a pain in your heart or some other natural disaster  
  
Now I dont care what kind of shape youre in  
If they put up a roadblock Ill parachute in  
Im a rocker baby Im a rocker  Im in love  
Im a rocker baby Im a rocker  every day  
Im a rocker baby Im a rocker  with you  
  
So you fell for some jerk who was tall dark and handsome  
Then he kidnapped your heart and now hes holdin it for ransom  
Well like a mission impossible Im gonna go and get it back  
You know I woulda taken better care of it baby than that  
  
Sometimes I get so hot girl well I cant talk  
But when Im with you I cool off  and I walk  
Im a rocker baby Im a rocker and I talk  
Im a rocker baby Im a rocker every day  
Im a rocker baby Im a rocker every day
