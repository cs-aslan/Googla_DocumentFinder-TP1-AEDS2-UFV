I could tell that it was over  
When her lips met mine  
There was an emptiness in her voice  
Hesitation when she smiled  
She didnt have to say a word  
It was just so plain to see  
She had found what shed been looking for  
And I knew it wasnt me  
  
I saw goodbye in her eyes  
I dont think I can change it  
Theres no way to disguise  
We will never make it  
  
Sometimes I feel like a clown  
Who cant wash off his makeup  
All she wanted it was gone  
Prince Charming I wasnt  
But I would trade a Babylons  
To be in her arms tomorrow  
But like tide her love has come and gone  
And its time for me to go  
  
I saw goodbye in her eyes  
I dont think I can change it  
Theres no way to disguise  
We will never make it  
Now she sees right through me  
  
Should I hold on to what weve got  
Is it just a waste of time  
One thing that I know for sure  
I saw goodbye in her eyes  
I saw goodbye in her eyes  
  
I know you got somebody new now  
All my candles have burned out  
Hes gonna love the way you shine  
So did I  
So dont smile at me if it aint what you need  
With that goodbye in your eyes  
I know that I cant change it  
Now you see right through me  
Theres no way to disguise  
We will never make it  
  
I saw goodbye in your eyes  
I know that I cant change it  
Now you see right through me goodbye in your eyes  
Should I hold on  
We will never make it  
Now you see right through me goodbye in your eyes  
Should I hold on  
Is it just a waste of time  
One thing that I know for sure  
I saw goodbye in your eyes  
I saw goodbye in your eyes  
I know that its over
