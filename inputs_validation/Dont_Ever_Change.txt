Dont ever change  
Dont ever change from the way that you are now  
If you ever change  
I would be sad cause I wanted you just as you are  
  
Dont you ever change now  
Always be the same now  
No dont ever change from the way that you were  
Last night  
  
Dont ever change  
What can you prove if youre changing your ways to me  
Please dont ever change  
Please dont be blind cause I need you cant you see  
  
Dont you ever change now  
Always be the same now  
No dont ever change from the way that you were  
Last night  
  
Dont ever change  
Dont ever change Id be sad  
And I would cry  
If you leave me  
Dont ever leave me  
  
Dont ever change  
Dont ever change from the way that you are now  
If you ever change  
I would be sad cause I wanted you just as you are  
  
Dont you ever change now  
Always be the same now  
No dont ever change from the way that you were  
Last night  
  
Dont ever change  
Dont ever change
