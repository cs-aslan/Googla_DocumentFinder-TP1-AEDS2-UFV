I hate funerals I love life  
I hate when I see a whole bunch of people just crying in a funeral on some
fake shit  
They aint really love a niggaare while he was there  
See Im a different type of niggaare I wanna be honest with yall  
I need the love now if you all motherfuckers gonna be crying and be playing
thirty minute specials when Im gone an hour special that Im gone  
Fuck that love me while Im here  
Love me while Im here I had to tell a bitch  
  
I want the love  
Cause all I see is haters and this money  
Got these niggers catching verbals and I tell you  
I want the love  
Cause all I know is getting money  
Knocking at the door Im like a wizard bitch I tell you  
I want the love  
  
Im a rich niggaare I dont get mad I just get paid  
I dont catch feeling s I catch flights thats brick paper  
For one rider at bad boy thats one side  
These killers with me dont fuck around they jump fast like all sides  
Im about to keep up on the billy bumping these bottles and willy  
I know they gonna hate when Im high but when its all over they feel me  
If you want your love when Im dead you better off just trying to kill me  
Cause Im gonna ball on you and I aint talking about you I hate all yall
niggers  
Ten birkin from your man hoe I could buy that  
Last week I made a hundred mil you should try that  
Im a real niggaare they all see it cant hide that  
Ill touch down in your city fuck shit up niggaare then fly back  
  
I want the love  
Cause all I see is haters and this money  
Got these niggers catching verbals and I tell you  
I want the love  
Cause all I know is getting money  
Knocking at the door Im like a wizard bitch I tell you  
I want the love  
  
Wanted the money and wanted the love  
Wanted them bitches that wanted the drugs  
That wanted the molly that wanted the weed  
I walk in the building give love in the club  
Love in the streets bitch its meek milly  
Them niggers was haters I love what they was  
Cause all of that hating was my motivation  
Now I got the paper and what whaty what  
It is what it is look at me now  
Living the life in the fucking eo  
Niggers that hate me still come to my shows  
Shorty aint ready to fuck up my wrist give a fuck about gold  
Straight to the money and back to the hood where they taking that money  
We package the good and we ring up the money  
You act like you good better sell you some money hater  
  
I want the love  
Cause all I see is haters and this money  
Got these niggers catching verbals and I tell you  
I want the love  
Cause all I know is getting money  
Knocking at the door Im like a wizard bitch I tell you  
I want the love
