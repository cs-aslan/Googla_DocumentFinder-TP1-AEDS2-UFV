Now Ive got a question baby  
What makes you cry  
Cause I havent seen any water  
In the corners of your eyes  
  
For a day or a week  
Or a month or a year  
Havent seen much of you  
Since you left me my dear  
  
Cant you see that Im hurting  
How Im falling apart  
Dont you care about my drinking  
Or my poor lonely heart  
  
I thought you liked football  
You didnt mind those videos  
And my dog didnt mean  
To ruin your clothes he cant help it  
  
Now you wont take my phone calls  
You sent my letters back  
Youre paying for a lawyer  
To stab me in the back  
  
Then I saw you on the street  
You looked happy thats a fact  
Im impressed  its a hell of an act  
  
Angel  admit it admit it  
Darlin  admit it admit it  
Your love for me didnt die  
Its just sleepin  
  
Now I hope you can hear me  
Wherever you are  
In a cheap hotel room  
Or the back seat of a car  
  
I make up those situations  
I dont know if theyre true  
But Ill tell you for now theyll do  
  
Angel  admit it admit it  
Darlin  admit it admit it  
Your love for me didnt die  
Its just sleepin  
And it wakes every night  
To your weeping  
  
Now Ive got a question baby  
What makes you cry
