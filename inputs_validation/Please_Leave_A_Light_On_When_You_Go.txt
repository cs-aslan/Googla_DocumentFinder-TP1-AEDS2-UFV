How fast can a heart shatter  
Before youre walking on splinters  
Your head aches just to feel what it knows  
Please leave a light on when you go  
  
How can you fix something  
That you cant touch without hurting  
The lesson youve learned is leaving you dumb  
Please leave a light on when its done  
  
Standing high above the flood line  
Watching all your belongings go by  
  
How can you see the ending  
When youre lost at the beginning  
The day hides all that the night left behind  
Please turn a light on when it dies
