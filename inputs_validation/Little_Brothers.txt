Little Brother  
I remember when you first came home  
Then came another little brother of our own  
Even when you break my toys  
You will always be my  
Little brothers  
Cuz youre younger  
Were related and youre boys  
Even when your making too much noise  
You will always be my  
Little brothers  
Cuz youre younger  
Were related and youre boys  
Little brothers  
Little brothers  
Little brothers
