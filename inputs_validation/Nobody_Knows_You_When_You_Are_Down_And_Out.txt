Well once I lived the life of a millionaire spending my money no I didnt
care  
Takin my friend John out for a mighty good time  
Buyin highpriced liquor champagne and wine  
  
Then I began to fall so low didnt have a friend nor no place to go  
If I get my hands on a dollar again  
Im goin to hold on to it until the eagle grins  
  
Soon as I get back up on my feet again everybody wants to be my longlost
friend  
Its might strange without a doubt  
Nobody wants you when youre down and out  
  
Lord soon as I get up on my feet again everybody wants to be my longlost
friend  
Its mighty strange without a doubt  
Nobody wants you when youre down and out  
Thats what I mean when youre down and out
