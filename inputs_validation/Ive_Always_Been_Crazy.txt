Ive always been crazy and the trouble that its put me through  
And busted for things that I did and I didnt do  
I cant say Im proud of all of the things that Ive done  
But I can say Ive never intentionally hurt anyone  
  
Ive always been different with one foot over the line  
Winding up somewhere one step ahead or behind  
It aint been so easy but I guess I shouldnt complain  
Ive always been crazy but its kept me from going insane  
  
Beautiful lady are you sure that you understand  
The chances your taking loving a free living man  
Are you really sure you really want what you see  
Be careful of something thats just what you want it to be  
  
Ive always been crazy but its kept me from going insane  
Nobody knows if its something to bless or to blame  
So far I aint found a rhyme or a reason to change  
Ive always been crazy but its kept me from going insane
