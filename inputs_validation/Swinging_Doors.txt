This ol smoke filled bar is something Im not used to  
But I gave up my home to see you satisfied  
I just called to let you know where Ill be livin  
Its not much but I feel welcome here inside  
Ive got swinging doors a jukebox and a bar stool  
And my new home has a flashing neon sign  
Stop by and see me anytime you want to  
Cause Im always here at home till closin time  
  
Ive got everything I need to drive me crazy  
And Ive got everything it takes to lose my mind  
And in here the atmospheres just right for heartaches  
Thanks to you Im always here till closin time  
And Ive got swinging doors  
Cause Im always here at home till closin time
