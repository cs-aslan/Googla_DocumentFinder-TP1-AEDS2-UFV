So I prayed  
But you werent listening  
Making miracles  
So I begged  
But you were far away  
Saving souls perhaps  
So I screamed  
But she was very small  
And you have worlds to mend  
So she died  
And you were glorious  
But you were somewhere else  
If you are my shepherd  
Then Im lost and no one can find me  
If you are my saviour  
Then Im dead and no one can help me  
If you are my glory  
Then Im sick and no one can cure me  
If you light my darkness  
Then Im blind and no one can see me  
If you are my father  
Then love lies abandoned and bleeding  
If you are my comfort  
Then nightmares are real and deceiving  
If you are my answer  
Then I must have asked the wrong question  
Id spit on your heaven  
If I could find one to believe in
