Pollards mumbling here  
Rings of blue and  
Rings of gold  
So many stories to be told  
It hurts be worse than it hurt you  
You realize now thats not trueoohh  
Amber neon wet concrete  
A wellworn track a smothering heat  
They curious pet in an open cage subjected  
To his masters rage oohh

A portait destroyed by fire  
A portait destroyed by fire
