I told you once and  
I told you twice  
you will fall and  
I will rise  
tell me now whos fooling who  
one of us must surely die  
it isnt me it must be you  
youre my holy sacrifice  
hairtriggertelling you no lies  
hairtriggertime to say goodbye  
you will cry and  
you will pray  
theres no escape  
its judgement day  
deep inside you know too well  
in my hands i hold your fate  
in the end well meet in hell  
youre my holy sacrifice  
hairtriggernow the time has come  
hairtriggernowhere left to run  
hairtrigger
