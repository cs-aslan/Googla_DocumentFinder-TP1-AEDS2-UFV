Lovers make believe in dreams  
Dreamers make believe in makin love to last forever  
Losers cant believe in anything at all  
Heywe never meant to fall so hard  
But dont be sorry  
  
Chorus  
Think of all the love we made us  
Since you used to be afraid of  
Staring at those starry skies above our lives  
And now youre free to  
Be the best that you can be now  
From here to eternity and Ill be here  
Forever in your love  
  
Nothing ever stays the same  
Sometimes lovers even learn to change  
And turn to strangers  
If we never see a single dream come true  
Hey I still believe in you and me and Im not sorry  
  
Chorus  
Think of all the love we made us  
Since you used to be afraid of  
Staring at those starry skies above our lives  
And now youre free to  
Be the best that you can be now  
From here to eternity and Ill be here  
Forever in your love  
  
Be the best that you can be now  
From here to eternity and Ill be here  
Forever in your love
