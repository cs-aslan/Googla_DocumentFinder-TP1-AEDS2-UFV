Were not strong enough  
Were not young enough  
Were not long enough  
Not cold enough  
Emotionally were not even old enough  
  
Late at night were in a videogame dream  
There is no lover in this numbered scene  
We summon every childhood ghost weve seen  
Then suddenly we hear that Mike Post Theme  
  
Chorus  
Everything is alright badoba  
We pray today bababadoba  
Everything is OK badoba  
We play today  
  
Late at night on the underground train  
Through endless suburbs in endless pain  
Then deep in the tunnel under the London rain  
Suddenly we hear Mike Post Again  
  
Chorus  
  
We watch those films  
That make men cry  
Young lovers kiss  
Then fight and die  
We start to yearn we climb the vine  
We have to face the truth sometime  
  
Were not strong enough  
Were not young enough  
Were not long enough  
Not cold enough  
Emotionally were not even old enough  
  
Well late at night we found our racing team  
Were faced with women and reality games  
We feel alive  
We feel new and blind  
Were hearing Mike Post in the air this time  
  
Chorus  
  
We watch those films  
That make men cry  
Young lovers kiss  
Then fight and die  
We start to yearn we climb the vine  
We have to face the truth sometime
