Like a Saturday night Ill be gone  
Like a Saturday night Ill be gone  
Before you knew that I was there  
  
So you wrote it down  
Im supposed to care  
Even though its never there  
Sorry if Im not prepared  
Is it hard to see the things you substitute  
For me and all my thoughts of you  
Its eating me alive to leave you  
  
Maybe its childish and maybe its wrong  
But so is your blank stare in lieu of this song  
Maybe its childish and maybe its wrong  
  
Dont want to be dont want to be wrong  
Youre leaving me youre leaving me in lieu of this song  
Dont want to be dont want to be wrong  
Youre leaving me youre leaving me in lieu of this lieu of this song  
  
Im breathing in your skin tonight  
Quiet is my loudest cry  
Wouldnt want to wake the eyes that make me melt inside  
And if its healthier to leave you be  
May a sickness come and set me free  
Kill me while I still believe that you were meant for me  
  
Im finding my own words my own little stage  
My own epic drama my own scripted page  
Ill send you the rough draft Ill seal it with tears  
Maybe youll read it and Ill reappear  
From the start it was shaky and the characters rash  
A nice setting for heartache where emotions come last  
All I have deep inside to overcome this desire  
Are friendly intentions and fairweather smiles  
  
And I dont want to be dont want to be wrong  
Youre leaving me youre leaving me in lieu of this song  
Dont want to be dont want to be wrong  
Youre leaving me youre leaving me in lieu of this in lieu of this song  
  
Like Saturday night Ill be gone  
Like Saturday night Ill be gone  
Like Saturday night Ill be gone  
Like Saturday night Ill be gone before you knew that I was there
