Be it your guide is so much to love  
And you can hide your love its true  
Its the freedom game  
You can see it every day  
Cause your freedom aint free  
  
Come on down I know how  
Im gonna make you so feared  
Dont you know it aint no thing before  
So dont take more than you need  
Its somethin that Ill do later  
Now its over  
Its not my fault  
  
Under my voodoo  
Its under my voodoo  
  
Pray that I leave you high and dry  
Pray you can make me cry  
If your faded put it in my prayers  
I damn my feeling I roll on  
I tell you the truth  
It aint no thing  
If you want to get real dry one thing though  
Gonna kill for it more more its not my fault its got me  
And Im gone gone gone gone gone gone  
  
Under my voodoo  
Under my voodoo  
Its under my voodoo  
  
Lord hey voodoo  
Lord hey voodoo  
Lord hey voodoo  
What cho want to want to want to do
