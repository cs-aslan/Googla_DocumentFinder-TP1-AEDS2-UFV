Cant understand  
Why this whole world  
Is pulling me down to the ground  
I walked two steps  
They called me bad feet  
Oh when will this world ever let me be  
Cant understand  
Why this whole world  
Is taking so long  
Its making me strong  
Somebody said  
Well just turn your cheek  
What youve got to know  
That its making me weak  
Cant understand  
Why this whole world  
Is pulling me down to the ground  
Unchain my head  
Please unchain my feet  
And please let me walk  
With these steady feet  
With these steady feet  
With these steady feet  
Oh please let me walk  
And let me be free  
Oh yeah
