When I was a child and I lived in the city  
I dreamed of Alaska so far away  
And I dreamed I was flying over mountains and glaciers  
Somehow I knew that Id live there one day  
  
Well it took me some growin and a fair bit of schoolin  
And a little bit of trouble to get on the move  
And I felt like a loser but I turned out the winner  
When I came to Alaska the land that I love  
  
Heres to Alaska heres to the people  
Heres to the wild and heres to the free  
Heres to my life in a chosen country  
Heres to Alaska and me  
  
I was born in a cabin on little Mulchatna  
Raised in hard times but I had a good life  
From the first time I flew with my father a singin  
I knew that Id wind up a bush pilots wife  
  
We sleep near the sound of a slow running river  
And wake up most mornings to a drizzling rain  
And we live every day like the first or the last one  
With nothing to lose and heaven to gain  
  
Heres to Alaska heres to the people  
Heres to the wild and heres to the free  
Heres to my life in a chosen country  
Heres to Alaska and me  
  
Oh for a fire on a cold winters night  
Once more to gaze at the great northern lights  
For all of the beauty my children will see  
Heres to Alaska and me  
  
Heres to Alaska heres to the people  
Heres to the wild and heres to the free  
Heres to my life in a chosen country  
Heres to Alaska and me  
Oh heres to Alaska and me
