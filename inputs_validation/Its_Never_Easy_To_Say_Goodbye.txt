Jimmy climbs on board of that old yellow bus  
It sure looks big in his little eyes  
His mama waves  
As the tears kick up the dust  
Its never easy to say goodbye  
  
Julie Ray in her pearl white wedding gown  
Has found her wings and its time to fly  
Its all her dad can do to keep from breakin down  
Its never easy to say goodbye  
  
It aint easy  
To ever say goodbye  
It aint easy  
Lettin go of the ones you love  
But believe me  
Well meet again by and by  
If not here  
Somewhere up above  
  
Ive had friends  
That I lost along the way  
Theyve been called on down the line  
Though their time was short  
I still think about em everyday  
It aint easy to say goodbye  
  
It aint easy  
To ever say goodbye  
It aint easy  
Lettin go of the ones you love  
But believe me  
Well meet again by and by  
If not here  
Somewhere up above  
  
The time has come  
To go our separate ways  
And its alright if you wanna cry  
Though I know well meet again someday  
Its never easy to say goodbye  
  
It aint easy  
To ever say goodbye  
It aint easy  
Lettin go of the ones you love  
But believe me  
Well meet again by and by  
If not here  
Somewhere up above  
  
If not here  
Somewhere up above
