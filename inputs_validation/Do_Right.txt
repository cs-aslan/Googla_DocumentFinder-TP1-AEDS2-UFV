Do right  
Do right  
  
Everytime I say  
Come closer my dear  
I need you to be by my side  
And every night I feel  
Youre driftin away  
Is there something youre trying to hide  
  
I can tell what it means  
That look in your eyes  
Cause Ive seen it before  
And it holds no surprise  
  
Do me right  
Youve been holding me tight  
But your minds on the new girl in town  
  
Now you know that youre lying  
And theres no use denying  
Cause this is the time baby  
  
Do right  
Baby do right by me  
Just want you to  
Do right  
Baby do right by me  
  
Bop ba dop bop ba dop bop ba dop Hey  
Bop ba dop bop ba dop bop ba dop  
  
All that I need from you  
Is that comes straight from the heart  
You have to be cruel to be kind  
And if I should lose you now  
I may hurt for a while  
But Ill leave all the sadness behind  
  
Lifes not always the way that I want it to be  
But given the choice I would rather be free  
  
Do me right  
Youve been holding me tight  
But your minds on the new girl in town  
  
Now you know that youre lying  
So theres no use denying  
This is the time baby  
  
Do right  
Baby do right by me  
Just want you to  
Do right  
Baby do right by me  
  
Bop ba dop bop ba dop bop ba dop Hey  
Bop ba dop bop ba dop bop ba dop  
  
Do right  
Baby do right by me  
Just want you to  
Do right  
Baby do right by me  
  
Do right  
Baby do right by me  
Just want you to  
Do right  
Baby do right by me
