Every time that someone walks in  
She turns around to see if its him  
She checks her watch by the clock  
I cant count the times hes stood her up  
And ones too much  
  
Chorus  
How could anybody break a heart like hers  
I cant stand to watch her hurt  
I would gladly take his place  
If shed just love me that way  
He must not know what its worth  
I dont understand how anyone  
Could break a heart like hers  
  
She keeps saying hell change someday  
He wasnt always this way  
She things he hung the moon and stars  
But all hes done is string her along like this  
It dont make sense  
  
Chorus  
  
How could anybody break  
A heart like hers
