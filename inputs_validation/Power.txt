Power  
  
My hands are clean  
My heart is so pure  
The world is sick  
I am the cure  
I dont want no money gold or gifts  
Give me your minds and souls to lift  
Put you faith and trust in me  
Ill move your mountains  
Part your sea  
All you poor all you needy  
All youre doin is givin to the greedy  
All you poor all you needy  
All youre doin is givin to the greedy  
Get off your knees believe in me  
Ill set you free  
  
All I needs a little more power  
Power power power power power  
Power power power power  
  
I have for you a master plan  
To lead you to the Promised Land  
I give you peace I give you pride  
I save you from mass suicide  
Im your hope your one salvation  
Im your one man United Nation  
All you poor all you needy  
All youre doin is givin to the greedy  
All you poor all you needy  
All youre doin is givin to the greedy  
Tell me your sins Ill be your friend  
I wont do you in  
  
All I needs a little more power  
Power power power power power  
Power power power power  
  
Ill make you all the master race  
Just put me in my godly place  
Well march the world down in defeat  
Take the fields of oil and the lands of wheat  
Power I need it more I got to have it  
One thing I must make perfectly clear  
Nuclear weapons all men fear  
Their hands sweat their fingers itch  
Im the only one you can trust with the switch  
Give it to me more power  
  
More give it to me  
More give it to me
