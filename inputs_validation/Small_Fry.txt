Small fry struttin by the pool room  
Small fry should be in the school room  
My my put down that cigarette  
You aint grown up high and mighty yet  
Samll fry dancin for a penny  
Small fry countin up how many  
My my just jlisten here to me  
You aint the biggest catfish in the sea  
You practice peckin all day long to eome old radio song  
Oh yes oh yes oh yes  
You better listen to your maw pay  
and someday practice the law  
and then youll be a real success  
Ys small fry you kissed the neighbors daughter  
Small fry should stay in shallow water  
Seems I should take you cross my knee  
You aint the biggest catfish in the sea  
Youve got your feet all soakin wet  
Youll be the death of me yet  
Oh me oh my small fry
