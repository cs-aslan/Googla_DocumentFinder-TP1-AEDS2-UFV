Poor little lamb now his fleece is all cold  
Wakes up in the morning alone  
Poor little lamb knows whats coming  
Life is an empty cup  
  
Poor little lamb watch your shoulder  
Coyotes waiting out there  
Nobody will get any older  
If we dont find a way out of here  
  
So lets go on a bummer this summer  
Where we wont have to be afraid  
The world will be on a hummer boys  
And well laugh and well drink lemonade
