Ill Walk with God from this day on  
His helping hand Ill lean upon  
This is my prayer my humble plea  
May the Lord be ever with me  
  
There is no death tho eyes grow dim  
There is no fear when Im near to Him  
Ill lean on Him forever  
And Hell forsake me never  
  
He will not fail me  
As long as my faith is strong  
Whatever road I may walk along  
  
Ill Walk with God Ill take His hand  
Ill talk with God Hell understand  
Ill pray to Him each day to Him  
And Hell hear the words that I say  
  
His hand will guide my throne and rod  
And Ill never walk alone  
While I walk with God
