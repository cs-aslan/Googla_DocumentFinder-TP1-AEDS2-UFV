The bells are ringing for me and my gal  
Oh the birds are singing for me and my gal  
Well everybodys been knowin to a wedding theyre goin  
And for weeks theyve been sewing every Susie and Sal  
  
Theyre congregatin for me and my gal  
While the parsons waitin for me and my gal  
And sometimes Im gonna build a little home for two  
Three or four or more in love land for me and my gal  
  
And sometimes Im gonna build a little home for two  
Three or four or more in love land for me and my gal
