An extra ordinary guy  
  
Can never have an ordinary day  
  
He might live the long goodbye  
  
But that is not for me to say  
  
I dig his friends I dig his shoes  
  
He is just a child with nothing to lose  
  
In their minds their minds  
  
But Ill have my way  
  
In my own time  
  
Ill have my say  
  
My star will shine  
  
cause you see me I got my Magic Pie  
  
Think of me yeah that was me I was that passer by  
  
Ive been and now Ive gone  
  
There are but a thousand days preparing for a thousand years  
  
Many minds to educate the people who have disappeared  
  
Dyou dig my friends Dyou dig my shoes  
  
I am like a child with nothing to lose  
  
My mind
