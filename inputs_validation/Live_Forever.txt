You painted me a picture of tomorrow  
A place where you and I walked hand in hand  
A world without despair and without shadows  
But things just didnt turn out how wed planned  
Now youre gone  
  
Chorus  
And I believe that there is somewhere  
Where the angels fill the sky  
And I believe well live forever  
You and I you and I  
Will never die  
  
I wonder if you knew that you were leaving  
I thought that I saw something in your eyes  
You painted me a picture of believing  
Ill see you there on the other side  
And Ill be there
