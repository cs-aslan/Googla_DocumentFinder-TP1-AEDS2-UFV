Lately boy your head aint right  
And nothing seems to thrill you  
Word on the streets is  
No sex no more cause itll kill you  
  
You touch she bites  
You push she shoves  
Then she yells in your ear  
No glove no love  
Oh it ruined the mood  
But you know shes right  
When the biggest talks and the littlest walks  
You better learn how to walk the walk  
  
Chorus  
As far as I can see  
Its really no big mystery  
Its the same old story  
No ring no gets  
It aint the boat you float  
Its the motion in the ocean and I quote  
Before you start pumping that feul without your jets  
No ring no gets  
  
This feeling coming over you  
Its a variable strength of emotion  
You keep thinking your smooth  
Start making your move  
But your lady starts causin commotion  
  
You want to round the bases  
She knows thats for sure  
But Miss Palm and her five sisters  
Dont cut it no more  
You know tonight youd like to buy her a kite  
But the wind aint blowing you got that right  
  
Chorus  
  
Woman hold the lock  
A mans known that for years  
Youre going up inside to persuade that key  
Could bring a man to tears  
  
Your gun is loaded  
You got her right in sight  
About to pull your trigger  
When the girl pulls out the lights  
  
But keep your cool dont make a scene  
Cause her   
  
  
Chorus x2  
  
But you wont find repeat  
Spoken Shut Up
