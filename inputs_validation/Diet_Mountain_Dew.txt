Youre no good for me  
Baby youre no good for me  
Youre no good for me  
But baby I want you I want you  
  
Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City  
Never was there ever a girl so pretty  
Do you think well be in love forever  
Do you think well be in love  
  
Baby put on heart shaped sunglasses  
Cause we gonna take a ride  
Im not gonna listen to what the past says  
Ive been waiting up all night  
  
Take another drag turn me to ashes  
Ready for another lie  
Says hes gonna teach me just what fast is  
Say its gonna be all right  
  
Hit me my darling tonight  
I dont know why but I like it  
Gotta get back to the wire  
Give it up give it up live it up live it up

Can we get it downlow down and gritty  
Do you think well be in love forever

Lets take Jesus off the dashboard  
Got enough on his mind  
We both know just what were here for  
Saved too many times  
  
Maybe I like this rollercoaster  
Maybe it keeps me high  
Maybe this weed it brings me closer  
I could sparkle up your eye  
  
Hit me and tell me youre mine  
I dont know why but I like it  
Scary my god youre divine  
Gimme them gimme them dope and diamonds
