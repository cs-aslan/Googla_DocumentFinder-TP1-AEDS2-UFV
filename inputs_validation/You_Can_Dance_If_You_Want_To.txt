Ah we can dance if we want to we can leave your friends behind  
Cause your friends dont dance and if they dont dance  
Well theyre are no friends of mine  
I say we can go where we want to A place where they will never find  
And we can act like we come from out of this world  
Leave the real one far behind  
And we can dance

Leave the real one far behind
