Valentinos got a bookie shop and what he takes  
He gives for what hes got  
And what hes got he says he has not  
Stole from anyone  
  
Its not that he dont tell the truth  
Or even that he misspent his youth  
Its just he holds the proof  
But you know somethings wrong  
  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
  
Valentinos in a cold sweat but he lost all his money on that last bet  
Against all the odds he smokes another cigarette  
Says it helps him to forget  
Hes a nervous wreck  
  
Its not that he misses much  
Or even that he lost his lucky touch  
Its just he gambles so much  
And you know that its wrong  
  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting just to catch your eye  
Waiting for an alibi  
  
Waiting for an alibi  
Try to say I told you I told you  
  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting just to get you  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
Just to say I told you  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
  
Oh my my my my my my my my my my my
