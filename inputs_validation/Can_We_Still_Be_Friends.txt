We cant play this game anymore  
But can we still be friends  
Things just cant go on like before  
But can we still be friends  
  
We had something to learn  
Now its time for the wheel to turn  
Grains of sand one by one  
Before you know it its all gone  
  
Lets admit we made a mistake  
But can we still be friends  
Heartbreaks never easy to take  
But can we still be friends  
Its a strange sad affair  
Sometimes seems like we just dont care  
Dont waste time feeling hurt  
Weve been through hell together  
  
Where do we go from here  
We cant play this game anymore  
But can we still be friends  
Things just cant go on like before  
But can we still be friends  
  
We awoke from our dream  
Things are not what they always seem  
Memories linger on  
Its like a sweet sad old song  
  
Where do we go from here  
Where do we go from here  
  
I cant play this game anymore  
Can we still be friends  
Things just cant go on like before  
I just want to be friends  
I just want to be want to be want to be  
And now I just want to be friends  
We had something to learn something to learn  
Now can we still be friends  
Lets admit our mistakes
