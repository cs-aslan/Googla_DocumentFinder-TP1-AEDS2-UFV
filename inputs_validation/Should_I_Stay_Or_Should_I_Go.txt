Darling you gotta let me know  
Should I stay or should I go  
If you say that you are mine  
Ill be there till the end of time  
So you gotta let me know  
Should I stay or should I go  
  
Its always tease tease tease  
Youre happy when Im on my knees  
One day is fine and the next is black  
So if you want me off your back  
Well come on and let me know  
Should I stay or should I go  
  
Chorus  
Should I stay or should I go now  
Should I stay or should I go now  
If I go there will be trouble  
And if I stay it will be double  
So come on and let me know  
  
This indecisions bugging me  
Esta indecision me molesta  
If you dont want me set me free  
Si no quieres librame  
Exactly who Im supposed to be  
Digame que tengo ser  
Dont you know which clothes even fits me  
Sabes que ropa me queda  
Come on and let me know  
Me tienes que decir  
Should I cool it or should I blow  
Me debo ir o quedarme  
  
Chorus Repeat
