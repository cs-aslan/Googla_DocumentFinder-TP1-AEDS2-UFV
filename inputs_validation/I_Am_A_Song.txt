I AM A SONG  
  
Im a song and Ive waited so long  
For someone to come and sing me  
I got a rhyme that Ive had for some time  
Nobody wants to sing me  
  
Let me show the world that Im not through  
Let me touch your heart the way I used to do  
  
Sing me sing me now I got a song to be sung  
Sing me sing me roll me around on your tongue  
  
I got sunshine I got a message to shout  
Sing me sing me wont someone please let me out  
  
Could I make you smile if I came back in style  
Tell me would you want to sing me  
Dont say Im gone never more to live on  
Somebodys got to sing me  
  
Let me fill  the air with my old song  
If I let you down tell me where did I go wrong  
  
Sing me sing me I got a song to be sung yes I do  
Sing me sing me roll me around on your tongue  
  
I got sunshine I got a message to shout  
Sing me sing me wont someone please let me out  
  
I got music I will share  
I got music now somebody cares cares
