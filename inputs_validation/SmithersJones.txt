Here we go again its Monday at last  
Hes heading for the Waterloo line  
To catch the 8 am fast its usually dead on time  
Hope it isnt late got to be there by nine  
Pin stripe suit clean shirt and tie  
Stops off at the corner shop to buy The Times  
Good Morning SmithersJones  
Hows the wife and home  
Did you get the car youve been looking for  
  
Let me get inside you let me take control of you  
We could have some good times  
All this worry will get you down  
Ill give you a new meaning to life  I dont think so  
  
Sitting on the train youre nearly there  
Youre part of the production line  
Youre the same as him youre like tinsardines  
Get out of the pack before they peel you back  
  
Arrive at the office spot on time  
The clock on the wall hasnt yet struck nine  
Good Morning Smithers Jones  
The boss wants to see you alone  
I hope its the promotion youve been looking for  
  
Come in Smithers old boy  
Take a seat take the weight off your feet  
Ive some news to tell you  
Theres no longer a position for you   
Sorry Smithers Jones  
  
Put on the kettle and make some tea  
Its all a part of feeling groovie  
Put on your slippers turn on the TV  
Its all a part of feeling groovie  
Its time to relax now youve worked your arse off  
But the only one smilin is the sun tanned boss  
Work and work and work and work till you die  
Theres plenty more fish in the sea to fry
