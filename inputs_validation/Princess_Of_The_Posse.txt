Basslines affect me when my rhymes direct me  
Forgive the crowds O Lord they know not why they sweat me  
Bitings against the law in the place that I live  
So I lock up the door with the keys to my crib  
The call me the high priestess of this hasta  
Although Im not a dread and not a rasta  
Theres never been a word I cant master  
Ive always been a piddly pastor  
I reign the lesson of today  
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say  
Because the Ruler Lord Ramsey is on my side  
And Im the princess of the posse so yo take it light  
The Princess of the Posse me say she a cool one  
She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun  
The Princess of the Posse me say she a cool girl  
She rhyme Brooklyn the Bronx USA the world  
You try to dissect my rhymes to see if theres a pattern  
I bounced it all around you like the rings around Saturn  
Let me know now if youd like to protest  
And proceeding a greeting or would you rather progress  
Onto a higher plateau to the peak and Im taking it slow  
Enough for you to see the knowledge and to know  
Im the QyouEEN LATIFAH  
Queen of the RE Posse the GLA which is  
Get Live Alright you standing there chewing on your fingernails  
Nervous watching me doing the live thing  
Singing like a bird sing ringing like the phone ring  
Im the Queen and youre the underling  
Im never following I follow none  
The princess of the posse is a cool one  
The Princess of the Posse me say she a cool one  
She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun  
The Princess of the Posse me say she a cool girl  
She rhyme Brooklyn the Bronx USA the world  
Im the queen of the clan with a mic in my hand  
I step over suckers to position myself to rule this land  
Its a concoction for my ability  
To show the skeezers the meaning of humility  
Cause they dont know Im the one to fly one or two  
Im snatching hearts cause Im Latifah and I want to  
I find it necessary to tell you to get off my tip  
Im kicking gold so grab a hold and get a good grip  
Stop the lying the trying  
The time buying youve been denying  
Youre dependent on me the princess of the posse  
I got the cards so Im dealing a death blow  
Youre taking no crowns put that on cease  
My DJs name is Mark the 45 King to the posse  
Peace got to let you know where I come from  
The princess of the posse is a cool one  
The Princess of the Posse me say she a cool one  
She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun  
The Princess of the Posse me say she a cool girl  
She rhyme Brooklyn the Bronx USA the world  
Now take run the family  
Me say me have to do it for the RE posse  
You try to be down you cant take the crown  
Maybe from someone else but not me Repeat 2x
