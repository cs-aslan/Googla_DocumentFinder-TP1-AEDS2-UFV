You cant buy it at a store  
Try it on for size  
Then bring it back if it dont feel right  
No love love aint like that  
  
You cant trade it in  
Like an automobile  
Thats got too many miles an rust on its wheels  
No love love aint like that  
  
Love aint that easy to define  
You cant build it by design  
It takes its own sweet time  
  
It dont fall from the sky  
Like a tiny drop of rain  
That hits you right between the eyes one day  
No love love aint like that  
  
You cant put your money down  
An just roll the dice  
Think youre gonna win it all some night  
No love love aint like that  
  
Love aint that easy to define  
You cant build it by design  
It takes its own sweet time  
  
You cant buy it at a store  
Try it on for size  
Then bring it back if it dont feel right  
No love love aint like that
