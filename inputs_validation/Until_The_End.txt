Youve got a famous last name  
But youre not to blame  
Baby I see you for who you are  
  
A onetime apple queen  
And a onetime tramp  
And an oldtime movie star  
  
Youre a shell picker  
Of the pickiest kind  
But you always find the ones to keep  
  
And in or out of bed  
You keep youre head wide open  
Cause ya dont only dream when youre asleep  
  
Like a child you remember  
But I forget all my dreams  
  
I used to think  
That someday Id relax a little  
And be more like you  
  
Then I realized  
How silly that thought was  
Needed to stand in my own shoes  
  
And from over here  
I can see you cry  
Dont even try to pretend  
  
Cause hes hurt you  
So many times  
Baby dont go back again  
  
Like a child you forget  
But I remember everything and every sting  
  
And through all the games  
Well both stay the same  
As weve always been  
Through the fat and thin  
Until the end  
Until the end
