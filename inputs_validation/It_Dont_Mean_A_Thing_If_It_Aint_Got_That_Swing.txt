What good is melody what good is music  
If it aint possessin something sweet  
Nah it aint the melody and it aint the music  
Theres something else that makes this tune complete  
  
Yes it dont mean a thing if it aint got that swing  
Well it dont mean a thing all you got to do is sing  
It makes no difference if its sweet or hot  
Just give that rhythm everything you got  
  
Yes it dont mean a thing if it aint got that swing  
It dont mean a thing dont mean a thing if it aint got that swing  
I said it dont mean a thing if it aint got that swing  
Nah it makes no difference if its sweet or hot  
Just give that rhythm everything you got  
Dont mean a thing boy if it aint that a swing
