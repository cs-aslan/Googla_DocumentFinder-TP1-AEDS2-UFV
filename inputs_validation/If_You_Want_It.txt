Dont you let it all pass you by  
Looking through lifes window pane  
Dont you sit around wasting time  
That would be a crying shame  
Theres a power thats deep inside  
And it burns just like a flame  
Just believe and you will see that God  
Will shower you like pouring rain  
If you want it  
You can change your world today  
If you want it  
Just break free and walk away  
Theres a reason  
For you to explore  
Why youre here  
What do you say  
And the beauty is that youre the one  
Who controls just how you play  
Theres a choice that you need to make  
One is ore and one is clay  
So drop your chains and take up your cross  
And let Jesus make your way  
If you want it  
You can change  
Your world today  
If you want it  
Just break free and walk away  
If you want it  
You can change your evil ways  
If you want it  
Just break free and walk away  
  
If you want it  
You can change your world today  
If you want it  
Just break free and walk away  
If you want it  
You can change your evil ways  
If you want it  
  
Just break free  
And walk away
