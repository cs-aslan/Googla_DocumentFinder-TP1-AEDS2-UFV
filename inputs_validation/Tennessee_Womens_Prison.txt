Mama said that thirteen was too young to think my lips  
And too young to run with me and twice my years  
But when youre young and yearn to be a woman what does your mother know  
I couldnt understand her hangups and her fears  
A year went by and I got tired of mamas foolish advice  
At fourteen I was sure I knew it all  
It wasnt like it was at home out on the streets so long  
Me I lived outside the law  
Now Im livin in the cold grey world hear me cryin in the night  
Missin even mom and dad and a man to hold me tight  
I shouldve listened to my mama and seen the visdom in her eyes  
And the Tennessee womens prison wouldnt be my mama tonight  
If I ever get out of this nasty cell Ill never be back again  
Cause mama has sure got smarter every day since Ive been in  
I gonna follow the straight and narrow if I can just get my parole  
And the Tennessee womens prison wont own my soul  
Cause Im livin in the cold grey world  
And this Tennessee womens prison wouldnt be my mama tonight
