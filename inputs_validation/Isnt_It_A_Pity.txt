Isnt it a pity  
You dont know what Im talking about yet  
But Im gonna tell you soon  
Its a pity  
Isnt it a pity  
Isnt it a shame  
Yes how we break each others hearts  
And cause each other pain  
How we take each others love  
Without thinking anymore  
Forgetting to give back forgetting to remember  
Just forgetting a note of thank you  
Isnt it a pity  
Some things take so long  
But how do I explain  
Why not too many people can see that we are all just the same  
Were all guilty  
Because all the tears  
Our eyes just cant hope to see  
But I dont think its applicable to me  
The beauty that surrounds them  
Child isnt it a pity  
How we take each others love  
The most precious thing without thinking anymore  
Forgetting to give back forgetting to keep open the door  
But I understand some things take so long  
But how do I explain  
Why not too many people can see were just the same  
And because of all their tears  
Their eyes cant hope to see  
The beauty that surrounds them  
God isnt it a pity  
The beauty that surrounds them  
Its a pity  
The beauty that surrounds them  
Its a pity  
The beauty that surrounds us  
And we dont see it  
We think things are just the same  
Weve been programmed that way  
Isnt it a pity  
If you want to feel sorry  
Isnt it a pity isnt it a pity  
The beauty sets the beauty that surrounds us  
Because of all our tears  
Our eyes cant hope to see  
Maybe one day at least Ill see me  
And just concentrate on givin givin givin givin  
And till that day mankind dont stand a chance  
Dont know nothin about romance everything is plastic  
Isnt it a pity  
My God
