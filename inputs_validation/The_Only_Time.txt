Im drunk  
And right now Im so in love with you  
And I dont want to think too much about what we should or shouldnt do  
Lay my hands on Heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars  
While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car  
  
Chorus  
Nothing quite like the feel of something new  
Maybe Im all messed up  
Maybe Im all messed up  
Maybe Im all messed up in you  
Maybe Im all messed up  
Maybe Im all messed up  
Maybe Im all messed up  
Maybe Im all messed up in you  
Maybe Im all messed up  
This is the only time I really feel alive  
This is the only time I really feel alive  
I swear  
  
I just found everything I need  
The sweat in your eyes the blood in your veins are listening to me  
Well I want to wrap it up and swim in it until I drown  
My moral standing is lying down  
  
Chorus
