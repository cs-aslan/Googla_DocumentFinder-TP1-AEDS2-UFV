We had a special way of talkin  
Oh a language all our own  
We always knew the latest dances  
But we liked oldfashioned love  
Now something seems the matter  
  
You dont want to play by the rules  
you dont want to play by the rules  
I dont want to love here anymore  
I dont want to love here anymore  
You dont want to play by the rules  
you dont want to play by the rules  
  
I dont have a lot of patience  
When someones lit my fuse  
So dont you try to reason  
Me I dont want no excuse no  
  
You dont want to play by the rules  
you dont want to play by the rules  
I dont want to love here anymore  
I dont want to love here anymore  
You dont want to play by the rules  
you dont want to play by the rules  
  
You you  
Dont dont  
Play play  
By the rules  
I I  
Wont dont  
Love here anymore  
  
You dont want to play by the rules  
you dont want to play by the rules  
cause I dont want to love here anymore  
I dont want to love here anymore
