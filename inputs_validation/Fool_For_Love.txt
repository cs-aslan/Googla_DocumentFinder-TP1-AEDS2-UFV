duet with Johnny Hallydayenglish version  
  
Johnnys part  
Im coming out with my hands up  
Put down your guns and Ill Confess  
I loved her more than life itself  
My angel in a pale blue dress  
But if you want to shoot then shoot  
Id welcome an eternal sleep  
No man has ever felt a love  
So deep  
  
Michaels part  
I took her life her tender life  
I couldnt bear to think that she  
Could laugh and love and give herself  
To any other man than me  
So if my world would end tonight  
I will not cry I do not care  
Ill meet her in another life  
Somewhere  
  
Chorus  
Johnny and Michael  
I was a fool a fool for love  
A fool who believed that she came from above  
Ill stay a fool until I die  
She was my world my breath my sky  
Im just a fool who lost all control  
Along with my soul  
In time the fool becomes a clown  
And you all laugh as I fall down  
  
Michaels part  
Ill never be at peace again  
Ill never feel her warm caress  
Ill leave each day just thinking of  
My angel in a pale blue dress  
  
Johnnys part  
And when her bodys in the ground  
Make sure you save a space for me  
For thats the only place I long to be  
  
Chorus
