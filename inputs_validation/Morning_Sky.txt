You and I were lovers all along  
We had a good thing going strong  
And never doubted  
Lately I feel changes comin on  
I know that I will soon be gone  
And you dont even want  
To talk about it  
  
Oh and it makes me stop and  
Wonder why  
People give their hearts and turn  
around and say goodbye  
If theres something on your mind  
You better say it while theres time  
Cause Im leavin when I see that  
Morning sky  
  
Oh how did we ever come to this  
Theres nothing for me in your kisses anymore  
Late nights in the kitchen  
Im pretending I still care  
But we both know theres nothing there  
And you just keep on starin  
At the door  
  
Oh and it makes me stop and  
Wonder why  
People give their hearts and turn  
around and say goodbye  
If theres something on your mind  
You better say it while theres time  
Cause Im leavin when I see that  
Morning sky  
  
You and I were lovers all along  
We had a good thing going strong  
And never doubted  
Lately I feel changes comin on  
I know that I will soon be gone  
And you dont even want  
To talk about it  
  
Oh and it makes me stop and  
Wonder why  
People give their hearts and turn  
around and say goodbye  
If theres something on your mind  
You better say it while theres time  
Cause Im leavin when I see that  
Morning sky  
See that morning sky
