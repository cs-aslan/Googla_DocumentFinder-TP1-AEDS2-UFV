Fly boy yeah right  
Hey mama they call me Weezy  
You should be with me I gotta pocket of full of reasons  
Baby I can bless you when you aint even sneezing  
Ill be at your rescue you dont even need me  
I can have you dreaming when you even sleeping  
Mama I can help you get off like the weekend  
She said she wanna do it to the new Enrique  
I pop the disc in and put the song on replay  
And then she backed it up like replay  
  
When you need it  
Girl I try to hide it  
But I cant escape it oh baby  
Please forgive me

Baby I dont give a damn  
I know that your mans nowhere in sight  
Our eyes dont tell a lie  
I know you wanna come with me tonight  
And I say alright

Chorus  
Push push back upon it Girl  
Make me believe you want it  
Push push back upon it Girl

Chorus  
  
After you bag it up just stop  
No drop it like its hot no pop it like a glock  
No stop it like a watch now move it like clockwork  
Your body is screamin and your booty is an outburst  
She wanna do it do it with no delay  
I told her I could run it run it just like relay  
Cause Im cool  
Just like the breezeway now pushin like salt and peppa  
  
Chorus x2
