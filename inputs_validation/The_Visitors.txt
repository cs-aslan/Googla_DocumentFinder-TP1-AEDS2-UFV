I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me  
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence  
I cannot move Im standing  
Numb and frozen  
Among the things I love so dearly  
The books the paintings and the furniture  
Help me  
  
The signals sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob  
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient  
And they dont dare to come here  
Anymore now  
But how I loved our secret meetings  
We talked and talked in quiet voices  
Smiling  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel Im  
Crackin up  
Voices growing louder irritation building  
And Im close to fainting  
Crackin up  
They must know by now Im in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
Crackin up  
My whole world is falling going crazy  
There is no escaping now Im  
Crackin up  
  
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation  
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces  
And now theyve come to take me  
Come to break me  
And yet it isnt unexpected  
I have been waiting for these visitors  
Help me  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel Im  
Crackin up  
Voices growing louder irritation building  
And Im close to fainting  
Crackin up  
They must know by now Im in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
Crackin up  
My whole world is falling going crazy  
There is no escaping now Im  
Crackin up  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel Im  
Crackin up  
Voices growing louder irritation building  
And Im close to fainting  
  
Crackin up I have been waiting for these visitors  
They must know by now Im in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
  
Crackin up I have been waiting for these visitors  
My whole world is falling going crazy  
There is no escaping now Im  
  
Crackin up I have been waiting for these visitors  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel Im  
  
Crackin up I have been waiting for these visitors  
Voices growing louder irritation building  
And Im close to fainting  
  
Crackin up I have been waiting for these visitors  
They must know by now Im in here trembling  
In a terror ever growing  
  
Crackin up I have been waiting for these visitors  
My whole world is falling going crazy  
There is no escaping now Im  
Crackin up
