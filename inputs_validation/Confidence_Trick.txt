Never meant to hurt you I dont know why  
You come with your lawyers and your alibi  
How can you look me straight in the eye  
When you know  
  
The clock on the wall is singing our song  
The love in my heart is all dead and gone  
You know why  
You know why  
  
There you go with your confidence trick  
Im much too wise you dont fool me a bit  
Feeling so low and looking so high  
We both know that your truth is a lie  
  
I never really knew you all these years  
You lied to my face while I undressed your fears  
Then you set me asail on an ocean of tears  
Said goodbye  
  
The clock on the wall is ticking real slow  
Theres nothing to say and theres nowhere to go  
You know why  
You know why  
  
There there you go with your confidence trick  
Im much too wise you dont fool me a bit no no  
Feeling so low and looking so high  
We both know that your truth is a lie  
  
Its a lie  
  
Looking up to the truth of what you are  
Blinding all colours and beauty  
And the sparkle in your eye is blinding  
  
The clock on the wall is singing our song  
The love in my heart is all dead and gone  
You know why  
You know why  
Why why why why why why  
  
There there you go with your confidence trick  
Im much too wise you dont fool me a bit  
Feeling so low and looking so high  
We both know that your truth is a lie  
Its a lie lie  
  
Repeats  
The truth is the truth is a lie  
  
And you never stopped loving me  
Choking back tears for you  
So lovable  
And we never go  
And we never know  
See Im over  
But Im under  
I dont ever wanna come down  
I dont ever wanna come down  
I dont ever wanna come down  
To where you are
