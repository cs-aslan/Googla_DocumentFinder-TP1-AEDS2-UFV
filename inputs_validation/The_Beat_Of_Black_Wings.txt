I met a young soldier  
He said his name was Killer Kyle  
He was shakin all over  
Like a nightfrightened child  
This is his story  
Its a tough one for me to sing  
Hard as the squawk and the flap  
And the beat of the beat of black wings  
  
They gave me a gun he said  
They gave me a mission  
For the power and the glory  
Propaganda piss on em  
Theres a war zone inside me  
I can feel things exploding  
I cant even hear the fucking music playing  
For the beat of the beat of black wings  
  
He said I never had nothin  
Nothin I could believe in  
My girl killed our unborn child  
Without even grievin  
I put my hands on her belly  
To feel the kid kickin damn  
Shed been to some clinic  
Oh the beat of black wings  
  
They want you they need you  
They train you to kill  
To be a pin on some map  
Some vicarious thrill  
The old hate the young  
Thats the whole heartless thing  
The old pick the wars  
We die in em  
To the beat of the beat of black wings  
  
Theres a man drawing pictures  
On the sidewalk with chalk  
Just as fast as he draws em  
Rain come down and wash em off  
Keep the drinks comin girl  
Til I cant feel anything  
Im just a chalk mark in a rainstorm  
Im just the beat of black wings
