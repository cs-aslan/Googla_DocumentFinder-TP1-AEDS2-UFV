Guess mine is not the first heart broken  
My eyes are not the first to cry  
Im not the first to know theres  
Just no getting over you  
  
You know Im just a fool whos willing  
To sit around and wait for you  
But baby cant you see theres nothing else for me to do  
Im hopelessly devoted to you  
  
But now theres no way to hide  
Since you pushed my love aside  
Im outta my head hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
  
My head is saying fool forget him  
My heart is saying dont let go  
Hold on to the end thats what I intend to do  
Im hopelessly devoted to you  
  
But now theres no way to hide  
Since you pushed my love aside  
Im outta my head hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you
