My loves a weapon and Im knockin em dead  
I got a heart thats tough as leather  
Get what I want and just forget em  
This game youre playin is a Russian Roulette  
Just cause Im sweet when were together  
Doesnt mean Im yours forever  
I never should have looked into your eyes  
Now everybodys gonna see how I feel  
  
Dont go ruinin ruinin my my bad reputation  
Dont go tellin em tellin em all the plans weve been makin  
Cause everyone knows that I dont cry  
You never see stars shinin in my eyes  
Ruinin ruinin my my bad reputation  
  
Well I tell em tell em yeah youre nothin to me  
I tell em that you youre just another  
Youre just like any other  
Well I try to sell em but they aint buyin it  
Baby they see me start to stutter  
When they ask if youre my lover  
Im losing sleep whats gotten into me  
Im usually never this way baby  
  
Dont go ruinin ruinin my my bad reputation  
Dont go tellin em tellin em all the plans weve been makin  
Cause everyone knows that I dont cry  
You never see stars shinin in my eyes  
Ruinin ruinin my my bad reputation  
  
I have got to pull myself together but I cant control it  
My lips they know what they want everybody knows it  
Once a girl controlled the world with words that pierced the bone  
Now Im smiling like a lovesick pup and everybody knows it  
  
Dont go ruinin ruinin my my bad reputation  
Dont go tellin em tellin em all the plans weve been makin  
Cause everyone knows that I dont cry  
You never see stars shinin in my eyes  
Ruinin ruinin my my bad reputation
