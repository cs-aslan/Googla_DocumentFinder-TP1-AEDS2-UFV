Well Ive heard of heart breakers  
But you take the cake  
Ladies man  
You could charm the diamonds  
Off a rattlesnake  
Ladies man  
Ladies bring it on over  
When you give em the glance  
They dont stand a chance  
First you unfold them  
Then you pigeonhole em  
Ladies man  
  
Well it sure takes a lot of  
Good natured selfcontrol  
Ladies man  
When Im so hot for you and  
Youre so cold so cold  
Ladies man  
Why do you keep on trying to  
Make a man of me  
Couldnt you just love me  
Like you love cocaine  
Cocaine head games  
  
Cross my heart I swear  
Im not trying to trick you  
No tricks  
Ladies man  
Its just a straight ahead feeling  
I have for you  
Nothing slick  
Ladies man  
I guess you learn to refuse  
What you think you cant handle  
Youre acting like a vandal  
Wrecking the dream  
At the first bad scene  
Ladies man  
Ladies man  
Ladies man  
Ladies man
