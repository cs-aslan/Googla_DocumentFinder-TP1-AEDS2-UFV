Im not afraid of losing you or saying goodbye  
If someone needs you more than me I will understand why  
Id never stand between someone whos holding your heart  
But I cant let a superstition tear us apart  
Who has the right to speak fire from above  
If heaven is away from you that is the place I will give up  
For falling in love cant be taking these lips from the cup  
  
Dont fill her mind with bread and blood  
Dont confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love thats thicker than all bread and blood  
  
Im not afraid to face the truth of what I believe  
If love was never meant to choose it could never succeed  
And we may always stand alone in everyones sight  
And be the judge unto ourselves between wrong and right  
Who puts a price on eternitys sin  
Who throws the first stone shall search for perfection again  
For you are the reason that pleasure was taken from the pain  
  
Dont fill her mind with bread and blood  
Dont confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love thats thicker than all bread and blood  
  
I wont see you cry should it make you cry  
  
Dont fill her mind with bread and blood  
Dont confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love thats thicker than all bread and blood  
  
Dont fill her mind with bread and blood  
Dont confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love thats thicker than all bread and blood
