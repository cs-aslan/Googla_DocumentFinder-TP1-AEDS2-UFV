Chorus  
Im back in babys arms  
How I missed those lovin arms  
Im back where I belong  
Back in babys arms  
  
Dont know why we quarreled  
We never did before  
Since we found out how it hurt  
I bet we never quarrel anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
Thought I didnt need his love  
Til he took it away  
Now Im back where I belong  
And in my babys arms Im gonna stay  
  
Chorus  
  
Back in babys arms back in babys arms back in babys arms
