Saigon it was all gone  
The same coke machines as the streets I grew on  
Down in a mesquite canyon come walking along the ridge  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Campsites an hours walk from the nearest road or town  
Theres too much brush in camp for the chp choppers to touch down  
Aint lookin for nothin  I just want to live  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Come the Santa Anas and man that dry brush would light  
Jimmy Devon got burned up in his own campfire one winter night  
We buried his body in the white stone high up on the ridge  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
I had enough of the town oh and the straight life  
Aint careful you end up on the wrong end of someones knife  
Now I want no trouble and I aint got none to give  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Well I shipped home back in 72  
And you know you were just a beautiul light in your moms dark eyes of  
Blue  
I stepped out on the tarmac we were just kids  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Come veterans day I sat on the stand in my dress blues  
I held your mothers hand and they passed with the red white and  
Blue  
One minute youre right there and somethin slips
