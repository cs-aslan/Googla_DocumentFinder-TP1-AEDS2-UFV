I need your love so badly I love you oh so madly  
But I dont stand a ghost of a chance with you  
I thought at last Id found you but other lovers surround you  
And I dont stand a ghost of a chance with you  
If youd surrender just for a tender kiss or two  
You might discover that Im the lover meant for you  
And Id be true but whats the good of scheming  
I know I must be dreaming
