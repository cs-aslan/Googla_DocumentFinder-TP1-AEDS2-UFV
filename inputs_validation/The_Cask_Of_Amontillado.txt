By the last breath of the four winds that blow  
Ill have revenge upon Fortunato  
Smile in his face Ill say come let us go  
Ive a cask of Amontillado  
  
Sheltered inside from the cold of the snow  
Follow me now to the vault down below  
Drinking the wine as we laugh at the time  
Which is passing incredibly slow  
  
What are these chains that are binding my arm  
Part of you dies each passing day  
Say its a game and Ill come to no harm  
Youll feel your life slipping away  
  
You who are rich and whose troubles are few  
May come around to see my point of view  
What price the Crown of a King on his throne  
When youre chained in the dark all alone  
  
Spare me my life only name your reward  
Part of you dies each brick I lay  
Bring back some light in the name of the Lord  
Youll feel your mind slipping away
