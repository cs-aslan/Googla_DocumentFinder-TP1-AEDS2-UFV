Ive got eyes for you  
And I keep them in a jar up in my room  
When you walk in they open wide  
Lids are gone no place to hide  
Ive got eyes for you  
Ive got eyes for you  
Ive got lips for you  
Some of what they say just might be true  
Well its a scary thought I must confess  
Youre an ice cream cone in a minidress  
Ive got lips for you  
Ive got lips for you  
Oh well I think Im going crazy  
Im feeling pretty good this isnt love  
Its just I think my body likes you  
More than any body should your body likes me too  
Thats why Ive only got eyes for you  
Ive got a nose for you  
And the way you smell I wish that I had two  
Ah well you always smell a bit like gin  
Youre gonna make me take to drinkin again  
Ive got a nose for you  
Ive got a nose for you  
Oh well I think Im going crazy  
Im feeling pretty good this isnt love  
Its just I think my body likes you  
More than any body should your body likes me too  
Thats why Ive only got eyes for you  
Ive got eyes for you  
And I keep them in a jar up in my room  
When you walk in they open wide  
Lids are gone no place to hide  
Ive got eyes for you  
Ive got eyes for you  
Ive got eyes for you  
Ive got eyes for you
