Ive been demoralized too many times  
But now I realize Ah ah no more  
Im gonna get me a gun  
Im gonna get me a gun  
And all those people who put me down  
You better get ready to run  
cause Im gonna get me a gun  
  
I know my destiny is like the sun  
You see the best of me when I have got my gun  
Im gonna get me a gun  
Im gonna get me a gun  
And all those people who put me down  
You better get ready to run  
cause Im gonna get me a gun  
  
So you think you can push me around  
And make me run  
Well Im gonna tell you now  
Im gonna get me a gun  
Im gonna get me a gun  
And all those people who put me down  
You better get ready to run  
cause Im gonna get me a gun  
  
Gonna get me a gun
