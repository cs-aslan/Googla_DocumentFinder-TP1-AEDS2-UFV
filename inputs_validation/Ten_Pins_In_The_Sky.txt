Did you ever wonder why in thunder  
Thunder comes in spring  
Once upon a time it seems  
All the world was wrapped in dreams  
Playful little fellas so they tell us  
Said Lets have our fling  
Spring is in the air you know  
Its time to wake em up below  
So when the thunder starts to thunder dont run home and cry  
Theyre playing tenpins in the sky  
Little fellas way up yonder make the raindrops fly  
While rollin bowlin tenpins in the sky  
The world will wear a new bonnet  
Daffodils on it  
Thanks to the skies above  
Thunder and showers  
Wake up the flowers  
Where there are flowers  
There must be love  
So laugh at raindrops laugh at thunder  
Clouds will soon roll by  
Theyre playing tenpins in the sky
