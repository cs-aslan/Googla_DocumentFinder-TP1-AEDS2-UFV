Well I wish I had a nickel for every time I fell  
And blamed somebody else  
Id give a ton of money to the ones Ive hurt  
And Id still be sittin pretty well  
Ive spent years losin touch of whats right and whats real  
Caught up in these missions of my own  
And youre tellin me you think Ive done so damn well  
While were sittin here a thousand miles from home  
Theres a hole in your wisdom a hole in your sky  
Two holes in your head where the lights supposed to get by  
  
Time to lock and load  
Time to get control  
Time to search the soul  
And start again  
  
So many times Ive seen chances disappear  
I hesitate and watch them slip away  
Like the time I fail to spend with the ones I love  
And its gone as sure as yesterday  
All these users and fakers big time takers  
Manipulating everyone they see  
I get caught up in their schemes and their useless dreams  
And the only one I have to blame is me  
I get turned round and twisted pulled left and right  
I can see where Im goin but I cant see the light  
  
Time to lock and load  
Come in from the cold  
Take a different road  
And start again  
  
I can sit here in the back half of my life  
And wonder when the other shoe will fall  
Or I can stand up point myself home  
And see if Ive learned anything at all  
Anything at all  
  
Mediocritys easy the good things take time  
The great need commitment right down the line  
  
Time to lock and load  
Come in from the cold  
Pay these debts I owe  
And start again  
  
Ive been down this road  
Ive seen things get old  
Time to get control  
And start it all again  
  
Time to lock and load  
Time to get control  
Time to search the soul  
And start again  
  
Ive been down this road  
Ive seen things get old  
Stand up get bold  
And start it all again  
  
Time to lock and load
