Stop marching cause you think you shot to number one  
Counting days and skipping your stones into the sun  
Overrated on the form it goes to where you turn  
Ill be yours tonight  
Living the dream of a meteorite  
  
Stop jumping cause we got something to say yeah  
Young lovers keep it pumping in the streets of LA yeah  
  
Short stroking butterfly better to go for broke  
What youre smoking Mary Jane it doesnt make you choke  
Jumping the fence riding the waves can you take a joke  
Ill be yours today  
Living the dream with a capital K  
  
Stop jumping cause we got something to say yeah  
Young lovers keep it pumping in the streets of LA yeah  
  
Tell me now tell you how  
Just show me where to sit  
  
Make time for love and your happiness  
The mothers of invention are the best  
We all learn and struggle with some loneliness  
A tender mess for everyone I guess  
I guess  
  
Half blinded Im reminded how to find myself  
Nickel and dime I think its time to play some musical chairs  
Dirty laundry what a quandary ask her if she cares  
Ill be yours and more  
Better than ever like never before  
  
Stop jumping cause we got something to say yeah  
Young lovers keep it pumping in the streets of  
  
Make time for love and your happiness  
The mothers of invention are the best  
We all know and struggle with some loneliness  
A tender mess for everyone I guess  
I guess  
  
Sweet talking theres a marker  
To your part of town  
Never again were trying to see your love supremed and bound  
Is it ever meant to be and is it so profound  
Is it you and me play it to one make history  
A history  
  
Said yeah oh yeah  
Said yeah oh yeah  
I said yeah oh yeah
