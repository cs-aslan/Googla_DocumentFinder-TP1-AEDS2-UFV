Theres a thunder in my head  
a roar I cant escape  
I cant ignore this certain fate  
Im experiencing something  
I cant explain  
Theres a frame of reference fragile at best  
An itching fear thats stronger than the rest  
Follow the black ribbon into the sun  
Push it further baby careful with this burnout now  
Im losing myself in you  
and trying to get back to me  
But Im so far away Im losing myself  
The sand in my mouth  
the wind and heat I feel numb  
Ten days on the road and it feels  
like where Ive been aint so bad  
Gotta get back home to you  
Gotta get back home to you  
Gotta get back home  
Throttle back slowly theres no time like now  
Red line it baby Im pushing to the edge now  
Im losing myself in you  
and trying to get back to me  
But Im so far away Im losing myself  
Im beating down this desert highway  
one hundred miles an hour times two  
But Im so far away Im a million miles away  
Im losing myself in you  
and trying to get back to me  
But Im so far away Im losing myself  
Get me off this desert highway  
Gotta get back to you but Im so far away  
Im a million miles away
