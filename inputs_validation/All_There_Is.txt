In the eyes of the world your touch is like gold  
Your reputations so cool and cruel and controlled  
You count your money in your prison tower  
Made of concrete glass and steel  
Feeling cozy in the hollow warmth of another business deal  
Youve climbed your way to the top but lately it seems  
That theres a hole in the heart of the american dream  
Sittin pretty in your trophy room with your shining souvenirs  
That just remind you of the wasted time and the lateness of the years  
Is that all is that all there is  
Is that all there must be more than this  
In the eyes of the world your touch is like gold  
Your reputations so cool and cruel and controlled  
In a moment it could all be gone in the twinkling of an eye  
Then whats your pile of precious pride worth then  
If youve never wondered why  
Is that all is that all there is  
Is that all there must be more than this  
Is that all is that all there is  
Is that all there must be more than this
