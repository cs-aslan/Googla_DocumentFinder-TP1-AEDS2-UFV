If your paycheck depends on  
The weather and the clock  
If your conversation calls for  
A little more than a coffee pot  
If you need to pour your heart out  
And try to rectify some situation  
That youre facing  
Contact your American HonkyTonk Bar Association  
  
When Uncle Sam dips  
In your pocket  
For most things you dont mind  
But when your dollar  
Goes to all of those  
Standing in a welfare line  
Well rejoice you have a voice  
If youre concerned  
About the destination  
Of this great nation  
Its called the American HonkyTonk Bar Association  
  
It represents the hardhat  
Gunrack achinback  
Over taxed flagwavin  
Funlovin crowd

And they love to play it loud

Theres no red tape administrations  
Its the American HonkyTonk Bar Association

Throughout the cities  
And the towns

Who are down  
And every local chapter  
Has a seven day a week  
Available consultation  
For your frustration  
Its called the American HonkyTonk Bar Association  
  
It represents the mud flap  
Six pack beer crack  
Overtaxed flagwavin  
Funlovin crowd  
Their heart is in the music  
And they love to play it loud  
Theres no forms or applications  
Theres no red tape administrations  
Its the American HonkyTonk Bar Association
