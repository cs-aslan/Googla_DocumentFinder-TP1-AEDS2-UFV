Chorus  
Gypsy gypsy dancing feet  
Gypsy gypsy bittersweet  
Screamer dreamer disarray  
Gypsy gypsy why dont you fly away  
  
No good papas no good sisters no good and thats a drag  
Sometimes you feel like your heads on the ceiling  
When you scream your mama rag  
When your daddy come home with an old soup bone  
And take all your money away  
And your mamas in the kitchen on the phone she be bitchin  
And your girlfriend who called to say  
  
Chorus  
  
High school lover with ya cops undercover and gettin high drank Lebanese  
Hey mama choose that you been through  
And its right between your knees  
Hair case shotgun rock on chewing gum take it to the dance tonight  
Your love child with wild child smile  
And dont care wrong from right  
  
Chorus  
  
Nobody but nobody baby knockin my socks off  
Rock rockin baby Ill be gettin my rocks off  
Nobody but nobody shootin never get a shot off  
Yeah yeah yeah
