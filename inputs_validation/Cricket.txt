Some people say that life is a game well if this is so  
Id like to know the rules on which this game of life is based  
I know of no game more fitting than the age old game of cricket  
It has honor it has character and its British  
Now God laid down the rules of life when he wrote those Ten Commandments  
And to cricket those ten same rules shall apply  
Show compassion and selfrighteousness and be honest above all  
And come to Gods call with bat and ball  
  
Now the Devil has a player and hes called the Demon Bowler  
Hes shrewd hes rude and hes wicked  
He is sent by Sinful Satan and hes out to take your wicket  
And you know that thats not cricket  
Hell baffle you with googlies with leg breaks and off spin  
But keep a level head and dont let that demon in  
So keep a straight bat at all times let the Bible be your guide  
And youll get by yes youll get by  
  
All through your life hell try to bowl you out  
Beware the Demon bowler  
Hes crafty and deceitful and hell try to LBW  
And bowl a maiden over  
The Devil takes the weak in spirit and so we must always be courageous  
And remember that God is on your side  
So keep old Satan in your sights and play the straight and narrow line  
And youll get by yes youll get by
