Everythings blue in this world  
  
He couldnt believe how easy it was  
he put the gun into his face  
Bang  
so much blood for such a tiny little hole  
Problems do have solutions you know  
A lifetime of fucking things up fixed  
In one determined flash  
  
Everythings blue  
Everythings blue in this world  
All fuzzy  
Spilling out of my head  
  
The deepest shade  
All spilling  
He couldnt believe how easy it was  
The deepest shade of mushroom blue  
Everythings blue in this world  
A lifetime of fucking things up fixed  
A lifetime of  
The deepest shade  
All fuzzy  
Spilling  
  
Bang  
He couldnt believe how  
Bang  
He couldnt believe how easy it was  
Bang  
He couldnt believe  
Bang  
The deepest shade of mushroom blue  
  
The deepest shade  
The deepest shade  
  
Bang  
  
All fuzzy  
Spilling out of  
The deepest shade of mushroom blue  
  
The deepest shade of mushroom
