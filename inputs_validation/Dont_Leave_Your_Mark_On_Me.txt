Under your protective wing I walked into the night  
And a thousand angry demons up and took flight  
And I went running through the fields with the fever in my veins  
And the rain came crashing down and tried to clear my name  
Above my head all in red I could see you bearing down on me  
You said youre not running out no youre leaving now  
I will find you there is no way out  
Ill keep tracking you down in the still of this night  
Forever mine forever  
  
Chorus  
Dont leave your mark on me I have to reply  
Im not staying no and Im not just killing time  
Dont leave your mark on me I have to reply Im not staying no  
Im not staying no  
  
Mistress of the darkness accomplice of the night  
A shadow in the doorway beckons me inside  
And something led the way though I could not see its face  
And a voice from deep inside me screamed to get out of this place  
Above my head all was said as the jailor turned the key on me  
He said youre not running out no youre not leaving now  
There aint no way there is no no way  
  
Chorus  
  
This nightmare never ends memories of absent friends  
Masked illusions stare at me point the finger silently  
Stand accused as the jury scares theres a ghost in here somewhere  
Theres a ghost in here somewhere  
  
Chorus  
  
Im not staying no  
Oh this nightmare really never ends this is memories of absent friends  
dont leave your mark on me  
Oh this nightmare really never ends theres a ghost in here somewhere  
dont leave your mark on me  
  
Im not staying no  
Oh this nightmare really never ends this is memories of absent friends  
dont leave your mark on me  
Oh this nightmare really never ends theres a ghost in here somewhere  
dont leave your mark on me
