The morning light comes stealing  
To start a new day  
Out there the world is waiting  
To take us far away  
And its time to make  
The final break  
But the memory will linger forever  
  
If I never see you again  
And think of me now and then  
Though it hurts so sweetly  
They say all good things come to an end  
Youve changed my life completely  
Im touched by your love  
Even if I never see you again  
  
The night is so unforgiving yeah  
And Im on my own  
I realize what Im missing  
And now that youve gone  
So I say a prayer  
Are you out there  
Are you feeling what Im feeling now yeah  
  
If I never see you again  
And think of me now and then  
Though it hurts so deeply  
They say all good things come to an end  
Youve changed my life completely  
Im touched by your love  
Even if I never see you  
If I never see you again  
  
And if I never see you again  
  
No one can tell you how the story ends  
Where the road will lead  
When love begins yeah  
  
Youve changed my life completely  
Im touched by your love  
Even if I never see you  
If I never see you  
Even if I never see you again  
And If I never see you
