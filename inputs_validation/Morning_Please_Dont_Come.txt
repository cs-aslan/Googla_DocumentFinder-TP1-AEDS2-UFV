Morning please dont come  
Surely you see that my lover is sleeping  
Morning please dont come  
Let the night linger on  
When the stars have left the sky  
We must say fond goodbye  
Make the night a little longer  
Morning please dont come  
Starshine glow a little stronger  
Morning please dont come  
Day dont break for you will take  
My love away from me  
Try to hold back the sun  
I beg you morning please dont come  
Sing sweet nightingale  
Sing me a song of a night neverending  
Sing sweet nightingale  
And Ill try to pretend  
That tomorrows nowhere near  
And theres nothing to fear  
Make the night a little longer  
Morning please dont come  
Starshine glow a little stronger  
Morning please dont come  
Day dont break for you will take  
My love away from me  
Try to hold back the sun  
I beg you morning please dont come  
Try to hold back the sun  
I beg you morning please dont come  
Try to hold back the sun  
I beg you morning please dont come
