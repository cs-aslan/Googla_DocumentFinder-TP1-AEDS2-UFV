Hang up the phone Im alone  
Ill unlock the door  
Slip in let all your clothes just fall  
Off you to the floor  
Dont even make a sound or turn your mind around  
There is only now For me and you  
  
We cant stop whatever we started  
Cant resist whats meant to be  
Forget whatever we promised  
I want you all over me  
Lets do it now dont think  
Look in my eyes and dont blink  
We cant stop whatever we started  
  
Come over and Ill put my hands where I want to  
End of the bed with my scent  
Still left on you  
Baby dont pretend  
Could ever just be friends  
After I have been Inside of you  
  
We cant stop whatever we started  
Cant resist whats meant to be  
Forget whatever we promised  
I want you all over me  
Lets do it now and dont think  
Look in my eyes and dont blink  
We cant stop whatever we started  
  
Hang up the phone  
Im all alone  
Ill unlock the door  
  
We cant stop whatever we started  
Cant resist whats meant to be  
Forget whatever we promised  
I want you all over me  
All over  
Lets do it now and dont think  
Look in my eyes and dont blink  
And dont And dont  
We cant stop whatever we started
