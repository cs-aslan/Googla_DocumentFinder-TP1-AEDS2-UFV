Watching and waiting  
For a friend to play with  
Why have I been alone so long  
Mole he is burrowing his way to the sunlight  
He knows theres some there so strong  
  
Cause here theres lot of room for doing  
The thing youve always been denied  
Look and gather all you want to  
Theres no one here to stop you trying  
  
Soon you will see me  
Cause Ill be all around you  
But where I come from I cant tell  
But dont be alarmed by my fields and my forests  
Theyre here for only you to share  
  
Cause here theres lot of room for doing  
The things youve always been denied  
So look and gather all you want to  
Theres no one here to stop you trying  
  
Watching and waiting  
For someone to understand me  
I hope it wont be very long
