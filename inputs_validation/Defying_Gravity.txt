I live on a big blue ball  
I never do dream I would fall  
But even the day that I do  
Ill jump off and smile back at you  
  
We dont even know where we are  
But they say that were circling a star  
Well Ill take their word I dont know  
But Im dizzy so maybe thats so  
  
Im riding a big blue ball  
And never do dream I would fall  
But even the high may lay low  
So when I do fall Ill be glad to go
