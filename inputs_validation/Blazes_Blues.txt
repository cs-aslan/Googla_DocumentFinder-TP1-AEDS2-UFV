I gotta guitar all my own  
I gotta quarter for the telephone  
I aint headed down this highway all alone  
One two three and maybe four  
Honey theyre knockin on my door  
I know youre gonna miss me when Im gone  
  
Got no daddy but I got a ma  
Think she lives in Arkansas  
Maybe Ill go see her some old day  
It aint like shed really care  
It aint like shed pay no fare  
But I might just blow on through there anyway  
  
Headed down to Alabam  
Cause some trouble if I can  
Aw buddy would you like to come along  
Its a place I never been  
And you know I could use a friend  
They say theyll give us twenty bucks a song  
  
I gotta guitar all my own  
I gotta quarter for the telephone  
I aint headed down this highway all alone  
One two three and maybe four  
Honey theyre knockin on my door  
You know Im gonna miss you when Im gone
