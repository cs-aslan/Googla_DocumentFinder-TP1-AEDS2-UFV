I cant remember what happened last night  
Was there trouble or was there a fight  
I was out with what was her name  
What I did will I ever do again  
And if I did it then what did I do  
Would you let that happen to you  
Ill give this morning back to my bed  
I cant remember I might be dead  
Cupids arrow sliding through the sky  
See you tomorrow come around tonight  
I cant remember what your kiss is like  
I cant remember if youre black or white  
I wish I could I wish I would remember what  
I cant remember what happened at all  
  
I found my suit all over the hall  
My telephones looking upside down  
Was there paint all over the town  
Is it sunny and is it July  
Does it matter and if so then why  
Ill give this morning back to my cot  
I cant remember if Ive been shot  
  
I cant remember which body is mine  
Is it the left or is it the right  
Maybe I had an excess of drink  
Whats this mess I find in the sink  
Ashtrays emptied all over my shoes  
Everytime I this booze  
Cant find time for words on the phone  
Ill leave today to play on its own
