How the fuck are we supposed to know  
When Im a monster the way  
You refuse to die  
How the fuck are we supposed to know  
If were in love or if in were pain  
  
Im a tightrope walker  
Cant find my circus  
And Im damaged beyond repair  
Now youre just a coffin of a girl I knew  
And Im buried in you  
  
You never said Ill end up like this  
Or so  
You never said Ill end up like this  
No  
  
Sometimes I dream Im an exterminating angel  
A traveling executioner from heaven  
Sent to give you the prettiest death I know  
Call the grave and make our reservations  
  
You never said Ill end up like this  
You never said Ill end up like this  
No  
You never said Ill end up like this  
You never said Ill end up like this  
No  
You never said Ill end up like this  
You never said Ill end up like this  
No  
  
Are we in love or are we in pain Repeat x5  
  
How the fuck are we supposed to know  
When Im a monster the way  
You refuse to die  
How the fuck are we supposed to know  
If were in love or if in were pain  
Why is my wound a front door to you  
Am I my own shadow  
Why is my wound a front door to you  
Am I my own shadow
