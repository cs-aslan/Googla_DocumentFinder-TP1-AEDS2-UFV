I have told  
All of my enemies  
Very politely  
To go home  
I have seen  
All of your remedies  
Now wont you let me please go home  
I cant find anythin to be sad about  
They say Im doomed but I feel fine  
I have tried  
So very hard as hell  
To stay away from them  
And go upstairs  
When I see  
All of your remedies  
I try more desperately to go home  
I cant find anythin to be sad about  
They say Im doomed but I feel fine  
But if Im seatin here lonely  
With no one to hold me  
At least ill have my health  
Im tryin to control myself  
I hav told  
All of my enemies  
Very politely  
To go home  
I have seen  
All of your remedies  
Now wont you let me please go home  
Ive been acting irresponsibly  
Oh what could possibly go wrong  
I have choked on all your remedies  
Now wont you let me please go home  
But if Im seatin here lonely  
With no one to hold me  
At least ill have my health  
Im tryin to control myself
