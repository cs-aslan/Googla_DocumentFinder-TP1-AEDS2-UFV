All the boys are wearing their utility drag  
The girls slip identikits from their utility bags  
Some refugees from suburbia are laughing  
Examining each others gags  
Vibrate on sulphate when it gets late  
And their velocity begins to sag  
Chorus  
And it goes on all night all night  
And it goes on and on the artificial life  
Mary Mary got so confused  
About the fusion game what a game  
Blunked on booze she talks like a newsreel  
Shell take up any kind of bleak exchange  
She turned to perfection once  
But realized shed only turned to pain  
She ran through divine light chemicals Warhol scientology her own sex  
Before she turned away  
Chorus  
Ive learned to be a stranger  
Ive learned to be a stranger  
Ive learned to be a stranger  
Ive learned to be a stranger  
Stranger still  
I should have left here years ago  
But my imagination wont tell me how  
This whirlpools got such seductive furniture  
Its so pleasant getting drowned  
So we drink and sink and talk and stalk  
With interchangeable enemies and friends  
Trying on each others skins  
While were dying to be born again  
Chorus
