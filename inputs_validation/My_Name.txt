Sikes  
  
Strong men tremble when they hear it  
Theyve got cause enough to fear it  
  
Its much blacker than they smear it  
Nobody mentions  
My name  
  
Rich men hold their fivepound notes out   
Saves me emptying their coats out  
They know I could tear their throats out  
Just to live up to  
My name  
  
Wiv me  
Jemmy in me hand  
Lemme see the man who dares  
Stop me  
Taking what I may  
He can start to say his prayers  
  
Biceps like an iron girder  
Fit for doing of a murder  
If I just so much as heard a  
Bloke even whisper  
spoken My name Bill Sikes  
  
sung Some Toff slumming wiv his valet  
Bumped into me in the alley  
Now is eyesll never tally  
Hed never heard of  
My name  
  
One bloke  
Used to boast the claim  
He could take my name in vain  
Poor bloke  
Shame e was so green  
Never was e seen again  
  
Once bad  Whats the good of turning  
In hell Ill be thereaburning  
Meanwhile thing of what Im earning  
All on account of  
My name  
  
What is it What is it What is it  
  
Sikes  
spoken Bill Sikes
