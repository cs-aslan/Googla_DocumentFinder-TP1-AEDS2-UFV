Im drunk cant see my glass  
Not worriedchair dancing man  
  
Tossed out of the Golden Playpen  
Beating the drum of pain and pleasure  
  
You see the street ahead  
Just keep walking down it  
Look straight ahead  
  
Night club ice cubes crackin  
The moneys gone  
Dont have a cent  
  
Tossed out of the Golden Playpen  
Beating the drum of pain and pleasure  
  
Sex talks eats you alive  
We go making friends  
Till were satisfied  
  
Im drunk cant see my glass  
Not worried chair dancing man  
  
Tossed out of the Golden Playpen  
Beating the drum of pain and pleasure
