Ill tell you from the start  
Hes gonna break your heart  
You cant stop the lover boy  
You cant stop the lover boy  
  
Hes gonna tell you lies  
But you wont realize  
Because you cant stop the lover boy  
You cant stop the lover boy  
  
Hes got a thing in his head  
Its from a book hes read  
Its got a funny title  
It tells you how to be vital  
  
He took a lot of time  
Over every line  
Because its guaranteed  
To satisfy  
  
Hes gonna knock em dead  
The boys got that book read  
You cant stop the lover boy  
You cant stop the lover boy  
  
Right from the clothes he wears  
The way he combs his hair  
You cant stop him now because he knows all the tricks  
He used to have a problem but he got it fixed  
  
He took a small apartment  
Above a shoe department  
And he could see from his window  
All the lights in the street glow  
  
Theres a club on the corner  
And tonight he will go there  
To find a new affair  
So all you ladies beware  
  
Hes got to have a good time in the city  
Hes got to have a good time every night  
Hes gonna love em and leave em cheat and decieve em  
Hes gonna show em whos wrong and whos right
