We were as one babe  
For a moment in time  
And it seemed everlasting  
That you would always be mine  
  
Now you want to be free  
So Im letting you fly  
Cause I know in my heart babe  
Our love will never die  
  
Youll always be a part of me  
Im part of you indefinitely  
Boy dont you know you cant escape me  
Ooh darling cause youll always be my baby  
  
And well linger on  
Time cant erase a feeling this strong  
No way youre never gonna shake me  
Oh darling cause youll always be my baby  
  
I aint gonna cry no  
And I wont beg you to stay  
If youre determined to leave boy  
I will not stand in your way  
  
But inevitably youll be back again  
Cause you know in your heart babe  
Our love will never end  
  
Youll always be a part of me  
Im part of you indefinitely  
Boy dont you know you cant escape me  
Ooh darling cause youll always be my baby  
  
And well linger on  
Time cant erase a feeling this strong  
No way youre never gonna shake me  
Oh darling cause youll always be my baby  
  
I know that youll be back boy  
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder  
Oh I know that youll be right back baby  
Oh baby believe me its only a matter of time time  
  
Youll always be a part of me  
Im part of you indefinitely  
Boy dont you know you cant escape me  
Ooh darling cause youll always be my baby  
  
And well linger on  
Time cant erase a feeling this strong  
No way youre never gonna shake me  
Oh darling cause youll always be my baby  
  
Youll always be a part of me  
Im part of you indefinitely  
Boy dont you know you cant escape me  
Ooh darling cause youll always be my baby  
  
And well linger on  
Time cant erase a feeling this strong  
No way youre never gonna shake me  
Oh darling cause youll always be my baby
