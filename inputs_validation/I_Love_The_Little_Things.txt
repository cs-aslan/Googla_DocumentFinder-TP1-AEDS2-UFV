Oh I love the little things you say  
And I love the little things you do  
Lets stay forever together this way  
My love Im so in love with you  
When you whisper I love you and tell me that youre true  
I know Im so lucky that Ive found a girl like you  
Oh I love the little things you say  
And I love the little things you do  
Lets stay forever together this way  
My love Im so in love with you  
When were walking together you slip your hand in mind  
I know Im so lucky that Ive found a girl so fine  
I love the little things you say  
And I love the little things you do  
Lets stay forever together this way  
My love Im so in love with you  
When you touch me and hold me and kiss me tenderly I know  
Im so lucky  
That you came along for meee  
I love the little things you say  
And I love the little things you do  
Lets stay forever together this way  
My love Im so in love with you  
My love Im so in love with you
