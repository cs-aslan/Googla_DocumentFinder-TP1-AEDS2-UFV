I bring it up  
Youre quick to cover it all up again  
Thought we were friends  
What are friends for  
The old bones in your closet  
Must really embarrass you  
And so to save face  
Its a locked place  
  
Chorus  
I dont see why you dont get naked with me  
Get all the little secrets out in the open air  
Cause we wont ever be  
All that we could be  
  
As long as you wont get naked with me  
The futures gettin shaky  
From all this holdin back  
  
Theres something in your past  
That seems to haunt you  
For better or for worse I said  
  
I meant it through and through  
No one has ever loved you  
More than I do  
  
Chorus
