Never saw I love you as a trend  
Cause I dont really work like that  
I mean what I say when it leaves my lips oh  
Nothin you could say would change my heart  
Cause I dont really love like that  
If youd only let me in Id show ya but Im tired of workin so hard  
  
You keep pushin me away  
Tearin down your walls is forcing me to break  
Dont know what to say will you ever let me in  
Its hard for me to pretend  
So tell me what you wanna do  
Tell me is there any other way  
  
Cause goodbyes on the tip of my tongue  
Tell me theres a reason to stay cause Im about to get up and run  
Better think about the words you say  
If you dont wanna end up alone  
  
Tell me is there any room for me  
Cause when its all said and done babe Im tired of singin  
Goodbyes on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbyes on the tip of my  
  
Never confuse me with where youve been  
Cause I dont really work like that  
If Im holdin you then Im all in in  
  
I know youre scared yeah youve been burned  
But I wont ever hurt you like that  
If youd take a chance Im not like them them them  
Give and get nothin in return  
You dont seem to care youre not the only one who hurts  
Tell me is there any other way  
  
Cause goodbyes on the tip of my tongue  
Tell me theres a reason to stay cause Im about to get up and run  
Better think about the words you say  
If you dont wanna end up alone  
  
Tell me is there any room for me  
Cause when its all said and done babe Im tired of singin  
Goodbyes on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbyes on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbyes on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbyes on the tip of my  
  
Why you gotta pull away Pull away and leave me hangin  
Why you gotta make me say  
Dont make me say what youve been thinkin all along  
  
Goodbyes on the tip of my tongue  
Im about to get up and run  
  
Cause goodbyes on the tip of my tongue  
Tell me theres a reason to stay cause Im about to get up and run  
Better think about the words you say  
If you dont wanna end up alone  
  
Tell me is there any room for me  
Cause when its all said and done babe Im tired of singin  
Goodbyes on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbyes on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbyes on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbyes on the tip of my
