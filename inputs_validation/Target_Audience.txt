Am i sorry your sky went black  
Put your knives in babies backs  
Am i sorry you killed the kennedys and huxley too  
  
  
But im sorry shakespeare  
Was your scapegoat  
And your apples sticking into my throat  
Sorry your sunday smiles are rusty nails  
And your crucifixion commercials failed  
But im just a pitiful anonymous  
  
  
And i see all the young believers  
Your target audience  
I see all the old deceivers  
We all just sing their song  
  
  
Am i sorry to be alive  
Putting my face in the beehive  
Am i sorry for booth and oswald pinks and cocaine too  
  
  
Im sorry you never check  
The bag in my head for a bomb  
And my halo was a needle hole  
Im sorry i saw a priest being beaten  
And i made a wish  
But im just a pitiful anonymous  
  
  
And i see all the young believers  
Your target audience  
I see all the old deceivers  
We all just sing their song  
We all just sing their song  
  
  
the valley of death we are free  
Your fathers your prison you see  
  
  
And i see all the young believers  
Your target audience  
I see all the old deceivers  
We all just sing their song  
  
  
Youre just a copy of an imitation
