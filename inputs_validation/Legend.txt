Hook  
When I pull up on a nigga  
Tell that nigga back back  
Im too good with these words  
Watch a nigga backtrack  
If I die all I know is Im a mother fuckin legend  
Its too late for my city  
Im the youngest nigga reppin  
Oh my God oh my God  
If I die Im a legend  
Oh my God oh my God  
If I die Im a legend  
  
Verse 1  
Im on first Im on tour  
Got a girl she from the South  
Used to work used to dance in Texas  
Now she clean the house  
Everyday I was strugglin to learn what lifes about  
On my way money taught me Spanish  
Make it andale  
Way up north packed in Honda cars  
They ont know who we are  
Fuck em all they only pussy niggas shootin at the star  
Right or wrong Ima write my wrongs  
They cant live this long  
You dont know where youre gonna go  
I got this shit mapped out strong
