Pissing in a river watching it rise  
Tattoo fingers shy away from me  
Voices voices mesmerize  
Voices voices beckoning sea  
Come come come come back come back  
Come back come back come back  
  
Spoke of a wheel tip of a spoon  
Mouth of a cave Im a slave Im free  
When are you coming  hope you come soon  
Fingers fingers encircling thee  
Come come come come come come  
Come come come come come come for me oh  
  
My bowels are empty excreting your soul  
What more can I give you  baby I dont know  
What more can I give you to make this thing grow  
Dont turn your back now Im talking to you  
  
Should I pursue a path so twisted   
Should I crawl defeated and gifted   
Should I go the length of a river  
the royal the throne the cry me a river  
Everything Ive done Ive done for you  
Oh I give my life for you  
Every move I made I move to you  
And I came like a magnet for you now  
  
What about it youre gonna leave me  
What about it you dont need me  
What about it I cant live without you  
What about it I never doubted you  
What about it  what about it   
What about it  what about it   
  
Should I pursue a path so twisted   
Should I crawl defeated and gifted   
Should I go the length of a river  
the royal the throne the cry me a river  
What about it what about it what about it   
Oh Im pissing in a river
