Originally recorded by Diamond Head  
  
Now I see his face I see his smile  
Such a lonely place no golden mile  
Eyes tell of morbid tales of his black heart  
His deeds through ages past tell of his part  
  
See his face see his smile  
Time to die  
Yoooh woooh noo  
  
Angel from below change my dreams  
I want for glorys hour for wealths esteem  
I wish to sell my soul to be reborn  
I wish for earthly riches dont want no crown of thorns  
  
See his face see his smile  
Time to die  
Woooh ooooh noo  
  
I was born a fool dont want to stay that way  
Devil take my soul with diamonds you repay  
I dont care for heaven so dont you look for me to cry  
And I will burn in hell from the day I die  
  
See his face see his smile  
Time to die  
Woooh noooh no
