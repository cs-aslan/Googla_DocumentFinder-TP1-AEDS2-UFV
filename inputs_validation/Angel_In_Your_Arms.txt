Do you think Im such a fool  
To believe everything you say is true  
Well that just goes to show  
That you really dont know  
While youre out painting the town  
Do you think Im home just sitting around  
Waiting on you  
Now whos really the fool  
  
When I first found out I hurt all over  
I felt so left out till I got to know her  
So I drived away as she got over  
And I became just like her  
  
So dont be surprised to find that  
The angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone elses arms tonight  
Yes the angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone elses arms tonight  
  
Whyd you slip around secretly  
If you were tired of loving me  
Why do you keep holding on  
When love was already gone  
The time you said you wasnt feeling well  
Did you think I couldnt tell  
Youve been with someone else  
You were only kidding yourself  
  
When I first found out I hurt all over  
I felt so left out till I got to know her  
So I drived away as she got over  
And I became just like her so dont be surprised to find  
The angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone elses arms tonight  
Yes the angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone elses arms tonight  
The angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone elses arms tonight  
Yes the angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone elses arms tonight
