Verse 1  
When you appeared  
I was just lonely  
I was just in need of a friend  
Spend your days  
Thinking if only  
Thinking if only you and me made sense  
For any love  
Quit the pain you feel  
You wont let it go  
You wont let it heal  
Baby its clear  
You dont know me  
You dont know me  
  
Chorus  
And I dont have the heart that you think I do  
And you give me so much its too much to lose  
You know Im not the one  
Baby Im not the one  
I cant show you my love that you showed to me  
When it isnt enough I wont makebelieve  
You know Im not the one  
Baby leave love alone  
Let it heal  
Let it heal  
  
Verse 2  
Its in your eyes  
I can see that youre broken  
I know youre lost because I am too  
Its in your voice  
I hear you choking  
When did the illusion take the truth  
I think youre in love  
With the pain you feel  
You wont let it go  
You wont let it heal  
Baby its clear  
You dont even know me  
You dont even know me  
  
Chorus  
And I dont have the heart that you think I do  
And you give me so much its too much to lose  
You know Im not the one  
Baby Im not the one  
I cant show you my love that you showed to me  
When it isnt enough I wont makebelieve  
You know Im not the one  
Baby leave love alone  
Let it heal  
Let it heal  
  
Bridge  
You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out  
It wasnt innocent youve measured every inch of love youve given now  
You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out  
It wasnt innocent youve measured every inch of love youve given now  
  
Chorus  
And I dont have the heart that you think I do  
And you give me so much its too much to lose  
You know Im not the one  
Baby Im not the one  
I cant show you my love that you showed to me  
When it isnt enough I wont makebelieve  
You know Im not the one  
Baby leave love alone  
Let it heal  
Let it heal
