Well there aint nobody safer than someone who doesnt care  
And it isnt even lonely when no ones ever there  
I had a lot of dreams once but some of them came true  
The honeys sometimes bitter when fortune falls on you  
  
So you know Ive been a soldier in the armies of the night  
And Ill find the fatal error in whats otherwise all right  
But here youre trembling like a sparrow I will try with all my might  
To give you just a little sweetness  
Just a little sweetness  
Just a little light  
  
I have always heard that virtue ought be its own reward  
But it never comes so easy when youre living by the sword  
Its even harder to be heartless when you look at me that way  
Youre as mighty as the flower that will grow the stones away  
  
Even though I been a stranger full of irony and spite  
Holding little but contempt for all things beautiful and bright  
Something shines around you and it seems to my delight  
To give me just a little sweetness  
Just a little sweetness  
Just a little sweetness  
Just a little light  
  
This could be just another highway coiled up in the night  
You could be just another whitetail baby stranded on my brights  
Theres a tingling recognition  
Like the sound of distant thunder  
And I begin to wonder  
If the love Ive driven under  
Wont ignite  
  
So you know Ive been a soldier in the armies of the night  
And Ill find the fatal error in whats otherwise all right  
Something shines around you that seems to my delight  
To give me just a little sweetness  
Just a little sweetness  
Just a little sweetness  
Just a little light
