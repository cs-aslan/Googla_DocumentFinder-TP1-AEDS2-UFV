I have been somebody on nobodys mind  
A funny kind of winner losing all the time  
On my way to somewhere with no place to go  
Then you said hello  
  
And now i walk with you  
I talk with you  
At last youre here  
In my arms close to me so very near  
  
Touching me reaching me with the everything you do  
Long nights through  
God love you  
God love you  
God love you  
You loving way will make me stay  
God love you  
  
Youve become the only one whos always there  
In my dreams on my mind in every prayer  
  
By your side Im satisfied no way to hide  
This feeling i have for you  
Ill swear its true  
God love you  
God love you  
God love you  
  
God loves you for being you  
And I thank you for loving me too  
God love you
