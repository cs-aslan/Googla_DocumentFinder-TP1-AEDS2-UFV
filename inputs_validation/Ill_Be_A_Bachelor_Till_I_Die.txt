Ill take you to the picture show and babe Ill hold your hand  
Ill sit up in your parlor let you cool me with your fan  
Ill listen to your troubles and pet you when you cry  
But get that marryin out of your head Ill be a bachelor till I die  
  
I done my honky tonkin round if that will bring you fun  
But somehow I cant understand how one and one makes one  
I like to cuddle near you and listen to you lie  
But get that marryin out of your head Ill be a bachelor till I die  
  
Now if you want a help mate youre just wasting lots of time  
Cause Im afraid of church bells how they scare me when they chime  
Ive seen those married people just up and say goodbye  
So keep that marryin out of your head Ill be a bachelor till I die  
  
This freedoms mighty precious in this land of liberty  
Ive seen what matrimony done to better men than me  
I dont mind keepin company with the apple of my eye  
But keep that marryin out of your head Ill be a bachelor till I die
