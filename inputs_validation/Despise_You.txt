Please go away  
Leave me alone  
To you I have nothing to say  
My voice has no tone  
  
Id rather be there  
Because youre here  
Whatever I dont care  
Because of you there was a tear  
  
No one cares about me  
No one needs me  
But dont you see  
I do whatever you do to me  
  
Do you hate me  
cause I know I hate you  
Thats why I want you to stay away from me  
You werent the only one that I knew  
  
Dont try to touch my feelings  
Dont try to see whats on my mind  
cause the last thing Id do is let you  
Back in my life I despise you
