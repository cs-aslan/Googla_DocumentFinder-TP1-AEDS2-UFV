Never let him see you when your breaking  
Never let him see you when you fall  
Thats how we live  
And thats how we try  
  
Tell The world youve got it all together  
You never let him see whats underneath  
We cover it up  
With the crooked smile  
But it only lasts for a little while  
  
Theres no such thing as perfect people  
There no such thing as a perfect life  
So come as you are broken and scarred  
Lift up your heart and be amazed and be changed  
By a perfect God  
Yea  
  
Suddenly its like a weight is lifted  
When you hear the words that you are loved  
He knows where you are  
And where youve been  
And you never have to go there again  
  
Theres no such thing as perfect people  
Theres no such thing as a perfect life  
So come as you are broken and scarred  
Lift up your heart and be amazed and be changed  
By a perfect God  
  
Who lived and died to give you life  
To heal our imperfections  
So look up and see love and let grace be enough  
  
There no such thing as perfect people  
Yea  
Theres no such thing as a perfect life  
So come as you are broken and scarred  
Lift up your heart and be amazed and be changed  
By a perfect God  
By a perfect God  
By a perfect God  
Yea  
By a perfect God  
Be changed by a perfect God  
Be changed
