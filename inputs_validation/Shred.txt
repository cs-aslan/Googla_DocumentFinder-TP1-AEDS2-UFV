Last time you saw me  
I was walking out the door  
Got a nasty habit  
Comin back for more  
Aint just a threat no  
Its a promise well kept  
So when all is said and done  
I came to shred  
  
Shred Simply stated  
Shred In a word  
Shred Simply stated  
Shred  
  
Dirty little rumor circulating round  
Spreadin like the plague in every little town  
Capturing the spirit and goin to the head  
Comin from a blindspot  
Comin out to shred shred  
  
You know me  
  
Go  
Next time you see me  
Ill be walking through that door  
And all those nasty habits  
Risin up once more  
Here comes the promise  
In actions not said  
So make no bones about it  
Im back to shred  
  
You or me  
Shred Simply  
Shred Shred  
Shred In a word  
Shred Shred Shred  
Shred Shred
