Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh  
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh  
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh  
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh  
  
Heres your standing O  
  
Boy you remind  
Me of a love that seemed so sublime  
Your kisses told me oh so many lies  
Shades on like I be stuntin through the night  
  
But I decided with the eyes  
To keep the world from knowin whats inside  
I didnt know oh oh oh ohohoh  
I was a show oh oh oh ohohoh  
  
And your words they had no meaning  
How didnt I forsee this  
Happiness and congrats  
Know that  
I pretend I mean it  
  
Chorus  
So cheers toast bravo to you  
Cause youre the man of the hour  
Im a have to send you some flowers  
Ohhhhhh  
Cheers toast bravo to you  
The man of the hour  
You played the one that loved you the most  
So heres your standing O  
Oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh  
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh  
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh  
Boy so Heres your standing O  
Oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh  
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh  
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh  
Gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it so heres your standing O  
  
Heres your standing ovation  
Doctor I was too patient  
Even when you wasnt enough  
Im the one that taught you how to love  
And boy I gave you all of me  
Parts of affection you couldnt see  
As you embrace her in your arms give her my all  
Give her more than you gave to me  
  
When you had nothing I gave  
When you were weak I made you brave  
You went and leave me with the scars on my heart  
Its funny how yall forget it all  
  
Chorus  
  
Round of applause to the  
Biggest fool in the world  
Give em all that you got  
And they still ride out into the sunset with the next girl  
  
Round of applause to the  
Biggest fool in the world  
Give em all that you got  
And they still ride out into the sunset with the next girl  
  
Standing ovation  
Congratulation  
Damn I was down for it  
Gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it  
Standing ovation  
Congratulation  
Damn I was down for it  
Gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it  
  
All you did was pound on it  
Gave you my heart  
And all you did was pound on it  
All you did was pound on it
