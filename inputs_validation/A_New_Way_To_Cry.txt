All my tears have fallen I can cry no more  
Ive cried so mmuch since you have said goodbye  
The pressure keeps on building up within my heart  
It grows and grows but still my eyes are dry  
Though my heart is breakin tears refuse to start  
So Ive got to find a new way to cry  
  
Ive got to find a new way to relieve the pain  
It just cant stay forever locked inside  
And until I forget you and can smile again  
Ive got to find a new way to cry  
  
Instrumental break  
  
Ive got to find a new way to relieve the pain  
It just cant stay forever locked inside  
And until I forget you and can smile again  
Ive got to find a new way to cry
