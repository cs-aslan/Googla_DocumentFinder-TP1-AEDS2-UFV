It was a red hot night night in Mobile  
Sweat glistened on the reverends chin  
His mohair suit was shinin  
  
He told us all about sin  
  
It could be wall to wall in Wall Street  
We could be livin hand to mouth  
Jesus loved a Yankee  
But God saved the south  
  
Across the street in the pool hall  
Bubba put the eight ball down  
Its a high five celebration  
They passed the Jack around  
  
Its wall to wall in Wall Street  
Were livin hand to mouth  
Jesus loved a Yankee  
But God saved the south  
  
God saved the south  
Yankee boy shut your mouth  
Yes God saved the south  
Yankee boy shut your mouth  
Shut your mouth  
  
Some long haired boys with guitars  
Playin behind the chicken wire  
Theyre goin up to New York City  
Gonna sing about Atlantas fire  
  
It could be wall to wall in Wall Street  
We could be livin hand to mouth  
Jesus loved a Yankee  
But God saved the south  
  
And God saved the south  
Yankee boy shut your mouth  
Yes God saved the south  
Yankee boy shut your mouth  
  
Yes God saved the south  
Yankee boy shut your mouth  
And God saved the south  
SoYankee boy shut your mouth  
  
And God saved the south  
Yankee boy shut your mouth  
Yes God saved the south  
So Yankee boy shut your mouth  
  
God saved the south  
So Yankee boy shut your mouth
