When I look into your eyes  
I see sunshine  
The coulds are blown away  
I hope youre here to stay  
Cause Ive got me needing more of you  
Guess Im falling for you  
  
You walk away  
My eyes caress you  
Then you turn and smile  
Youve caught me thinkin of love with you  
Guess Im falling I may be falling for you  
  
Since I met you days are brighter  
Lifes uneven loads are lighter  
When I hear you whisper the words I long to hear dear  
Now I look into your eyes  
Im lost in knowing that you are all I want  
My need for you is growing  
Guess Im falling I think Im falling for you  
Think about falling for me too
