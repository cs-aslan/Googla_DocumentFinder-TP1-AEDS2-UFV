I never thought a first time love would ever last  
How could a kiss like that  
Knock me flat on my ass  
  
The burning bed  
The roses dead  
And now Im dancing with myself  
  
Yeah  
Im missing you  
Just like you want me to  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I cant get you off of my mind  
  
Yeah  
Your sweet talking hip shaking wobble gonna blow a man away  
Kiss butt and guess what  
Even double crossin dogs have their day ha  
So forget about regret about youre right I aint afraid to say  
  
Yeah Im missing you  
Just like you want me to  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I cant get you off  
  
And the more I try  
Leads to the same old why  
You made me slip into the grind  
Now I cant get you off of the cloud we was on  
And now its all gone  
Tell me why why why why  
Why aint I getting through  
Aint no lie there out of love love love  
  
Tell me was it good for you  
  
Tell me what you want  
  
Yeah cause Im missing you  
Just like you knew Id do  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I cant getchoo off  
And I know I tried  
Leads to the same old why  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I cant cant cant get you  
Get you Repeat x4  
Get you Repeat x3  
  
Off of my mind
