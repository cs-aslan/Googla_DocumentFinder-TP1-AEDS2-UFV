Im so confused  
Maybe its because ti amo  
I wrote this whole thing  
Just because ti amo  
I sit alone and  
Im playing the piano  
I feel so strange  
Its just because ti amo  
  
I think I wont make it through  
Youre always on my mind  
Please tell me you love me too  
Or else Im gonna die  
Here is what you mean to me  
You are an angel God sent to me  
And I just want you here with me  
Holding you all the time  
  
When things go wrong  
Everything seems nice to me  
I dont know why  
But I think its cause ti amo  
I cant live without you  
And I dont want to try  
The reasons obvious  
It is because ti amo  
  
You mean the whole world to me  
You are my everything  
You make me fly without wings  
Its just the way I feel  
What else could I ever ask  
You are the dream of a lifetime  
And I want you beside me  
Till the world stops to turn  
  
I cant describe  
The way I feel inside  
I dont know why  
Maybe because ti amo  
All my friends wonder  
How I can be so lucky  
To have you in my life  
The answers cause ti amo
