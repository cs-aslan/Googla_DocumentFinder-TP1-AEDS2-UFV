The roof is leaking and the wind is howling  
Kids are crying cause the sheets are so cold  
I woke this morning found my hands were frozen  
Ive tried to fix the fire but you know the damn things too old  
  
Its been months now since we heard from our Mary  
I wonder if she ever made the coast  
She and her young man they both moved out there  
But I sure hope they write just to let us know  
  
And me Im getting stronger by the minute  
My wifes expecting but I hope she can wait  
Cause this winter looks like its gonna be another bad one  
But Springll soon be here  
Oh God I hope its not late  
  
Ma and Pa lived here and theirs before them  
Tried their hardest to make it a home  
Seems so long now since they passed over  
Hope my childrenll try to make it their own
