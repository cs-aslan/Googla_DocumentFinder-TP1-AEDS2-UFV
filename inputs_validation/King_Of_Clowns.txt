Here I come the king of clowns  
As I hide behind a smile and paint the town  
Though I cry since youre gone  
Youll never know because the show must go on  
  
Ive been sad Ive been blue  
Ever since the day that you found someone new  
I pretend but you cant tell  
With my broken heart I play my part so well  
  
Step aside here I come the king of clowns  
As I hide the lonely teardrops that come down  
I make believe with a smile  
But the king of clowns is cryin all the while  
Tra la la la la la lilo tra la la la la la lilo  
Here comes the king of clowns  
Tra la la la la la lilo tra la la la la la lilo  
Here comes the king of clowns  
  
There are tears youll never see  
No youll never see my tears and pity me  
Though Im hurt still Im proud  
Always laughin as I walk among the crowd  
  
Step aside here I come the king of clowns  
As I hide the lonely teardrops that come down  
I make believe with a smile  
But the king of clowns is cryin all the while  
Tra la la la la la lilo tra la la la la la lilo  
Here comes the king of clowns  
Tra la la la la la lilo tra la la la la la lilo  
Here comes the king of clowns  
  
Tra la la la la la lilo tra la la la la la lilo  
Here comes the king of clowns
