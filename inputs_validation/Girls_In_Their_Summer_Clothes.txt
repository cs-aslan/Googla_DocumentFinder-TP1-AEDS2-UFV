Well the street lights shine  
Down on Blessing Avenue  
Lovers they walk by  
Holdin hands two by two  
  
A breeze crosses the porch  
Bicycle spokes spin round  
Jackets on Im out the door  
Tonight Im gonna burn this town down  
  
Chorus  
And the girls in their summer clothes  
In the cool of the evening light  
The girls in their summer clothes  
Pass me by  
  
Kids rubber ball smacks  
Off the gutter neath the lamp light  
Big bank clock chimes  
Off go the sleepy front porch lights  
  
Downtown the stores alive  
As the evenings underway  
Things been a little tight  
But I know theyre gonna turn my way  
  
Chorus  
  
Frankies Diners  
Over on the edge of town  
Neon sign spinnin round  
Like a cross over the lost and found  
  
Fluorescent lights  
Flicker above Bobs Grill  
Shaniqua brings a coffee and asks fill  
And says penny for your thoughts now my boy Bill  
  
She went away  
She cut me like a knife  
Hello beautiful thing  
Maybe you could save my life  
  
In just a glance  
Down here on Magic Street  
Loves a fools dance  
I aint got much sense but I still got my feet  
  
Chorus x2  
  
La la la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la la  
fades
