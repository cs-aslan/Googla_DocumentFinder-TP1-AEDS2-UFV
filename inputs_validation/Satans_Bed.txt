Its not all been saidbeen said and done  
Ive never slept in Satans bed  
Although I must admitstill visits my place  
Uninvited as you know he dont wait  
Funny how he always seems to fit in  
Funny how I always want to give in  
Sundays Fridays Tuesdays Thursday the same  
Sometimes the special guest he dont like to leave  
Alreadyin love 3x  
Already  
Who made who made up made up the myth  
That we were born to be covered in bliss  
Who set the standard born to be rich  
Such fine examples skinny little bitch  
Model role model roll some models in blood  
Get some flesh to stick so they look like us  
I shit and I stink Im real join the club  
Id stop and talk but Im already in love  
Alreadyin love 3x  
Already  
In loveAh ha ha ha  
follows torturefollows reward 2x  
Oh oh my butt  
Never shook Satans hand look see for yourself  
Youd know it if I had that shit dont come off  
Ill rise and fall let me take credit for both  
Jump off a cliff dont need your help so back off  
Ill never suck Satans dick  
Again youd see it you know right round the lips  
Ill wait for an angel but I wont hold my breath  
Magine theyre busy think Im doing okay  
Alreadyin love 6x  
Already
