She was the sweetest ever  
Whatever happened to forever  
She never say never she rather say whatever  
Id rather stay together and shed rather chase the devil  
Now Im left to race the rebel  
Bartender make it several  
Turn up the bass and treble  
How bout I make it metal  
Im such a fatal fellow  
And shes the reason why  
Because without the muthafucker Id die  
Id die Id die  
So bury me today or tomorrow  
Cause Ive buried myself away  
In the sorrow in may  
I die before I wake  
I pray Im resurrected for her nightmares sake  
  
But you love me  
At least thats what she said  
That whole weekend in my bed  
But there was a speaker in my head  
Saying seek and youll be led  
But instead instead I loved you  
I was weak and mislead  
I was deeper than dead  
I was sinking in dread now Im thinking in shreds  
So I inked this in red  
  
But she loves me  
She loves me not  
  
I hate love  
Yeah I hate love  
Oh my God  
I hate love  
  
I used to tell myself I wouldnt do this to myself  
Until I proved it to myself  
And now Im losing myself  
I hides to have my shit together but now  
You see now Im with whatever  
And now you see now you with whoever forever and ever  
And everybody know I aint actin like in supposed  
Im attacking my own soul  
Im back in a lone mode  
Im back on that long road  
And that road goes forever and ever  
  
I dont wanna love no more spare me  
You can have my heart its only dead beat  
Im sick of the loves songs and the bullshit  
When reality bites like a wolf bitch  
Shes on top she wanna kiss  
She wont stop she dont wanna quite  
Then I woke up and I wish I could sleep forever and ever  
  
She loves me  
She loves me not  
I hate love  
Yeah I hate love  
Oh my God  
I hate love  
  
And I dont want love I dont want love  
I dont wanna love no more  
So if you see her you can have her  
Shell be outside my door  
So tell a preacher tell a doctor  
I curse the very day you were born  
Tell my lawyer to tell a judge that in guilty
