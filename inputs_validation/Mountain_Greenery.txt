On the first of May it is moving day  
Spring is here so blow your job  
Throw your job away  
Nows the time to trust  
To your wanderlust  
In the citys dust you wait must you wait  
Just you wait  
  
In a mountain greenery  
Where God paints the scenery  
Just two crazy people together  
While you love your lover  
Let blue skies be your coverlet  
When it rains well laugh at the weather  
And if youre good Ill search for wood  
So you can cook while I stand looking  
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery  
Bless our mountain greenery home  
  
Simple cooking means  
More than French Cuisines  
Ive a banquet planned which is  
Sandwiches and beans  
Coffees just as grand  
With a little sand  
Eat and youll grow fatter boy  
smatter boy Huh huh Atta boy  
  
In a mountain greenery  
Where God paints the scenery  
Just two crazy people together  
Howhowhowhowhow we love sequestering  
Where no pests are pestering  
No dear momma holds us in tether  
Mosquitoes here  
Wont bite you dear  
Ill let them sting me on the finger  
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery  
Bless our mountain greenery  
Far from lifes machinery  
Bless our mountain greenery home
