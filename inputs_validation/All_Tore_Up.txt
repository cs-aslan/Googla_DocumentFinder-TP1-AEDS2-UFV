We were a blown out of wicked proportions  
An accidental company  
If we said were gonna go out and get all tore up tonight  
Then we did we got a little happenin  
Player tonights the nights right  
And dont clear the place  
Sweep up a little on your way out  
You might make it  
With Dottie the bluegrass singer  
Baring her local breast  
Singing You want an open concept  
Ill give you open concepts  
You player Fuckup nows right  
And dont clear the place  
Wreak some havoc on the way out  
You might make it  
Drink up folks its getting on time to close  
They saidWe dont even like you Im with you I said  
Perhaps you think the road is a means to an end  
Where its a living in the end  
The living end the living image of the end  
Player tonights the nights right  
Dont clear the place  
Sweep up a little on your way out  
You might make it  
If your tonights the nights right  
You dont clear the place  
Sweep up a little on your way out  
You might make it  
Tonights the night  
Tonights the night tonight  
Tonights the night tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight  
Tonights the night tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight  
Tonights the night tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight
