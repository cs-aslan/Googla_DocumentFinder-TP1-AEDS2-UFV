Tell me that you love me  
You say you dont but you dont know  
See you in my dreams  
And you are so fair  
I tried so hard to find you  
But you were never there  
Youre my dream girl  
And none can compare  
Youre always with me  
In our kingdom far away  
You will be her majesty  
And together we will reign  
Youre my dream girl  
Itll always be that way  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa yeah  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa yeah  
Walking into the night  
Just waiting to hear you say  
Everything will be alright  
And I will be okay  
Youre my dream girl  
Itll always be that way  
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Yeah  
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Yeah  
Youll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
Youll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
Youll always be that way  
No matter what they say yeah  
You say you dont want to  
Tell me that you love me  
You say you dont but you dont know  
Youll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
Youll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
Youll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
Youre my dream girl  
Youll always be that way  
Wear you down  
you say you dont  
wear you down  
you say you dont  
You say you dont want to tell me  
that you love me  
You say you dont but you dont know  
Youll always be that way  
Youll always be that way  
Youll always be that way
