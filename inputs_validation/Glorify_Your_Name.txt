Jesus Jesus  
Holy One Gods precious Son  
You gave  
  
Jesus Jesus  
On the cross You took my shame  
Forever from my heart Ill say  
  
I live to worship You Lord  
My King of glory  
Brought me to life  
Gave me wings to fly  
You are holy  
Heaven and earth declare Your praise  
Both now and evermore  
I glorify Your name  
  
Jesus Jesus  
On the cross You took my sin  
Forever from my heart Ill sing  
  
You are holy  
Glorify Your name  
Jesus Jesus Jesus  
I glorify Your name
