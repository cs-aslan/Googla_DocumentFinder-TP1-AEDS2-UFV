Christmas in the Caribbean  
Snowbirds fill the air  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Lots of presents everywhere  
We dont live in a hurry  
Send away for mistletoe  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
We got everything but snow  
  
Lights are glowing in the palm trees  
Stockings hanging from mast  
Santas riding on a dolphin  
Dont you want to make it  
Dont you want to make it last  
  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Snowbirds fill the air  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Lots of presents everywhere  
We dont live in a hurry  
Send away for mistletoe  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
We got everything but snow  
  
Suntanned children sleeping  
Hoping Santa will come through  
Christmas morning boy theyre leaping  
Oh its Bubbas Birthday  
Mr Buffetts birthday too  
  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Snowbirds fill the air  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Lots of presents everywhere  
We dont live in a hurry  
Send away for mistletoe  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
We got everything but snow
