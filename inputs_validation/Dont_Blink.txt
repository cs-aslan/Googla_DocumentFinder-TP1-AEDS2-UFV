I turned on the evening news  
Saw a old man being interviewed  
Turning a hundred and two today  
Asked him whats the secret to life  
He looked up from his old pipe  
Laughed and said All I can say is  
  
Chorus  
Dont blink  
Just like that youre six years old and you take a nap and you  
Wake up and youre twentyfive and your high school sweetheart becomes your
wife  
Dont blink  
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did  
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half  
Of fifty years is there in bed  
And youre praying God takes you instead  
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think  
So dont blink  
  
I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said  
Best start putting first things first  
Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand  
You cant flip it over and start again  
Take every breathe God gives you for what its worth  
  
Chorus  
  
So Ive been tryin to slow it down  
Ive been tryin to take it in  
In this here today gone tomorrow world were livin in  
  
Chorus  
  
Naw dont blink  
Life goes faster than you think
