Though I know that you are sleepin  
Girl theres somethin I must say  
Though the road may wind  
My love will find the way  
Many the miles have come between us  
And the days they come and go  
Still with all we feel  
It never really shows  
  
Hold me touch me and think of me when were apart  
Hold me baby wont you touch me  
And think of me here in the night  
And you know itll be alright  
  
Though the time apart seems endless  
All my thoughts remain with you  
I believe one day  
Well make our dreams come true  
  
Our goodbyes go on forever  
And with all that we may say  
Till tomorrow comes  
Well dream of yesterday  
  
Hold me baby wont you touch me  
And think of me when were apart  
Hold me baby wont you touch me  
And think of me here in the night  
And you know itll be alright  
Mmm aha yeah
