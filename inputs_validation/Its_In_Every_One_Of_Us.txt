Its in every one of us to be wise  
Find your heart  
And open up both your eyes  
We can all know every thing  
Without ever knowing why  
Its in every one of us by and by  
Its in every one of us  
Find your heart  
And open up both your eyes  
We can all know every thing  
Without ever knowing why  
Its in every one of us by and by  
Its in every one of us  
I just remembered  
Its like Ive been sleeping for years  
Im not awake as I can be  
But my seeings better  
I can see through the tears  
Ive been realizing that  
I bought this ticket  
And watching only half of the show  
But theres scenery and lights  
And a cast of thousands  
Who all know what I know  
And its good that its so  
Its in every one of us to be wise  
Find your heart  
And open up both your eyes  
We can all know every thing  
Without ever knowing why  
Its in every one of us by and by  
Its in every one of us by and by
