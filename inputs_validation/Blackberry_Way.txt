Blackberry way absolutely pouring down with rain  
Its a terrible day  
Up with the lark silly girl i dont know what to say  
She was running away  
But now Im standing on the corner  
Lost in the things that i said  
What am i supposed to do now  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I cant see you i dont need you  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day  
  
Flowers in the park overgrowing but the trees are bare  
Theres a memory there  
Boats on the lake unattended now for all to drown  
Im incredibly down  
Just like myself they are neglected  
Turn with my eyes to the wall  
What am i supposed to do now  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I cant see you i dont need you  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day  
  
Run for the train look behind you for she may be there  
Said a thing in the air  
Blackberry way see the battlefield of careless sins  
Cast to the winds  
So full of emptiness without her  
Lost in the words that i said  
What am i supposed to do now  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I cant see you i dont need you  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I cant see you i dont need you  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day
