Rock rock rock  
Swing baby swing youre playing with my can  
And it feels right  
Jump baby jump Im one step behind  
And its alright  
You got one mile to go and your tank is still full  
And you dont stop no you dont stop  
  
Chorus  
You say hold on tight for the ride  
Ya youre my destination  
And you rock me all night long  
Yeah you push me all night long  
Yeah you love me all night long  
You rock me all night long  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Come baby come you got me blowing up  
And it feels right  
Slide baby slide youre not the girl  
To put up a stop sign  
A bullet to my head and theyre driving me insane  
And they dont stop  
  
Chorus  
  
Live baby live there for today  
Fly baby fly lets get away  
I dont care what they think what they say  
And you know yeah you know  
  
That you rock me  
Yeah you rock me oh yeah  
De de de de rock me all night long  
Yeah you push me all night long  
Yeah you love me all night long  
You rock me all night long x 3
