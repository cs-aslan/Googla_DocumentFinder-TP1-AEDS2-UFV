Nightclubbing were nightclubbing  
Were whats happening  
Nightclubbing were nightclubbing  
Were an ice machine  
We see people brand new people  
Theyre something to see  
When were nightclubbing  
Brightwhite clubbing  
Oh isnt it wild  
Nightclubbing were nightclubbing  
Were walking through town  
Nightclubbing were nightclubbing  
We walk like a ghost  
We learn dances brand new dances  
Like the nuclear bomb  
When were nightclubbing  
Bright white clubbing  
Oh isnt it wild
