As I was walking down the street one day  
A man came up to me and asked me what the time was that was  
On my watch yeah  
And I said  
Does anybody really know what time it is  
I dont  
Does anybody really care  
Care  
If so I cant imagine why  
About time  
Weve all got time enough to cry  
Oh no no  
  
And I was walking down the street one day  
A pretty lady looked at me and said her diamond watch had  
Stopped cold dead  
And I said  
Does anybody really know what time it is  
I dont  
Does anybody really care  
Care  
If so I cant imagine why  
About time  
Weve all got time enough to cry  
Oh no no  
  
And I was walking down the street one day  
Being pushed and shoved by people trying to beat the clock  
Oh so I just dont know  
I just dont know  
And I said yes I said  
  
People runnin everywhere  
Dont know the way to go  
Dont know where I am  
Cant see past the next step  
Dont have to think past the last mile  
Have no time to look around  
Just run around run around and think why  
  
Does anybody really know what time it is  
I dont  
Does anybody really care  
Care  
If so I cant imagine why  
About time  
Weve all got time enough to die  
Oh no no
