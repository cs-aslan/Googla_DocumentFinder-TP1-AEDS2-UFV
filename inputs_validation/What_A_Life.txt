Love comes to everyone some are weak some strong  
Im not strong today  
Theyve took her back brought the curtain down  
What can I do now Im afraid to think about it  
  
Chorus  
What a life gets better as it goes along  
What a life gets better as it goes along  
Been in love been left standing till I said is that what I want  
Oh no theres got to be another smile on my face  
I dont care about the money I make or what it can do  
Im alive and thats whats important to me  
I dont need someone to tell me youll get along youll get along  
Who to love who to watch over me  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres an old man been calling me for a long time  
Im never able to get his face off my mind  
He always said to me take it easy take it easy  
And all the things you want will come easy will come easy  
What a life what a life  
  
Chorus  
  
He always said to me take it easy take it easy  
And all the things you want will come easy will come easy  
What a life what a life  
  
Chorus
