Dont touch  
  
Verse 1 Nicki Minaj  
Aint yelling cut when its shooting time  
Sign up its recruiting time  
Big wigs with a suit and tie  
And them big things got two inside  
Fuck worn with these ho niggas  
Dont do coke I dont blow nigga  
I dont tell niggas I show niggas  
And its never less than like 4 niggas  
4 wings and some french fries  
Hot sauce and ketchup nigga  
He telling and he hiding but real niggas will still catch a nigga  
I cop Raris dont test drive em  
Home theaters cant best buy em  
These niggas that I roll with dont let a single thing get by em  
King pins and them drug lords  
Chitown no gun lords  
Broke bitches that talk shit now them the bitches I stunt for  
Malcom X daughter came at me  
Looking niggas aint happy  
Rolled out with some Latin Kings and some eses and them plain khakis  
Smack bitches no smack cam  
Whole fist no back hand  
Pop pussy on a hand stand they sucking dick like a band camp  
Call Web and then call Nitty  
Queens niggas in its all hoodies  
Kidnapping and then rob niggas  
Call Drock for a biggie  
Pussy ass lil rap niggas

Hook Lil Herb

When its drama time  
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin  
Leave his loved ones all traumatized  
Onefifty Im really wit it  
Ill drop his ass and then forget it  
Im the man round my side of town  
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it  
  
Verse 2 Lil Herb  
Im a young nigga I be getting money  
Take your bitch from you  
And these niggas get no respect  
Imma stay 100 till Im 6 under  
Matter fact I gotta keep it 150  
For every nigga thats gon come with me  
Im on rock block with a new semi and a blue Bentley and do 160  
Smoke a lot a of weed

Got a 40 on me I dont trust any  
And if any nigga ever try to end me

You too busy hating you cant get no paper why are yall so silly  
Straight killers I can call so many  
I dont love no bitches but my mom my sister my gun and Nicki  
Im in Hollywood came from Kingston Food  
Shorties standing in the streets with tools  
Where Im from we dont play no games  
Aint no April fools you will make the news  
Where I hang we dont say no names  
If you talk to cop I stay away from you  
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations  
Youll be out the station in a day or two  
Dedication and a little patience  
Leave the domination on my way to greatness  
Dont put yourself up in a situation  
Putting my relations in your conversations  
Shoot a opposition with no hesitation  
You get my position nigga better take it  
Know some young bulls from a while back tryna leave the game but they never
made it

On a couple tracks I just never played it  
Pussy nigga you dont want war I got old clips bitch Im Baron Davis  
Pussy nigga you dont want war I got old clips bitch Im Baron Davis  
  
Hook Lil Herb  
Know a couple niggas thats down to ride for a homicide  
When its drama time  
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin  
Leave his loved ones all traumatized  
Onefifty Im really wit it  
Ill drop his ass and then forget it  
Im the man round my side of town  
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it
