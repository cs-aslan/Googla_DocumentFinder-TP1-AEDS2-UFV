Altamont now wont be the same  
When we see each other again  
If it all falls apart who is to blame  
  
Dont you think its time to get real  
I want to scream out the way I feel  
Im so tired of watching you bail  
  
Hey dont try to tell me its okay  
Dont turn me off and walk away  
Youve gotta say its straight  
  
Close the door  
But it wont go away  
Tell me that its at your control  
Im not waiting for you anymore  
  
Hey dont try to tell me its okay  
Dont turn me off and walk away  
Youve gotta say its straight  
  
Altamont Im on your side  
Believe it or not Im on your side  
Its so hard to be your friend sometimes  
  
Hey dont try to tell me its okay  
Dont turn me off and walk away  
Youve gotta say its straight  
  
Youd better say its straight
