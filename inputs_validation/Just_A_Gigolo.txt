Was in a Paris cafe that first I found him  
He was a Frenchman a hero of the war  
But war was over  
And heres how peace had crowned him  
A few cheap medals to wear and nothing more  
Now every night in the same cafe he shows up  
And as he strolls by ladies hear him say  
If you admire me hire me  
A gigolo who knew a better day  
  
Just a gigolo everywhere I go  
People know the part Im playing  
Paid for every dance  
Selling each romance  
Every night some heart betraying  
There will come a day  
Youth will pass away  
Then what will they say about me  
When the end comes I know  
Theyll say just a gigolo  
As life goes on without me  
  
Just a gigolo everywhere I go  
People know the part Im playing  
Paid for every dance  
Selling each romance  
Every night some heart betraying  
There will come a day  
Youth will pass away  
Then what will they say about me  
When the end comes I know  
Theyll say just a gigolo  
As life goes on without me
