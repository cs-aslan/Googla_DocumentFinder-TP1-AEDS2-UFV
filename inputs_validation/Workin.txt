Up every mornin before the sun  
Takin my lovin on the run  
Breakin my back till the day is done  
Im gonna punch that time clock and have some fun  
Aint no easy way to get myself out  
  
SoI keep on workin  
Like a workin man do  
I gotta buy my baby shoes  
I keep on workin  
Its the only thing to do  
I make my livin by the sweat of my brow  
Ohworkin just like youuh  
  
I was raised on the poor side of town  
I made my livin movin around  
I never let no one dog me down  
Oh I was taught to stand my ground  
Life was always changin  
Thats just the way it is  
  
SoI keep on workin  
Like a workin man do  
I got to buy my baby shoes  
I keep on workin  
Its the only thing to do  
I make my livin by the sweat of my brow  
Ohworkin just like youuh  
Oh oh oh ohI keep on workin  
  
OohI keep on workin  
Like a workin man do  
I got to buy my baby shoes  
I keep on workin  
Its the only thing to do  
I make my livin by the sweat of my brow  
  
OhI keep on workin  
Like a workin man do  
I need to buy my baby shoes  
I keep on workin  
Its the only thing to do  
I make my livin by the sweat of my brow
