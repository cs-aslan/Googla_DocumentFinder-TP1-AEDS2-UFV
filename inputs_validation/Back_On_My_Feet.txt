Im back on my feet again Im flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
When were up there flying  
And it all seems fine  
Half the time were trying  
Trying hard what a fool  
Saying anything to raze it all  
But Im back on my feet again Im flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
It is down to timing  
Get it right first time  
cause its so exiting  
Keeping on with the flow  
Giving everybody such a show  
But Im back on my feet again Im flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
Out on the street again Im riding high  
Worried bout anything that passes by  
Its not a nightmare or a dream  
Its not the first time that its been  
Im back on my feet again Im flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
So its time to work out  
What is going on  
So youd best not freak out  
Lose your mind lose your cool  
Its the quickest way to end it all  
But Im back on my feet again Im flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
Out on the street again Im riding high  
Worried bout anything that passes by  
Back on my feet again Im flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die
