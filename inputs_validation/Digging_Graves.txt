Lucy you stay herethe tomb is warm  
Why dont you play with the dools  
The dolls on the wall  
  
I am not the guy I used to be  
Not since he put me away  
I left half my brain behind back in that crazy place  
Does that meanthat I am insane  
Does that really meanthat I am to blameNO NO NO  
  
Is it true what they saylittle girls dont cry  
Is it true what they sayLucy look at me  
  
I am not the guy I used to be  
Not since he put me away  
I left half my brain behind back in that crazy place  
Does that meanthat I am insane  
Does that really meanthat I am to blameNO NO NO  
  
Into the night I go and you cant follow me  
Into the night I go and you cant follow me  
  
I will be your misery Im gonna be your HELL  
I will be your misery and I wish you well in HELL  
  
Im digging graves seven deadly tombs  
Im digging graves below that crazy moon  
  
I will be your misery Im gonna be your HELL  
I will be your misery and I wish you well in HELL

I left half my brain behind back in that crazy place  
Does that meanthat I am insane  
Does that really meanthat I am to blameNO NO NO  
  
Into the night I go and you cant follow me  
Into the night I go and you cant follow me
