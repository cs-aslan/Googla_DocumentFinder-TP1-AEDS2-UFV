Wont you give me all your limes  
And I will give you a reason  
Ill rub them on my body  
And smell like the West Indies  
  
And when Im feelin like the islands  
And Im giving you all my sighs  
I beg you when you love me  
Look me in the eyes  
  
Its your heat that makes me warm  
Makes me climb on you like a tree  
And I dont need no fancy dancing  
When you bend over me  
  
Well be like two lazy sunbathers  
Swaying palm trees against the sky  
And I beg you when you love me  
Look me in the eyes
