I cant reach behind your eyes  
You always look away  
You hide behind your alibis  
And change your mind  
from day to day  
If theres something I can do  
Then Ill be there  
Outside your broken world  
Youll see its me who cares  
Take me straight to your heart  
Cause this times real  
and real lasts forever  
I know where you are  
Cause you know  
Ive been there before  
Straight to your heart  
I watch you move  
and I watch you dance  
I watch you drift away  
And Id give anything for you  
And you know thats bad  
When it gets that way  
You cant go on like this  
And I dont want to fight again  
I dont give a damn anymore  
Right or wrong youre gonna let me in  
Straight to your heart  
Cause this times real and real lasts forever  
I know where you are  
Cause you know Ive been there before  
Straight to your heart this time this time  
Baby I know where you are  
Cause you know Ive been there before  
Then maybe Ill break down the walls  
And my love will go  
Straight to your heart  
Inside  
Take me inside yeah  
Straight to your heart  
Cause this times real and real lasts forever  
I know where you are  
Cause this time were goin all the way  
Straight to your heart  
This time  
This time  
Baby its straight  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
This time its straight to your heart  
Oh yeah  
Cause this time its real
