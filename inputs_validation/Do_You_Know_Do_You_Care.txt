You said you would you didnt and I want to know why  
And dont make no excuses  
You promised you promised you better explain  
Tho I dont know what the use is  
You said you could you couldnt now why did you lie  
You made it look so easy  
You did it why do it what was your point  
Laughing while you tease me  
  
Oh do you know and do you care  
  
I said I did I shouldnt cause the magic will go  
It happened once before  
Youll see it youll steal it and take it away  
And then come back for more  
Dont say you werent you were cause I saw you myself  
Its too late for your reason  
Youre lying youre lying youve done it this time  
Im sick of all the cheating  
  
Oh well do you know and do you care  
  
Cause I watch you  
Oo every day I watch you pass me by  
Ill get you  
Yes in the end Ill get you  
Just watch me try  
  
Oh you make it hard to be hard but Im trying my best  
Cause down inside Im burnin  
You want it you get it now take it and run  
Ill hide how much its hurtin  
  
Oh well do you know and do you care  
Oh well do you know and do you care
