We are assassins  
We are not evil  
We act with reason and heart  
Your heart  
  
We are not vicious  
Is that surprising  
Were so much larger than life  
  
I assassin I am  
I assassin I am  
  
I just arrived  
Something to fix  
This new depression  
  
We are not hunters  
We are just patient  
Well wait a lifetime for you  
Just you  
  
Ive never felt good  
Ive never felt bad  
Ive never felt much at all  
  
I assassin I am  
I assassin I am  
  
Theres nothing personal  
Just read the papers  
Thats real
