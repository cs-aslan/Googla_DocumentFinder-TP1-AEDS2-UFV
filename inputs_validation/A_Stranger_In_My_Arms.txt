Though you try you cant conceal it  
Love has only brought us storms  
I can see your eyes revealin  
Your a stranger in my arms  
Say goodbye to our romancing  
We have lost the flame that warms  
Though I hold you while were dancing  
Your a stranger in my arms  
Every story has an ending  
This is where our story ends  
Please dont hurt me by pretending  
For lovers never can be friends  
Through the years your love will haunt me  
And Ill dream about your charms  
Still I know youll never want me  
Your a stranger in my arms  
Every story has an ending  
This is where our story ends  
Please dont hurt me by pretending  
For lovers never can be friends  
Through the years your love will haunt me  
And Ill dream about your charms  
Still I know youll never want me  
Your a stranger in my arms
