Have you heard them talk about it  
You say theyre wrong but they know all about it  
Have you tried another story  
Were tired of all the lies and allegories  
  
Every single things your fault  
There you are not really jaded  
Youve learned to live with being underrated  
But they dont know just what youre made of  
Because of them who knows how you will end up  
  
Every single things your fault  
With you its always something  
When everyones the same  
Dont you try to blame me
