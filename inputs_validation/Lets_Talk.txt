I saw you coming  
I called your name  
You couldnt hear me  
You walked on by  
  
Somethings changed  
Everythings rearranged  
You didnt see me  
You didnt answer  
  
I was invisible to your cause  
I tried to tell you  
I was your friend  
You just kept walking  
Like it was the end  
  
Lets talk  
Tell me all about it  
Lets talk  
What could it hurt now  
Lets talk  
Wont you tell me what is wrong yeah  
Lets talk  
We can work it out somehow  
  
I saw you coming  
You wore a wig  
I wanted to laugh  
But you looked so serious  
  
I say lets talk  
And you just walk  
  
How was I  
To approach you  
You really left no room  
  
Run out in the crowd  
If you really want to  
But why not try  
For something new
