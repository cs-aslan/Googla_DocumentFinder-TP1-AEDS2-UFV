Well I dont care whats wrong or right  
When youre not there by my side  
I just wonder what to do  
Well if I cant have you  
And I think about nothing much at all  
Nothing but you and me  
And Im pleading cant we just be  
The way that we used to be  
Honey wake up wont you please come back to me  
Honey think of think of the way things used to be  
If we make up well I wont ever be that bad  
Honey wake up and give me just one more chance just one more chance  
Well I dont know how I lost control  
But I now know that its true  
That the hurt I aimed at me misfired  
And came back to hurt you  
Ive been wondering where you are tonight  
And wondering where youve been  
Now Ill walk these lonely streets awhile  
And think about it again  
Honey wake up wont you please come back to me  
Honey think of think of the way things used to be  
If we make up well I wont ever be that bad  
Honey wake up and give me just one more chance just one more chance  
What can I do What can I say  
Honey wake up wont you please come back to me  
Honey think of think of the way things used to be  
If we make up well I wont ever be that bad  
Honey wake up and give me just one more chance just one more chance  
I wont ever be that bad wont you please come back to me  
What can I do What can I say
