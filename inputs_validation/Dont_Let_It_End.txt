What can I do  
Pictures of you still make me cry  
Trying to live without your love  
Its so hard to do  
Some nights Ill wake up  
Ill look at your pillow  
Hoping that Ill see you there  
But I get up each day not much to say  
Ive nowhere to go  
Loneliness fills me up inside  
Cause Im missing you  
So if youll give us a chance to remember  
The love we had once together  
Wait and see  
Time is all that we really need  
Im praying you wont say no  
I mean to tell you  
  
Dont let it end  
Baby we could have so much more  
Dont let it end  
Honey please dont walk out that door  
  
Im telling you baby I made my mistakes  
But Ill make you this promise to do what it takes  
Ill be there to protect you and hold you tight  
You got my lovin baby every single night  
  
Dont let it end  
Im begging you dont let it end this way  
Dont let it end  
Im begging you dont let it end this way  
  
Dont let it end  
Baby we could have so much more  
Dont let it end  
Honey please dont walk out that door  
Dont let it end  
Im begging you dont let it end this way  
Dont let it end  
Im begging you dont let it end this way no no no  
No no no  
  
What will I do  
If you say were through  
I need you to stay honey  
Dont let it end this way
