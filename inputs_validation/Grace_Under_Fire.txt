Ive seen them run Ive seen them broken  
Ive seen them fold without a word even spoken  
Oh all it takes is a little fire  
Well they watch your eyes they learn your weakness  
They turn it up and you know  
The lean is on the lean is on  
Oh sooner or later youre gonna catch heat  
Theres no use running away  
Everything hurries to eat or be eaten they say  
  
Oh Papa was right nothing rates higher  
The coolest of cool is grace under fire  
  
Back in the shadows theres the law of the city  
Work on the one who shows the first sign of pity  
I know I know  
Well they knock on your door and they call out your number  
And your legs wont move and you heart starts running  
Youll know youll know  
  
Oh Papa was right nothing rates higher  
The coolest of cool is grace under fire  
  
Youve got to be the diamond youve got to be the steel  
The lucky have ice in their veins  
They laugh at the devil  
And burn like a torch in the rain  
  
Oh The Jesus was cool no one bet higher  
The measure of heart is grace under fire
