Let the stars fade and fall  
And I wont care at all  
As long as I have you  
  
Every kiss brings a thrill  
And I know that it will  
As long as I have you  
  
Lets think of the future  
Forget the past  
Youre not my first love  
But youre my last  
Take the love that I bring  
Then Ill have everything  
As long as I have you  
  
Lets think of the future  
Forget the past  
Youre not my first love  
But youre my last  
Take the love that I bring  
Then Ill have everything  
As long as I have you  
  
As long as long as I have you
