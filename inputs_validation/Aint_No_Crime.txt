You got to open your eyes in the morning  
Nine oclock comin without any warnin  
And you gotta get ready to go  
You say you went out late last evenin  
Did a lot of drinkin  
Come home stinkin  
And you went and fell asleep on the floor  
And then your lady comes and finds you asleepin  
Starts in to weepin bout the hours you been keepin  
And you better get your ass out the door  
  
Aint no crime  
Say everybody gets that way some time  
Aint no crime  
You know its good to get it on to get a load off your mind  
Oh no it aint no crime Oh  
  
You got to open your eyes in the morning  
Nine oclock comin with out any warnin  
And you gotta get ready to go  
Well now you tell me you love somebody  
And youll love em forever  
You may love em forever  
But you wont like em all of the time  
Well now you tell me you need somebody for the rest of your life  
You might have somebody  
But you wont want em everyday  
  
Aint no crime  
Say evrybody gets that way some time  
Aint no crime  
Well its just human nature  
Happens all the time  
Oh no it aint no crime Oh  
  
And just as surely as the wind keeps blowin  
The grass keeps growin  
You gotta keep goin  
And the Lord have mercy on your soul  
La la la la
