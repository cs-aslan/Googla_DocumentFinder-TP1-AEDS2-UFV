Why do people cry  
When they hear the word goodbye  
In a love song  
Tears are sure to fall  
When you know they gave it all  
In a love song  
Somehow two lovers get a chance  
At a beautiful romance  
And you wish it could be you  
  
Cause everybodys needing  
What the singers all are singing  
In a love song  
  
It can tear you apart  
Cause a word can break a heart  
In a love song  
They say all the things you feel  
And they make it sound so real  
In a love song  
It seems that everything they say  
Is said in such a way  
That we believe its true  
  
Cause everybodys needing  
What the singers all are singing  
In a love song  
  
Each of us know  
Theres no guarantee  
Well ever find love  
And in the songs that we share  
The heartache is there  
To remind us  
New love brings a thrill  
And we know it always will  
In a love song  
  
Happiness can leave  
But it helps if we believe  
In a love song  
Theres a part of you and me  
In every memory  
That tells us who we are  
  
And everybodys needing  
What the singers all are singing  
In a love song
