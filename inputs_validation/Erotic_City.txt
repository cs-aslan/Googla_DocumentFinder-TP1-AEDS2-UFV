Erotic City  
Erotic City  
  
All of my purple life  
Ive been looking for a dame  
That would want to be my wife  
That was my intention babe  
  
If we cannot make babies maybe we can make some time  
Thoughts of pretty you and me Erotic City come alive  
We can funk until the dawn making love til cherrys gone  
Erotic City cant you see thoughts of pretty you and me  
  
Every time I comb my hair  
Thoughts of you get in my eyes  
Youre a sinner I dont care  
I just want your creamy thighs  
  
If we cannot make babies maybe we can make some time  
Thoughts of pretty you and me Erotic City come alive  
We can funk until the dawn making love til cherrys gone  
Erotic City cant you see thoughts of pretty you and me  
  
All of my hangups are gone  
How I wish you felt the same  
We can funk until the dawn Til the dawn Until the dawn  
How I wish you were my dame Baby wont you call my name  
  
If we cannot make babies maybe we can make some time  
Thoughts of pretty you and me Erotic City come alive  
We can funk until the dawn making love til cherrys gone  
Erotic City cant you see thoughts of pretty you and me  
  
Baby youre so creamy  
  
If we cannot make babies maybe we can make some time  
Thoughts of pretty you and me Erotic City come alive  
We can funk until the dawn making love til cherrys gone Til the dawn  
Erotic City cant you see thoughts of pretty you and me  
  
If we cannot make babies maybe we can make some time You and me  
Some time some time some time Erotic City  
If we cannot make babies maybe we can make some time  
Thoughts of pretty you and me Erotic City come alive  
  
We can funk until the dawn making love til cherrys gone Come alive  
Erotic City cant you see thoughts of pretty you and me  
We can funk until the dawn making love til cherrys gone  
Erotic City
