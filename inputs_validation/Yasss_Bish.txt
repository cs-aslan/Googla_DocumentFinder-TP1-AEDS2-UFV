Me Im just me  
Me Im just real  
Me Im that bitch  
That be footing the bill  
Only a real nigga could cop a feel  
Credit Card blacker than that nigga Seal  
24 million I brokered a deal  
Jewish my lawyer he Kosher than Dill  
And I am still poppin them pills  
I dont give a fuck how you bitches feel  
Jealousy jealousy thats how you feel  
I am still living in Beverly Hills  
Tell em to chill  
Tell em to chill  
Tell all them people my wrists is on chill  
Bitches cant beat me they aint got the skill  
Eye of the tiger they aint got the kill  
Look up to Jada I love her and Will  
Bitches my sons but they aint in my will  
The fuck be wrong with these bitches  
The fuck be wrong with these niggas

Tell em give a bad bitch a proper due  
What they say aint never what they gon do  
It say 250 on that fucking sticker  
Pink Print hot should be in some slippers  
  
I dont fuck with you niggas  
I own the Clippers  
I own some homes  
I own my own liquor  
Bitches is bitter  
My titties is bigger  
You bitches my sons I need a babysitter  
I am the dream on the dream team  
I am Olajuwon I am Hakeem  
Abdul Jabbar I am Kareem  
I am the Queen because Im a machine  
You not ready you not seasoned  
Go against me I say Fix it Jesus  
Thinking they hot talk shit a lot  
But when they shit drop I say Fix it Jesus  
Oh your shit aint gold  
Word to my bank roll  
Real niggas aint sold  
Dropping my single in two weeks  
The Pink Print album a movie  
Bitches be thinkin they hot  
But these bitches be using that term so loosely
