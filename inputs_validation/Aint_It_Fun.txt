Aint it fun when youre always on the run  
Aint it fun when youre friends despise what you become  
Aint it fun when you get so high well that you you just cant come  
Aint it fun when you know that you gonna die young  
  
Its such fun good fun such fun such fun aah such fun  
Such fun such fun aah yeah fun such fun such  
  
Aint it fun when youre taking care of number one  
Oh aint it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun  
Aint it fun when you just cant seem to find your tongue  
Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung  
  
Its such fun ah  
  
Well so good to me they spit right in my face  
And I didnt even feel it it was such a disgrace  
I punched my fist right through the glass  
And I didnt even feel it it happened so fast  
Such fun such fun such fun  
Ah such fun such fun such fun  
Ah such fun such fun such fun  
Ah such fun such fun such  
  
Aint it fun when you tell her shes just a cunt  
Aint it fun when you she splits and leaves you on the bum  
Well aint it fun when youve broken up every band that youve ever begun  
Aint it fun when you know that youre gonna die young  
  
Its such fun  
Such fun such fun such fun  
Ah such fun such fun such fun  
Ah such fun such fun such fun  
Such fun such fun such fun  
Such fun such fun such fun  
Such fun
