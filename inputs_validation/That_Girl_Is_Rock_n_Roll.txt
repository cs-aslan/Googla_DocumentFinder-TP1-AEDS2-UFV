She dresses in leather  
She isnt too together  
She looks then she lowers her eyes at me  
  
She smokes cigarettes  
She likes to get wet  
And shes about a woman as a woman can be I said  
  
That girl is rock n roll  
She got the cutest figure  
I think its gettin bigger  
Shes about hangin out over me  
  
She feels just right  
In the middle of the night  
N shes about a woman as a woman can be I said  
  
That girl is rock n roll
