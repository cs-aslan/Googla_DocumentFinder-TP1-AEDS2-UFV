Chorus  
I need some weed now I need some weed now  
Somebody call the weed man Somebody call the weed man  
Im tryna get high Im tryna get high tryna get high  
I need some weed now  
Somebody call the weed man  
Im tryna get high Im tryna get high tryna get high  
  
Woke up at the Ritz Carlton damn sun in my face  
Racks in my jeans gun still on my waist  
And I aint leaving shit in my cup thats such a waste  
You know Im sipping on that straight like that oh what a a taste  
Tip the valet a hundred I love to stunt  
Pulled up in that mean machine leave it up front  
This passed out thing beside me I barely know her  
But you can just imagine the shit Im bout to show her  
Snow way them streets too cold them bitches polar  
Expectations out of this world Im thinking solar  
Thats why I do it for that Kalamazoo  
And then NOLA thats what happens  
When you learn to mix it with that soda  
  
Chorus  
  
I wake up just to bake up get my cake up and rise up  
Motivating factors that Im liver than most  
I boast and bang pour some pain in that thing  
Put some purple rain on your brain unravel the flame  
Maintain my fame get you new pictures  
Just to put in your frame  
We in the hood blowing kush with The Game  
Foot in the cane walking just like Im an Indian chief  
With no beef real brief with a wreath  
You may think its a leaf  
With the residue stuck deep down in your teeth  
When you smoking with the dogg shit you might not eat  
Its OK cause we lay in the cut on the hill on the dip  
With a fit on Crip dont trip  
  
Chorus  
  
The coffee that I had it was good to the last drop  
But now Im fresh out and you know it dont stop  
So please man somebody call the weed man  
Id call mine but hes been low on herb even  
Im fiending daydreaming of the times when I had  
Much mota many different kinds in the bag  
I fell hard for the funk I cant fake the love  
I smoke dro good Reggie smoke shake to nugs  
If its weed then Im with it  
You got a paper Then twist it You got a bowl Fill it  
Got a blunt Let me split it down the gut  
But shit for what Cause aint no green on the scene  
Man what the fuck
