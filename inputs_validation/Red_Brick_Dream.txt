Red brick dream  
Windows scream  
As the rusting north star shines above  
And drops its iron beams  
Crashing down upon the rooves of swindon town  
  
I heard the engines dying breath  
Castles and kings all starved to death  
I dropped the coronation cup  
Sshh please dont wake them up from  
Red brick dream  
  
Red brick dream  
Buttons gleam  
By the light of the furnace pouring  
Molten memories  
Splashing down upon the rooves of swindon town  
  
The men of muscle piston rods  
Who forged the horses of the gods  
The made the town a set of chains  
And sleeping it remains in  
Red brick dream
