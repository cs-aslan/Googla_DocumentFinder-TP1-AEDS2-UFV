You squirt out red and turn so yellow  
And then you made me kill my own  
Im not afraid  
Coming coming  
But Im afraid  
  
Blood in your eyes again  
Bravery the face of man  
Blood on your mind again  
Chivalry the face of man  
Blood in your lies  
Enemy the face of man  
Blood in your eyes again  
  
Is this the only path of glory If so then I wont go alone  
Follow the trail  
Running Follow the trail  
  
Im not afraid  
But Im afraid
