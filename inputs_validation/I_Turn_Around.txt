Sometimes I try so hard to resist you say you will and I say you wont  
Sometimes I think that you dont exsist and sometimes you dont  
Pinch me cause I dont believe it  
Kiss me cause it feels like a hit  
I turn around and youre not there  
Why must it always be the less I see of you the more I care  
Youre determined to make me as miserable as you can  
Youre like Harry Houdini or the Invisible Man  
Count 10 and then down again  
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  
Doing everything they say shouldnt be done  
More fun than you can have with your clothes on  
Pinch me cause I dont believe it  
Kiss me cause it feels like a hit  
I turn around and youre not there  
Why must it always be the less I see of you the more I care  
Youre determined to make me as miserable as you can  
Youre like Harry Houdini or the Invisible Man  
I turn around and youre not there  
Why must it always be the less I see of you the more I care  
The less I see of you the more I care  
The less I see of you the more I care
