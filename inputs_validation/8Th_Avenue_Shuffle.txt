Hey hey honey whats on your mind  
Well you said that sleepin with a poor bands not your style  
Aint that just a little unkind  
Hey Marlon Brando what would you do in a spot like this  
I dont play as your pawn tonight  
  
Doin the New York Hustle with a hundred dollar miss  
Summer night in the city  
New York girls they always make you feel so fine  
Theres music and I can always hear it playin  
New York Nights and theres music in the streets  
  
A doin the Eighth Avenue Shuffle on a Friday afternoon  
With the hum of a thousand engines  
Singin that old familiar tune  
And now yakety yak and dont talk back  
When a guy lay me down with my Pontiac  
Tell those high school queens of mine that the  
Prom was for your monkey shine  
  
Try n a catch a cab in New York City  
New York girls are oh so pretty  
Try n a catch a cab in New York City  
New York girls make you feel so fine  
Try n a catch a cab in New York City  
New York girls are oh so pretty  
Try n a catch a cab in New York City  
Music in the streets  
  
Another night another town  
Im out on the road and thers no one around  
And its rainin yeah its rainin  
Silence is all around  
Its cold and lonely oh darlin if only I could feel it  
Oh can you feel it  
  
Eighth Avenue Shuffle on a Friday afternoon  
With the hum of a thousand engines  
Singin that old familiar tune  
Hey Marlon Brando do you agree it feels so fine  
Doin the New York Hustle  
These girls are doin the monkey shine  
  
Summer night in the city  
New York girls they always make you feel so fine  
Theres music and I can always hear it playin  
New York Nights and theres music in the streets
