I was handed down the looks of a man with a broken nose  
Thats the way our family was I suppose  
But at least you gave me deeply profound  
As we lay and chatted late upon the cricket ground  
You didnt have to love me  
Where others got rid  
You didnt have to treat me like a very good friend  
But Im glad that you did  
One thing I never said to you  
And one thing I never can  
Amongst the false applause and the deafening cheers  
Im your No 1 fan  
Im your No 1 fan  
Im the richly blessed daughter of a mother with tattooed arms  
Thats the way my family life life was charmed  
But at least it gave me mental grace  
And a thought at the pit on my mind and a smile on my face  
You didnt have to listen  
To a word that Id said  
You didnt have to tell me all those silly old jokes  
For every tear that I shed  
Every tear that I shed  
cause one thing I never said to you  
And one thing I never can  
Amongst the false applause and the deafening cheers  
Im your No 1 fan  
Im your No 1 fan  
I was handed down a bike with a crooked old wheel  
But I rode it on a million lanes the way that you made me feel  
But at least we thought about it so long and hard  
As we sat upon our mother in the graveyard  
And you dont have to listen  
To a word in this song  
Your picture hangs the same and in the same old place  
Even though that youve gone  
Even though that youve gone  
Cos one thing I never said to you  
And one thing I never can  
Amongst the false applause and the deafening cheers  
Im your No 1 fan  
Im your No 1 fan  
Yes I am  
Im your No 1 fan
