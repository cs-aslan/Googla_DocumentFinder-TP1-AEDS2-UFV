All those dreams and broken glass  
Swept down the sewer with the rest of the trash  
Never to be seen again  
Now youre makin a home in a garbage can  
  
But heres a little story that I lived to tell  
Hello from the gutter  
Hello from our little hell  
  
Wasted days wasted nights  
Hypnotized by the city lights  
Another king another queen  
Livin in the shadows so they cant be seen  
Remember all the world lies at your feet  
And the big apples rotten  
Rotten in the heat  
  
Hello Hello  
Hello from the gutter  
Hello Hello  
  
Hello from the gutter  
Hello Hello  
Hello from the gutter  
Hello Hello  
Hello from the gutter  
  
Gutter child sweet sixteen  
Broadway stars that have never been  
All those dreams and broken glass  
Swept down the sewer with the rest of the trash  
  
Well heres a little story that we lived to tell  
Hello from the gutter  
Hello from our little hell  
  
Hello from the gutter  
Hello from the gutter Hey  
  
Welcome the the gutter  
Weve been expecting you
