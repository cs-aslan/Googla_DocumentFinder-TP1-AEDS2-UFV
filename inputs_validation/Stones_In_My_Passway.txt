I got stones in my passway  
And my road seem dark as night  
I got stones in my passway  
And my road seem dark as night  
I have pains in my hearts  
They have taken my appetite  
I have a bird to whistle  
  
And I have a bird to sing  
Have a bird to whistle  
And I have a bird to sing  
I got a woman that Im lovin  
Boy she dont mean a thing  
My enemies have betrayed me  
  
Have overtaken poor Bob at last  
My enemies have betrayed me  
Have overtaken poor Bob at last  
An eres one thing certainly  
They have stones all in my pass  
Now you tryin to take my life  
  
And all my lovin too  
You laid a passway for me  
Now what are you trying to do  
Im cryin please  
Pleaease let us be friends  
And when you hear me howlin in my passway rider  
Pleaease open your door and let me in  
I got three legs to truck home  
  
Boys please dont block my road  
I got three legs to truck home  
Boys please dont block my road  
Ive been feelin ashamed bout my rider  
Babe Im booked and I got to go
