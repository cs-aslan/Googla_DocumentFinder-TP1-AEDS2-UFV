Ive spent my life waiting  
For that famous final scene  
I believe you know the one  
When she falls in love with me  
  
As for you youve been fakin your smile  
Fillin your time  
On small talk  
And cheap wine  
Knowing in your heart there was someplace  
That youd rather be  
  
So right or wrong  
I wrote you this song  
To tell you how I feel  
  
Dont put up no fight  
You just turn off the lights  
Walk over here to me  
  
Chorus  
And lay your body down on me  
Down on me tonight oh yeah  
Oh let your tears fall down on me  
Down on me tonight oh yeah  
  
As for me Ive lied to denied to  
Fight with and tried to  
Apologize for all my ways  
To all the women who were fool enough to fall  
In love with me  
  
You played your role  
Like a movie  
Got your lines for who is  
Who was who would be  
Somehow you lost track  
While real love slipped away yeah  
  
So for tonight just turn off the lights  
And let those real feelings show  
Theres no wrong or right  
But until you try  
Youre never gonna know  
  
Chorus  
  
Before you was mine  
I was so lonely  
Aint it a shame  
Your heart must feel pain  
Before you get back on your feet again  
  
So lets draw the blinds  
Forget wasted time  
And let them old demons die  
Take a hold of my hand  
Then youd understand  
Why loves worth one more try  
  
Chorus
