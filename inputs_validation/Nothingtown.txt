Lets make this complicated  
Thinking is overrated  
Were busting out  
Of this shitty little town  
  
Green grass and colored lenses  
Tear down these picket fences  
Burn in our beds  
While the city lies sleeping  
  
Why oh why  
Are we starting up and going down  
My oh my  
Just the two of us in Nothingtown  
Our superhero play  
Well leave this town today  
Hold on tighter  
With my lighter  
Shining through  
  
These city streets are burning  
Rose red your wheels are turning  
Make me believe  
Someday we could really leave  
  
Blindfold a new direction  
Stop asking better questions  
Dont figure out  
That were never getting out  
  
Why oh why  
Are we starting up and going down  
My oh my  
Just the two of us in Nothingtown  
Our superhero play  
Well leave this town today  
And Ill row it if you steer it  
Ill yell until you hear it  
Hold on tighter  
With my lighter  
Shining through  
  
Why oh why  
Are we starting up and going down  
My oh my  
Just the two of us in Nothingtown  
Our superhero play  
Our dreams get in the way  
And Ill row it if you steer it  
Ill yell until you hear it  
Hold on tighter  
With my lighter  
Shining through  
  
Still stuck in Nothingtown  
Still stuck in Nothingtown  
Come on lets go
