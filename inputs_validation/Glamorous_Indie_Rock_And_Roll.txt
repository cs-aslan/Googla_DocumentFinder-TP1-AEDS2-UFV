Glamorous  
Indie rocknroll is what I want  
Its in my soul its what I need  
Indie rocknroll its time  
Two of us  
Flipping through a thrift store magazine  
She plays the drums Im on tambourine  
Bet your bottom dollar on me  
  
Its indie rocknroll for me  
Its indie rocknroll for me  
Its all I need  
Its indie rocknroll for me  
  
In a clutch  
Im talking every word for all the boys  
Electric girls with worn down toys  
Make it up break it up what do you care  
Oh what do you care  
  
I take my twist with a shout  
A coffee shop with a cause then Ill freak you out  
No sex no drugs no rock no roll  
  
When it comes today  
  
Stay if you wanna love me stay  
Oh dont be shy lets cause a scene  
Like lovers do on silver screens  
Lets make it yeah well cause a scene  
  
Its indie rocknroll for me  
Its indie rocknroll for me  
Its all I need  
Its indie rocknroll for me  
  
In a clutch  
Im talking every word for all the boys  
Its all I need  
Make it up break it up what do you care  
Its indie rocknroll for me  
  
Two of us flipping through a thrift store magazine  
Its all I need  
Makin up breakin up what do you care  
Its indie rocknroll for me
