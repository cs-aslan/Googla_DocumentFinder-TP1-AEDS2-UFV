Oh my this beat in my heart  
Just in the dark but youre lightning my eyes  
Said I watch you ignite in fire  
And you got a power  
Youre damn right  
This life I did  
Not gonna make it if you dont connect tonight right  
  
Stars tried all night  
Body moves lightweight  
Youre reaching my heart fast  
Youre searching for something  
Thats just how electricity behaves  
Now I need it in somewhere  
The others dont last  
Wait a minute Im feeling charged  
Glow as you glow in the dark  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady uuh  
Wait a minute Im to the drops  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady  
  
Love wont die  
So what youre giving me girl  
That energy giving  
You know how it goes sometimes  
Love wont die  
Love wont die  
But if you need it girl  
I got energy come and get it  
Sometimes I need to give a little  
Get a little forget a little  
We could meet any place  
I You got the power  
Baby you know if you ever go  
And youre back into the light  
  
Stars tried all night  
Body moves lightweight  
Youre reaching my heart fast  
Youre searching for something  
Thats just how electricity behaves  
And Ive been needing it so bad  
The others dont last  
Wait a minute Im feeling charged  
I shouldve known as you glow in the dark  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady uuh  
Wait a minute Im to the drops  
I feel it on we get closer till we shock  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady  
  
Wait a minute Im feeling charged  
I shouldve known as you glow in the dark  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady uuh  
Wait a minute Im to the drops  
I feel it on we get closer till we shock  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady
