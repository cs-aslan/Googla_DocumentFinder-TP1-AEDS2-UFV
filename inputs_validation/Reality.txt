For me its a beach bar  
Or on a boat underneath the stars  
Or with my band up on a stage  
For a while everythings okay  
  
For some its a fast car  
Moonshine in a mason jar  
And everybody has their way  
Somehow to escape  
  
Reality yeah sometimes life  
Aint all that its cracked up to be  
So lets take a chance and live this fantasy  
Cause everybody needs to break free from reality  
  
Yeah some days its a bitch its a bummer  
We need a rock and roll show in the summer  
To let the music take us away  
Take our minds to a better place  
  
Where we feel that sense of freedom  
Leave our worries behind we dont need em  
All we need is a sunny day and an old tailgate  
And well escape  
  
Reality yeah sometimes life  
Aint all that its cracked up to be  
So lets take a chance and live this fantasy  
Cause everybody needs to break free from reality  
  
Everybody raise your hands and voice tonight  
Set your soul free lets take a carpet ride  
Well leave it all behind  
  
Reality yeah sometimes life  
Aint all that its cracked up to be  
So lets take a chance and live this fantasy  
Cause everybody needs to break free from reality  
  
Come on everybody break free  
Come on everybody break free
