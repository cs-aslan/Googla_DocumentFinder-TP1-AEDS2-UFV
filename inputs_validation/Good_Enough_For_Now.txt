Oh I couldnt live a single day without you  
Actually on second thought well I suppose I could  
Anyway what Im trying to say is honey youre the greatest  
Well at any rate I guess youre pretty good  
Now it seems to me Im relatively lucky  
I know I probably couldnt ask for too much more  
I honestly can say youre an aboveaverage lady  
Youre almost just what Ive been looking for  
Youre sort of everything Ive ever wanted  
Youre not perfect but I love you anyhow  
Youre the woman that Ive always dreamed off  
Well not really but youre good enough for now  
Youre pretty close to what Ive always hoped for  
Thats why my love for you is fairly strong  
And I swear Im never gonna leave you darlin  
At least til something better comes along  
Cause youre sort of everything Ive ever wanted  
Youre not perfect but I love you anyhow  
Youre the woman that Ive always dreamed off  
Well not really but youre good enough for now  
No not really but youre good enough for now
