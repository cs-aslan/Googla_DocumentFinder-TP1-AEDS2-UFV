Walking down this hill tonight  
I had a thought all to myself  
As I contemplated the moonlight  
  
Weve got it all weve got it made  
I dont know how I got here  
But Im holding on for the crash  
  
Pull myself out of the moon  
I know Ill never go there but  
Its shining down from up on high  
We got it made we got it made  
I dont know what we gotta make  
Sooner or later we die  
  
Were apart go to pieces  
While I go to sleep  
  
Look into my heart oh baby  
Dont become a part of the past  
You can be a part of the key  
  
Dont turn away dont run away  
Dont leave me hanging by a thread  
Shine a little love down on me  
  
Were in love make your peace  
Wasting time is all you need  
  
Walking down this hill tonight  
I had a thought it was my own  
Moon swept by the clouds and save the starlight  
Or shall I be or shall I not be  
I dont know I just dont  
Feel like it tonight
