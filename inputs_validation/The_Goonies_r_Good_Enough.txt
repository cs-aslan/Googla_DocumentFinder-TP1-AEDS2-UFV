Here we are  
Hanging onto strains of greed and blues  
Break the chain then we break down  
Oh its not real if you dont feel it  
Unspoken expectations  
Ideals you used to play with  
Theyve finally taken shape for us  
  
Whats good enough for you  
Is good enough for me  
Its good enough  
Its good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Now youll say  
Youre startin to feel the push and pull  
Of what could be and never can  
You mirror me stumblin through those  
  
Old fashioned superstitions  
I find too hard to break  
Oh maybe youre out of place  
  
Whats good enough for you  
Is good enough for me  
Its good enough  
Its good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
good enough for you  
Is good enough for me  
Its good its good enough  
Its good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Old fashioned superstitions  
I find too hard to break  
Oh maybe youre out of place  
  
Whats good enough for you  
Is good enough for me  
Its good enough  
Its good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
good enough for you  
Is good enough for me  
Its good its good enough  
Its good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
