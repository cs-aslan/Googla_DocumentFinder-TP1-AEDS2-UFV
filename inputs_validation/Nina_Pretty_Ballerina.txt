Every day in the morning on her way to the office  
You can see as she catches a train  
Just a face among a million faces  
Just another woman with no name  
Not the girl youd remember but shes still something special  
If you knew her I am sure youd agree  
Cause I know shes got a little secret  
Friday evening she turns out to be  
  
Nina pretty ballerina now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment shes waited for  
Just like Cinderella just like Cinderella  
Nina pretty ballerina who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play  
But she knows the fun would go away  
If she would play it every day  
  
So shes back every morning to her work at the office  
And another week to live in a dream  
And another row of early mornings  
In an almost neverending stream  
Doesnt talk very often kind of shy and uncertain  
Everybody seems to think shes a bore  
But they wouldnt know her little secret  
What her Friday night would have in store  
  
Nina pretty ballerina now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment shes waited for  
Just like Cinderella just like Cinderella  
Nina pretty ballerina who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play  
She would like to play it every day  
  
Nina pretty ballerina now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment shes waited for  
Just like Cinderella just like Cinderella  
Nina pretty ballerina who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play
