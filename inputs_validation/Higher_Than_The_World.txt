Well Im higher than the world  
And Im livin in my dreams  
Ill make it better than it seems  
Today  
  
And Im higher than a cloud  
And Im living in the sound  
Ill make it better than it seems  
Today  
  
Higher than the world  
But my head is in a swirl  
I gotta give a life a whirl  
Today  
  
Higher than the clouds  
Wrapped up in the sound  
Ill make it better all around  
Today  
  
Higher than the world  
But my head is in a swirl  
I gotta give a life a whirl  
Today  
  
Higher in my mind  
Im going leave these blues behind  
And Ill find what I find  
Today  
  
Cause Im higher than the world  
And Im wrapped up in my dreams  
Ill make it better than it seems  
Today  
  
Yes Im higher than the world  
And Im livin in my mind  
I got to hold on to what I find  
Today  
  
Just a little bit higher  
Little bit higher
