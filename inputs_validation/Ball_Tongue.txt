There you are alone  
With no hope of ever having something to be proud of  
Something earned without begging  
Yes I know youre a person a person close to me  
Who do you think you are What more do you want from me  
Ball Tongue  
  
Why are you at home buried in your self pity  
Why do you insist on living the lifeling out of me  
Yes I know youre the person the person that took down me  
Does it give you the right to expect your life from balls around me  
Ball Tongue  
  
You were my bride when does our friendship end  
Im not gonna give in  
You were my bride when does our friendship end  
Im not gonna give in  
How can you fuckn doubt me but not again  
  
Ball Tongue  
Youre a psychofuck  
Ball Tongue
