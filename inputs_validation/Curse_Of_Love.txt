Ive seen those signs a million times  
The chill that clouds your eyes  
The light that shines black as a coal  
Deep down in the mind  
And Im hungry and Im dying of thirst  
Just suffering from a lovers curse  
Ill turn to stone let the rivers flow  
And wash me to the sea  
  
The curse of love is hanging over me  
Ive walked the line stood by your side  
Ive kept you company  
And all those times you felt like crying  
Ive held you close to me  
Now someones put a spell on me  
All my worst dreams are coming true  
Ill turn to stone let the rivers flow  
And wash me to the sea  
  
The curse of love is hanging over me  
The curse of love is hanging  
Over me  
  
Around the tent the storm was raging  
The gypsys eyes were wild and blazing  
Should have listened when she said  
Youd slip away from me  
  
The bottles empty Ive drunk it dry  
And still I feel the pain  
Well all we had is lost now  
Like teardrops in the rain  
The night is long Im tired and weary  
But I dont know where this road will lead me  
Ill turn to stone let the rivers flow  
And wash me to the sea  
  
The curse of love is hanging over me  
The curse of love is hanging  
Over me
