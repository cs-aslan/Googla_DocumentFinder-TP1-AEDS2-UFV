Men made out of monkeys  
Men made into mice  
Happy days are here again  
And all the drinks half price  
A girl with a trick and a man with a calling  
  
Trying to make a living out of your downfalling  
Trying to make a living out of anything at all  
Didnt they teach you anything except how to be cruel  
In that charm school  
  
You and I as lovers  
Were nothing but a farce  
Trying to make a silk purse  
Out of a sows arse  
Saying why dont you watch me  
Hardly speaking sotto voce  
  
Ive got a notion  
Ive got an angle  
Take your dreams and promises  
And put them through the mangle  
They say its hell to finance too  
And I just want to romance you  
  
In this perpetual nightclub  
Ill be yours eternal  
Though the hours are long  
And the noise infernal  
Just one shameful act or sometimes two  
We make believe were making do
