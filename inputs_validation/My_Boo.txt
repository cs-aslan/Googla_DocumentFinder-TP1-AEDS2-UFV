Theres always that one person  
That will always have your heart  
Youll never see it coming  
Cause youre blinded from the start  
Know that youre that one for me  
Its clear for everyone to see  
Oh baby ooh youll always be my boo  
  
I dont know bout chall  
But I know about us and uh  
This is the only way  
We know how to rock  
I dont know bout chall  
But I know about us and uh  
This is the only way  
We know how to rock  
  
Do you remember girl  
I was the one who gave you your first kiss  
Cause I remember girl  
I was the one who said put your lips like this  
Even before all the fame and  
People screaming your name  
Girl I was there and you were my baby  
  
Chorus  
It started when we were younger girl  
You were mine my boo  
Now another brothers taking over  
But its still in your eyes my boo  
Even though we used to argue its alright  
I know we havent seen each other  
In awhile but you will always be my boo  
  
I was in love with you when we were younger  
You were mine my boo  
And I see it from time to time  
I still feel like my boo  
And I can see it no matter  
How I try to hide my boo  
Even though theres another man whos in my life  
You will always be my boo  
  
Yes I remember boy  
Cause after we kissed  
I could only think about your lips  
Yes I remember boy  
The moment I knew  
You were the one  
I could spend my life with  
Even before all the fame  
And people screaming your name  
I was there and you were my baby  
  
Chorus  
  
I was in love with you when we were younger  
You were mine my boo  
And I see it from time to time  
I still feel like my boo  
And I can see it no matter  
How I try to hide my boo  
Even though theres another man in my life  
You will always be my boo  
  
My oh my oh my oh my oh my boo  
My oh my oh my oh my oh my boo  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont know bout chall  
But I know about us and uh  
This is the only way  
We know how to rock  
I dont know bout chall  
But I know about us and uh  
This is the only way  
We know how to rock
