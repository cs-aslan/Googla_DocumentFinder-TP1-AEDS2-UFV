Time flies when youre having fun  
I heard somebody say  
But if all Ive been is fun then baby let me go  
Dont wanna be in your way  
  
And I dont wanna be your second choice  
Dont wanna be just your friend  
You keep telling me that youre not in love  
You wanna throw it all away  
  
But I cant stay away form you  
I dont wanna let you go  
And though its killing me thats true  
Theres just some things I cant control  
  
Your love is slipping through my hands  
And though Ive heard it all before  
I know youre telling me the truth  
I know its just no use  
But I cant stay away from you  
  
Hold on to every bit of hope thats all I ever do  
Hoping you might change  
Your mind and call me up  
To say how much you need me too  
  
And though youre leaving me no other choice  
That to turn and walk away  
Look over your shoulder Ill be there  
You can count on me to stay  
  
Cause I cant stay away from you  
I dont wanna let you go  
And though its killing me thats true  
Theres just some things I cant control  
  
Your love slipping through my hands  
And though Ive heard it all before  
I know youre telling me the truth  
I know its just no use  
But I cant stay away from you  
  
I know youre telling me the truth  
I know its just no use  
But I cant stay away from you
