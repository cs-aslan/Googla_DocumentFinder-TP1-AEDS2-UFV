Well do it all  
Everything  
On our own  
We dont need  
Anything  
Or anyone  
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world  
I dont quite know  
How to say  
How I feel  
Those three words  
Are said too much  
Theyre not enough  
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world  
Forget what were told  
Before we get too old  
Show me a garden  
Thats bursting into life  
Lets waste time  
Chasing cars  
Around our heads  
I need your grace  
To remind me  
To find my own  
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world  
Forget what were told  
Before we get too old  
Show me a garden  
Thats bursting into life  
All that I am  
All that I ever was  
Is here in your perfect eyes  
Theyre all I can see  
I dont know where  
Confused about how as well  
Just know that these things  
Will never change for us at all  
If I lay here  
If I just lay her  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world
