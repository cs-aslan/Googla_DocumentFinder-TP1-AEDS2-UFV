I met a babe in a backseat drivein  
Back in the saddle shed sit  
Pulled on the reins just to keep me risin  
  
She loved to chomp at the bit  
Daddy do it ooh just do it  
Daddy do it please let me see  
Do it please just do it daddy  
Do it do it drivin me crazy  
  
She always walks with her eyes down on her bootlace  
She lives to give it away  
She dont believe in the right time or the wrong place  
Shes always liable to say  
  
Cheese cake Looser than her sister  
Cheese cake Mmm her sugar gets me high  
She knows I cant resist her cheese cake  
Got my fingers in her pie cheese cake  
  
Cheese cake Sneakin out the back door  
Cheese cake Rollin down the lawn  
Everybodys kissed her cheese cake  
At the crack of dawn cheese cake
