Its been a long time baby  
Its been a long time comin  
I dont like it  
Its been on my mind baby  
Its not the same anymore  
Lets face it weve changed yeah yeah  
  
Dont stand there laughin  
cause Im here cryin  
Dont have no pity baby  
cause my suns never shinin  
  
And dont think I ever think about you with another man  
And dont think I care about you honey  
You just dont understand  
Thats why I say  
  
Cant stop it but Im gonna try  
Cant stop it but Im gonna try  
Cant stop it but Im gonna try  
Cant stop it but Im gonna try  
Cant stop lovin you baby

Lets face it weve changed yeah yeah  
  
Here comes that feelin  
That feelin never stops  
From the first time that I met you  
Till the last time that we talked  
  
And some days I dont think Ill make it through  
Id feel better if you felt it too  
But dont have no pity pity baby  
You just dont understand

Cant stop it but Im gonna try  
Cant stop it but Im gonna try
