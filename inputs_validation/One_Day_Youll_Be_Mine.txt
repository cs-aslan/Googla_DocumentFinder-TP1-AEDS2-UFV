Come on  
Im sayin  
You goin be mine  
  
First time I saw you baby  
You did something to me  
That no one else has ever done  
Ohits something in your eyes  
Caught me by surprise  
And told me that you were the one  
Ohbut whats bad is I know you got a man  
  
And hell never understand  
The chemistry between me and youAh baby  
Something inside of me  
Its saying you and I were meant to be  
If you can think it you can have it  
Thats why I believe  
  
One day youll be minemine  
No more creepin sleepin around  
No whisperin when hes around  
One day youll be mine  
  
Now eveytime I see you baby  
Its plain to see  
That Im everything youve been missin at home baby  
So much love to share  
  
Its something in the air  
Tellin me I should never leave you alone  
But even though  
I know you gotta man  
  
Hell never understand  
The chemistry between me and youAh baby  
You can try to stop it but it wont quit  
You say you dont when I know that you want it

One day youll be minemine  
No more creepin sleepin around  
No whisperin when hes around  
One day youll be mine
