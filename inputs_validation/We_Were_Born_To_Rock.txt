Streets alive  
Something in the air  
Were writing up a brand new constitution  
  
Dont want to grow old  
Age is in your head  
Another boy has soul  
His soul for rock and roll  
  
We were Born to rock  
Pull out all the stops  
And we scream  
Were the voice  
Cause we made our choice  
And that is  
We were Born to rock  
  
Yeah  
Rock and roll  
Yeah  
  
Look out  
  
All alone  
The partys just begun  
No boss to guard your shoulder generation  
  
Running out of time  
With us theres no control  
Rockin is a crime  
Boss man says No more  
  
We were Born to rock  
Pull out all the stops  
And we scream  
With the voice  
Cause we have the choice  
We were Born to rock  
  
Rock on  
Watch out  
Oohoohooh  
Oohooh  
Oohoohooh  
Oohooh  
Oohoohooh  
  
We were Born to rock  
Pull out all the stops  
  
We were Born to rock  
Pull out all the stops  
  
We were Born to rock  
  
We were born to rock
