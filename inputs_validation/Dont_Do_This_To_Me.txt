Ive tried hard in pleasin you tell me youre leavin  
I must know the reason dont do this to me  
My loves like a flower that grows every hour  
Its my only power dont do this to me  
  
Dont squeeze it dont leave it why dont you believe it  
Its made you its pleased you but say dont you see  
Youre free to abuse it yes you can accuse it  
But please dont excuse it dont do this to me  
  
Dont treat me so wrongly for I love you only  
Dont leave me so lonely dont do this to me  
Cause I love you honey much more than all money  
Dont think that its funny dont do this to me  
  
Dont squeeze it dont leave it why dont you believe it  
Its made you its pleased you but say dont you see  
Youre free to abuse it yes you can accuse it  
But please dont excuse it dont do this to me  
  
Dont breathe it dont leave it why dont you believe it  
Its made you its pleased you but say dont you see  
Youre free to abuse it yes you can accuse it  
But please dont excuse it dont do this to me
