Shes smiling like heaven is down on earth  
Sun is shining so bright it hurts  
All her wishes have finally com true  
Her heart is weeping  
Happiness is killing her  
  
Shell be right here in my arms  
So in Love  
Shell be right here in these arms  
She cant let go  
She cant let go  
  
So hard shes trying  
But her heart wont turn to stone oh no  
She keeps on crying  
But I wont leave her alone  
Shell never be alone  
  
Shell be right here in my arms  
So in Love  
Shell be right here in these arms  
She cant let go  
She cant let go  
She cant let go  
She cant let go  
She cant let go  
She cant let go  
She cant let go
