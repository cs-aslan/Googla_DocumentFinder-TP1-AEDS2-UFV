Starting today Im not gonna waste another moment  
Even if I had the chance before I would have blown it  
But you took me by surprise  
And you caught me just in time  
Everyday you give me reason not to walk away  
I stop believing that the worlds gone crazy  
And if it is youll save me  
Starting today Im not gonna worry about tomorrow  
Ill wash away all this fear thats left me feeling hollow  
Cause you made me want to try  
And you caught me just in time  
Everyday you give me reason not to walk away  
Ill stop believing I should burn like crazy  
Cos if I did you chase me  
  
Anyway I should have told you  
So many times  
That I shyed away  
Somehow you always seem to  
Be there making it easy  
And you give me reason to stay  
  
Everyday Everyday Everyday  
Oh everyday Ill stop believing that I should burn like crazy  
Cos if I did you chase me  
Anyway you give me reason not to walk away  
I stop believing that the worlds gone crazy  
And if it is youll save me  
  
Starting today Im not gonna waste another moment
