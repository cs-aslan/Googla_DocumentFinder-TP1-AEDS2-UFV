I sent a message to another time  
But as the days unwind this I just cant believe  
I send a note across another plane  
Maybe its all a game but this I just cant conceive  
  
I drive the very latest Hover car  
I dont know where you are  
But I miss you so much till then  
I met someone who looks a lot like you  
She does the things you do but she is an IBM  
  
Shes only programmed to be very nice  
But shes as cold as ice whenever I get too near  
She tells me that she likes me very much  
But when I try to touch she makes it all too clear  
  
She is the latest in technology  
Almost mythology but she has a heart of stone  
She has an IQ of 1 001  
She has a jump suit on and shes also a telephone  
  
Chorus  
  
Is that what you want  is it what you really want  
  
I realize that it must seem to strange  
That time has rearranged but time has the final word  
She knows I think of you she reads my mind  
She tries to be unkind she knows nothing of your world  
  
Although her memory banks overflow  
No one would ever know all she says Is that what you want  
Maybe one day Ill feel her cold embrace  
And kiss her interface until then Ill leave her alone  
  
Chorus
