Well thanks a lot thank you  
Now Im the talk of the town  
Of all the fools they drink to  
I am the king of the clowns  
I play the lonely joker  
I take what fun I can find  
I laugh when things arent funny  
I throw away my last dime  
Youre not mine so I waste my time in pantomime  
Its pantomime  
  
Im ready for lonely fun times yeah  
Loud music may dull my mind  
Black coffee and electric sunshine  
Get set for this pantomime  
  
Iayayay cry inside cause youre not mine  
Iay dieayayay inside cause youre not mine  
I pantomime  
  
Laughing when I feel like crying  
Crying when I feel like dying  
Youre not mine so I waste my time in pantomime  
Bring on the girls and the parties yeah  
Guitars and drums beating time  
Be merry be gay and hardy yeah  
Im set for this pantomime
