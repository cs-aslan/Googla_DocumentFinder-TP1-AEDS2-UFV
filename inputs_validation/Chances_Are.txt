Chances are youll find me  
Somewhere on your road tonight  
Seems I always end up driving by  
Ever since Ive known you  
It just seems youre on my way  
All the rules of logic dont apply  
  
I long to see you in the night  
Be with you til morning light  
  
I remember clearly how you looked  
The night we met  
I recall your laughter and your smile  
I remember how you made me  
Feel so at ease  
I remember all your grace your style  
  
And now youre all I long to see  
Youve come to mean so much to me  
  
Chances are Ill see you  
Somewhere in my dreams tonight  
Youll be smiling like the night we met  
Chances are Ill hold you and Ill offer  
All I have  
  
Youre the only one I cant forget  
Baby youre the best Ive ever met  
  
And Ill be dreaming of the future  
And hoping youll be by my side  
And in the morning Ill be longing  
For the night for the night  
  
Chances are Ill see you  
Somewhere in my dreams tonight  
Youll be smiling like the night we met  
Chances are Ill hold you and Ill offer  
All I have  
  
Youre the only one I cant forget  
Baby youre the best Ive ever met
