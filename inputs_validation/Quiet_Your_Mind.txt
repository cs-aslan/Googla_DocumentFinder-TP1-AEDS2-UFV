I hear the waves  
Sun beatin down on my shoulders  
Its a nearperfect day  
Wishin I wouldnt get any older  
They say that its gone fore you know it now  
  
Quiet your mind  
Soak it all in  
Its a game you cant win  
Enjoy the ride  
  
I feel the change  
Goin on all around me  
Its strange  
How Im taken and guided  
Where I end up right Im needed to be  
  
Quiet your mind  
Soak it all in  
Its a game you cant win  
Enjoy the ride  
  
At the end of the water  
A red sun is risin  
And the stars are all goin away  
And if youre too busy talkin  
Youre not busy listenin  
To hear what the land has to say  
  
Quiet your mind  
  
I hear the waves  
Sun beatin down on my shoulders  
Its a nearperfect day  
Wishin I wouldnt get any older  
They say that its gone fore you know it now  
Soak it all in  
Its a game you cant win  
Enjoy the ride
