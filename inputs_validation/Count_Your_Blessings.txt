When Im worried and I cant sleep  
I count my blessings instead of sheep  
And I fall asleep counting my blessings  
When my bankroll is getting small  
I think of when I had none at all  
And I fall asleep counting my blessings  
  
I think about a nursery and I picture curly heads  
And one by one I count them as they slumber in their beds  
If youre worried and you cant sleep  
Just count your blessings instead of sheep  
And youll fall asleep counting your blessings  
  
I think about a nursery and I picture curly heads  
And one by one I count them as they slumber in their beds  
If youre worried and you cant sleep  
Just count your blessings instead of sheep  
And youll fall asleep counting your blessings
