Chorus  
Its automatic Repeat x4  
  
Girl I can see right through your false defenses  
You act as if you can ignore the sound  
My force detectors tell me your pretending  
All of your systems are about to go down  
No need to panic I know you feel it  
If you can stand it just dance  
Im your mechanic I know you feel it  
This automatic romance  
  
Chorus  
  
I know the secrets to your circuitry girl  
To your diskette I have to access code  
Dont try to fight this electricity girl  
From all this power you might overload  
No need to panic I know you feel it  
If you can stand it just dance  
Im your mechanic I know you feel it  
This automatic romance  
  
Chorus  
  
Girl I can see right through your false defenses  
Before you know it I will be in control  
My force detectors tell me your pretending  
Your force repellors can no longer hold  
No need to panic I know you feel it  
If you can stand it just dance  
Im your mechanic I know you feel it  
This automatic romance  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Its automatic baby  
Its automatic  
I realize baby  
All the things you fantasize baby  
Its in your eyes baby  
So let your body rock  
Shake that thing  
  
Ill make you wet baby  
Ill make you sweat baby  
Im your best bet baby  
So let your body rock  
  
I know you feel it just dance  
I know you feel it romance  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I know you feel it romance  
I know you feel it just dance  
No need to panic I know you feel it  
This automatic romance  
Its automatic I know you feel it
