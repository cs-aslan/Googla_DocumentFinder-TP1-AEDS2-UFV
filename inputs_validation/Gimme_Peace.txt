Let me sit on your porch let me drink a beer  
Let me scratch that hound dogs ear  
Let me rock in your rocking chair  
Gimme peace gimme peace gimme peace  
Show me your garden I love to hoe  
Let me walk in a fertile row  
I got some seeds that Id like to sow  
Gimme peace gimme peace gimme peace  
And when that evening sun goes down  
Drive me into your hometown  
Let me buy your friends a round  
Gimme peace gimme peace gimme peace  
Let me drink water from your well  
Tell me a story that youd like to tell  
I think youll find that Ill listen well  
Gimme peace gimme peace gimme peace  
When youve had all of me that you can take  
Say so long with a strong handshake  
Dont get to drinkin and ask me to stay  
Gimme peace gimme peace gimme peace  
And when that evening sun goes down  
Drive me into your hometown  
Ill catch that next truck outwardbound  
Gimme peace gimme peace gimme peace  
You can find out what time that bus leaves for Cincinnati
