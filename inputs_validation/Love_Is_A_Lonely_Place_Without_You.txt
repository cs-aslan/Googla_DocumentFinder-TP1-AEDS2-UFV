Love is a lonely place without you without you without you  
I know Im not alone  
I should not be afraid  
Cause I hear your voice  
And I know youre there beside me  
And so I give my heart  
I live to love again  
But I cant let go  
Of the way I feel about you  
Love is a lonely place without you  
I miss you and youre almost here  
And Im almost touching you  
Love is a place I have to hide away  
Ill never love this way again again  
If love was ever true  
I know it was with you  
Cause you touch my soul  
And you stay with me forever  
No tears no sad goodbyes  
There are no reasons why  
But Im holding on  
I believe in love eternal  
Love is a lonely place without you  
I miss you and youre almost here  
And Im almost touching you  
Love is a place I have to hide away  
Ill never love this way again  
Though Im moving on  
Im still holding on holding on holding on  
Love is a lonely place without you  
I miss you and youre almost here  
And Im almost touching you  
Love is a place I have to hide away  
Ill never love this way again again  
Love is a lonely place a lonely place  
Love is a lonely place a lonely place  
Love is a lonely place a lonely place
