It Wont Be Long  
Words by Ray Boltz Steve Millikan and Greg Gilpin Music by Ray Boltz and
Steve Millikan  
When I got home from work last night  
The news was just coming on  
What a mess this world is in  
Everythings going wrong  
But I wont be discouraged  
I will not fear  
Theres a voice inside my heart  
And this is what I hear  
Chorus  
It wont be long till we see Jesus  
It wont be long till Hell be here  
Im gonna follow Him all the way  
Im gonna watch for Him every day  
With all thats going on  
It wont be long  
When I get up and start each day  
I turn it over to Him  
Oh you know I want to serve the Lord  
In any way that I can  
Theres a world of people  
Everywhere I go  
Theyre lost and lonely  
Bound and afraid  
Oh and they need to know  
Chorus  
Jesus said before summer comes  
The leaves start turning green  
And He said before he returns  
Wed see lots of things  
Keep your eyes on the heavens  
And dont you be surprised  
When a trumpet sounds  
And we leave the ground  
And meet Him in the skies
