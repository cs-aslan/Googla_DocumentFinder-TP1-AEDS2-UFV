Chorus  
You alright star  
No star  
You alright star  
You alright star  
No star  
I don t feel proper  
  
I went to the dr to get a prescription  
I told him little fact and lots of fiction  
About a bad back that I aint got  
He tried to sell me faith healing  
But I think not  
I want Xanax Vicadin and Oxycotton  
Funky fill the form out  
So I can drop em  
Ive got all these demons  
And I cant stop em  
To tell you the truth Doc  
I might have a problem  
Robert Williams take one adoral with water in the morning  
As if Im goin to take one tablet Im Keith Moon  
Dick head  
  
Chorus 2

But a pain killer could help for whats wrong with my knee  
And Im a little bit down from too much tea

Chorus 3  
He said this ones to take you up

Now if you go to the barber shop long enough then youre goina get a hair cut  
And if go to the doctors regular then you gots to be a fuck up  
Well Ive got 5 or 6 if Im at a loss  
Do I have a history of drug abuse well I never tick that box  
And I now that some of you are going to be really really cross  
The drugs stop working so prescription pills are boss  
The glory days are gone and weve all stopped havin it  
No raves no more just bedside cabinet  
Sleepers are great but dont start dabbing it  
The world carries on spinning were mad in it  
Take that take that
