When my Mama met my girl she took me aside  
Shes a softspoken woman but she speaks her mind  
She said De de de de de de de de de de  
Let nothing come between you  
De de de de de de de de de de  
Dont let nothing come between you  
I went to see my friend to ask his advice  
He just smiled and Shes good around the eyes  
But Id already made up my mind  
Let nothing come between us  
  
There are frustrated people in town  
Who might envy us and try to bring us down  
We know they dont really mean any harm  
That doesnt mean weve gotta let em hang around  
  
Got the license  got the ring  
Got back the blood tests and everything  
Putting on my boutonniere  Its her favorite flower  
Then Im walking down the altar and Im gonna take the vow  
De de de de de de de de de de  
Dont let nothing come between us  
De de de de de de de de de de  
Dont let nothing come between us  
  
There are frustrated people in town  
Who might envy us and try to bring us down  
We know they dont really mean any harm  
That doesnt mean weve gotta let em hang around  
  
I have advice for the young and old  
If I may be so bold  
When you find someone to have and hold  
Dont let nothing come between you  
De de de de de de de de de de  
Get together and let nothing come between us  
De de de de de de de de de de  
Get together and let nothing come between us
