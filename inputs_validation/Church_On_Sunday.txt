Today is the first day of the rest of our lives  
Tomorrow is too late to pretend  
Everythings all right  
Im not getting any younger as long as you dont get any older  
Im not going to state that yesterday never was  
  
Bloodshot deadbeat and lack of sleep  
Making your mascara bleed  
Tears down your face  
Leaving traces of mistakes  
  
If I promise to go to church on Sunday  
Will you go with me on Friday night  
If you live with me Ill die for you  
And this compromise  
  
I hereby solemnly swear to tell the whole truth  
And nothing but the truth is what Ill ever hear from you  
Trust is a dirty word that comes only from such a liar  
But respect is something I will earn  
If you have faith
