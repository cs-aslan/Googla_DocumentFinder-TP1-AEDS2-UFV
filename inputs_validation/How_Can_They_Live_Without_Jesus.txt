How can they live without Jesus  
How can live without Gods Love  
How can they feel so at home down here  
When theres so much more up above  
  
Throwin away things that matter  
They hold on to things that dont  
The world has gone crazy  
But soon maybe  
A lot more are gonna know  
  
For maybe they dont understand it  
Or maybe they just havent heard  
Or maybe were not doin all we can  
Living up to his Holy Word  
  
Cause phonies have come  
And wrongs been done  
Even killing in Jesus name  
And if youve been burned  
Heres what Ive learned  
The Lords not the one to blame  
  
For Hes not just a religion  
With steeples and bells  
Or a salesman who will sell you  
The things you just want to hear  
  
For his Love was such  
That he suffered so much  
To cause some of us  
Just to follow follow  
  
So many laughing at Jesus  
While the funniest thing that hes done  
Is love this whole stubborn rebellious world  
While their hate for him just goes on  
  
And love just like that  
Will bring him back  
For the few he can call his friends  
The ones hes found true  
Whove made it through  
Enduring until the end  
The ones hes found true  
Whove made it through  
Enduring until the end
