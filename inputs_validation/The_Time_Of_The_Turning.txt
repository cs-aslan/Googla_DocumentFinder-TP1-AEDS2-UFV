In the big house  
Where the sun lives  
With the walls so white and blue  
In the red soil  
All the green grows  
And the winds blow across your face  
They blow across your heart  
  
Its the time of the turning and theres something stirring outside  
Its the time of turning and wed better learn to say our goodbyes  
  
All the earth breaks  
Like a stale bread  
And the seeds are folded in the soil  
Oh the sun pours  
Then the rains fall  
While the roots reach out right through the ground  
They reach out through the ground  
  
Its the time of turning and theres something stirring outside  
Its the time of turning and the old worlds falling  
Nothing you can do can stop the next emerging  
Time of the turning and wed better learn to say our goodbyes  
  
If we can stand up  
When all else falls down  
Well last through the winter  
Well last through the storms  
Well last through the north winds  
That bring down the ice and snow  
Well last through the long nights  
Till the green fields growing again  
Growing again
