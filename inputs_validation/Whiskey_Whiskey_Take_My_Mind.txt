Chorus  
Whiskey whiskey take my mind  
Let me leave it all behind  
Take me somewhere I can find  
Someone to believe  
  
Whiskey whiskey be my friend  
Dont you let me fall again  
You can help me to pretend  
She wont ever leave  
  
Whiskey whiskey tell me lies  
You know she can hypnotize  
If I look into her eyes  
Ill be lost again  
  
Chorus  
  
Whiskey whiskey keep your cool  
Dont you let me be no fool  
Ill be sitting on this stool  
Til the very end  
  
Chorus
