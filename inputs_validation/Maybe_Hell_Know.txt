Maybe hell know  
Im not so sure  
Maybe hell know  
Maybe hell be my cure  
Ah ah ah  
  
Maybe hell know  
Im not so sure  
Maybe hell know  
Maybe hell be  oh  
  
Something calls to me  
I know I know  
I hear an echo start to pound like a drum Im  
Chanting a song anchor me  
But dont take too longno no no no  
  
I got an anxious feeling  
Got this ache engraved in me like stone  
Dont take too long  
Say youll never leave me say youll never go
