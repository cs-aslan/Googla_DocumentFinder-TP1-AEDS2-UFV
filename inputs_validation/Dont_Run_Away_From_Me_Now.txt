Its time now to pick all the toys off the floor  
Ill say it again and Ive said it before  
We dont have a nickel to spend at the store  
And dont run away from me now  
Your daddys gone looking to find him a job  
Your grandmothers sent all her welfare to god  
Your brothers been taking it out on the dog  
So dont run away from me now  
Theres you and your brothers and sisters to care for  
But I dont know how when we aint got the wherefor  
So come let me hug you and show you what loves for  
And dont run away from me now  
The screaming and shoutings all done for today  
Ill clear up the mess when youre all out the way  
So give us a kiss cause theres nothing to say  
But dont run away from me now  
Theres you and your brothers and sisters to care for  
A whole lot of things that you should say your prayers for  
So dont make a fuss now or Ill give you what for  
Just dont run away from me now  
Dont run away from me now
