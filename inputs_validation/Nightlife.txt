Taking a ride to my old haunt  
Shes in my blood I reside in my nightlife  
My favorite colors candy apple girl  
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife  
  
Whats that I hear You wanna go for a ride  
Dont be afraid boy to come inside  
I got the thing that you want the fix that you need  
Chase this with a little lust and greed  
Ill be the devil on your shoulder saying hey boy come on  
My black heart beats crimson and clover  
Operator operator patch my boy in  
This is nightlife and Ill get under your skin  
  
Taking a ride to my old haunt  
Shes in my blood I reside in my nightlife  
My favorite colors candy apple girl  
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife  
  
What a thrill heart beats fast  
Sounds like love but you know it wont last  
Cheap champagne stain on an even cheaper suit  
Hope theres more in your pants than a bus route  
Red velvet walls  
Line the sugarcoated halls  
Girls on your bar stools from late last calls  
This town is filled with snakes mistakes and whiskey shakes  
Its too late I already cut the brakes  
  
Im rollin strollin into town  
Is it me or am I going crazy  
This dirty city is my sugar town  
My little angel of death is my nightlife  
  
You better make a move before I get bored  
If you wanna explore my vocal chord  
Leave the girl a gogo dance in the cooch  
One hand on my knee one hand on the hooch  
Why dont you stick around for one more round  
This place is a circus and I know youll be my clown  
Cause Im a ring leader  
I run the show  
And only when I tell ya  
Will it be time to go  
  
Taking a ride to my old haunt  
Shes in my blood I reside in my nightlife  
My favorite colors candy apple girl  
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife  
  
Hey boy She is my night life  
hey boy She is my night life  
Haha hey boy She is my night life  
See you later She is my night life
