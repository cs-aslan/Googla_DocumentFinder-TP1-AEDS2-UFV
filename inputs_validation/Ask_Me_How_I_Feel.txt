Oh Im waiting in the storm ask me how I feel  
When things are going wrong why dont you ask me how I feel  
The night is awful cold ask me how I feel  
Youre much too loose to hold why dont you ask me how I feel  
  
I close my eyes to follow you  
To my surprise youre so untrue  
And Im crying Im dying  
  
Oh Im waiting in the storm ask me how I feel  
When you keep me hanging on why dont you ask me how I feel  
The waters run so deep ask me how I feel  
When I dont get any sleep why dont you ask me how I feel  
  
And when youre down you lean on me  
Youre a fool too blind to see  
That Im crying Im dying  
  
Oh Im waiting in the storm why dont you ask me how I feel  
What the hell is going on why dont you ask me how I feel  
When you stay out late at night ask me how I feel  
When you think that Im uptight why dont you ask me how I feel oh  
  
You dont treat me tender no matter what I do  
But Im the great pretender  
  
Im waiting in the storm ask me how I feel  
What the hell is going on  
When you stay out late at night  
You never ask me how I feel you just say that Im uptight  
When youre down I do for you  
And now I find that youre untrue
