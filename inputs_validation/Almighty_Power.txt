When you feel like youve come to the end of your way you need love  
When all you get is lonesome at the end of the day you need love  
When youve lived the lifetime in a night still theres darkness above  
Theres no way to measure the almighty power of a good womans love  
  
When you got an old memry that refuses to die you need love  
When you feel someone special has long passed you by you need love  
When youve lived the lifetime in a night still theres darkness above  
Theres no way to measure the almighty power of a good womans love  
  
A good womans love is all that any man needs  
Give me a good womans love my heart my sould and mind plead  
When theres someone somewhere that youre thinking of  
Theres no way to measure the almighty power of a good womans love
