Im the last leaf on the tree  
The autumn took the rest  
But they wont take me  
Im the last leaf on the tree  
  
When the autumn wind blows  
Theyre already gone  
They flutter to the ground  
Cause they cant hang on  
Theres nothing in the world  
That I aint seen  
I greet all the new ones that are coming in green  
  
Im the last leaf on the tree  
The autumn took the rest but they wont take me  
Im the last leaf on the tree  
  
They say I got staying power  
Here on the tree  
But Ive been here since Eisenhower  
And Ive out lived even he  
  
Im the last leaf on the tree  
The autumn took the rest but they wont take me  
Im the last leaf on the tree  
  
I fight off the snow  
I fight off the hail  
Nothing makes me go  
Im like some vestigial tail  
Ill be here through eternity  
If you want to know how long  
If they cut down this tree  
Ill show up in a song  
  
Im the last leaf on the tree  
The autumn took the rest but they wont take me  
Im the last leaf on the tree  
Im the last leaf on the tree  
Im the last leaf on the tree
