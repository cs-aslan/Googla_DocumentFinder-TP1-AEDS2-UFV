Hey you know  
Baby dont care whos mad about her  
Always got the boys hanging out to get her  
Knows just when to smile  
But she can bite like a crocodile  
Dont want to get heavy dont ask me why  
Got everything in place from her foot to her eyelash  
Just might dance but not for a while  
She dont want nobody cramping her style  
Knows it when you think shes nice  
But if you want her to be yours boy  
You got to pay the price  
Better get ready for tears and sorrow   
Shell be here today and shell be gone tomorrow  
Waving her pretty hand  
Shes got a date with another man  
Too busy to stay in one place too long  
Got itchy feet got to be moving on  
See you again out on the tiles  
Your broken heart will mend baby up in a while  
Now you know shes cold as ice  
And if you want her to be yours boy  
You got to pay the price
