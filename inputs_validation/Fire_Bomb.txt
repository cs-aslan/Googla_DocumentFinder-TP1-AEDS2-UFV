Yeah  
Whoa  
Gunfire left a hole  
In the tank  
Losing gasoline  
  
Fire is on my trail  
And hes after me  
Hope it dont get here  
Before I get where Im going  
I gotta get where Im going  
Take off my mask to breath  
  
You couldve been a apart of a  
Masterpiece  
Fluid in the breaks  
Was the last to leak  
Thats the thing  
  
Where Im going  
I dont need my breaks  
Cant wait to see your face  
When your front windows break  
And I come crashing through  
  
The lovers near to clear the road  
Oh oh oh  
Cause this thing is ready to blow  
Oh oh oh  
  
I just wanna set you on fire  
So I wont have to burn alone  
Then you  
Then youll know where  
Im coming from  
Fire bomb  
Fire bomb  
  
Scenes go  
But baby no  
Doesnt have to be  
Microwaving a medal tragedy  
Watching it burn and  
Its beautiful and its blue  
And its pitiful  
When its through  
Its the other half of me  
  
I didnt do it  
You lit the match for me  
Now were flying  
From the blast baby  
Thats the thing  
  
Where were going  
We dont need no breaks  
Cant wait to see your face  
When your front windows break  
And I come crashing through  
  
The loveers near to clear the road  
Oh oh oh  
Cause this thing is ready to blow  
Oh oh oh  
  
I just wanna set you on fire  
So I wont have to burn alone  
Then you  
Then youll know where  
Im coming from  
Fire bomb  
Fire bomb  
  
Baby we were killing them  
They couldnt handle the millionth degree  
We were criminals ah ah ah  
As we were burning  
The world called the police  
Fire department ambulance  
You can call me crazy cause I believe  
The only move for me and you  
Is to blow our flames  
And  
  
The lovers need to clear the road  
Oh oh oh  
Cause this thing is ready to blow  
Oh oh oh  
  
I just wanna set you on fire  
So I wont have to burn alone  
Then you  
Then youll know where  
Im coming from  
Fire bomb  
Oh oh oh  
Fire bomb
