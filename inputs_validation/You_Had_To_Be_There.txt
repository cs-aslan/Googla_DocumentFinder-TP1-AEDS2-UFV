He sat down picked up the phone  
And said Boy Im your old man  
He touched the glass between the two  
As if to shake his hand  
  
The boy he didnt budge  
Not even so much as a blink  
The man said Oh come on  
Better late than never dont you think  
  
He said I read it in the paper  
Cant believe youre 21  
Cant believe some son of mine  
Could do the things I hear youve done  
  
He went on like some big hero  
Who flew in to save the day  
And the boy said If youre here  
To steer me right man its too late  
  
You had to be there  
And Im talkin from day one  
Thats the only time a man should talk  
Through glass to his new son  
  
And youd have to go back  
And teach me how when I was nine  
Cause my mama couldnt throw a ball  
Even if she had the time  
  
And I should have been learnin how to fish  
Instead of learnin how to smoke  
I bet if youd have whooped my tail  
Id never thought it was a joke  
  
He said Sometimes the will  
For doin wrong is way too strong  
For any Mamas prayers  
You had to be there  
  
The man said Boy Im sorry  
That you hate me like you do  
The boy said Dry it up man  
We aint makin this about you  
  
Its about a teenage girl against the world  
Who was left there high and dry  
About a kid who might have stood  
A whole lot better shot at life  
  
But you had to be there  
And Im talkin from day one  
Thats the only time a man should talk  
Through glass to his new son  
  
Youd have to go back  
And teach me how when I was nine  
Cause my mama couldnt throw a ball  
Even if she had the time  
  
I should have been learnin how to fish  
Instead of learnin how to smoke  
I bet if youd have whooped my tail  
Id never thought it was a joke  
  
He said Sometimes the will  
For doing wrong is way too strong  
For any Mamas prayer  
You had to be there  
  
Before the boy hung up the phone  
He said They say Im out of time  
And it hit the man right there and then  
My God son so am I
