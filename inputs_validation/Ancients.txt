All I know is youre not with me  
Like me  
All I know  
Youre not with me  
Some can shine  
Some can fly  
Some are glorious  
Some are ancient  
Some are wise  
Some are strong  
Some are everything  
You could dream of  
Some are clouds  
Some are rain  
Float like angel wings  
On an ocean  
Some can sing  
Songs of Gods  
Words so beautiful  
They fall like raindrops  
Fall like raindrops  
Fall like raindrops  
But none are like me  
All I know is youre not with me  
Like me  
All I know is youre not with me  
All I know is youre not with me  
Like me  
All I know is youre not with me  
Some will cry  
Cry for you  
Take your pain away  
When youre sleeping  
Some will die  
In your name  
Give their soul to you  
For safe keeping  
All I know is youre not with me  
Like me  
All I know  
All I know is that youre not with me  
Like me x3  
All I know is that youre not with me  
Youre not with me x4
