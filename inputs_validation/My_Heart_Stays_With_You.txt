You know sometimes being  
On the road is rough especially the loneliness  
  
Girl I miss you  
And its only been one day  
Since I been away  
And aw lady I say I long to kiss you  
And hold you in my arms  
The nights are much too long when youre gone  
Baby thats why  
  
Chorus  
Wherever I go  
Girl my heart stays with you  
My heart stays with you  
After every show  
I want to rush over to you  
My heart stays with you  
  
Trust me when we are apart  
I wont break your heart  
Wherever you are I know you feel me Baby  
And I can feel you too  
No matter what you do  
I think of you  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby yeah  
When Im leaving town  
Girl it hurts me too  
But Ive got a job to do  
Ill be back around  
To see your sweet face  
Your embrace  
No one can take your place  
I want you to know  
  
Wherever I go  
Ill be rushing over to you  
  
Chorus  
  
Wherever I go  
Where I stop who knows  
Whatever I do  
My heart stays with you  
Im gonna rush gonna rush over
