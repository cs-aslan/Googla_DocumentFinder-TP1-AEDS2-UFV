Ive learned to turn the other cheek  
Is not what loves about  
Ive turned mine so many times  
That I damned near wore em out  
Ive grown used to your abuse  
And I thought Id never quit  
But I woke up this morning  
Couldnt find my shivagit  
Youve always liked to play your games  
Well I got one for you  
Pretend were playing checkers girl  
And its your time to move  
Youll find your suitcase on the porch  
And the taxi in the drive  
So get your tongue out of my mouth  
Im kissing you goodbye  
I see youve finally made it home  
You been out all night  
Your artificial hairs a mess  
And your clothes dont fit you right  
Ive given and forgiven  
Till there aint nothing left  
But all you gave was just enough  
To satisfy yourself  
I can smell that whiskey in your hair  
And SenSen on your breath  
If you ever tried to tell the truth  
Youd choke yourself to death  
I dont want your nasty kisses  
And dont tell me no more lies  
Get your tongue out of my mouth  
Im kissing you goodbye  
Get your tongue out of my mouth  
Im kissing you goodbye
