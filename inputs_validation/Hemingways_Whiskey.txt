Hemingways whiskey warm and smooth and mean  
Even when it burns itll always finish clean  
He didnt like it watered down he took it straight up and neat  
If it was bad enough for him you know its bad enough for me  
  
Hemingways whiskey  
  
Ah its tough out there a good muse is hard to find  
Living one word to the next one line at a time  
Theres more to life than whiskey theres more to words than rhyme  
Sometimes nothing works sometimes nothing shines  
  
Like Hemingways whiskey  
  
Sail away sail away three sheets to the wind  
Live hard die hard this ones for him  
  
Hemingways whiskey warm and smooth and mean  
Even when it burns itll always finish clean  
He didnt like it watered down he took it straight up and neat  
If it was bad enough for him you know its bad enough for me  
  
Hemingways whiskey  
Hemingways whiskey
