Ive seen you happy  
Ive seen you low  
Ive watched your prosper  
Ive watched your grow  
But youre so unhappy  
And you should know  
That you need me now  
  
Youve got your money  
Youve got your pride  
Youre so cute youre so funny  
And you cant hide  
But theres something wrong here  
But Im on your side  
And you need me now  
  
Chorus  
Youre aching  
Theres no mistaking  
Ive seen it before  
Youre faking  
Your heart is breaking  
Get off the floor  
  
I hope theres something you let me do  
I live and love because of you  
And I set my sights with you in view  
So lets make a vow  
You live in a quandary  
Youre blessed and cursed  
They say they love you  
But I saw you first  
And you think you could love me  
But youre unrehearsed  
So Ill show you how  
  
Chorus  
  
You hur inside  
You cant hide  
Its all up to you  
You hurt inside  
You lost all your pride  
It all comes down to you
