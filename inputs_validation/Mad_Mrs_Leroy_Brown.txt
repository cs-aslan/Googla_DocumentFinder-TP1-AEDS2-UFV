Ive been in and out of every honky tonk in town  
And Im almost drunk from the drinks that Ive turned down  
Well you told me youd be happy bouncin babies on your knee  
While I sit at home alone and Ive been bouncin three  
Yeah and Im tired of it too  
  
Im gonna call myself a long pink limousine  
Yeah believe it or not its the prettiest thing I think Ive ever seen  
Theres a big bar in the corner and a tv on the side  
This babys 60 feet long and 40 feet wide  
  
Hey driver pull this car buddy right inside the bar  
Take it on back to the big ole blonde that thinks shes a movie star  
Im gonna grab her by her phony ponytail  
Im gonna sling her around and around  
When she wakes up shell know she met up with mad Mrs Leroy Brown  
  
Well the smokes so doggone thick you could cut it with a knife  
And the musics so loud you can hear the same line twice  
Hey Leroy Brown how do you like my big ol pink limo  
I just drawed all your money out of the bank today  
Honey you dont have no mo  
  
Im gonna call myself a long pink limousine  
Yeah believe it or not its the prettiest thing I think Ive ever seen  
Theres a big bar in the corner and a tv on the side  
This babys 60 feet long and 40 feet wide  
  
Hey driver pull this car buddy right inside the bar
