instrumental intro  
Going to jamaica  
Warm and coral waters flow  
There she goes  
Sun kissed her body in this magic feel love grow  
Love grows  
Feel like letting go  
Hey mr Saturday night  
  right out the hole  
It stops in a minute  
Its right down in it  
Hey were really back on a roll  
I dont know why I dont know why  
Feel so good I could die I could die  
Great escape Ill be there by the skin of my teeth on a wish and a prayer  
With a head full of hammers both feet in the grave Im gonna stand Im gonna
rise again  
Dream time lavinia    
Even though the odds are stacked shes coming back  
moon monkeys barking  in a bitter chocolate glow  
There she goes feel like letting go  
Hey mr cool jazz nights let the fever go  
It stops in a minute Im down in it  
Hey play it long and slow  
I dont know why I dont know why  
Feels so good I could die I could die  
With a great escape Ill be there by the skin of my teeth on a wish and a
prayer  
With a head full of hammers both feet in the grave Im gonna stand Im gonna
rise again  
instrumental  
With a great escape Ill be there by the skin of my teeth on a wish and a
prayer  
With a head full of hammers both feet in the grave Im gonna stand Im gonna
rise again  
Ive been stricken Ill be there by the skin of my teeth on a wish and a
prayer and Im  
Not going down both feet in the grave Im gonna stand Im gonna rise again  
Dream time lavinia    
Feel like letting go  
end
