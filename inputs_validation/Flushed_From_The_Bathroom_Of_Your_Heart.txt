From the backdoor of your life you swept me out dear  
In the bread line of your dreams I lost my place  
At the table of your love I got the brush off  
At the Indianapolis of your heart I lost the race  
  
Chorus  
Ive been washed down the sink of your conscience  
In the theater of your love I lost my part  
And now you say youve got me out of your conscience  
Ive been flushed from the bathroom of your heart  
  
In the garbage disposal of you dreams Ive been ground up dear  
On the river of your plans Im up the creek  
Up the elevator of your future Ive been shafted  
On the calendar of your events Im last week  
  
Chorus
