When everybody else refrains  
My uncle Jonny did cocaine  
Hes convinced himself right in his brain  
That it helps to take away the pain  
Hey Jonny  
Hey what you say Jonny  
  
I wanna go out tonight  
Come a little closer to the city lights  
Levitation aint your only friend  
Levitation coming back again  
Feel a burning in your bodys core  
Its a yearning that you cant ignore  
Now I wanna go out tonight  
  
Superman and hold on tight  
Hes convinced himself right in his brain  
That it helps to take away the pain  
Hey Jonny  
Hey what you say Jonny  
  
My appetite aint got no heart  
I said my appetite aint got no heart  
Shocking people when you feel that pull  
Shock em drop em when you know its full  
  
I feel a burning in your bodys core  
Its a yearning that you cant ignore  
I gotta go out tonight  
Hey Jonny I got faith in you man  
I mean it its gonna be all right  
Hes convinced himself right in his brain  
That it helps to take away the pain  
Hey what you say Jonny  
  
Tell us whats going on  
Feels like everythings wrong  
Hey what you say Jonny  
If the future is real  
Jonny youve got to heal  
Hey what you say Jonny  
  
When everybody else refrains  
My uncle Jonny did cocaine
