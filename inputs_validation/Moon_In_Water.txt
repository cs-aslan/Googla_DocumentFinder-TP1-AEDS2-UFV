The phenomenon of mooninthewater is likened to human experience  
The water is the subject and the moon the object  
When there is no water there is no mooninthewater  
And likewise there is no moon  
But when the moon rises  
The water does not wait to receive its image  
And even when the tiniest drop of water is poured out  
The moon does not wait to cast its reflection  
Does not wait to cast its reflection  
Does not wait to cast its reflection  
Does not wait to cast its reflection  
Does not wait to cast its reflection  
Does not wait to cast its reflection  
Does not wait to cast its reflection  
Does not wait to cast its reflection  
  
Past is already past  
The futures not yet here  
Things are constantly changing  
  
Manifests manifests  
Manifests manifests  
Manifests manifests  
  
Does not wait to cast its reflection  
Does not wait to cast its reflection  
Does not wait to cast its reflection  
Does not wait to cast its reflection  
  
And the past is already past  
The future not yet here  
Things are constantly changing  
  
Things are constantly changing  
  
The event is caused as much by the water as by the moon  
And as the water manifests the brightness of the moon  
The moon manifests the clarity of the water
