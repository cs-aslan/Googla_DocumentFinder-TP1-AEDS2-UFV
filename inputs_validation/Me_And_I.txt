Sometimes when Im mad  
Theres a part of me that seems to be a little sad  
Sometimes when I scream  
Theres a voice in me that says You shouldnt be so mean  
Oh no oh no  
Part of me is acting while the other stands beside  
Yes I am to myself what Jekyll must have been to Hyde  
  
Were like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes were a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
Were a funny combination  
Me and I  
I dont think Im different or in any way unique  
Think about yourself for a minute  
And youll find the answer in it  
Everyones a freak  
  
Sometimes I have toyed  
With ideas that I got from good old Dr Freud  
Nothing new of course  
It may seem to you I try to break through open doors  
Oh no oh no  
I just want to say a lot of that applies to me  
Cause its an explanation to my split identity  
  
Were like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes were a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
Were a funny combination  
Me and I  
I dont think Im different or in any way unique  
Think about yourself for a minute  
And youll find the answer in it  
Everyones a freak  
  
Me and I

Me and I
