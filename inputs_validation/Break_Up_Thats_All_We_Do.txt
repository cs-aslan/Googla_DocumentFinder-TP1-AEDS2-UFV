Make up and break up  
Thats all we do  
Then we have sex next thing you know  
Everything is cool  
Best of Both Worlds Holla at your boy  
  
Like we always do about this time  
Uhhuh yeah  
I know what you doin ma  
Tryin to get in an argument with me so I can  
Do my mad thing you want me to do my mad thing  
I understand cmon  
  
Chorus  
Seems were always arguing but  
Right after the arguing we have sex  
And somehow its the best yes  
Seems were always arguing but  
Right after the arguing we have sex  
And somehow its the best girl  
  
Gangsta love gangsta love  
  
Think about it while the streets you roam  
Its Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home  
Sex is always better fresh off a vendetta  
We break up or break you off then we right back together  
Then this brand new leathers and Caroline Aurera  
Marijuana white wine somewhere under the weather  
Like we sick but we fine shit we couldnt feel better  
Just some sunshine in mind lookin fine as ever  
Who got a mouth on her woo she put some words together  
Sometimesll make a nigga wanna leave but when we make up  
  
Chorus  
  
Woo  
Boy talk boy  
  
Break up to make up baby  
Seems thats all we do darlin  
But no one wants to walk out the door  
After all of the hollan  
Cursing and fighting  
And me sleeping on the couch  
In the midst of our stormy weather  
Sex brings the sun out  
After I hit that there  
Seems we dont have a care  
Sex makes you say Im sorry  
And things like Im not goin nowhere  
Its somethin bout the PUSSY  
That keeps brother in check even I  
Even if you was a pimp you couldnt survive  
Without the HELP to provide you  
  
Chorus  
  
Think about it while the streets you roam  
Its Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home  
Remember that night You was all like  
Maybe we should go our separate ways for life  
I hit the lights fit you tight at the lil place right  
I hit it right you look me right in the eyes like psych  
You was goin through your act til I caught you in the sack  
And I made you relax when I hit it hard from the back  
Yeah now we back friends  
And the next time you need some sex counselin we  
  
Chorus  
  
Seems were always arguing but  
Right after the arguing we have sex  
Sex with best friends  
From the bathroom to the kitchen we sex  
From the kitchen to living room we sex  
From the living room to upstairs we sex  
Upstairs to the attic we sex  
Attic to the basement we sex  
From the basement to the car garage we sex  
Garage to the back of the Jeep we sex  
Bicycle to the treadmill we sex  
Even over by the dirty lawnmower we sex  
The neighbors and the dogs are lookin crazy we sex  
I dont care because youre my baby we sex  
Its our house and we can have sex we sex  
Anytime we want to we sex  
They can kiss my ass because whoahohoo
