Lord You know its been a busy day  
And Im just weary to my bones  
I hope Youll understand if I dont pray  
But I need my rest to carry on  
Why do I kid myself You see my heart  
The me I try so to ignore  
And Lord You know how very weak I am  
I just cant hide it any more  
Chorus  
All of a sudden I knew  
That Id never be wanting  
As long as Im leaning on You  
Oh Lord all that I need is You  
  
Everytime when the doubting comes And I seem to lose my way  
When I cry within cause I need a friend  
But I just dont say You know that I need You  
All at once its clear even though Youre here  
Ive tried to make it on my own Im not trusting You  
Lord you know that I really need our time together  
Only your strength can see me through  
So talk with me now As You walk with me now in this quiet time  
Im waiting on You Cause  
Repeat Chorus twice
