Stark naked in front of my mirror  
A pudgy person somehow did appear  
Seems lately all Ive eaten sugar and fat  
Its getting obvious thats not where its at  
A big pot and tripley chin  
Oh what condition my condition was in  
Laughing at myself at what a crying shame  
What ever happened to my Greek godly frame  
Cyclamates juicy steaks sweet things too  
Arent always good as they seem  
Doughy lumps stomach pumps enemas too  
Thats what you get when you eat that way  
I read a book on organic foods  
Jumped on a health food kick  
Put me in the mood  
You may not get to perfect overnight  
But on the way youre feelin clean out of sight  
We ate tonight at Fairfax and 3rd  
Were gonna spread the news and give you the word  
We hope that soon youll eat like we did today  
Were mighty thankful now that HELPs on its way  
Salad with a special knock you right off your seat  
With carrot juice to wash it all down  
Yummy carob cookies are an organic treat  
And HELP has got the best food in town  
HELP  
HELP your education creates much benefit and peace  
Hamburgers and hot dogs throw em all out  
Youll feel so good youll jump up and shout  
If you havent why dont you go shopping today  
And member now that HELP s on its way  
HELP  
Radiant Radish
