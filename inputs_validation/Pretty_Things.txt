Mamas high heels cherry lipstick  
And a goodwill dress  
Play pretending danced for the mirror  
A fairytale princess  
  
Chorus  
Pretty things are yours to hold  
My pretty thing soon you will know  
Pretty things you think you need  
But dont make you beautiful  
Pretty things will rot with love  
Pretty things will fade with time  
Its whats inside that makes you shine  
  
My pretty thing  
  
Its only natural the tables turning  
And gracefully Ill learn  
How to cradle the one who raised me  
Will be too fragile for this world  
  
Chorus  
  
Selfless and faithful  
As good as you should be  
Open and fearless  
Oh what a gift you gave  
  
Chorus
