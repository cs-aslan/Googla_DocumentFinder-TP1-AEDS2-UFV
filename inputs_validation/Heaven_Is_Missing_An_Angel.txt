You came into my life like an answer to a prayer  
Like a star that falls from the sky right out of thin air  
Some might say its a miracle or a dream come true  
But from that day I always knew  
  
Chorus  
Heaven is missing an angel  
Thats the only thing that it can be  
Heaven is missing an angel  
Cause youre right here with me  
  
No one else in the world has touched me like you do  
Its super natural girl the way I feel when Im with you  
Im in paradise whenever youre around  
Then when I look in your eyes theres no doubt  
  
Heaven is missing an angel  
Thats the only thing that it can be  
Heaven is missing an angel  
Cause youre right here with me  
  
Im in paradise whenever youre around  
Then when I look in your eyes theres no doubt  
  
Heaven is missing an angel  
Thats the only thing that it can be  
Heaven is missing an angel  
Cause youre right here with me  
  
Right here with me  
Youre right here
