Id never let you down when youre in a fix  
Id come running when you call  
Thats my weakness baby  
So connected are we  
You get your kicks from the ghost of a memory  
So busy turning away from reality baby  
That you just wont let it go  
But memories fade  
Yeah theyre designed that way  
  
But youre so wrapped up in her you dont see straight  
Watch her mangle the truth while you take the bait  
So tell her cant you see  
Your just turning yourself inside out for no need  
  
This thing youre using is worse then a photograph  
It picks you up and it turns you inside out now baby  
And it just wont let you go  
  
But memories fade  
Yeah theyre designed that way  
  
She doesnt love you anymore  
Maybe she did long ago  
Youre just a slave to the grind that she grew tired of baby  
So tell her cant you see  
Youre just turning yourself inside out for no need  
But memories fade  
Cause theyre designed that way  
  
She doesnt love you anymore  
Maybe she did long ago  
Youre just a slave to the grind that she grew tired of baby  
So tell her cant you see  
Youre just turning yourself  
Youre just turning yourself inside out for no need  
Youre just turning yourself inside out for no need
