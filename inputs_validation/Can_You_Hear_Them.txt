So sick and tired of living  
And so afraid to die  
Ive lived so many lives  
And still I wonder why  
The way the world perceives me  
Is not the way I am  
The one half thinks Im crazy  
The other thinks Im mad  
  
I spent a long long time alone in my room  
I need your help to get me out of this gloom  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They wont be happy till Im dead  
They freak me out  
  
Ten thousand million nightmares  
Temptation by the score  
I used to get so high  
And still I wanted more  
You think my time is wasted  
In search of who I am  
I tried to so hard to kill  
The boy inside the man  
  
I spent a thousand years one night in my room  
Ive lived so many lives and that is my doom  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They wont be happy till Im dead  
They freak me out  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They wont be happy till Im dead  
They freak me out  
  
I never thought Id smile again  
Always thought Id be here on my own  
Sometimes when Im down  
You come and save me again  
And again  
And again  
And again  
  
Ill never understand it  
It makes no sense at all  
Just look at what Ive done  
Its time to count the score  
  
Ive spent a long long time alone in my room  
I need your help to get me out of this gloom  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They wont be happy till Im dead  
They freak me out  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They wont be happy till Im dead  
They freak me out
