From hard luck tricks  
To trust fund freaks  
Bathroom stalls to penthouse suites  
  
I been around  
I been around  
  
From the bottom of the barrel  
To the cream of the crop  
  
Theyve picked me up  
And Ive watched em drop  
  
I been around  
I been around  
  
I sang em all a song or two  
About simple things  
Still I feel Im bein used  
Aint a damn thing changed  
  
Im an outlaw  
Bad Leroy Brown  
The only Cool Hand Luke left in this town  
I get my lovin on the run  
  
Im a low down  
Mister fly by night  
Baby slow down  
Let me show you right  
I sure dont wanna hurt no one  
  
So dont tell me you love me  
Dont tell me you love love me do  
Dont tell me you love me  
Cause loves one thing that I cannot do  
And its the only thing that I cant give to you  
  
From Hollywood hoes to backstage jive  
Jacked up trucks and Gulf Stream 5s  
I been around  
I been around  
  
From silly little girls who play them games  
To the rich and famous  
I wont say no names  
I been around  
I been around  
  
You gotta touch the stove to learn they say  
Get burnt and learn that way  
You better keep your feelings at bay  
Or honey you gonna pay  
  
Im an outlaw  
Bad Leroy Brown  
Im the only John Wayne left in this town  
I get my lovin on the run  
  
Im a low down  
Mister fly by night  
Baby slow down  
Ima fuck you right  
I sure dont wanna hurt no one  
  
So dont tell me you love me  
Dont tell me you love love me do  
Dont tell me you love me  
Cause loves one thing that I cannot do  
And its the only thing that I cant give to you  
  
So dont tell me you love me
