Safe in the eye of the storm  
Mercy and faith keep me warm  
Oh the dreams Ive seen tattered and torn  
Just when I think I cant take anymore  
  
You give me shelter and never will I be alone  
Hold me closer and help me to find my way home  
Cause its a long road through the darkest of nights  
But your love wont let me lose sight  
Of the glory of life  
  
High is this mountain I climb  
Deep is this river of time  
The devils got trouble in mind  
Sometimes I stumble  
But youre there to remind me  
Standing right there beside me  
  
You give me shelter and never will I be alone  
Hold me closer and help me to find my way home  
Cause its a long road through the darkest of nights  
But your love wont let me lose sight  
Of the glory of life  
  
This world has left me tangled up inside  
No where left to hide  
And the wind and rain  
Is baring down on me  
Baring down wearing down on me  
  
You give me shelter and never will I be alone  
Hold me closer and help me to find my way home  
Through the darkest of nights  
But your love wont let me lose sight  
  
You give me shelter and never will I be alone  
Hold me closer and help me to find my way home  
Cause its a long road through the darkest of nights  
But your love wont let me lose sight  
Of the glory of life
