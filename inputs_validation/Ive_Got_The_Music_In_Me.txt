Aint got no trouble in my life  
No foolish dream to make me cry  
Im never frightened or worried  
You know I always get by  
I heat up  
I cool down  
Something gets in my way I go around it  
Dont let life get me down  
Gonna take it the way that I found it  
  
Ive got the music in me  
Ive got the music in me  
Ive got the music in me  
  
Ive got the music in me  
Ive got the music in me  
Ive got the music in me  
  
You say that life is a circle  
But that aint the way that I found it  
Oh gonna move in a straight line  
Keeping my feet firmly on the ground  
I heat up  
I cool down  
I got words in my head so I sing them  
Dont let life get me down  
I cant hold onto the blues so I play them  
  
Ive got the music in me  
Ive got the music in me  
Ive got the music in me  
  
Ive got the music in me  
Ive got the music in me  
Ive got the music in me
