How do you tell someone youre letting go  
I wish that I could tell you  
But youre askin me things that I dont know  
I wish that I could tell you  
Words that I would say  
Sound as empty as the way you feel inside  
While the silence in between  
Tells me everything that you deny  
I dont know how to help you  
I wish that I could tell you  
How to tell me goodbye  
I dont know how you leave it all behind  
I wish that I could tell you  
Is it true a heart heals itself with time  
I wish that I could tell you  
How do you choose  
Do you hurt em with the truth or with a lie  
Where do you go to find the courage  
You know I could never find  
I dont know how to help you  
I wish that I could tell you  
How to tell me goodbye  
Where do you turn where do you go  
When youve finally reached the end of the road  
How do you say it I just dont know  
When it comes to leaving youre on your own  
How do you tell someone youre letting go  
I wish that I could tell you  
Oh wish that I could tell you
