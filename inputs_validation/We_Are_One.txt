We are one with ourselves  
We dont give a shit about anyone else  
Well it wont be wrong until our day in the sun is gonna stop  
The walls come tumbling down  
  
Chorus  
We are one  
We are free  
We are headed for obscurity  
We are one  
We are weak  
We are gonna make ourselves extinct  
  
Let it go  
Were gonna let it go  
Its real we are one  
You know its true  
Dont fuck with us or well fuck with you  
Its a mentality that kills the best  
We better stop  
The walls come tumbling down  
  
Chorus  
  
We are one and it wont be news  
When we hang ourselves with one collective noose  
Well it wont be wrong until our day in the sun is gonna stop  
The walls come tumbling down  
  
The bigger they are  
The harder they fall
