For all these years  
Ive been rushing and running away  
I have seen the cities  
The bars and the beaches are full  
To keep away from you  
I know Ill meet you  
One day for a lifetime  
Im scared  
One thousand years I could live on your smile  
Im scared  
And run away forever  
  
For all that time Ive been crazy  
There is no escape  
Come back to the city  
Come back in the hotel and wait  
The city waits forever
