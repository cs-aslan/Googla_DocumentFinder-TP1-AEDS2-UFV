Lets dream in the moonlight  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell the stars above me  
Whats in you heart  
  
Lets dream in the moonlight  
Say youre glad you found me  
Put your arms around me  
Before we part  
  
Even though its just pretending  
And the night is almost through  
I can say Im only lending  
When I give my heart to you  
  
Lets dream in the moonlight  
Let your lips touch mine  
Though were only dreaming tonight  
Tonight
