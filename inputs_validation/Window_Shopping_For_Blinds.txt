One day Im loaded next day Im broke  
Spent all my money on whisky and coke  
Riding high till the rock hit the spoke  
Its like window shopping for blinds  
  
Spent all my money on a sunbed tan  
Spoke the best that a young girl can  
Ended up with a blind drunk man  
Its like window shopping for blinds  
  
Its like the heartbreak hotel  
With the heartbreak but nowhere to stay  
The doors are shut on us  
The neon light fading to grey  
  
They say I drink too much to me well thats just profound  
How do you know you cant swim until you have drowned  
  
Well theres always a drop in the bottle lady  
Always a sip of the wine  
The glass doesnt seem quite so empty  
When window shopping for blinds  
  
Its like gatecrashing a field thats not true  
Theyve a harvest they yield  
Save your tears for your evening meal  
When youre window shopping for blinds  
  
One day youre sober next day youre not  
One day remembered the next day forgot  
Spent all my money on cocaine and pot  
Its like window shopping for blinds  
  
Covered in bruises from head to toe  
Noone to speak to and nowhere to go  
A map of nowhere and nowhere I know  
Its like window shopping for blinds  
  
Its like the heartbreak hotel  
With the heartbreak but nowhere to stay  
The doors are shut on us  
The neon light fading to grey  
  
They say I drink too much to me well thats just profound  
How do you know you cant swim until you have drowned  
  
Well theres always a drop in the bottle lady  
Always a sip of the wine  
The glass doesnt seem quite so empty  
When window shopping for blinds  
  
But what if my husband should come  
Well tell me what have you done  
Ive cherished my vodka Ive cherished my rum  
Dont mind us were just licking our wounds in the sun  
  
Its like writing I love you in snow  
You know when you write it the message will go  
I want a message my lover will find  
Dont mind us were just window shopping for blinds
