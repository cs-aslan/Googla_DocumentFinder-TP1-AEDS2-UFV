Lionel Richie  
Itd be so nice  
If you didnt have to feel so lonely  
Itd be so nice  
If I could sneak you for a moment  
  
I know you like to get away go away far away  
To a place where theres just us two  
Got a busy day everyday but not today  
Cause Im Here to take that stress from you  
  
So you can just chill  
And clear your head  
And let me do everything for you cause you deserve it  
Prepare your meal  
And make your bed  
Well let just first make this with you cause you are so worth it  
  
Akon  
I just want us to go go go  
Drop everything and just go go go  
I just want us to go go go  
Drop everything and just go go go  
  
Verse 2  Lionel Richie  
How would you like to sail away in the Bahamas  
Just you and me girl  
So far out in the sea where nobody can find you  
Just the end of the world  
Cause there is no rush  
For you to come back and face the rain  
Cause there is plenty sunshine where I pickin you  
And Im here to reduce the pain  
  
I know you like to get away go away far away  
To a place where theres just us two  
Got a busy day everyday but not today  
Cause Im Here to take that stress from you  
So you can just chill  
And clear your head  
And let me do everything for you cause you deserve it  
Prepare your meal and make your bed  
Well let just first make this with you cause you are so worth it  
  
Akon  
I just want us to go go go  
Drop everything and just go go go  
I just want us to go go go  
Drop everything and just go go go  
  
Lionel Richie  
Just imagine when you tired and  
Layin by my side and  
Sippin on some wine while I stand in massage and  
Releasein all your tension I couldnt handle a time and  
My job is to keep my baby smilin  
  
So you can just chill  
And clear your head  
And let me do everything for you cause you deserve it  
Prepare your meal and make your bed  
Well let just first make this with you cause you are so worth it  
  
Akon  
I just want us to go go go  
Drop everything and just go go go  
I just want us to go go go  
Drop everything and just go go go  
I just want us to go go go  
Drop everything and just go go go  
I just want us to go go go  
Drop everything and just go go go
