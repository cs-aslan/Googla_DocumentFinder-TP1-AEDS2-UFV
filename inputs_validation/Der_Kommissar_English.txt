Zwei drei vier one two three  
Its easy to see  
But its not that I dont care so  
Cause I hear it all the time  
But they never let you know  
On the TV and the radio  
She was young her heart was pure  
But every night is bright she got  
She said sugar is sweet  
She come rappin to the beat  
Then I knew that she was hot  
  
She was singin  
Dont turn around oh oh  
Der Kommissars in town oh oh  
Youre in his eye  
And youll know why  
The more you live  
The faster you will die  
  
Alles klar Herr Kommissar  
  
She said babe you know  
I miss Jill and Joe  
And all my funky friends  
But my street understanding  
was just enough to know what she really meant  
And I got to thinking while she was talking  
That I know she told the story  
Of those special places that she goes  
When she rides with the others in the subway  
  
Singin  
Dont turn around oh oh  
Der Kommissars in town oh oh  
And if he talks to you  
And you dont know why  
You say your life  
Is gonna make you die  
  
Alles klar Herr Kommissar  
  
Well we meet Jill and Joe  
And brother Herr  
And the whole cool gang and oh  
Theyre rappin here theyre rappin there  
But shes climbin on the wall  
Its a clear case Herr Kommissar  
Cause all the children know  
Theyre all slidin down into the valley  
Theyre all slipping on the same snow  
  
Hear the children  
Dont turn around oh oh  
Der Kommissars in town oh oh  
Hes got the power  
And youre so weak  
And youre frustration will not let you speak  
  
Dont turn around oh oh  
Der Kommissars in town oh oh  
And if he talks to you  
Then youll know why  
The more you live  
The faster you will die  
  
Dont turn around oh oh  
Der Kommissars in town oh oh  
repeat x5
