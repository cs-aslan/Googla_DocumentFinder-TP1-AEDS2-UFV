I try and feel the sunshine  
You bring the rain  
You try and hold me down  
With your complaints  
You cry and moan and complain  
You whine an tear  
Up to my neck in sorrow  
The touch you bring  
You just dont step inside to 14 years  
So hard to keep my own headthats what I say  
You knowIve been the beggar  
Ive played the thief  
I was the dogthey all tried to beat  
  
But its been  
Fourteen years of silence  
Its been  
Fourteen years of pain  
Its been  
Fourteen years that are gone forever  
And Ill never have again  
  
Your stupid girlfriends tell you  
That Im to blame  
Well  theyre all usedup hasbeens  
Out of the game  
This time Ill have the last word  
You hear what I say  
I tried to see it your way  
It wont work today  
You dont just step inside to 14 years  
So hard to keep my own headthats what I say  
You knowIve been the dealerhangin on your street  
I was the dogthey all tried to beat  
  
But its been  
Fourteen years of silence  
Its been  
Fourteen years of pain  
Its been  
Fourteen years that are gone forever  
And Ill never have again  
  
Bullshit and contemplation  
Gossips their trade  
If they knew half the real truth  
What would they say  
Well Im past the point of concern  
Its time to play  
These last four years of madness  
Sure put me straight  
You dont get back fourteen years  
In just one day  
So hard to keep my own head  
Just go away  
You knowjust like a hooker she said  
Nothins for free  
Oh I tried to see it your way  
I tried to see it your way
