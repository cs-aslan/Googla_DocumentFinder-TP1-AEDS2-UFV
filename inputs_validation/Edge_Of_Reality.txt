I walk along a thin line darling  
Dark shadows follow me  
Heres where lifes dream lies disillusioned  
The edge of reality  
  
Oh I can hear strange voices echo  
Laughing with mockery  
The border line of doom Im facing  
The edge of reality  
  
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me  
The girl with the nameless face  
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me  
With fears that I cant explain  
She drove me to the point of madness  
The brink of misery  
If shes not real then Im condemned to  
The edge of reality  
  
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me  
The girl with the nameless face  
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me  
With fears that I cant explain  
She drove me to the point of madness  
The brink of misery  
If shes not real then Im condemned to  
The edge of reality  
  
Reality reality reality reality  
Reality reality reality reality
