What would you be if you werent an animal  
Who would you eat if you were a cannibal  
Where do we go when our evolution is done  
  
Youre going home youre tired of incident  
Kicked in the head by a nasty accident  
One with only half opposable thumbs  
  
Give me mine is what were told  
When all we needs a little bit of soul  
Give it up and give away  
Its only yours to borrow anyway  
  
What will you have when theres nothing left to take  
Who will you hit when theres no one left to hate  
Where will you go when youre going out on your own  
  
Were all born in total ignorance  
Perfect as a happy accident  
Lose yourself see how far you can go  
  
Give me silver give me gold  
But all we needs a little bit of soul  
Give it up and give away  
Its only yours to borrow anyway  
  
Give me mine is what were told  
When all we needs a little bit of soul  
Give it up and give away  
Its only yours to borrow anyway  
  
What would you be if you werent an animal  
Who would you eat if you were a cannibal  
Where do we go when our evolution is done
