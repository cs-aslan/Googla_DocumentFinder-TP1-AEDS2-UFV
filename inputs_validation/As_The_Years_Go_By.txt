Well theres nothing I can do  
If you leave me here to cry  
Well theres nothing I can do  
If you leave me here to cry  
You know my love will follow you  
As the years go passing by  
  
I gave you all that I own  
Thats one thing you cant deny  
I gave you all that I own  
Thats one thing you cant deny  
You know my love will follow you  
As the years go passing by  
  
Im gonna leave it up to you  
So longso long good bye  
Im gonna leave it up to you  
So longso long good bye  
You know my love will follow you  
As the years go passing by
