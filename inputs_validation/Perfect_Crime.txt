Kickin back in the shadows  
Got no need for the light  
Whos sorry now old timer  
Look at how youve spent your life  
Scroungin for change  
To put some money in your pocket  
My how scratch does burn  
Laughin at the fuckers as you piss it away  
  
But I got the time and I got the muscle  
I got the need to lay it all on the line  
I aint afraid of your smoke screen hustle  
Its a perfect crime  
God dammit its a perfect crime  
Mother fucker its a perfect crime  
  
I said its perfect  
  
An keep the demons down  
And drag the skeletons out  
I got a blind man followin me in chains  
I said hes fun to watch  
When the world has stopped  
An I think hes got somethin to say  
You want to fuck with me Dont fuck with me  
Cause Im what youll be so dont fuck with me  
If you had better sense  
Youd step aside from the bad side of me  
Dont fuck wit da bad side o me  
Stay way from the bad side o me  
Dont fuck wit da bad side  
  
T minus 109 and counting  
  
Ostracized but thats all right  
I was thinkin about somethin myself  
  
One two three four five six seven eight  
  
Call on everybody whos got last rites  
Said its better  
If you locked em away  
Runnin through the visions  
At the speed of light  
Wont ya let me be  
Mother fucker just let me be  
God dammit better let me be  
Dont ya know ya better let me aaahh  
  
Perfect crime  
God dammit its a a perfect crime  
Mother fucker its a perfect crime  
Dont ya know  
Its a perfect crime
