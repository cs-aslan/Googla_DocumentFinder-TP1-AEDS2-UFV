So Im leaving  
This warehouse frightens me  
Has me tied up in knots  
Cant rest for a moment  
  
Soon Im going  
Im slipping slow away  
Hoping to find something better than  
Ive got inside here  
And the warehouse slips away  
  
Hey reckless mind  
Dont throw away your playful beginning  
You and I will fumble around in the touches  
And be sure to  
  
Leave all the lights on  
So we can see the black cat changing colors  
And we can walk under ladders  
And swim as the tide turns you around and around  
  
Hey we have found  
Becoming one in a million  
Slip into the crowd  
This question I found in the gap in the sidewalk  
  
Keep all your sights on  
The black cat changing colors  
We can walk under ladders  
And swim as the tide choose to turn you  
  
And here I sit  
Life goes on end of tunnel TV set  
Spot in the middle  
Static fade statistic bit  
And soon Ill fade away Ill fade away  
  
This I admit  
Taste so good hard to believe an end to it  
Smell touch feel  
How could this rhythm ever quit  
Bags packed on a plane  
Hopefully to heaven  
  
Shut up Im thinking  
I had a clue now its gone forever  
Sitting over these bones  
You can read in whatever youre needing to  
  
Keep all your sights on  
The big bad black cat thats  
Changing colors  
  
Its not the colors that matter  
But that theyll all fade away  
  
This I admit  
Seems so full  
Hard to believe an end to it  
Warehouse is bare  
Nothing at all inside of it  
Walls and halls have disappeared theyve disappeared  
  
My love I love to stay here  
My love I love to stay here  
My love I love to stay here  
My love I love to stay here  
In a corner was wondering  
If a change could be better than this  
And then I worry  
Maybe things wont be better than they have been here  
Here in the warehouse  
  
At the warehouse  
How I love to stay here  
At the warehouse  
Every man and woman get alive  
  
Thats our blood down there  
Seems poured from the hands of angels  
But trickle into the ground  
Leaves the warehouse bare and empty  
  
My hearts numbered beat  
Still echo in this empty room  
Fear wells in me  
But nothing seems enough to defend  
So I am going away
