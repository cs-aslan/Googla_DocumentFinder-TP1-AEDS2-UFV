Its only been a hour since you left me  
But it feels like a million days  
If I had a magic wand I could turn back time  
Id never let you go away  
  
I didnt have the heart to say Im sorry  
Now I havent got a heart at all  
I could tolerate the pain if I could talk to my best friend  
But you wont even call  
  
Im contemplating pulling out my suitcase  
And packing everything I own  
I didnt back then but I do know now  
Wherever you are is home  
Ill crawl on my belly and beg you  
But youre so far away  
Youve only been gone for an hour  
But it seems like a million days  
  
Its only been a hour since you left me  
I wish I had somebody to blame  
But youre the perfect picture of what love should look like  
And I want to be youre frame  
Its only been a hour but it feels like a million days  
  
A million days  
One hundred thousand million days  
Come home come home baby  
I cant take this no more  
Well come home baby oh yeah  
Baby I know I shouldnt put my faith in heroes  
But I cant see you any other way  
Its only been a hour since you left me girl  
Feels like a million feels like a million days  
  
Come home baby
