Hey Colorado  
It was not so long ago  
I left your mountains to try life on the road  
But Im tired of that race  
It was much too fast a pace  
And I think Ive found my place  
Colorado I want to come home  
  
I had a man there but I left him far behind  
I could have loved him if Id only had the time  
Ah but I stopped along my way  
Just long enough to say  
That Id really like to stay  
But my baby  
You know I have to go  
  
I was too young  
To know what Id done  
I made my plans  
But I was wrong  
Yes I was wrong  
  
Colorado  
Is it too late to change my mind  
Ive done some thinking  
And Im trying hard to find  
A way to come back home  
Cause Ive been so very long alone  
Wont you take care of your own  
Colorado  
I think Im coming home  
I want to come home  
Let me come home
