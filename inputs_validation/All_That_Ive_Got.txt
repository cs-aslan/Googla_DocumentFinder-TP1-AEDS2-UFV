So deep that it didnt even bleed and catch me  
Off guard red handed  
Now Im far from lonely  
I sleep I still see you lying next to me  
So deep that it didnt even bleed and catch me I  
  
I need something else  
Would someone please just give me  
Hit me and knock me out  
And let me go back to sleep  
I cant laugh  
All I want inside I still am empty  
So deep that it didnt even bleed and catch me I  
  
Ill be just fine  
Pretending Im not  
Im far from lonely  
And its all that Ive got  
  
Ill be just fine  
Pretending Im not  
Im far from lonely  
And its all that Ive got  
  
I guess I remember every glance you shot me  
Unharmed Im losing weight and some body heat  
Eyes closed so hard  
I stopped your heart from beating  
So deep that I didnt even scream fuck me I  
  
Ill be just fine  
Pretending Im not  
Im far from lonely  
And its all that Ive got  
  
Ill be just fine  
Pretending Im not  
Im far from lonely  
And its all that Ive got  
  
And its all that Ive got  
Yeah its all that Ive got  
Its all that Ive got  
Its all that Ive got  
  
So deep that it didnt even bleed and catch me  
So deep that I didnt even scream fuck me  
  
Ill be just fine  
Pretending Im not  
Im far from lonely  
And its all that Ive got  
  
Ill be just fine  
Pretending Im not  
Im far from lonely  
And its all that Ive got  
  
And its all that Ive got  
Yeah its all that Ive got
