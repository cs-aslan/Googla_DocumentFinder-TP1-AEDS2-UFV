I feel like an alligator  
Climbing up the escalator  
Climbing up the escalator  
I feel strong  
  
I feel like an aviator pilot  
Bet you wouldnt buy it  
Im feeling violent  
Bet your bleeding eye in turn up and fly it  
Hey hey alligator youve got a lot to learn  
I have got have got a lot to learn  
  
I feel like an autopilot  
Im the worlds strongest island  
I feel like a rage coming under my hood  
I feel good and calm like a robot would  
  
I feel like an autopilot  
I feel like an autopilot  
I am not a hater hater hater hater hater  
Hey hey alligator youve got a lot to learn  
I have got have got a lot to learn  
  
I feel like a contradiction  
Im a walking sciencefiction  
I dont know which way to turn  
Ive got a lot to burn  
Ive got a lot of lot to learn  
  
If I didnt like the way you stared at me  
If I didnt like the way you stared at me  
I could knock sideways I could knock you blind  
I could show you found to the lost and find  
  
I am not an agitator  
I feel like an alligator  
Climbing up the escalator  
Hey hey alligator youve got a lot to learn  
I have got have got a lot to learn  
  
Youve got so much to learn  
You got a lot to learn
