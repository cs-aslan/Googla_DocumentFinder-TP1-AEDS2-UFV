She packed her bags and moved to Florida  
Ive been blue since shes been gone  
And this bowling green motel room  
Is now my old Kentucky home  
All she left me was some whiskey  
And these funny cigarettes she rolled  
It must have been her main intention  
To watch our dreams go up in smoke  
Its another blue grass morning  
Im gonna blow my mind away  
In this smoke old motel room looks  
Like its gonna be another blue grass day  
Shes soakin up the sun in Florida  
Im smokin up this motel room  
Shes sippin drinks down by the ocean  
Im guzzlin blue Kentucky moon  
Its another blue grass morning
