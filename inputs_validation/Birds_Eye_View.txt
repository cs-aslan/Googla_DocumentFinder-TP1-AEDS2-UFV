featuring Tha Alkaholiks  
  
Xzibit  
When it comes to shit like this  
I always get it right the first time  
playa haters and snakes  
waitin for mistakes  
But thats the breaks the highs and lows  
Of the industry  
DITC and X to the Z  
Bringin it live  
Get it crackin to the third degree  
Xzibit breakin niggas down like HIV  
We gring rap to your city like BET  
But still feel California  
Is the place to be Catashtrophy  
  
Tash  
The Alkaholiks is back to fry you  
Xtra crispy  
With the skills that make the plots  
to dis me Xtra risky  
Cause the time it takes to infiltrate  
And stop my forward motion  
California will have broken off  
And fell into the ocean  
Cause i rocked around the world  
With my ill type skill  
Step for real or Ill leave your grill scarred like Seal  
Cause I regulate the sectin where the drinks  
Is gettin blended  
Certifed bartender  
So catch the 40  
When I send it your way  
  
Xzibit  
Niggas that hustle  
Till the day light break  
Go to county 20 times  
Still cant go straight  
Dont nothin in the mothafuckin  
World come free  
Ill never see a nine to five  
Cause it just aint me  
Its like this  
Xzibit shall hustle lift build muscle  
And think like Russell  
Survive and bring it live and direct  
To any crowd through out the world  
Like this come home  
And smoke a spliff in the benz  
With Swift

Lookin at these bitches  
From a birds eye view  
My name is JRo from tthe Likwit Crew  
  
Hurricane G  
So what nigga is it you want to do  
  
JRo  
My flow is metaphorical  
Historicly correct  
What do you expect from a nigga  
With my intellect  
East coast representing West coast gangsta  
New I aint trippin  
I call up King Tee we go dippin  
Through the streets  
Pumpin hard core Likwit beats  
Flowin air blowin loungin  
Inn them leather seats  
Think gback how we used to rock the house party  
Now we just fuckin it up for everybody  
  
Xzibit  
How dare you try to compare  
Yourself to the original  
Professional Xzibit break you down  
Like correctional Facilitys  
Limit all capabilities muthafuck MCs  
Hard to read like Japanese  
Im spreading like disease  
So I cant be stopped  
By who you run with your click  
Or the Btich ass cops  
Xzibits first LP  
It hit your black like crack rock  
Im blowin up your spot by remote  
Mr Cut Throat  
  
JRo  
Im from Cystalifornia  
I warned ya Id be on ya  
The Ro is outer national  
Cold as Hennesota  
I smoke 12 MCs a day  
Just to fill my quota  
From forty 0hio  
All the way to Oregin  
Buddy my fingers are bloody Now Im Washingten  
I clown from Brewyork  
Down to Mitiami  
I soak up game like a shammy  
Understand me  
  
Hook  
  
Tash  
So Elizabeth its MCs  
Thats comin to join ya  
Some will be from NYC And some will be from California  
Cause I drop the lyrics on you  
From beneath the Earths surface  
Where I write rhymes so fresh  
I try to bite my own verses  
Cause the purpose of my flow  
Is to let you know  
My style is badder than the water  
Down in Mexico  
Cause RICO blend styles like juice and gin  
I got the Likwit shit  
That have you seein double  
Like the Twins
