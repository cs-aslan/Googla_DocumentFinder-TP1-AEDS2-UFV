I cant rest in war  
Will you be my friend  
Dark Ages never change  
I cant comprehend  
  
Kiss me we self destruct  
Can you hear me Lord  
Yes I think were fucked  
But I cant rest in war  
  
The righteous and the wicked  
War and peace  
The killing fist  
Of the human beast chorus  
POP  
Prodigies Of Peace  
Hear me when Im calling you  
From my knees  
I am playing for a better day  
  
Holy mother earth  
Crying into space  
Tears on her pretty face  
For she has been raped  
  
Killing your future blood  
Fill her with disease  
Global abortion please  
That is what she needs  
  
chorus  
  
Are we fire flies  
Flashing in the night  
Big thunder rumble fish  
Did you get it right  
  
Headstrong battle song  
Exploding souls be gone  
Marvin Gaye my love  
Where did we go wrong  
  
chorus
