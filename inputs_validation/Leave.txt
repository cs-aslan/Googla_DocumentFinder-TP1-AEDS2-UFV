Do you mean the attack is routine  
A bird asked of a bird  
In this context a concave nest  
How do we learn to hurt  
Do you mean theres no variation  
Watching a dog charge a flock  
Of birds exploding in congregation  
Why plan when when we stop  
I dont know but why suppose  
Cause its not the way it should be  
When you can fly above the great waiting list  
As the crow implies we wont be missed  
We can leave we can leave we can leave you leave  
Its a routine flight for this bird tonight  
Theres more worms than earth in the after life  
Where the blind feed the blind whispering things like  
On the money and Bullseye  
She picks up the little leaves  
Where human wrecks are left to seed  
Left to repaint their deities  
And plaster away at their villainies  
Where theres love and theres hope  
And do you hope those earthbound poets  
Could learn to sing as good as us  
So we can sit back and enjoy our illusions and our quietus  
Well I dont know but why suppose  
Its not the way it should be  
When you can squawk and wait for a word from above  
And change yourself into something you love when you leave  
You leave you leave
