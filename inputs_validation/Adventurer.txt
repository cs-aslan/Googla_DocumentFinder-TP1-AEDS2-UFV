Youre an adventurer  
You sail across the oceans  
You climb the Himalayas  
Seeking truth and beauty as a natural state  
Youre a queen reborn  
Worshiped from above afar  
Some see you as an elixir  
An elemental natural seeking perfect grace  
In a catacomb  
Or cave of endless drawings  
Prehistoric or religious  
Your accomplishments prodigious  
Seeking out the perfect tone  
Your language so clear  
Your voice perfectly turning  
As in the city I sit yearning  
Blowing rings of smoke from thin cigars  
Or driving fast in foreign cars  
To capture your remains  
Youre an adventurer  
A turban wet wrapped round your head  
On the mountainside they predict your death  
Oh how you fooled them all  
But subjects are a poor excuse  
When what you really wants a muse  
An inspirating knowledge of what comes before  
Speeds of light  
The momentary flicker of a candle in its wicker basket  
Smoking wax  facts  
Did you find that superior knowledge that eluded you in college  
Did you find that super vortex that could cause your cerebral cortex  
To lose its grip  
Youre an adventurer  
You were out looking for meaning  
While the rest of us were steaming in an inspirating urban pit  
An adventurer  
You enter as Im dreaming  
I wish Id never wake up  
Differentiating scheming from my one true love  
Youre an adventurer  
You love the angles and the cherries  
The height and width of levies  
The natural bridge and tunnels of the human race  
Youre an adventurer  
Nothing seems to scare you and if it does it wont dissuade you  
You just will not think about it  
You dismiss it and defocus  
You redefine the locus of your time in space  race  
As you move further from me and though I understand the thinking  
And have often done the sane thing I find parts of me gone  
Youre an adventurer  
And though Ill surely miss you  
And of course Ill survive without you and maybe good will come of that  
But at this point I anticipate some grieving  
And although I know your leaving  
Is a necessary adjunct to what we both do  
An adventurer  
Splitting up the atom  
Splitting up the once was  
Splitting up the essence  
Of our starcrossed fate  
None who meet you do forget you  
My adventurer my adventurer  
My adventuress
