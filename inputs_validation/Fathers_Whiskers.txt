I have a dear old daddy  
For whom I nightly pray  
He has a set of whiskers  
That are always in the way  
  
Oh theyre always in the way  
The cows eat them for hay  
They hide the dirt on Daddys shirt  
Theyre always in the way  
  
Father had a strong back  
Now its all caved in  
He stepped upon his whiskers  
And walked up to his chin  
  
Oh theyre always in the way  
The cows eat them for hay  
They hide the dirt on Daddys shirt  
Theyre always in the way  
  
Father has a daughter  
Her name is Ella Mae  
She climbs up fathers whiskers  
And braids them all the way  
  
Oh theyre always in the way  
The cows eat them for hay  
They hide the dirt on Daddys shirt  
Theyre always in the way  
  
I have a dear old mother  
She likes the whiskers too  
She uses them for dusting  
And cleaning out the flue  
  
Oh theyre always in the way  
The cows eat them for hay  
They hide the dirt on Daddys shirt  
Theyre always in the way
