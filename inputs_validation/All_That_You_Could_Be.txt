A star up in the sky will never know  
How lovely is the light that shines below  
Its always there it never fades  
Without its magic light  
How would we find our way  
  
And you dont know how beautiful you are  
If your eyes could see the love thats in your heart  
Then you would know what everybody sees  
That beautiful is all that you could be  
  
What did I feel or think was true  
I cant remember before loving you  
Youve shown me all that love can be  
As beautiful as you are  
It still amazes me  
  
That you dont know
