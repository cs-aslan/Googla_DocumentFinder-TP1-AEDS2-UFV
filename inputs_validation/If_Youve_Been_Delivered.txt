If ya been delivered stand up on your feet and praise the Lord  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah repeat  
Heres the Knowledge get your pen and paper  
A spiritual caper Youll be calling me later  
Seeking Godly wisdom thats 2000 years in the making  
Im taking the lesson that holds your deliverance  
Asking me how God can save a man raise a man  
The enemy he pays your man  
So why you judging me and your buggin me  
Just remember me aint no fearing me

Sabbatical taker innovator in love with the Creator

But lately dont really matter what you say
