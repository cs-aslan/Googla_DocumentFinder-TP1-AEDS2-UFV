It was a hot and steamy night  
Then Frankie pulled his gun in sight  
He said Now Suzi dont you lie  
Did Stevie did he catch you with another guy  
Standing in the line of fire its gonna shoot ya  
Standing in the line of fire its comin to ya  
Its goin through ya  
  
He told her that he had been true  
And that hed never made her blue no  
So dont go sayin Stevies a liar  
Girl Ive got my finder on a hairtrigger wire  
  
Standing in the line of fire its gonna shoot ya  
Standing in the line of fire its comin to ya  
Its goin through ya  
Bye bye bye Suzi  
So long girl  
  
Those gunshots echoed through the town  
Oh Frankie threw his shotgun down  
That roof had moonlight shinin through  
She said shed never never never make him blue yea  
  
Standing in the line of fire its gonna shoot ya  
Standing in the line of fire its comin to ya  
Standing in the line of fire its gonna shoot ya  
Its goin through ya  
Bye bye bye Suzi  
So long
