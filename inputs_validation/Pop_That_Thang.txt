Pop that thang  
Bang bang bang  
Pop that thang  
Bang bang bang  
  
Ting a ling a ling  
I hook it on up  
Get on down  
Now do your stuff  
Come on  
  
Pop that thang  
Bang bang bang  
Pop that thang  
Bang bang bang  
  
If you cant do it right  
Dont you try it again  
Look at that rooster  
Runnin after that hen  
Come on  
  
Pop that thang  
Bang bang bang  
Pop that thang  
Bang bang bang  
  
Sister Rosaline  
Ting a ling a ling  
Look at that child  
Popping that thang  
  
Hitch up to my wagon  
And get ready to roll  
But dont get on board  
If you cant carry the load  
  
If balloon goes down  
I fill it up with wind  
If the record stops  
Start it over again  
  
Pop that thang  
Bang bang bang  
Pop that thang  
Bang bang bang  
  
Ting a ling a ling  
Hook it on up  
Get on down  
And do your own stuff  
  
Pop that thang  
Bang bang bang  
Pop that thang  
Bang bang bang  
  
If you cant do it right  
Dont you try it again  
Look at that rooster  
Running after that hen  
  
Come on and pop it  
Pop it pop it pop it  
Come on and pop it  
Pop it pop it pop it  
Come on and pop it
