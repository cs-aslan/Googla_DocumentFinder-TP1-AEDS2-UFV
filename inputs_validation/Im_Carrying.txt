By dawns first light Ill come back to your room again  
With my carnation hidden by the packages  
Im carrying something  
Im carrying something for you  
  
Ah long time no see baby sure has been a while  
And if my reappearance lacks a sense of style  
Im carrying something  
Im carrying something for you  
  
Im carrying  
Im carrying cant help it  
  
Im carrying  
Im carrying something for you
