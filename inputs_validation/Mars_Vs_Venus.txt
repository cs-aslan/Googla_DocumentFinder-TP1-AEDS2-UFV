initiate radar  
  
Your eyes say it all all  
All  
Theyre fixed upon an object of desire  
You cant control control  
No No  
But gravity compels you to ignite ignite  
And explode explode  
Oh  
Til our time and space combine youll fantasize size  
The unknown  
Ooh  
  
Girl its taking off the ground  
You know how I put it down  
Have you seeing stars baby  
  
This is the big bang so unpredictable  
Sex love  
And find out whose in control  
Mars verses Venus  
But when the worlds collide  
This is the big bang  
Step into the ring of fire  
Sex love  
Lets find out who can tame desire  
  
Seduce and analyze  
Yeah  
Objective is to conquer deep  
And I make paradise

You know how I put it down  
Have you seeing stars ooh

Mars verses Venus  
But when the worlds collide  
This is the big bang  
Step into the ring of fire  
Sex love  
Lets find out who can tame desire  
  
Pitch black  
Across amidst the galaxy between the sheets  
Want that only you and I  
Generate when we collide  
Hold that  
Dont make my emotions peak  
If I let go then Ill be weak  
Your control is my defeat  
I repeat never never never never  
Will I give up no no no no

Repeat x2  
This is the big bang so unpredictable  
Sex love  
And find out whose in control  
Mars verses Venus  
But when the worlds collide  
This is the big bang  
Step into the ring of fire  
Sex love  
Lets find out who can tame desire  
Mars verses Venus  
  
But when the worlds collide
