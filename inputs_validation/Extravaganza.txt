Jamie Fox featuring Kanye West  
  
First Verse  
  
Last night me and my dogs was hanging out  
Tired of being cramped up in the house  
We were simply celebrating life  
Off from work today so its all right  
But all those ups and downs turned me in a twist  
Started dancing with this model chick  
Then every record became our favorite song  
And that is all that I remember  
  
Chorus  
  
Cuz I had one too many drinks  
And ended up at the Embassy  
With this pretty little thing from Memphis Tennessee  
It was a one night extravaganza  
  
Second Verse  
  
When I woke up from last nights salvatry  
Baby doll was laying next to me  
Shoes and clothes was scattered every where  
I got dress and got up out of there  
But not before I call for me a cab  
Hung over from all the drinks I had  
And now Im telling my story to you  
Every thing that I remember  
  
Repeat Chorus 2x  
  
Bridge  
  
Extravaganza Extravaganza  
Only was an extravaganza  
Yes it was  
The things that I remember  
  
Kanye Wests Rap  
And I remember  
Being at the bar  
Trying to ask what that Hpyno hit fo  
Knowing that I cant afford to get mo  
Heres a broke nigga trick  
Buy one bottle and sip slow  
Or or leave the club now  
Do like I did  
Come back when you get dough  
A fish stick nigga  
Now we messing with lobsters  
We messing with Grammies  
We messing with Oscars  
You messing with that dranky drank  
Plus you puffing on the stanky stank  
In the morning you gon draw a blank  
The hotel said that yall was on one  
My girl wasnt on shit  
I picked the wrong one  
Steady talking about I aint like them other girls  
Well tonite Im trying to find them other girls  
Bring they own rubber girl  
Neva meet cha mother girl  
You know they love it when you love them  
And they tell they friends girrrllllll  
  
Repeat Chorus 2x  
  
Ad libs

You know thats just an excuse to do exactly what you want to do
