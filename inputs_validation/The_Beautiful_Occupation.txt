Dont just stand there watching it happening  
I cant stand it  
Dont feel it  
Somethings telling me  
Dont want to go out this way  
But have a nice day  
  
Then read it in the headlines  
Watch it on the TV  
Put it in the background  
Stick it in the bag  
Stick it in the bag  
  
For the beautiful occupation  
The beautiful occupation  
You dont need an invitation  
To drop in upon a nation  
  
Im too cynical  
Im just sitting here  
Im just wasting my time  
Half a million civillians gonna die today  
But look the wrong way  
  
Then read it in the headlines  
Watch it on the TV  
Put it in the background  
Stick it in the bag  
Stick it in the bag  
  
For the beautiful occupation  
The beautiful occupation  
You dont need an invitation  
To drop in upon a nation  
  
Dont just stand there watching it happening  
I cant stand it  
Dont feel it  
Something telling me  
Dont want to go out this way  
But have a nice day  
  
Then read it in the headlines  
Watch it on the TV  
Put it in the background  
Stick in the bag  
Stick in the bag  
  
For the beautiful occupation  
The beautiful occupation  
Dont need an invitation  
To drop in upon a nation  
  
The beautiful occupation  
The beautiful occupation  
So much for an intervention  
Dont call the united nations
