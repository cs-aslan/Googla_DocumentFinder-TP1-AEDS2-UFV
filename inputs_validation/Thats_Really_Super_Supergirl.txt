I cant hold you down  
If you want to fly  
Cant you see Im all broke up inside  
Well just you use your two X Ray eyes  
  
Hurt like Kryptonite  
Put me on my knees  
Now that Ive found out just what youre doing  
With your secret identities  
  
Thats really super Supergirl  
How you saved yourself in seconds flat  
And your friends are going to say  
Thats really super Supergirl  
How youre changing all the worlds weather  
But you couldnt put us back together  
Now I feel like Im tethered deep  
Inside your Fortress of Solitude  
Dont mean to be rude  
But I dont feel super  
Supergirl  
  
I wont call again  
Even in a jam  
Now I realise you could be on a mission  
Saving some other man  
  
Thats really super Supergirl  
How you saved yourself in seconds flat  
And your friends are going to say  
Thats really super Supergirl  
How you stopped the universe from dying  
But youre never going to stop me crying  
And I feel like youre trying hard  
To sweep me like dirt underneath your cape  
Well I might be an ape  
But I used to feel super  
Supergirl  
  
Thats really super Supergirl  
How you saved yourself in seconds flat  
And your friends are going to say  
Thats really super Supergirl  
How youre changing all the worlds weather  
But you couldnt put us back together  
Super Supergirl  
How you stopped the universe from dying  
But youre never going to stop me crying  
Super Supergirl  
Im here in your Fortress of Solitude  
Dont mean to be rude  
But I dont feel super
