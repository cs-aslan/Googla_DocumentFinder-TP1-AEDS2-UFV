You said that you loved me  
And I thought that it was true  
You said that you needed me  
And baby I believed that too  
  
I thought that you were shy  
But you put me straight with a wink of your eye  
I shouldve known better  
Put my hands in my pockets every time I see you cry  
  
People think youre just so sweet  
But they dont know you quite like I do  
I guess they think that Im a lucky guy  
But youre not fooling everybody  
  
Chorus  
You can have my credit card baby  
But keep your red hot fingers off of my heart lady  
All I know is what I see  
Youre getting what you want and girl it aint just me  
No matter how you cry  
Im not giving any love away  
Do you think Im crazy  
All I know is what I see  
And what can I do  
When you pretend that youre in love with me baby  
  
Dont say that you love me  
Because I know that its not true  
Just tell me you need my money  
Girl you know Ill give it to you  
  
Between the ocean and the sky  
There are things that you cant buy  
And if you look youll see  
One of them is me  
Take you hands out of my pockets  
Digging till the day you die  
  
People think youre just so sweet  
But they dont know you quite like I do  
I guess they think that Im a lucky guy  
But youre not fooling anybody  
  
Chorus  
  
These are the things that youve made for yourself  
Youve gotta take your opportunities or stay on the shelf  
Youve gotta stay  
Oh yeah  
Well thats OK  
Its just a game that we play  
  
No matter how you cry  
Im not giving any love away  
Do you think Im crazy  
All I know is what I see  
And what can I do  
When you pretend that youre in love with me baby
