Love where are we going  
And when do we reach the promise on the horizon  
  
Out on the ocean under a sunset  
I was invited to come out and play a while  
with magic and move a mountain  
  
Has anyone ever captured the sun  
Is the eagle ever truly tame  
Given just a little time  
I know that youll find a way  
  
I would do anything for you  
Give up the world Ive made me  
And take you away  
I swear from now on  
The trust in my heart  
The vision of you in my life  
  
My love  
I will be faithful  
but how can I make a promise  
to a place Ive never been  
  
Something has taken me off  
and I dont know if I will survive  
I believe that everything  
Ill ever need is here by the roadside  
  
How can you fly  
keeping heaven in sight  
blinded by the light of day  
  
Given just a little time  
I know that Ill find a way  
  
I would do anything for you  
Listen with all of my spirit  
for ecstasy calling  
You know I believe  
Cause all I have seen  
From the mountain  
The view from the heart  
  
I would do anything for you  
Give up the world Ive made me  
And take you away  
I swear from here on  
The trust in my god  
The vision of you in my life  
  
Freedom is mine  
One beat at a time  
Where are we going  
I just dont know yet  
How will we make it  
I just cant say  
All that I know is that weve finally sailed away  
  
Seems everyones made a prison of love  
But if anybody can escape  
Given just a little time  
I know that well find a way  
  
I would do anything for you  
Listen with all of my spirit  
for ecstasy calling  
You know I believe  
Cause all I have seen  
From the mountain  
The view from the heart  
  
I would do anything for you  
Give up the world Ive made me  
And take you away  
I swear from here on  
The trust in my god  
The vision of you in my life  
  
In my arms Ill pray  
I am safe I am loved I am free baby  
I am safe I am loved I am free baby  
I am safe I am loved I am free baby  
I am safe I am loved I am free baby
