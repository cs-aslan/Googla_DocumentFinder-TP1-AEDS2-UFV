Poor little girl  
With her head in the air  
Theres a poorly sick world all around you  
  
Poor horny boy  
One thing on his mind  
That poor little girl  
He must find you  
  
Chorus  
Theres a whole lotta love  
Shaking inside of me  
And I must figure out why its there  
  
Theres a bottomless heart  
Thats hooked into all of you  
And its wondering how much you care  
  
Poor little girl  
With a whole in her heart  
Theres a poorly sick world all around you  
  
Poor horny boy  
One thing on his mind  
That poor little girl  
He must find you  
  
Theres a whole lotta love  
Shaking inside of me  
And I must figure out why its there  
  
Theres a bottomless heart  
Hooked into all of you  
And its wondering how much you care  
  
Poor little boy  
Head in a whirl  
Theres a phony slick world all around you  
  
That poor little girl  
With her head in the air  
That poor little boy he must find you  
  
Theres a whole lotta love  
Shaking inside of me  
And I must figure out why its there  
  
Theres a bottomless heart  
Hooked into all of you  
And its wondering how much you care  
  
Theres a need and desire I have  
To express whats inside of me  
I must figure it out while its still there  
  
And an endless amout of  
Of a joy that you touch me with  
Thought its almost too much for me to bear  
  
Poor litte girl
