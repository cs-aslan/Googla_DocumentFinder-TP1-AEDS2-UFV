If I was the sun way up there  
Id go with love most everywhere  
Ill be the moon when the sun goes down  
Just to let you know that Im still around  
  
Thats how strong my love is whoa  
Thats how strong my love is  
Thats how strong my love is baby baby  
Thats how strong my love is  
  
Ill be the weeping willow drowning in my tears  
And you can go swimming when youre here  
And Ill be the rainbow after the tears are gone  
Wrap you in my colors and keep you warm  
  
Thats how strong my love is darling  
Thats how strong my love is baby  
Thats how strong my love is whoa  
Thats how strong my love is  
  
Ill be the ocean so deep and wide  
And catch the tears whenever you cry  
Ill be the breeze after the storm is gone  
To dry your eyes and love you warm  
  
Thats how strong my love is baby  
Thats how strong my love is  
Thats how strong my love is darling  
Thats how strong my love is again now  
  
Thats how strong my love is so deep and wide  
Thats how strong my love is  
So much love yes so much love whoa  
Yes so much love yes so much love  
Anything that I can do Ill be good for you  
Any kind of love you want Ill be with you
