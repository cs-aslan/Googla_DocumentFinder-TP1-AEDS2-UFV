I know somewhere they are drivin lovin women makin money all the time  
And ever since I was a little boy thats all Ive ever had on the mind  
I had always been a music man I loved anything that rolls  
And all I want is a piece of the road  
Piece of the road a part of that traffic thats passin me by  
Piece of the road a piece of that great big pie in the sky  
Want you to use me like you want to Lord  
But lemme carry a part of the load cause all I want is a piece of the road  
Well forgive me if I love it just a little too much but you see  
I have always been a part of the road and the road is such a big part of me  
Well each man has his calling and mine is to rattle and roll  
And all I want is a piece of the road  
Piece of the road a part of that traffic thats passin me by  
Piece of the road a piece of that great big pie in the sky  
Want you to use me like you want to Lord  
But lemme carry a part of the load cause all I want is a piece of the road  
Well I aint too good but I aint too bad  
Though Ive been sorry for some things that Ive done  
Ive got to have a piece of the road before I reach the end of my run  
You know time aint no friend to no man Ive got to get a road on this show  
Cause all I want is a piece of the road  
Piece of the road a part of that traffic thats passin me by  
Piece of the road a piece of that great big pie in the sky  
Want you to use me like you want to Lord  
But lemme carry a part of the load cause all I want is a piece of the road  
Now I wanna go to Dallas Fort Worth Los Angeles New York Chicago  
St Louis Olive Hill Kentucky  
All I travel around and see all of them people and pick and sing
