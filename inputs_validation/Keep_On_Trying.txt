Everybody is lazy  
Nobody wants to do anything  
Everyones crazy  
At times i think ive had enough of it  
Living together  
Its not a easy thing to begin  
Making life a little better  
Takes the power of your second please  
Ive been around to love  
Im trying hard i know  
I havent reach my ball  
Ill do what I have to do  
Someday well see it through  
As long as i have you  
  
Weve got to keep on pushing  
weve got to keep on pushing  
Weve got to keep on trying  
weve got to keep on trying  
Weve got to keep on pushing  
weve got to keep on pushing  
Weve got to keep on trying  
weve got to keep on trying  
Weve got to keep on pushing  
weve got to keep on pushing  
Weve got to keep on trying  
weve got to keep on trying  
Weve got to keep on pushing  
weve got to keep on pushing  
Weve got to keep on trying  
weve got to keep on trying
