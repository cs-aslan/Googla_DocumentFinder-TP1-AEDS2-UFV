Deep river woman  
Lord Im coming home to you  
Deep river woman  
Lord I know shes waiting  
Just anticipating all my love  
  
I spent a night in LA  
Just another chance to see you  
Just you and I  
Wanted you to know  
That my playing days are over  
Cause all I do is think of you  
The writings on the wall  
  
Deep river woman  
Lord Im coming home to you  
Deep river woman  
Lord I know shes waiting  
Just anticipating all my love  
  
Ive been out in the world  
Yes the fast life had me going  
Now all thats changed  
I finally make up my mind  
About the one thing  
Ive been knowing  
Youre the only girl  
Ive ever cared for in this world  
  
Deep river woman  
Lord Im coming home to you  
Deep river woman  
Lord I know shes waiting  
Just anticipating all my love  
  
You kind of love girl is forever  
It took me a long time to realize  
That Ive come so far  
And end up going nowhere  
Oh girl I need you by my side  
  
Oh deep river woman  
Lord Im coming home to you  
Deep river woman  
Lord I know shes waiting  
Just anticipating all my love
