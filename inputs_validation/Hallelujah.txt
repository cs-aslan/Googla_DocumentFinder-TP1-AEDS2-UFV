All the years combine they melt into a dream  
A broken angel sings from a guitar  
In the end theres just a song comes cryin up the night  
Through all the broken dreams and vanished years  
Stella blue Stella blue  
  
When all the cards are down theres nothing left to see  
Theres just the pavement left and broken dreams  
  
In the end theres still that song comes cryin like the wind  
Down every lonely street thats ever been  
Stella blue Stella blue  
  
Ive stayed in every bluelight cheap hotel cant win for trying  
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time  
Gonna make them shine shine  
  
It all rolls into one and nothing comes for free  
Theres nothing you can hold for very long  
And when you hear that song come crying like the wind  
It seems like all this life was just a dream  
Stella blue Stella blue
