When the Texas moon is shining down on Austin  
When it shines across the Rio Grande  
When it comes to makin love  
Under the stars above  
Well honey Ill take Texas everytime  
  
We danced in every ballroom down in Beaumont  
And we strolled the river walk in San Antone  
Its where we fell in love  
Like to young turtle doves  
Well honey Ill take Texas everytime  
  
When it comes to makin love  
Under the stars above  
Honey Ill take Texas  
Honey Ill take Texas  
Honey Ill take Texas  
Honey Ill take Texas everytime
