I went down to the highway  
That runs between love and pride  
And I tried to get sideways  
Across the great divide  
But my minds eyes on the key ring  
Crying in misery  
Cause it wont spend one more evening  
Staring back at me  
  
It may be by choice or a small inner voice I cant say  
When you add up the cost we all have a cross  
How do you write off the loss  
  
Where do I go from here  
How do I find my way  
When is it loud and clear  
That theres no turning back No looking back  
Where do I go from here  
Nobody gets away  
Its a new kind of fix  
For the poor and the rich  
You never know whats coming next at the turning point  
  
The rules are unwritten  
And nobody knows the deal  
Where have I been driven  
Are deamons behind the wheel  
Yeah I know my days are numbered  
Were only flesh and bone  
And Ive been left to wonder  
How it went so wrong  
  
Is it all tailor made can the sinner be saved I cant say  
So dont hang your hat on the knife Im my back  
Cause nobody treats me like that  
  
Where do I go from here  
How do I find my way  
When is it loud and clear  
That theres no turning back No looking back  
Where do I go from here  
Nobody gets away  
Its a new kind of fix  
For the poor and the rich  
You never know whats coming next at the turning point
