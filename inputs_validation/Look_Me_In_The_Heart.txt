Last night we tried to touch but we never got close  
Last night we tried to talk the words got caught in our throats  
When we finally fell asleep  
We couldnt have been further apart  
  
Look me in the heart  
If you think that love is blind  
Baby look me in the heart  
And youll see that Im so crazy about you baby  
And its not in my mind  
Cant you look me in the heart  
Look me in the heart  
  
You try to say that Im hiding from you  
You act like a spy always looking for clues  
Youve read about my past  
But why dont we try to make a new start  
  
Look me in the heart  
If you think that love is blind  
Baby look me in the heart  
And youll see that Im so crazy about you baby  
And its not in my mind  
Cant you look me in the heart  
Look me in the heart  
  
Remember how good we used to be together  
Remember baby so be tender baby  
Remember the love we said would last forever  
I know we can make it like that again
