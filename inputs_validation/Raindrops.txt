Can you hear the sounds of the love angels calling us  
Sweet violinsand harps playing  
Then suddenly theres this kiss of trust  
Damper than the morning dewtonight has chosen me and you  
And girl I vow to make everyone of your fantasies come true  
  
I can here the horns sounding  
Bells ringing a full orchestra  
And the choir singing  
The oceans calm and the rivers flowing  
It feels so good keep on going  
  
Rain drops keep fallin on our headsas we make love  
We wont stop the rain keeps fallin down on both of us  
Rain drops keep fallin on our heads as we make love  
We wont stop the rain keeps fallin down on both of us  
  
Can you see the flowers bloomingslowly as the seasons change  
The gift of joy is found in when I softly here you call my name  
Rose pedals and all these oils surrounded by a hundred candles  
The eagle delivers a letter that says this night will last forever  
  
Damper than the morning dewthe night has chosen me and you  
And girl I promise to make everyone of your fantasies come tru  
  
I can here the horns sounding bells ringing a full orchestra  
And the choir singingthe oceans calm and the rivers flowing  
Dont you stop just keep on going  
  
Rain drops keep fallin on our headsas we make love  
We wont stop the rain keeps fallin down on both of us  
Rain drops keep fallin on our heads as we make love  
We wont stop the rain keeps fallin down on both of us  
  
Through all the trees the smooth wind blowsthen suddenly a rainbow  
An ocean filled with white sail boats and huge waterfalls that overflow  
 and fairy tales  
  
And imagine far away from here  
Where the land crys joyful tears  
  
Repeat x2  
Rain drops keep fallin on our headsas we make love  
We wont stop the rain keeps fallin down on both of us  
Rain drops keep fallin on our headsas we make love  
We wont stop the rain keeps fallin down on both of us
