Im getting wise to you  
Youre going to see  
Im going to work on you  
The way you worked on me  
I got a sharper aim  
And youre in my sights  
And if Im going to go  
Im going in a blaze of lights  
  
And in this crazy world of hit and run  
There are no laws here  
Just a loaded gun  
  
Shes got a mean disposition  
Shes got a big shooter too  
Shes got a mean disposition  
Really make a mess  
Really make a mess out of you  
  
I never close my eyes  
I never sleep  
Im staying on my guard  
Waiting for my flesh to creep  
And I never trusted you  
You never trusted me  
Ill do a deal with you  
If youll do a deal with me  
  
For me the nightmares only just begun  
There is no law here  
Just a loaded gun  
  
Shes got a mean disposition  
Got a big shooter too  
Shes got a mean disposition  
Got a bad attitude  
Shes got a mean disposition  
Going to cut your half  
Going to cut your half in two  
  
Im going have to stand my ground  
Like Crockett at the Alamo  
Im going to draw the line  
One of us has got to go  
  
Shes got a mean disposition  
Got a big shooter too  
Shes got a mean disposition  
Got a bad attitude  
Shes got a mean disposition  
Going to make a mess out of you  
Shes got a mean disposition  
Going to cut your half  
Going to cut your half in two
