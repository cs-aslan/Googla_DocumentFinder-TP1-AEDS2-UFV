The love that you gave me has gone with the rain  
The joy that just filled me has turned into pain  
  
My face in the mirror reminds me of you  
Its the one that you lied to when you said youd be true  
  
The tears in my eyes are all that youll find  
The scars on my face just deepen my mind  
  
The love that you gave me has gone with the rain  
The joy that just filled me has turned into pain
