But you act like Im alright is something I just cant do  
Something I just cant do

So something I just cant do  
What if I could Im just not strong enough to whoa  
Not strong enough to who

I can see you looking at me  
Youre thinking too little too late  
Cause it was me that said that we shouldnt be

My pride it made me lie lie lie  
To you and to myself about what I need  
So now I walk around with this lie truly dying inside  
Acting like Im just fine its something I just cant do
