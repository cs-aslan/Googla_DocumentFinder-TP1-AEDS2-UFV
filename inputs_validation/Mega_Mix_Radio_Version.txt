By the rivers of babylonwhere we sat down  
Yeah we wept remembered zion  
Yeah we wept remembered zion  
When the wicked carried us away in captivity  
Required from us a song  
Now how shall we sing the lords song in a strange land  
Sunny yesterday my life was filled with rain  
Sunny you smiled at me and really eased the pain  
The dark days are gone and the bright days are here  
My sunny one shines so sincere  
Sunny one so true I love you  
Freeze  
Im ma baker but yer hans in the air an gimme all yer money  
  
Shes crazy like a fool what about daddy cool  
Daddy daddy cool daddy daddy cool  
Daddy daddy cool daddy daddy cool  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey  
  
There lived a certain man in russia long ago  
He was big and strong in his eyes a flaming glow  
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear  
But the moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear  
He could preach the bible like a preacher full of ecstasy and fire  
But he also was a kind of teacher in them put desire  
  
Ra ra rasputin  
Lover of the russian queen  
They put some poison in his wine  
Ra ra rasputin  
Russias greatest love machine  
He drank it all an set up in fire  
  
Ra ra rasputin  
Lover of the russian queen  
They didnt quit they wanted his head  
Ra ra rasputin  
Russias greatest love machine  
An so they shot him til he was dead  
O those Russians
