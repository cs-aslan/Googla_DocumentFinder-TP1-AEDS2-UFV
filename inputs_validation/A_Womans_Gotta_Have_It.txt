Oh oh oh  
A womans gotta have it  
A womans gotta have it  
  
Do the things that keep a smile on her face  
Say the words that make her feel better everyday  
You betcha better keep on your ps and qs  
If you dont your woman you could easily lose  
  
Oh I had love a true love and I lost it  
And no one seems to understand  
About the pain that it cost me  
A womans gotta have it I believe  
  
Shes got to know that shes needed around  
When you kiss her you got to make her feel it  
She wants to know that shes not walking on shaky ground  
When you miss her you got to be 4realin  
Make her know that shes needed around  
  
Dont take for granted the smile upon her face  
Check a little bit closer you might find a tear trace  
Maybe the little girl never said a mufflin word  
But shes got to know that her voice is heard  
  
Oh I had love a true love and I lost it  
And no one seems to understand  
About the pain that it cost me  
A womans gotta have it I believe that I should know  
  
Shes got to know that shes needed around  
When you kiss her you got to make her feel it  
She wants to know that shes not walking on shaky ground  
When you miss her you got to be 4realin  
Make her know that shes needed around  
  
Oh I had love a true love and I lost it  
Now Im sufferin all this pain  
That the true love cost me  
A womans gotta have it I believe that I should know  
  
Shes got to know that shes needed around  
When you kiss her you got to make her feel it  
She wants to know that shes not walking on shaky ground  
When you miss her you got to be 4realin  
Make her know that shes needed around
