Its easy when youre sorry  
And youre lonely  
I know this girl that spied on her boyfriend  
In case he might miss an fall he just might miss and fall  
She said its not that I dont trust him  
Ive just gotta be sure Ive just gotta be sure  
I know this kid that signed himself up to a gym  
His palls kepp nagging him about his chicken chest  
Well youll never get a girl that way youve gotta pump up  
Chorus  
What if love isnt only about  
And if love isnt only about  
Two people in love with themselves  
What if love isnt only about  
And if love isnt only about  
Two people involved with themselves honey  
Tom goes to law school his father wants him to  
Youve got to make me proud son youve got to fill me in  
Youve got to lead the life I never lived  
Julys got a baby now no one invites her to a party  
Kids are too inconvenient there days  
July dont care she dont miss anyting  
Chorus  
Chorus  
Row row row down the river  
Row row row down the road
