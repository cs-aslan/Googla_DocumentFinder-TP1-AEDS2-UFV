Shed wake us up early  
Every mornin  
Shed help us say our prayers  
Every night  
She was always there to help us  
Through the hard times  
We could count on her  
To make everything alright  
  
I remember swingin on the front porch  
Papa said theres somethin  
I need to say tonight  
Mamas been sick for a long time  
Lets pray to God  
She can make it through the night  
  
Chorus  
Mama dont wanna say goodbye  
She said  
Wipe those tears from your eyes  
Mama I dont wanna say goodbye  
It was written in the heavens  
And the skies above  
Son I gave you birth  
Showed you all my love  
I cant think of this life without you  
Its hard to try  
Mama Im afraid to say goodbye  
  
Now kids  
Ive been hangin on a long time  
I hate to leave this world  
Before youre grown  
Remember everything  
That Ive taught you  
Remember all the good times  
When Im gone  
  
Chorus  
  
She whispered in my ear  
Before she passed away  
Son its time to be a man  
Aint nothin left to say  
Jesus walked on water I know its true  
When it comes time hell call you home  
I hope youre ready too  
  
Chorus
