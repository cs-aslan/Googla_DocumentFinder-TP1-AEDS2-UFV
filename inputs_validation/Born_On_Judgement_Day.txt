My mother died close to me  
And while I lie sobbin here  
This worlds going down with fear  
Armies of minions is all I see  
Creatures in anguish no place to flee  
Living their nightmares the fall from grace  
And so Im standing here  
  
Chorus  
I was born on Judgment Day  
And I have no words to say  
Dont know good or bad  
Kinda feel so sad  
But still I sing this song for you  
  
Theres no one beside me  
Im shuddering wearily  
Utterly destitute and all  
Nobility has left mankind  
Turned into vultures bewildered eyes  
  
Shoved to the abyss a twisting whirl  
Under the blood red sky  
  
Chorus x2
