My love  
Theres only you in my life  
The only thing thats right  
My first love  
Youre every breath I take  
Youre every step I make  
  
And I  
I want to share  
All my love with you  
No one else will do  
And your eyes your eyes your eyes  
They tell me how much you care  
Oh yes  
Youll always be  
My endless love  
  
Two hearts  
Two hearts that beat as one  
Our lives have just begun  
And forever  
Ill hold you close in my arms  
I cant resist your charms  
  
And I  
Id play the fool  
For you Im sure  
You know I dont mind  
No you know I dont mind  
And yes  
You mean the world to me  
I know Ive found in you  
My endless love  
  
And love  
Id play the fool  
For you Im sure  
You know I dont mind  
Whoa you know I dont mind  
Oh yes  
Youd be the only one  
Cause no I cant deny  
This love I have inside  
And Ill give it all to you  
My love my love my love
