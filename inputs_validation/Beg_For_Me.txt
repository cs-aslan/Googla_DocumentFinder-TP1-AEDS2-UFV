Everyone is looking at me  
I cant get out of bed  
There is evil in my head  
Just let me be  
Because when I hit the stage  
It is gone and I am free  
Goddamn you say youll get up for me  
  
Youre the crowd come on give it back to me  
You wont beg for me beg for me beg for me  
  
Goddamn you say youll get up with me  
Youre the crowd come on give it back to me  
You wont beg for me be there for me beg for me  
  
Tell me how could this fade  
I am going in shame  
And I could not have my pain  
Everyone please let me be  
Cause were on stage  
And its gone and I am free  
  
Goddamn you say youll get up with me  
Youre the crowd come on give it back to me  
You wont beg for me beg for me beg for me  
  
Goddamn you say youll get up with me  
Youre the crowd come on give it back to me  
You wont beg for me be there for me beg for me  
  
I feel the shame  
Im not insane  
The things I feel now  
Arent the same  
Who gives a fuck  
  
If my life sucks  
I just know one day  
I wont give up  
  
Everyone just let me be  
  
Goddamn you say youll get up with me  
Youre the crowd come on give it back to me  
You wont beg for me beg for me beg for me  
  
Goddamn you say youll get up with me  
Youre the crowd come on give it back to me  
You wont beg for me be there for me beg for me  
  
Be there for me
