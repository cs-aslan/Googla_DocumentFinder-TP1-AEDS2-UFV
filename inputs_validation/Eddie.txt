I woke up today the papers spoke of a man we know  
Hes made of the stuff they say that first made our country grow  
Living in style traveling to distant lands  
Better hang tough for now its time to make your stand  
Can we ignore the basic facts of history  
Or deny what people say is destiny  
I think the message is ever so loud and clear  
  
Eddie now dont you run  
You know youre a bootleggers son  
And you saw just what its done to the others  
Eddie now dont you run  
Its the end of all your fun  
And you saw just what theyve done  
To your brothers  
  
Can we ignore the basic facts of history  
Or deny what people say is destiny  
First in the eighties but last of the sons  
First in the eyes of his countrymen  
I think the message is ever so loud and clear  
  
Eddie now dont you run  
You know youre a bootleggers son  
And you saw just what its done to the others  
Eddie now dont you run  
Its the end of all your fun  
And you saw just what theyve done  
To your brothers
