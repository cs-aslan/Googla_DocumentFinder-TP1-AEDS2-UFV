Give me a ride on your roller coaster  
Give me a thrill I cant help feelin bored  
Give me a dime to call my baby closer  
cause Im alone Im feelin bored  
I cant help thinking Im ignored  
  
Ive been away far too long to recall  
Just what its like to be among my friends  
Give me a pill to ease my nervous tension  
cause I cant hardly see the end  
I long to be among my friends  
  
Ive been on the road for too long I dont know  
Im walking around and I dont know where to go  
Well Im halfcrazed and I dont know who to be  
Wont you please Help me please  
Wont you please I long to be at ease  
  
Give me a ride on your magic carpet  
Take me away from this mediocrity  
What must I do to get me feeling better  
I guess it all boils down to me  
Responsibilitys on me
