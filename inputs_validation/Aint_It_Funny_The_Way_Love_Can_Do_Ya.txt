She had good intentions and I had the same  
She kept the baby and left me the blame  
We both had our reasons but they werent the same  
Aint it funny the way love can do ya  
  
We made a promise wed never break up our home  
Or ever find reasons for leaving each other alone but we did  
Once we were strangers then we were friends  
Next we were lovers now were strangers again  
Aint it funny the way love can do ya But it did  
  
I had good intentions and she had the same  
She kept the heartaches and left me the shame  
We both have our memories but theyre not the same  
Aint it funny the way love can do ya  
  
We made a promise wed never break up our home  
Or ever find reasons for leaving each other alone but we did  
Once we were strangers then we were friends  
Next we were lovers now were strangers again  
Aint it funny the way love can do ya But it did
