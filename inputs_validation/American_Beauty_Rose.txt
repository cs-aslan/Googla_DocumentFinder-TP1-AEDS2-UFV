Daisy is darling Iris is sweet  
Lily is lovely Blossoms a treat  
Of all the sweethearts  a guy could meet  
Well I finally chose an American beauty rose  
  
Camelias tragic she cant be mine  
Magnolias magic it makes Maggie shine  
Laurel will hug you Orchids divine  
Still I finally chose an American beauty rose  
  
Shes clingier than Ivy and shes zingier than blackeyed Susan  
And springier than Mabel in June  
Im daffy as a daffodil its laughable the way I thrill  
When roses are in bloom  
  
Pansy is pretty Willow is tall  
Violets kisses tulips two lips recall Violets kiss is Tulips recall  
How can I choose one I love em all  
Still I finally chose an American beauty rose
