I wake up in the morning  
I walk out on the street  
And my face lights up with all the smiles  
Of all the friends I meet  
And my lifes almost complete  
Cause I can dream of you  
  
And I dont feel no heartache  
And I dont feel no pain  
And I dont feel all those angry souls  
That are standing in the rain  
And my lifes peaceful once again  
Cause I can dream of you  
  
Then I wake myself up  
I take a look around  
And theres not much I can say  
No ones here to say it to why anyway  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
  
My day and night  
Theyre just about the same  
I think Ill just call them gray  
But I think of you  
And the sun breaks through  
And Im glad to live my life this way  
  
Youre so understanding  
So gentle and serene  
And I swear youve got the sweetest eyes  
That Ive ever seen  
And I pray that I may never lose  
A single dream of you  
  
Lord knows that Ill be in for hard times  
Pain will know my soul  
And the wind is blowing from the North  
And it comes down so cold  
I know never will I lose all hope  
Cause I can dream of you  
  
I know never will I lose all hope  
Cause I can dream of you
