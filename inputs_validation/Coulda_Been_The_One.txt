Looking back its hard for me to see  
Just how I could have been so blind  
Like an actor on a movie screen  
You played the part with every line  
Well every story doesnt have a happy ending  
Sometimes a flower doesnt grow  
  
I hope you understand the message that Im sending  
But boy I think you need to know  
  
Coulda been the one  
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo  
Shoulda been the one  
Didnt know just what you had boy  
Now its just too bad boy  
After all is said and done  
Youre a cheater and a liar  
Went to play with fire  
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun  
cause you coulda been the one  
  
Theres nothing left to say  
Coulda been the one  
Coulda been  
Shoulda been  
  
My momma didnt raise no fool  
She said play with fire you get burned  
You laughed at me I laugh at you  
Now it seems the tables turned  
I must admit I really thought you had potential  
But I could not have been more wrong  
I need somebody I can trust with his essentials  
You had your chance but now Im long gone  
  
Coulda been the one  
I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo  
Shoulda been the one  
Didnt know just what you had boy  
Now its just too bad boy  
After all is said and done  
Youre a cheater and a liar  
Went to play with fire  
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun  
cause you coulda been the one  
  
You coulda been the one baby  
You coulda been the one  
Oh yeah  
  
You played yourself boy  
And there is no denying it  
Its just the way the story goes  
You made your bed boy  
Better go and lay in it  
But know that youll be laying there alone  
  
You coulda been the one  
  
Coulda been the one  
I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo  
Shoulda been the one  
Didnt know just what you had boy  
Now its just too bad boy  
After all is said and done  
Youre a cheater and a liar  
Went to play with fire  
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun  
Cause you coulda been the one
