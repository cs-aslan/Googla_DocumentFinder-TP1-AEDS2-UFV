All is fair in love boy  
When the love is shared  
Now youve been acting for some time  
Like you just dont care  
About me  
  
Well my mama used to say  
That there would come a day  
When fools begin to open up their eyes  
  
Chorus  
You never miss the water  
Till the well runs dry  
Now I have had enough bad love  
So Im telling you goodbye goodbye  
  
Youve been taking me for granted  
You even made me cry  
And sorry just aint good enough  
Baby not this time  
  
My mama used to say  
That there would come a day  
When the truth can no longer be denied  
  
Youre gonna miss my love  
Youre gonna miss my love  
Youre gonna miss my love  
  
You never miss the water  
Till the well runs dry for ya  
  
My mama used to say  
That there would come a day  
When you would run but baby you cant hide
