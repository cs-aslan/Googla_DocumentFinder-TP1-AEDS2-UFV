Here I am again in this mean old town  
And youre so far away from me  
And where are you when the sun goes down  
Youre so far away from me  
  
Chorus  
So far away from me  
So far I just cant see  
So far away from me  
Youre so far away from me  
  
Im tired of being in love and being all alone  
When youre so far away from me  
Im tired of making out on the telephone  
And youre so far away from me  
  
Chorus  
So far away from me  
So far I just cant see  
So far away from me  
Youre so far away from me  
  
And I get so tired when I have to explain  
When youre so far away from me  
See youve been in the sun and Ive been in the rain  
And youre so far away from me  
  
Chorus  
So far away from me  
So far I just cant see  
So far away from me  
Youre so far away from me
