Daybreak  
At the bottom of lake  
Its a hundred degrees a I cant breath  
And I wont get out  
til I figure it out  
Thought Im weak like I cant believe  
So you tell me trust me I can trust you  
Just let me show you  
But I gotta work it out in a shadow of doubt  
Cause I dont know if I know you  
  
Doing fine but dont waste me time  
Tell me what it is you want to say  
You sin you win just let me in  hurry  
Ive been out in the rain all day  
So you tell me trust you I can trust you  
As far as I can throw you  
And Im trying to get out of a shadow of doubt  
cause I dont know if I know you  
  
Chorus  
Dont tell me you wanted me  
Dont tell me you thought of me  
I wont I swear I wont  
did  
Ill try I swear Ill try  
lie  
  
Mother Mary quite contrary  
Kiss the boys and make them wary  
Things are getting just a little bit scary  
Its a wonder I can still breath  
Never been much of a doubting thomas  
But nothing breaks like a broken promise  
You tell me bout your two more coming  
But once is just enough for me  
  
Chorus  
  
I had gotten used to being a soul destroyed  
She comes in apparently to fill the void  
All dogs need a leash and  
At least Ill forget it  
And she would never hurt me though shes never said it  
But Im not gonna ask her today  
I dont want to scare her away  
Oh Your town Im all alone  
And I just cant stare at the phone  
I want to talk about lifelong mistakes  
And you can tell your stepfather I said so  
  
Chorus
