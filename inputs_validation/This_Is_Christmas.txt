Dont be discouraged dont be dismayed  
Theres hope for all in this world  
Cause this is Christmas day  
Say a little prayer for the world  
God teach us love  
Though you think that He doesnt hear  
I know he does  
  
This is Christmas let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin today  
  
Christmas bells ring peoples hearts sing  
And I forget about all the troubles I seem to have  
Aand I tell myself to feel how my brother feels  
Try to love him and maybe then Ill understand him  
Make a little room in our hearts  
No hearts too small  
Cant we love each other today  
Cause after all  
  
This is Christmas let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin today  
  
Come come come see the little one  
Come come come see the little one  
Come see the baby  
Come see the baby  
  
This is Christmas let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin today  
  
This is Christmas let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin  
  
This is Christmas let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin  
  
This is Christmas
