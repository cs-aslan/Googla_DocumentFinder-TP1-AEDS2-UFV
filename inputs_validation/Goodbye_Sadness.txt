Goodbye sadness goodbye goodbye  
I dont need you anymore  
I wet my pillow evry night  
But now I saw the light  
  
Goodbye goodbye sadness  
I dont need you anymore  
Goodbye goodbye sadness  
I cant take it anymore  
  
Goodbye sadness goodbye goodbye  
I dont need you anymore  
I lived in fear evry day  
But now Im going my way  
  
Goodbye goodbye sadness  
I dont need you anymore  
Goodbye goodbye sadness  
I cant take it anymore  
  
Hello happiness wherever you are  
I hope you hear my song  
Never want to cry again  
Or hold my breath in fear again  
  
Goodbye goodbye sadness  
I dont need you anymore  
Goodbye goodbye sadness  
I cant take it anymore
