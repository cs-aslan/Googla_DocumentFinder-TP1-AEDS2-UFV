My soul is in the mountains  
My heart is in the land  
Im lost here in the city  
Theres so much I dont understand  
  
Theres quiet desperation comin over me  
Comin over me  
  
Ive got to leave I cant stay another day  
Theres an emptiness inside of me  
I cant bear the loneliness out here  
Theres another place Ive got to be  
  
I long for you Dakota  
Smell of sweet grass on the plain  
I see too much meanness  
And I feel too much pain  
  
Theres quiet desperation comin over me  
Comin over me  
  
Ive got to leave I cant stay another day  
Theres an emptiness inside of me  
I cant bear the loneliness out here  
Theres another place Ive got to be
