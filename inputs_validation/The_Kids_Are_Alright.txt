I dont mind other guys dancing with my girl  
Thats fine I know them all pretty well  
But I know sometimes I must get out in the light  
Better leave her behind with the kids theyre alright  
The kids are alright  
  
Sometimes I feel I gotta get away  
Bells chime I know I gotta get away  
And I know if I dont Ill go out of my mind  
Better leave her behind with the kids theyre alright  
The kids are alright  
  
I know if I go things would be a lot better for her  
I had things planned but her folks wouldnt let her  
  
I dont mind other guys dancing with my girl  
Thats fine I know them all pretty well  
But I know sometimes I must get out in the light  
Better leave her behind with the kids theyre alright  
The kids are alright  
  
Sometimes I feel I gotta get away  
Bells chime I know I gotta get away  
And I know if I dont Ill go out of my mind  
Better leave her behind with the kids theyre alright  
The kids are alright
