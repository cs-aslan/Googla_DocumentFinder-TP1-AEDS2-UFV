Pardon me I want to talk to you  
I may be kinda shy But I just gotta tell you  
What Im going to do  
Someone over there says He wants to get to know you  
I dont care cause  
I really want to hold you  
And Im so scared

To you that you like  
Now Ive been waiting  
Such a bloody long time  
Just to get this close to you  
Now that youre near me  
I want you to hear me  
Ill tell you what I want to do  
Oh I want to do it  
Do it all night  
I want to do it  
Do it to you right  
Giving up so easy  
Is something that I never do  
But Im so easy so easy  
When it comes to loving you Cant you understand that I want  
To hug and kiss you  
Ill do anything I can just  
To give you happiness  
And I drown baby drown baby  
In your arms cmon baby  
Cant you get to this  
Ive been waiting such a bloody long time  
And youre talking to someone else  
Now that Ive got your attention
