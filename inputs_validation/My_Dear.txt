Here in the dawn  
As I walk through this dream  
As I have done since ages now gone  
Shall I read you the letter  
They sent postmarked from somewhere out here  
Its in Latin I think I dont know  
Can you help me my dear  
Please can you help me my dear  
Near to their bed they never sleep  
They sit sipping their tea watch the sea  
Move the sand through their heads sit in their chairs by the bay  
Did I show you the marks on the wall  
Left by captains now dead house out on the cove  
They fell fighting for peace in their lives  
Or so it is said still nobody seems to be here  
Please can you help me my dear  
Please can you help me my dear  
You cant miss it  
A blue forest on a green sky  
You must risk it  
Dont ignore us if you want us to  
If we want us to survive  
Where will I be cant you help me to find my way  
After watching them walking the pier  
At the mouth of the sea Ive been lost for so long  
Theyre in love with the news  
And dont show if theyre living in fear still nobody seems to be here  
They eat ice cream alone  
Watch the waves at the end of the pier ah nobody seems to hear  
Please can you help me my dear  
Please can you help me my dear
