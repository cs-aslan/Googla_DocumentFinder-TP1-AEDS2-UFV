Well theres a cross on the hill where the ragweed has grown  
Where a mothers young son sleeps all alone  
All for the land that he dreamed he could save  
Yeah theres none so beautiful as the brave  
Oh theres a stone in the meadow with all the weight of the world  
Where the flowers are watered by the brown eyes of a girl  
She cries for the life that her one true love gave  
Yeah theres none so beautiful as the brave  
None so beautiful as the boy who cries freedom  
None so beautiful as the voice that carries far  
None so strong as love beyond all reason that fears no evil  
Undaunted by the dark or any wicked mans heart  
Oh theres a cross on a hill where no steeple bells ring  
A shrine with no name where little children sing to the rhythm that rocks us  
From the cradle to the grave  
Yeah theres none so beautiful  
Oh theres none so beautiful  
Oh theres none so beautiful as the brave  
Theres none so beautiful as the brave
