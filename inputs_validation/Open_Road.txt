I was somewhere on the open road  
Between the east and the west   
It was a no mans land  
And rumor says that it was a wilderness  
Forty days it took me forty nights  
Ive done some wrong  
But Ive done some right  
Theres no turning back  
cause the lights are burning up ahead  
Lead me to an open road  
And put me on the freeway  
Lead me to an open road  
And put me on the freeway  
  
I was traveling twice the speed of sound  
Down a white line  
Trying to be in the right place  
At the right time  
You cant stop me making tracks  
Now Im on the run  
cause I set my sights on this road I ride  
Its the only one  
Lead me to an open road  
And put me on the freeway  
Lead me to an open road  
And put me on the freeway  
I can read the signs that I left behind  
Like an open book  
And I cant forget the things that you said  
And the way you looked  
I still hold the keys to the memory of the times weve seen  
So when I look back  
Things are not as black as they might have been
