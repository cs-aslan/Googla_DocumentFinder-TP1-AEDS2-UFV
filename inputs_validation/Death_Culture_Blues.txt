Wizards kiss dragons breath  
Pot of gold payable on death  
  
You think youre on the winning team  
But its no game though it just might be a dream  
  
Highest hill to lowest pit  
If you aint got love you aint got shit  
Cause its your life to live or to lose  
Im tired of singing the death culture blues  
  
Now were told just to get in line  
And bowo down the almighty dollar sign  
Battle turns from left to right  
But Im not going down without a fight  
  
Ive done my time I took my bath  
Im back on track down the shining pathy  
Cause its your life to live or to lose  
Ive tired of singing the death culture blues
