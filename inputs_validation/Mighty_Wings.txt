Its just a ball of dust  
Underneath my feet  
It rolls around the sun  
Doesnt mean that much to me  
  
I take a chance on the edge of life  
Just like all the rest  
I look inside and dig it out  
Cause theres no points for second best  
  
Theres a raging fire in my heart tonight  
Growing higher and higher in my soul  
Theres a raging fire in the sky tonight  
I want to ride on the silver dove  
Far into the night  
  
Chorus  
Till I make you take me  
On your mighty wings  
Make you take me  
On your mighty wings across the sky  
Take me on your mighty wings  
Take me on your mighty wings tonight  
  
With just a little luck  
A little cold blue steel  
I cut the night like a razor blade  
Till I feel the way I want to feel  
  
Theres a raging fire in my heart tonight  
Growing higher and higher in my soul  
Theres a raging fire in the sky tonight  
I want to ride on the silver dove  
Far into the night  
  
Chorus  
  
Make you take me  
On your mighty wings  
Make you take me  
On your mighty wings across the sky  
  
Take me on your mighty wings  
Take me on your mighty wings tonight  
On your mighty wings  
  
Make you take me  
On your mighty wings across the sky
