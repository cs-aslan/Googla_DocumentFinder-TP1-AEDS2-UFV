If you hate me after what I say  
Cant put it off any longer  
I just gotta tell you anyway  
Bye bye baby baby goodbye  
Bye baby baby bye bye  
Bye bye baby baby dont make me cry  
Bye baby baby bye bye  
Youre the one girl in town Id marry  
Girl Id marry you now if I were free  
I wish it could be  
I could love you but why begin it  
Cause there aint any future in it  
Shes got me and Im not free so  
Bye bye baby baby goodbye  
Bye baby baby bye bye  
Bye bye baby dont make me cry  
Bye baby baby bye bye  
Guess I never will know you better  
Wish I knew you before I met her  
Gee how good you would be for me  
Should have told you that I cant linger  
Theres a wedding ring on my finger  
Shes got me and Im not free so  
Bye bye baby baby goodbye  
Bye baby baby bye bye  
Bye bye baby dont make me cry  
Bye baby baby bye bye  
Ohhhhh ohhhhhh  
Bye baby bye  
Ohhhhh baby try  
Repeat chorus to fade
