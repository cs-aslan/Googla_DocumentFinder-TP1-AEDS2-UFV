I dont believe what you said  
I can go anywhere  
I can hold my head up  
I can breathe in the air  
Im not officially dead  
I still have a heart  
Im not officially dead yeah  
I still have a heart  
Do you remember the times  
You ride my bike past my house  
I want to know you so bad  
Know you inside and out  
Youre officially dead  
You dont have a heart  
Youre officially dead yeah  
You dont have a heart  
Youre officially dead  
You dont have a heart  
Youre officially dead  
see me feel me touch me please me  
Was it easy just to leave me  
Just to leave me dead  
I know you cant let me go  
Its all in your head  
You want me back in your arms  
Back in your bed  
Were officially dead  
We dont have a heart  
Were officially dead  
We dont have a heart Repeat x4  
Officially dead  
Were officially dead Repeat x2  
Officially dead Repeat x3
