You imagine you were at my station  
And you brought your  
motor to me  
Youre a burner yeah a real motor car  
You say you want your order filled  
Made me shiver when I  
put it in  
Pumping just wont do you know lucky for  
you  
  
Whod ever thought youd be better  
At turning a screw than me  
I do it for my life  
You  
made my drive shaft crank  
You made my pistons bulge  
You made my ball bearings melt from the heat  
Oh yeah  
yeah  
  
We were shifting this hard when we took off  
Put tonight all four on the floor  
When we hit top then  
you know it feels so slow  
You say you want your order  
filled  
Made me shiver when I put it in  
Pumping just  
wont do you know lucky for you  
  
Whod  
ever thought youd be better  
At turning a screw than  
me  
I do it for my life  
You made my drive shaft  
crank  
You made my pistons bulge  
You made my ball  
bearings melt from the heat  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
Im giving you my room service  
And you know  
its more than enough  
When you spark my plug you know  
Im in love  
You imagine you were at my station  
And you brought your motor to me  
With all four on the  
floor I feel whats in store  
  
Whod ever  
thought youd be better  
At turning a screw than me  
I do it for my life  
You made my drive shaft crank  
You made my pistons bulge  
You made my ball bearings melt  
from the heat  
Oh yeah yeah
