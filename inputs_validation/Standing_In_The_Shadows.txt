I know that Im not great  
And some say I imitate  
Anymore I dont know  
Im just doing the best I can  
  
After all Im standing in the shadows  
Of a very famous man  
  
As I travel around from town to town  
I have a lot of dads fans and friends come around  
They say I know Hank would be proud of you  
If he were here today  
  
Now well were all so glad  
And we know he would be too  
That youre carryin on  
His music this way  
  
Yes they say Hank was the all time great  
And we know youll be just as good as your dad  
But I just smile and say therell never be another Hank Williams friends  
Thats the part that always makes them sad  
  
Yes I know that Im not great  
And some say I imitate  
Anymore I dont know  
Im just doing the best I can  
  
Its hard standing in the shadows  
Of a very famous man  
  
So many times when Im on that stage  
I feel something go through me  
And for a minute Im in a different world  
And thats when it does something to me  
  
The people are a hollering and clapping real aloud  
While Im out theyre taking my bows  
I look up toward the ceiling and I say to myself  
Listen dad just listen to that crowd  
  
But as the show goes on the people clap and holler more  
I start to singing another of your great songs  
Thats the time that I know although youre gone  
Your music will live on and on and on
