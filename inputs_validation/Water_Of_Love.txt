High and dry in the long hot day  
Lost and lonely in every way  
Got the flats all around me sky up above  
Yes I need a little water of love  
Ive been too long lonely and my heart feels pain  
Cryin out for some soothing rain  
I believe Ive taken enough  
Yes I need a little water of love  
  
Chorus  
Water of love deep in the ground  
But there aint no water here to be found  
Someday baby when the river runs free  
Itll carry that water of love to me  
  
Once I had a man I could call my own  
Once I had a man now my man is gone  
Once there was a river now theres a stone  
You know its evil when youre living alone  
  
Chorus
