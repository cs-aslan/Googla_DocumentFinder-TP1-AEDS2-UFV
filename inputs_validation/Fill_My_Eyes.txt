And in the morning when you fill my eyes  
I knew that day I couldnt do  
Ah no wrong I couldnt do  
  
And so my mind begins to memorize  
Cause time will never seem the same  
Ah no more never again  
  
Im just a coaster but my wheels wont go  
My legs are weak my heels are low  
Im just a coaster but my wheels wont roll  
Cant make no headway on this road  
  
Theres an empty space inside me now  
A wasteland deep beneath the snow  
So cold nothingll grow  
  
Im just a coaster but my wheels wont go  
My legs are weak my heels are low  
Im just a coaster but my wheels wont roll  
Cant make no headway on this road What road  
  
And in the morning when you fill my eyes  
I knew that day I couldnt do  
Ah no wrong I couldnt do
