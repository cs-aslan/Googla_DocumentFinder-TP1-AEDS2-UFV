I wanna jump but Im afraid Ill fall I wanna holler but the joints too
small  
Young Man Rhythym got a hold on me too  
I got the Rockin Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu  
I wanna get in trouble but that aint all  
I wanna kiss her but the gals too tall  
I wanna scream but that aint all I wanna kiss her but the gals too small  
I wanna scream but no ones around My babys loving Lord shes carrying on
