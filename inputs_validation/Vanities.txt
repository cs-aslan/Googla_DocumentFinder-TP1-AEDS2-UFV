Big bad mans law doesnt carry much sway  
When you come around here  
You can still scratch my back  
And I can still change sides  
Dont carry no torch til you have it in type  
That Im doing okay  
Its only one mans outlook  
It could be one more lie  
Look at it closely  
Counterfeit mostly  
Yesterdayss brushwork  
Using yesterdays paint  
And everything that I believe  
And every note that you receive  
Theyre just vanities to you  
Hear that liverpool wind as Im making my way  
For the very last time  
Is this a resurrection  
And do you really care  
I cant relish no kiss til I happen to hear  
Your honeycomb nouns  
Let you down so often  
Ill do the same again  
Look at it closely  
Counterfeit mostly  
Yesterdays stories  
Its the same all over the world  
And everything that I believe  
And every note that you receive  
Theyre just vanities to you  
Busy little bodies have a story to tell  
Even if it goes against the grain  
Tiny little seeds have got an ocean to swell  
But who am I to rock the boat  
And everything that I believe  
And every note that you receive  
Look at it closely  
Counterfeit mostly  
Yesterdays brushwork  
Using yesterdays pain  
Look at it closely  
Counterfeit mostly  
Yesterdays stories  
Its the same all over the world
