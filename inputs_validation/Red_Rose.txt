little girl do you know what you are do you know  
this babys gonna be a star do you know  
a teenangel empress from hollywood highs  
with wonderful eyes  
your beautiful put on your stratoblue suit  
i know that your in the mood to fly  
we got the power to make it come true  
the most exciting news  
well be together till the end of time  
and when you smile red rose its just like blue sunshine  
oh were ascending and well never die  
cause when we kiss red rose were changing 6 to 9  
its revolution time  
when 6 turns into 9  
move over closer to my fantasies pretty baby  
were standing at the turn of the centuries  
the daughter of time is dancing tonite  
little dreamer youre the dj of your soul  
cmon lets swing to that rock and roll  
the sweetest arrows of desire will set this dance on fire  
above the city of the million moons  
well reach the palace of the sun  
do what you will shall be our destiny  
we will unfold the secrets of the new jerusalem
