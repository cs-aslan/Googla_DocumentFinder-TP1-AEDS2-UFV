Flowers I sent  
Were found dead on their arrival  
The words I said  
Inserted foot in my mouthful  
So when we dance  
My lead it aint so graceful  
isnt so not aint so  
  
Im a hapless romantic  
Stttuttering ppoet  
Just call me a tragic comic  
Cause Im in in love with you  
  
And when we dine  
I forget to push in your seat  
I wear the wine  
Spilling hearts all over my sleeve  
A stitch in time  
Proposing down on my knees  
splitting between the seams  
  
Im a hapless romantic  
Stttuttering ppoet  
Just call me a tragic comic  
Cause Im in in love with you  
  
Nobody can know the  
Trouble Ive seen  
Nobody can know the  
Trouble I get into  
When Im with you
