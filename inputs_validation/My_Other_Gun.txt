Ohh  
Hold me down with a thousand pounds on her shoulder  
Lift me up despite the stones rocks boulders  
Soft and strong right and wrong anxious patient  
In her eyes ride or die aint just a statement no  
  
So much more than ride or die  
Shell get on the trigger or take the wheel and drive  
And I know if situations go arise  
Then shes right there in the holster by my side  
  
Thats my other gun  
Thats my other eye  
Thats who got my back  
When the world aint on my side  
She my other gun  
Should I go to war  
Holding me down  
Thats what she there for  
  
She my other gun yeah yeah  
She my other gun  
  
Put me first even when Im on my moment  
Knows me well cant front her she see right through me  
You rub my hand hold me when this world is troubling  
Settle for that long youll never want or need for nothing girl  
  
So much more than ride or die  
Shell get on the trigger or take the wheel and drive  
And I know if situations go arise  
Then shes right there in the holster by my side  
  
Thats my other gun  
Thats my other eye  
Thats who got my back  
When the world aint on my side  
She my other gun  
Should I go to war  
Holding me down  
Thats what shes there for  
  
Shes always locked and loaded  
Ready for anything  
She got me fully covered  
Im glad shes on my team  
Custom grip perfect fit  
All she spits is heat  
Her and me all I need  
Makes us hard to beat oh  
My other gun oh  
  
Thats my other gun  
Thats my other eye  
Thats who got my back  
When the world aint on my side  
Said she my other gun  
Should I go to war  
Holding me down  
Thats what shes there for  
She my other gun oh  
  
Said she my other gun  
And I love you said I love you baby  
Said I love said I love you baby
