Take the sun  
Take the moon  
Take the earth and watch it move  
Under Your control  
Cause Youre all I know  
  
Heres my life and all my heart  
I give it all but every part  
Is under Your control  
Lord Youre all I know  
  
Chorus  
The stars in the sky will hang there  
til You tell them to  
The faith in my heart will still sing  
Of what Your love can do  
And even when life weighs heavy on me  
I know Youre in control  
And Youre all I need  
The stars in the sky will hang there  
til You tell them to  
  
Take the sea  
Take the tide  
Take the waters watch them rise  
Giving praise to You  
Always praising You  
Heres my voice  
And all my soul  
Singing freely when  
Lord Im giving praise to You  
Lord Im praising You  
  
Chorus  
  
The clouds will rain  
The seasons change  
Cause You told them to  
The sun will shine  
Your burning light  
Cause You told it to  
When You speak your words through my soul  
So I know its true  
Youre in control  
In control  
In control  
  
The stars in the sky will hang there  
The faith in my heart will sting sing  
  
Chorus  
  
The stars in the sky will hang there
