Deep in the dark jungles of Africa  
There is a goddess the natives call BetICha  
BetICha BetICha BetICha  
BetICha BetICha BetICha  
Its a story thats told of a maid that never will fade  
The tale of BetICha  
BetICha BetICha BetICha  
BetICha BetICha BetICha  
Shes the song of delight in the night the natives will sing to you  
BetICha BetICha BetICha  
The wise men say shes a spirit  
Whose lover left long ago  
But others say shes the music  
Of lovers hearts all aglow  
She may be moonlight so bright  
Or soft winds sighin at night  
No matter where you may find her  
Shes one part close to your heart  
BetICha BetICha BetICha  
BetICha BetICha BetICha  
Its a story thats told of a maid that never will fade  
The tale of BetICha  
They sing of BetICha  
They sing of BetICha  
They sing of BetICha  
They sing of BetICha
