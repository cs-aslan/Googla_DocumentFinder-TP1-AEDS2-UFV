There was a child named Bernadette  
I heard the story long ago  
She saw the queen of heaven once  
And kept the vision in her soul  
No one believed what she had seen  
No one believed what she heard  
But there were sorrows to be healed  
And mercy mercy in this world  
  
So many hearts I find broke like yours and mine  
Torn by what we have done and cant undo  
I just want to hold you wont you let me hold you  
Like Bernadette would do  
  
Weve been around we fall we fly  
We mostly fall we mostly run  
And every now and then we try  
To mend the damage that weve done  
Tonight tonight I just cant rest  
Ive got this joy in my breast  
To Think that I did not forget that child  
That song of Bernadette  
  
So many hearts I find broke like yours and mine  
Torn by what weve done and cant undo  
I just want to hold you wont you let me hold you  
Like Bernadette would do
