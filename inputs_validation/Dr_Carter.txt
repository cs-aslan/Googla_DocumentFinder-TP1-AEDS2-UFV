Wheres my coffee  
Good morning doctor carter hey sweetie  
Looks like its going to be a long day another one what we got  
Your first patient yeah  
Is suffering from a lack of concept uhhuh  
Originality ugh  
His flow is weak another one  
And he has no style ugh  
Whatcha got for um  
  
OK let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on  
Drcarter to the rescue  
Excuse me if Im late  
But like a thief it takes time to be this great  
Ha so just wait your style is a disgrace  
Your rhymes are fifth place and Im just grace  
One uno ace and Im tryin to make your heart beat like bass  
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix  
Whatever you shall break  
Where is your originality  
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery  
Capture what I say  
All I need is one mic  
All I need is one take  
Like hey brighter then the sun ray got a pistols on the playground  
Watch the gunplay like  
No kidding no kids in the way  
But the kids do watch  
Gotta watch what we say  
Gotta work everyday  
Gotta not be cliche  
Gotta stand out like Andre 3k  
Gotta kick it kick it like the sensei  
You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait  
Think I think I lost em  
  
Good afternoon doctor carter  
Nurse  
I dont know about this one  
His confidence is down  
Vocab and metaphors needs work  
And he lost respect for the game  
Ah let me see  
Think you can save him  
  
OK  
Respect is in the heart  
So thats where Im a start  
And a lot of heart patients dont make it  
Now hey kid  
Plural I graduated  
Cause you could get through anything if magic made it  
And that was called recycling  
Or rereciting  
Something cause you just like it  
So you say it just like it  
Some say its biting  
But I say its enlightening  
Besides Dr Kanye West is one of the brightest  
And Dr Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest  
And Dr Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest  
Arthritis in my hand from writing  
But Im a doctor they dont understand my writing  
So I stop writing  
Now Im like lighting  
And you aint Vince Young so dont clash with the titans  
Fast and exciting  
My passion is frighting  
Now let me put some more vocab in your iv  
Here take this Vicodin  
Like it and love it  
And confidence has no budget  
So pay me no mind  
I dont walk like I talk it cause Im running  
I dont do it cause I done it and Im in the emergency unit  
God damn it Ive lost another one  
  
Good evening doctor carter its been a long day  
But this one looks much better then the others  
His respect is back up  
Concepts sound good his style is showing strong signs of improvement  
All he needs now is some swagger  
OK let me take my gloves off then  
  
Swagger tighter then a yeast infection  
Fly go hard like geese erection  
Fashion patrol police detection  
I stay tight like Chinese connection  
I stay tight like pussy at night  
Baby dont get me wrong I could do that pussy right  
But Im too wrong to write  
Too fresh to fight  
Too paid to freestyle  
Too paid to freestyle  
I had to say it twice  
Swagger so nice  
And dont ask me shit unless it concern a price  
And I dont rap fast I rap slow  
Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes  
Swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats  
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat  
Wait as I put the light down his throat  
I can only see flow  
His blood starting to flow  
His lungs starting to grow  
This one starting to show  
Strong signs of life  
Wheres the stitches heres the knife  
Smack his face his eyes open I reply what a night  
Welcome back hip hop I saved your life  
  
He looks good  
His vitals are up  
Hes looking good  
Hes looking good  
I think we got one  
Doctor carter I think we got one  
Yup we got one  
We saved him  
Hes good  
Hes good  
We got one  
Hes good  
Hes good  
We got em  
Hes a go  
Hes good
