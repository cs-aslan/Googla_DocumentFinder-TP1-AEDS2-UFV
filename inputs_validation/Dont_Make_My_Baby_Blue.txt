I know that I cant keep her  
Now shes in love with you ah ah ah  
But I just wanna say  
I wont be far away  
So dont make my baby blue  
  
I know your reputation  
They say you cant be true ah ah ah  
But Ill be standing by  
So you just better try  
And dont make my baby blue  
  
Ooh that little girls an angel  
And it hurts to  
Set her free  
So you better take  
Good care of her  
Cause she still means  
The world to me  
  
Im gonna step aside now  
Just like she wants me to ah ah ah  
But even though Im gone  
Ill still be looking on  
So dont make my baby blue  
  
But even though Im gone  
Ill still be looking on  
So dont make my baby blue  
No dont make my baby blue
