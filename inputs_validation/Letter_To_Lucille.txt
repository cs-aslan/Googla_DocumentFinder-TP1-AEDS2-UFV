Somebody please if somebody will  
Let them take a letter to my girl Lucille  
Let them tell her Lord how Im missing  
Her still  
I think about her constantly  
Somebody please if somebody can  
Let them take a letter from this  
Lonely man  
All I ask is Lord make her understand  
Ill die if she dont wait for me  
I heard a rumor from the guys in Cell A  
Youve served your time and you are  
Leaving today  
Well there is something you can do  
For me to help your old friend  
Help me please  
Cause Ive got seven years in this  
Old pen  
Till Im home again  
Somebody please if somebody will  
Let them take a letter to my girl Lucille  
Let them tell her Lord how Im missing  
Her still  
I think about her constantly  
Somebody please if somebody can  
Let them take a letter from this  
Lonely man  
All I ask is Lord make her understand  
Ill die if she dont wait for me  
To hear you tell it youre all innocent men  
But I was guilty and Id do it all again  
Just to hold her for a minute or two  
Id steal a kings crown yes I would  
If I dont reach that girl some way I know  
Therell be another man around  
Somebody please if somebody will  
Let them take a letter to my girl Lucille  
Let them tell her Lord how Im missing  
Her still  
Because I think about her constantly  
Ugh somebody please if somebody can  
Let them take a letter from this lonely man  
All I ask is Lord why dont you make her  
Understand because  
Ill die if she dont wait for me  
Oooooh somebody please if somebody will  
Let them take a letter to my girl Lucille  
Let them tell her Lord how Im missing  
Her still  
I think about her constantly
