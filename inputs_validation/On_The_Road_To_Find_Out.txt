Well I left my happy home  
To see what I could find out  
I left my folk and friends  
With the aim to clear my mind out  
  
Well I hit the rowdy road  
And many kinds I met there  
And many stories told me on the way to get there  
  
So on and on I go the seconds tick the time out  
So much left to know and Im on the road to find out  
  
In the end Ill know  
But on the way I wonder  
Through descending snow  
And through the frost and thunder  
  
I listen to the wind come howl  
Telling me I have to hurry  
I listen to the robins song  
Saying not to worry  
  
So on and on I go the seconds tick the time out  
So much left to know and Im on the road to find out  
  
Well I found myself alone  
Hoping someone would miss me  
Thinking about my home and the last woman to kiss me  
  
Well sometimes you have to moan  
When nothing seems to suit you  
But never the less you know  
Your locked towards the future  
  
So off and on you go the seconds tick the time out  
Theres so much left to know and Im on the road to find out  
  
And I found my head one day  
When I wasnt even trying  
And here I have to say  
Cause there is no use in lying lying  
  
Yes the answer lies within  
So why not take a look now  
Kick out the devils sin  
Pickup pickup a good book now  
  
Yes the answer lies within  
So why not take a look now  
Kick out the devils sin  
Pickup pickup a good book now  
  
Yes the answer lies within  
So why not take a look now  
Kick out the devils sin  
Pickup pickup a good book now
