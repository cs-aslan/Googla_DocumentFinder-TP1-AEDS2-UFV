Youre one of Gods better people  
And you dont know  
Thats why youre special  
And I cry so I can talk like this  
From my downbeat existence  
And I know that you can make my wish  
If my wish is pure  
  
But I dont know  
I just dont know  
I dont know  
Let me love you so  
Now I cant live this without you  
Id die without you  
Without you without you  
  
Youre one of Gods better people  
And you dont know  
Thats why youre special  
It must hurt to see your favourite man  
Lose himself again and again  
And I know that youre my only friend  
From way back when  
  
My wish was pure  
It was oh so pure  
It was pure  
I couldnt love you more  
Now I cant live this without you  
Id die without you  
Without you  
Now I cant live this without you  
Id die without you  
Without you without you  
  
Cos I dont know no more  
I just dont know no more  
I jsut dont know  
Let me love you so  
Now I cant live this without you  
Id die without you  
Without you  
Now I cant live this without you  
Id die without you  
Without you without you  
  
Youre one of Gods better people  
And you dont know  
Thats why youre special
