You walk into the room everybody stares  
The talking stops theres a silence there  
The room is yours you own it now  
Youre in control and everybody down here knows  
You got a place in my heart I dont want you there  
But you come and you go like a millionaire  
You take a walk right across my soul  
Youre in control and everybody down here knows  
  
Youre the life and the death of the party  
You got my heart right by the throat  
Youre the life and the death of the party  
When the stage lights rise  
You start and stop the show  
  
You love me bad you love me good  
Youre unimpressed thats understood  
I lost it all you knew I would  
Youre in control and everybody down here knows  
  
Youre the life and the death of the party  
You got my heart right by the throat  
Youre the life and the death of the party  
When the stage lights rise  
You start and stop the show  
  
Its just one night  
Its just one time  
Its just one hotel room  
Its just another dream  
That cant come true  
  
Youre the life and the death of the party  
You got my heart right by the throat  
Youre the life and the death of the party  
When the stage lights rise  
You start and stop the show
