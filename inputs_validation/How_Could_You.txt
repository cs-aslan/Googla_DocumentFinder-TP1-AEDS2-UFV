Just when romance got a start  
You decided it was time to part  
How could you  
How could you  
  
It was on a night like this  
You left me and didnt leave a kiss  
How could you  
How could you  
  
You know that love is just like apple pie  
Its either sweet or tart  
You could be the apple of my eye  
But you you you upset the apple cart  
  
I was looking forward to  
All those little things you didnt do  
How could you  
Could you break my heart
