I picked a rose this morning  
And it was so fresh it looked like it was crying  
I thought how sad to be so beautiful  
Only to wither and die  
Like papas roses soft and pale  
Like petals thrown in the dirt  
Only silence is spoken here  
All that grows here is hurt  
And papas roses  
Papa wasnt really a hardened man  
He could be tender at times  
I remember it was like it holiday  
When he was gentle and kind  
He gave those roses his heart and soul  
I wish hed saved some for me  
It wouldve been such a simple thing  
For me to be like papas roses  
Like papas roses soft and pale  
Like petals thrown in the dirt  
Only silence is spoken here  
All that grows here is hurt  
And papas roses  
Voices that whisper soft and low  
Forever buried inside  
Haunted by images dark and cold  
Forever burned in your mind  
But I dreamed I could fly away  
Like an angel Id fly  
To the places where I could forget  
Forget that I was like papas roses  
Like papas roses soft and pale  
Like petals thrown in the dirt  
Only silence is spoken here  
All that grows here is hurt  
And papas roses
