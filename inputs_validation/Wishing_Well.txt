Jesse to Self  
  
Theres place where Im  
Oh  with sorrowed lives  
And all the souls  
Oh  theyre wishing they could die  
  
Take me down  
And drown this the orphan forever  
Ya know I do  
Wish away the pain  
And wash away my life  
Find me down inside a shallow pool  
Down a wishing well  
No more bleeding  
No more screaming tonight  
  
Wash away my pain  
Oh  in the well of sighs  
For I have no face  oh  
Abandoned for all for all time  
  
Jesse thinking of his mother  
  
Why why am I nothing  
Oh mamma why whyd you leave me  
A throw away for life  
Oh  oh why why am I nothing  
Oh and mamma why  
Can you feel me there  
Oh God I want to die
