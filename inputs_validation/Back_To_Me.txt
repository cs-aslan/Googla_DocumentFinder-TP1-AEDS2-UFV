Oh this must mean something  
For us to endure all the hurt  
And Ive tried to analyze through  
If maybe its more than its worth  
  
Ive already found a mountain to move  
Should that be all that it takes  
And it isnt like theres nothing to lose  
Only me only you  
  
I dont notice if its night or day  
I stand around in the pouring rain  
I dont answer when they call my name  
I will come to if only you come back to me  
  
Like the shadow that follows  
I wander around in a trance  
You could wake me from this big sleep  
All that we take is a chance  
  
We could run away somewhere alone  
Make up a little lost time  
Cause theres nothing worse than nowhere to go  
All alone no one home  
  
I dont notice if its night or day  
I stand around in the pouring rain  
I dont answer when they call my name  
Ill be rescued if only you come back to me  
  
More than long enough  
Weve been holding all the way  
If you wait too long  
The colors start to fade  
  
Cause it isnt like theres nothing to lose  
Only me only you  
  
I dont notice if its night or day  
I stand around in the pouring rain  
I dont answer when they call my name  
I will come to if only you come back to me  
  
I dont notice if its night or day  
I stand around in the pouring rain  
I dont answer when they call my name  
I will come to if only you come back  
Ill be rescued if only you come back  
Ill get through if only you come back To me  
  
Back to me baby  
  
Come back to me  
  
Come back to me
