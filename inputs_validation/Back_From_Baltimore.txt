Hey see how she kissed me  
Yeah no reason for the girl to lie  
She say she gonna miss me  
Yeah smile on my face I wave goodbye  
  
But Ive been back from Baltimore  
For a week or two  
I hurried back from Baltimore  
Baby where are you  
Where are you  
  
Yeah Im about to crumble  
Yeah come see me die before your eyes  
Yeah my thoughts all jumbled  
And my throat is dry from asking why  
  
But Ive been back from Baltimore  
For a week or two  
I hurried back from Baltimore  
Baby where are you  
Where are you  
  
Instrumental  
  
Girl Ive been back from Baltimore  
For a week or two  
I hurried back from Baltimore  
Baby where are you  
Well Ive been back from Baltimore  
For a week or two  
I hurried back from Baltimore  
Baby where are you  
Where are you
