The time has come to air my feelings  
Theres just so much confusion going down  
Im not the kind to be complaining  
But sometimes you got to stand out from the crowd  
Everyones got their own opinion  
And you know I sure got mine  
  
Its my world  
Dont you come a messin with my world  
I dont appreciate the fact some people just cant see  
Its hurting you and me  
Its my world  
My world your world our world one world  
  
We all got to get it together  
Theres just no other place to go  
If we cant find some peace with each other  
Then well be dead before you know  
I dont have all the answers  
Im just one man whos searching for a change  
  
Its my world  
Dont you come a messin with my world  
I dont appreciate the fact some people just cant see  
Its hurting you and me  
Its my world  
My world your world our world one world  
  
I hear the cries of the people  
From every single corner of this earth  
Wheres the love the compassion  
Wheres the hope whats the future worth
