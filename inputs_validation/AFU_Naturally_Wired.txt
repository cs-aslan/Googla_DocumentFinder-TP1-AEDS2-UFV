Yeah 8x  
Ninety days on the road is what I need  
When my axe cuts me deep I let it bleed  
On the stage off my strings down my face  
And all over me  
Pumpin up for the show  
Feelin like somethings gonna blow  
Its got me all fired up  
Yes Im all fired up  
UH  
Through the ice into the fire  
Blowin steam  
North and South East n West right n left  
Im always extreme  
Dont like the middle squeezing me  
I dont like nothin in between  
Yes Im all fired up  
Got me all fired up  
When the rest have packed it up  
Im alive Im electric inspired  
I Im naturally wired  
Wired naturally wired  
Wired wired  
Im naturally wired  
Naturally wired  
Wired naturally wired  
Wired naturally wired
