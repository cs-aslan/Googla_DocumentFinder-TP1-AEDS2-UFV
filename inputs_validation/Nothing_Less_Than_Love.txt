She cries just a little when she sees him walk away  
After all she cant see it any other way  
And its hard when youre feelin like theres nothin left to lose  
No she cant help it she sees no excuse  
Theres no good in her goodbye  
Theres no tears she hasnt cried  
But its not enough  
She needs nothin less than love  
Dont say the sacrifice is small  
And no one ever has it all  
When all she wants  
Is nothin less than love  
You cant stand in the middle and see it either way  
Thats just how it is no one ever wants the blame  
So shell pick up the pieces and pretend she just cant see  
Cause all shes looking for is some room to breathe  
She knows better than to wait  
Just keep waiting until its too late  
Theres no good in her goodbye  
When all she wants  
Is nothin less than love  
Dont say the sacrifice is small  
And no one ever has it all  
When all she wants  
Is nothin less than love
