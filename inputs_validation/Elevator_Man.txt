Whos goin down  
Whos goin down  whos goin down  
I ride my elevator  
Through the shafts of your heart  
When you climb aboard baby  
Theres no getting off  
  
Im a silent operator wont you please take my hand  
I am so polite  Im the elevator man  
  
Friction and harmony  whos gonna ride with me  
Im the elevator man  
  
Whos going down whos comin with me  
Who wants to take a chance  
On a piece of abstract reality  
Its only just a dance  
Wont you come and ride with the elevator man  
Whos goin down yeah  movin slow without a sound  
  
Whos going down  whos going down  whos going down
