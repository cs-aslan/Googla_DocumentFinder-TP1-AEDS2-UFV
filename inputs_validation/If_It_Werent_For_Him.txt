If shed only knew what I was thinking  
If shed only knew what was in my head  
Why cant she see my heart is breaking  
Shed be mine if it werent for him  
  
So many times I dreamed I had her  
I call her name when I lay down  
Still I cant learn to live without  
Her jealous heart is all I found  
  
See your face would be my destiny  
Now I wont take what you can give to me  
This lonely place is all I hope to find  
If it werent for him then youd be mine  
  
If hed only knew what I was thinking  
If hed only knew what was in my head  
Why cant he see my heart is breaking  
Hed be mine if it werent for him  
  
Youd be mine if it werent for him
