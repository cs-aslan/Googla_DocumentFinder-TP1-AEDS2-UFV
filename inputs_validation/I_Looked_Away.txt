She took my hand  
And tried to make me understand  
That she would always be there  
  
But I looked away  
And she ran away from me today  
Im such a lonely man  
  
It came as no surprise to me  
That shed leave me in misery  
It seemed like only yesterday  
She made a vow that shed never walk away  
  
She took my hand  
And tried to make me understand  
That she would always be there  
  
But I looked away  
And she ran away from me today  
Im such a lonely man  
  
And if it seemed a sin  
To love another mans woman baby  
I guess Ill keep on sinning  
Loving her Lord till my very last day  
  
But I looked away  
And she ran away from me today  
Im such a lonely man
