Ive got a lot of memories to last me the rest of my life  
So if you dont want to love me baby thatll be alright  
Im gonna take all the lovin that I have for you  
Gonna take all the loneliness an sit right down with the blues  
  
Im gonna give myself a party an serve old memories  
Give my self a party think of how it used to be  
Remember all the happiness that once we knew  
Gonna give myself a party just me an the blues  
  
A few of your love letters a photograph or two  
A gift you gave on my birthday with words of I love you  
Theres lots of things to think about when youre feelin blue  
So Im gonna take all the loneliness sit right down with the blues  
  
Im gonna give myself a party an serve old memories  
Give my self a party think of how it used to be  
Remember all the happiness that once we knew  
Im gonna give myself a party just me an the blues  
  
Just me an the blues
