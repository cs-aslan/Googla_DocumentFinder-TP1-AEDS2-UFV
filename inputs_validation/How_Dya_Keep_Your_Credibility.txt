Hey this song is for Marilyn and every drag queen  
Oh brother its not like the past  
Were wearing stilettos and talking too fast  
Passing the mirror hung up in pose  
The boys they were fairest in immaculate clothes  
Lunch with Janet Street Porter and Marilyns nose  
But this life is a baby so sad when it grows  
Into you and me ah what the hell were gonna be  
Where will we go and what will we be  
If we cant communicate intelligently  
Theres a price on my head but Ive never been free  
I said How dya keep your credibility  
No more crying no more trying  
Please no more dying  
I just wanna be free  
Im taking the trouble right to your door  
Whyd you do it you bastard Dont love you no more  
Sinners beside me saints on the right  
And if you slow down youll be a turkey tonight  
cmon lets go a little further dont be uptight  
If you feel insecure well just turn off the light  
Where will we go and what will we be  
If we cant communicate intelligently  
Theres a price on my head but Ive never been free  
I said How dya keep your credibility  
I said How dya keep your credibility
