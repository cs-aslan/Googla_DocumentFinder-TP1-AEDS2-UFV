talking  
Look here you know what I mean I done did a lot of  
shit in my life Yo Gotti street raised street paid  
chorus  
Ima sell my dope cant trust no bitch  
Pop my wheel break bread with my click  
If a nigga dont hustle than a nigga dont eat  
steady chasin paper out here running these streets  
Ima sell my dope cant trust no bitch  
Pop my wheel break bread with my click  
Kinfolks we block burn till we get these mills  
We do it how it go so we gone get it how we live  
Im back to the basics  
Face it Im back on the rise  
Back with my guys  
Back 22 for them pies  
Im back rollin clean  
Back lookin mean at niggaz  
Thats throwin up signs  
Lettin off rounds for mine  
Back in the hood  
Like my niggaz think I should  
But knockin on wood  
They got a nigga back on that good  
Back on a mission  
In other words Im back in the kitchen  
Water whippin with my niggaz tryin to sew up the city  
Back in school  
Gotti back to actin a fool  
But seekin some knowledge  
Southwest community college  
Took hold a nigga  
Enrolled and showed a nigga  
When Gotti around aint enough hoes for niggaz  
Never did I  
Get the big head or lie  
And say Im the mayne  
I just said Im workin with change  
And doin my thang  
I cant help I dont trust hoes  
Move birds on the low and seen a hundred or mo  
chorus  
You want to sue me You want to rob me  
Get your choppers come to my shows and try to mob me  
I took birds from your people  
So you gone kill me  
Say my beats be aight  
But you dont really feel me  
Dog I aint hard to find I be in the bay  
Ridgecrest Shady Vista street everyday  
Sellin yay with my nigga GB and Todd  
Lil Mont Big G we all got heart  
Rap shit aight but Im from the streets  
Under all circumstances I gotta eat

What you know about thirty six os in a drought  
Double up make em bounce whoaLook at my mouth  
Blockburner nigga be rollin  
I go the title from  my shit aint stolen  
Im watchin TVs and DVDs  
Im thug bruh  
One more time Dre and Shine  
Its love bruh Its love bruh  
chorus  
Dope just  and cant stop me from gettin this paper  
Nineteen years a closet full of gators  
Platinumed out chain beggets around my charm  
One hundred fifty shots shtos four five caliber drum  
Got 4 spots  
One for the money  
One for the drugs  
A third spot for all of these hoes that I dont love  
A fourth spot for me and my shorty that stayed down  
The one who stayed strong and helped me through shady grounds  
Im a mean muggerhead buster  
Nothin nice  
Im a street hustler  
And my motto is rock ice  
Streets is callin  
Why not picture me ballin  
Enjoy it while I got it cause one day Im gone be fallin  
Dope boys do what they want not what they can  
You boys tag along and protect the man  
Cheap hoes jockin them niggaz cause they got paper  
All hoes change like weather because its nature  
chours till fade
