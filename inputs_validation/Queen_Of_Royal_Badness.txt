Let me remind you on how to unwind your body  
So dance and shake and just keep in step  
Understand draw a clear picture  
What Im gonna hit you with is truly def  
These are the words of a Queen of a Queendom  
All competitors I simply cream them  
One by one I dust a rush them all  
If you have any more bring them  
To the front so they can sho me what they got  
What they got it better be hot  
Cause if its not Ill simply knock them out the box  
And theyll be put in a spot  
The style I use will surely amuse  
The party people to a state of gladness  
What I mean is Im on the scene  
Im the Queen of Royal Badness  
Well its the Lah TIFAH  
While I say my rhyme Mark creates  
The direct hitech sound of the dope noise  
The bass will pound I hope girls I hope boys  
Understand what Im quoting Im not joking  
Or freaking this is a Queen speaking  
Wis words when Im done I leave your eyes blurred  
When you address me address me as Your Highness  
One of hiphops finest  
You see I can flow on tempo off tempo  
It makes me no difference  
So play that beat play it kick it watch me  
Flip it with dope lyrics you want to hear it  
Observe my ways and actions I grab the mic  
And draw attractions  
To the table Im a hit you at all angles  
Those who think I caught a fit I strangled them  
The result with a pen and a pad  
Gets mean see Im the Queen of Royal Badness  
I cant wait until the party is jampacked  
When I start to drop it the people say Damn black  
The queen is hyped up awesome and deadly  
If you dont dance grab a chair and plex be  
Composures kept blows are thrown in death hard as hell  
Guard as well as you can or step  
Off the premisis in one minute its  
Going to explode in a style thats limitless  
Make your first move dont let it be your worst move  
Cause if you do youll be a hurt fool  
Keep your mouth shut to those that shout and cuss  
Its no doubt that I got clout and Ill bust  
Literature that flows like liquid  
Some cant comprehend the way I kicked it  
So dont say nothing  
Just listen up follow instructions  
Rhyme shake slide and dance like Lat said  
When Im on stage I sold rage and drop heads  
Ambidextrous skilled with both hands  
Teaching a lesson ready to throw jams  
Latifah loves to rip up the scenery  
Its nothing special just a Queen to me  
So do the knowledge see if you can catch this  
You know what I mean its the Queen of Royal Badness
