RZA  
See sometimes  
You gotta flash em back  
See niggaz dont know where this shit started  
Whyall know where it came from  
Im sayin we gonna take whyall back to the swords  
We bounce yo  
  
Chorus GZA RZA  
When the MCs came to live our their name  
And to perform forrrrm  
Some had to snort cocaine caiiinnne to act insane sannne  
With before Pete Rocked it on now gone  
That the mental plane plaaanne to spark the brain brainnn  
With the building to be born  
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to guy  
Check em check chicka icka etta UHH  
  
GZA  
Fake niggas get flipped  
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns  
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down  
I flow like the blood on a murder scene like a syringe  
  
On some loud howl shit to insert a fiend  
But it was yo ock the shop stolen art  
Catch a swollen heart from not rollin smart  
I put mad pressure on phony wack rhymes they get hurt  
  
Shits played like zodiac signs on sweatshirt  
Thats minimum and feminine like sandals  
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble  
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt  
  
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts  
That attack the micfones like cyclones or typhoon  
I represent from midnight to high noon  
I dont waste ink nigga I think  
  
I drop megaton BOMBS more faster than you blink  
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed  
Through clouds of smoke of natural blends of weed  
Only under one circumstance is if Im blunted  
Turn that shit up my clan in da front want it  
  
Chorus  
  
GZA  
Im on a Mission that niggaz say is Impossible  
But when I swing my swords they all choppab
