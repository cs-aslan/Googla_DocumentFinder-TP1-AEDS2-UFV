Your out there somewhere and your crying  
And I love you though weve never met  
Wait there for me Ill recognize you  
Someone lonesome someone hurtin someone blue  
Thatll be you  
  
Well help each other start all over  
A tear for a tear  
A shoulder for a shoulder  
Youll be someone thats born to lose  
Cause I need someone like me  
To hold on too  
  
Well help each other start all over  
A tear for a tear  
A shoulder for a shoulder  
Youll be someone thats born to lose  
Cause I need someone like me  
To hold on too  
  
Cause I need someone like me  
To hold on too
