You can spend all your days in the grind  
Converting your nickles to dimes  
You could stuff all your pockets till they overflow  
Dont chu know dont chu know dont chu know  
  
You can say youre too old to be young  
You think youre too smart to be dumb  
But the well seasoned pro knows how long he can go  
Dont you know dont chu know dont chu know  
  
You can sing every song thats been sung  
Conquer the moon and the sun  
But if you asked me its all both been said and been done  
  
Were just recycled history machines  
Cavemen in faded blue jeans  
Its the unanswered question in each one of us  
Dont chu know dont chu know dont chu know  
  
Bridge  
The more we learn the less we know  
What you keep is what you cant let go  
Take it fast or take it slow  
Just one way for you to go  
Dont chu know  lets go now  
  
You can sing every song thats been sung  
Conquer the moon and the sun  
But if you asked me its not in the race that you run  
Its the outcast in each one of us  
  
Who gets the girl who is too glamorous  
Theres no one to deceive its just all make believe  
Dont chu know dont chu know dont chu know  
Dont chu know dont chu know dont chu know  
Dont chu know dont chu know dont chu know
