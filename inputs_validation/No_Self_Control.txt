Got to get some food  
Im so hungry all the time  
I dont know how to stop  
I dont know how to stop  
  
Got to get some sleep  
Im so nervous in the night  
I dont know how to stop  
No I dont know how to stop  
I dont know how to stop  
I dont know how to stop  
  
Got to pick up the phone  
I will call any number  
I will talk to anyone  
I know Im gone too far  
Much too far I gone this time  
And I dont want to think what Ive done  
I dont know how to stop  
No I dont know how to stop  
  
There are always hidden silences  
Waiting behind the chair  
They come out when the coast is clear  
They eat anything that moves  
I go shaky at the knees  
Lights go out stars come down  
Like a swarm of bees  
  
No selfcontrol  
  
You know I hate to hurt you  
I hate to see your pain  
But I dont know how to stop  
No I dont know how to stop  
  
Street after street  
Night after night  
I walk on through the rain  
I walk on through the rain  
I dont know how to stop
