Close your eyes close the door  
You dont have to worry any more  
Cause Ill be your baby tonight  
Shut the lights and shut the shade  
You dont have to be afraid  
Cause Ill be your baby tonight  
Well that mockingbirds gonna sail away  
Were gonna forget it  
That big fat moon  
Is gonna shine like a spoon  
But were gonna let it  
You wont regret it  
Kick your shoes off  
And dont you fear  
Bring that bottle over here  
Cause Ill be your baby tonight  
Well that mockingbirds gonna sail away  
Were gonna forget it  
That big fat moon  
Is gonna shine like a spoon  
But were gonna let it  
You wont regret it  
Kick your shoes off  
And dont you fear  
Bring that bottle over here  
Cause Ill be your baby tonight  
Cause Ill be your baby tonight  
Cause Ill be your baby tonight tonight
