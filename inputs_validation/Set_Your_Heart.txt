When your heart is beating black and blue  
And a cold worlds looking back at you  
When youre fading low around the bend  
Go on turn around youll see me  
I will always be your friend  
  
Set your heart free  
Set your heart free  
  
Said you cant say much about today  
Just that dark cloud coming back your way  
And that your dreams are all worn thin  
Well you better stop with all that talk  
Before it all starts happening  
  
Set your heart free  
Listen to your heart  
  
When your heart is beating black and blue  
And the old worlds knocking down on you  
And youre starting to become unglued  
Dont go there come on you know i love you  
  
Set your heart free Repeats
