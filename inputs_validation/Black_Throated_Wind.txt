Bringing me down  
Im running aground  
Blind in the light of the interstate cars  
Passing me by  
The buses and semis  
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars  
  
But Im here by the road  
Bound to the load  
That I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars  
Alone with the rush of the drivers who wont pick me up  
The highway the moon the clouds and the stars  
  
The blackthroated wind keeps on pouring in  
With its words of a life where nothing is new  
Ah Mother American Night Im lost from the light  
Oh Im drowning in you  
  
I left St Louis the City of Blues  
In the midst of a storm Id rather forget  
I tried to pretend it came to an end  
Cause you werent the woman I thought I once met  
  
But I cant deny that times have gone by  
When I never had doubts or thoughts of regret  
And I was a man when all this began  
Who wouldnt think twice about being there yet  
  
The blackthroated wind keeps on pouring in  
And it speaks of a life that passes like dew  
Its forced me to see that youve done better by me  
Better by me than Ive done by you  
  
Whats to be found racing around  
You carry your pain wherever you go  
Full of the blues and trying to lose  
You aint gonna learn what you dont want to know  
  
So I give you my eyes and all of their lies  
Please help them to learn as well as to see  
Capture a glance and make it a dance  
Of looking at you looking at me  
  
The blackthroated wind keeps on pouring in  
With its words of a lie that could almost be true  
Ah Mother American Night here comes the light  
Im turning around thats what Im gonna do  
  
Goin back home thats what Im gonna do  
Turnin around  
Thats what Im gonna do  
  
Cause youve done better by me  
Than Ive done by you
