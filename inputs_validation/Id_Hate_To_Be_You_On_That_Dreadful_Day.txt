By Bob Dylan  
  
Well your clock is gonna stop  
At Saint Peters gate  
Ya gonna ask him what time it is  
Hes gonna say Its too late  
Hey hey  
Id sure hate to be you  
On that dreadful day  
  
Youre gonna start to sweat  
And you aint gonna stop  
Youre gonna have a nightmare  
And never wake up  
Hey hey hey  
Id sure hate to be you  
On that dreadful day  
  
Youre gonna cry for pills  
And your heads gonna be in a knot  
But the pills are gonna cost more  
Than what youve got  
Hey hey  
Id sure hate to be you  
On that dreadful day  
  
Youre gonna have to walk naked  
Cant ride in no car  
Youre gonna let evrybody see  
Just what you are  
Hey hey  
Id sure hate to be you  
On that dreadful day  
  
Well the good wines aflowin  
For five cents a quart  
Youre gonna look in your moneybags  
And find youre one cent short  
Hey hey hey  
Id sure hate to be you  
On that dreadful day  
  
Youre gonna yell and scream  
Dont anybody care  
Youre gonna hear out a voice say  
Shoulda listened when you heard the word down there  
Hey hey  
Id sure hate to be you  
On that dreadful day
