Seen you round I know your face  
Watched you try to grow up with grace  
Seen that heart out on your sleeve  
Like its so much life youre dying to feel dying to feel  
  
Cause if you got to steal youve got to steal the show  
Its the spirit of the underdog  
And if you got to break youve got to break the mould  
Its the spirit of the underdog  
  
Ive seen you reach that main event  
And make it look like an accident  
Your need for love cant be replaced  
Just put away at least for today at least for today  
  
Cause if you got to steal youve got to steal the show  
Its the spirit of the underdog  
And if you got to break youve got to break the mould  
Its the spirit of the underdog
