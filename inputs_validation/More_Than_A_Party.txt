Lots of surprises in store  
This isnt a party  
Its a whole lot more  
  
Weve had enough of this blind mans bluff  
Youve kept us in the dark for long enough  
  
This is more than a party  
More than a party  
More than a party  
  
Keep telling us were to have fun  
Then take all the ice cream so weve got none  
  
The failed magician waves his wand  
And in an instant the laughters gone  
  
Loads of surprises in store  
This isnt a party  
Its a whole lot more
