I remember when you took a stand  
With the pearl of wisdom in your hand  
And a soul of desire  
You hold your own up against the world  
A lions heart in a little girl  
So unafraid of the fire  
  
But those days dont last  
Sweet dreams die fast  
A stumble when you walk on the wire  
When all your friends  
Start giving in  
The flames are burning higher and higher  
  
Chorus  
Dont give up Andrea  
Got the whole world at your feet  
Just keep on holding on  
This is where you need to be  
  
All the days that youve been spending  
Spinning while your hearts descending  
Like a stone in the ocean  
Sometimes when you think the world is ending  
Its really just a new beginning  
The other side of emotion  
  
But Ive seen your eyes  
No compromise  
When you set your mind on the matter  
Be strong through the tears  
And your sight will clear  
Youre gonna get what youre after  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont be surprised when the road divides  
Just take the one less traveled by  
  
Chorus
