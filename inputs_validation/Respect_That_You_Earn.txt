And you know they say its a mans job to respect a woman

Wow if I called you my bitch  
When Im with my partners eating  
As a badge of honor or just be like no Wale  
Dont call me out at my mommas given  
Name sacred she whispers mine when Im in her thighs  
And I leave her inner feelings cause I never leave her dry  
Some ill advice lying to her is ill advised  
She know these Jones on my John but I still give her time  
I try follow her everybody want her  
Worried about none if she gonna work that body  
And I unfollow her though my eyes still on her
