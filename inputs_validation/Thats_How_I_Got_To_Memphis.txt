If you love somebody enough  
Youll follow wherever they go  
Thats how I got to Memphis  
Thats how I got to Memphis  
If you love somebody enough  
Youll go where your heart wants to go  
Thats how I got to Memphis  
Thats how I got to Memphis  
I know if youd seen her youd tell me cause you are my friend  
Ive got to find her and find out the trouble shes in  
If you tell me that shes not here  
Ill follow the trail of her tears  
Thats how I got to Memphis  
Thats how I got to Memphis  
She would get mad and she used to say  
That shed come back to Memphis someday  
Thats how I got to Memphis  
Thats how I got to Memphis  
I havent eaten a bite  
Or slept for three days and nights  
Thats how I got to Memphis  
Thats how I got to Memphis  
Ive got to find her and tell her that I love her so  
Ill never rest til I find out why she had to go  
Thank you for your precious time  
Forgive me if I start to cryin  
Thats how I got to Memphis x8
