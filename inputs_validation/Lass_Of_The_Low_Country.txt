Oh she was a lass from the low country  
And he was a lord of high degree  
But she loved him oh so tenderly  
Oh sorrow sing sorrow  
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod  
Noone knows how she loved him but herself and God  
  
One day when the snow was on the mead  
She passed him by on a milk white steed  
And she spoke to him low nobody paid no need  
Oh sorrow sing sorrow  
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod  
Noone knows how she loved him but herself and God  
  
Now if you be a lass from the low country  
Dont love no man of high degree  
For he dont got a heart or no sympathy  
Oh sorrow sing sorrow  
Now she sleeps in the valley where wild flowers nod  
Noone knows how she loved him but herself and God
