Never treat me sweet and gentle  
The way she should  
Cause I got it bad and that aint good  
  
My poor heart is so sentimental  
And its not made of wood  
Now I got it bad and that aint good  
  
When the weekends over  
And Monday rolls around  
I end up like start out  
Just crying my heart out  
  
She dont love me like I love her  
Nobody could  
I got it bad and that aint good  
  
Now when the weekends over  
Monday rolls around  
I end up like I start out  
Just crying  
  
Oh she dont love me like I love her  
Nobody could  
I got it bad and it sure is good
