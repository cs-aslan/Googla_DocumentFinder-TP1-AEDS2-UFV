Were like a melody with no words  
Until we figure it out  
We sing  
La la la la la la  
  
I know its simple yeah but its worked right up til now  
Its up to now  
Yeah every days been like a dream world  
Oh but now your not just  
In my head oh no  
  
Will we remember different summers  
Its like tossing your heart to see where it land  
Heads is easy  
Tails is harder to plan  
If were starting all over again and again and again oh  
  
You know that I cant help but wonder  
Whats gonna happen next  
Im a little curious oh yeah  
Every star that I stood under  
When you were under it too  
Did you ever think about us  
I hope you did cause I can tell you  
Thats something Ill never forget  
I wont forget  
  
If we remember different summers  
Its like tossing your heart to see where it lands  
Heads is easy  
Tails is harder to plan  
If were starting all over again  
  
Dont need friends just beginning  
But I hope that we will find it again  
So we can go from here oh  
  
Will we remember different summers  
Its like tossing your hearts to see where it lands  
Heads is easy  
Tails is harder to plan  
If were starting all over again again and again and again and again  
And again and again and again  
Will we remember different summers
