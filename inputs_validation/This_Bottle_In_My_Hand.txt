Last week he spent his whole pay check on whiskey  
I know Friday night hell do it all again  
Oh hell drink till he falls down then hell order One more round  
And then go home with that bottle in his hand  
  
And the only thing I can hold on to is the bottle in my hand  
I know Ill never have to share it with any other man  
Im so glad you introduced us and Ill do the best I can  
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand  
  
She told George that changing diapers could sure become a drag  
And to clean the house and cook for him was not her kind of bag  
She said he needed someone who would love and understand  
Then she left him with that bottle in his hand  
  
And the only thing I can count on now is this bottle in my handv  
I know Ill never have to share it oh with any other man  
And Im so glad you introduced us oh Ill do the best I can  
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand  
Yes well be faithfull to this bottle in our hand
