Oh You gotta move on now  
I can see I can feel The tears in your eyes  
The tears that you cry you gotta move on now  
Let me wipe those tears from your eyes  
If I could only take his place On the other side  
I can see I can feel The tears in his eyes  
The tears that he cries  
We need each other  
In the darkest of night Hes all I have  
Solo  Andy  
Time is running out To find another soul  
Time is running out To find another soul  
You gotta move on now You gotta move on now  
And find another house before the dawn is coming in  
Moving on Moving on Oh yeah  
Before the dawn is coming in find a soul thats free of sin  
Im trying Crying Im trying I dont know if I can  
You gotta move on now You gotta move on now  
And find another house before the dawn is coming in  
Find a soul thats free on sin  
Time is running out Im moving on  
Time is running out Im moving on  
On the other side  
I can see I can feel The tears in his eyes  
The tears that he cries  
We need each other  
In the darkest of night  
Im moving on to THIS house
