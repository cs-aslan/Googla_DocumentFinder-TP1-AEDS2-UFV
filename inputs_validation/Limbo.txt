I see them all smiling  
Those all around me  
Tend to my wounds and alert my senses  
It would be nice  
Im not here  
Im dreaming  
Holding on  
  
Time has no meaning  
All of it wasted  
Smothers till there is no more air  
When will it be that I can breathe again  
Im waiting in the void  
  
Limbo lost in limbo  
Limbo limbo limbo  
Limbo lost in limbo  
Limbo  
  
This notion of needing had held me ransom  
And all I can do is avoid my mind  
Dont make me speak or hear or look  
Because Im hurting  
Help me out  
  
Limbo lost in limbo  
Limbo limbo limbo  
Limbo lost in limbo  
Limbo Im in limbo  
Limbo  
  
Im getting tired  
Im getting tired  
  
Caught in a crossfire  
Nobody gets it  
Im finding it hard to contain myself  
Take all my trust and faith and hope  
until I need it once again  
  
Limbo lost in limbo  
Limbo limbo limbo  
Limbo lost in limbo  
Limbo limbo limbo  
  
Limbo lost in limbo  
Limbo limbo limbo  
Limbo Im lost in limbo  
Limbo Im in limbo  
  
Limbo lost in limbo  
Limbo limbo limbo  
Limbo Im lost in limbo  
Limbo Im in limbo  
  
Limbo
