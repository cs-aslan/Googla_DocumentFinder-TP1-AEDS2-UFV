Higher higher  
Wont you come with me  
Baby gonna get my soul free  
  
Now you and me  
I guess we see things differently  
Were night and day  
A bad connection some would say  
And I dont want nothing to change  
I dont want nothing to change  
Because  
When you touch me baby  
I dont have no choice  
Oh that sweet temptation  
In your voice  
  
Higher higher  
Wont you come with me  
Baby gonna get my soul free  
  
Now seems to me  
Some things have just got to be  
The games we play  
Breakup makeup day by day  
And I dont want nothing to change  
I dont want nothing to change  
Because  
When you touch me baby  
I dont have no choice  
Oh that sweet temptation  
In your voice  
  
Higher higher  
Wont you come with me  
Baby gonna get my soul free
