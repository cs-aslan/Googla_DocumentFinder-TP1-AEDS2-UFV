Well I got time on my hands and I got you on my mind  
And the moon and the stars up above  
Theres a warm summer breeze  
Blowing down through the trees  
And somewhere someones falling in love  
Well if this world where we live is the only one we have  
Then theres only one thing Im thinking of  
Lets go for that ride  keep our eyes open wide  
Cause somewhere someones falling in love  
  
Chorus  
You may be looking for someone  
Someone may be looking for you  
Someday youll awaken and open your eyes  
And love will be looking at you  
  
So dont get down on yourself  
No and dont lose your faith  
Believe these words that Im singing of  
For as sure as the day that you were born  
Somewhere someones falling in love  
  
Repeat Chorus  
So dont get down on yourself  
No and dont lose your faith  
Believe these words that Im singing of  
For as sure as the day that you were born  
Somewhere someones falling in love  
Yeah for as sure as the day that you were born  
Somewhere someones falling  
Somewhere someones falling  
Somewhere someones falling in love
