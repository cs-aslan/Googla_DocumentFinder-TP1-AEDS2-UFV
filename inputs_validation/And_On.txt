Your mother was crying  
Your father passed her a handkerchief  
Their tearstained faces  
Looked to mine for a sign of grief  
A thousand raincoats  
Always stand around too long  
But I stayed to talk with you  
After they had gone  
  
The flowers I brought you  
Were beginning to fade under the heavy rain  
Your name on the card had run  
So I tried in vain to write it again  
They didnt understand you no  
They didnt even try  
Im so glad that you left us now  
Before you had the chance to die  
  
I sat there for a long time  
Expecting to turn and see you there  
I ran my fingers through the long grass  
Willing it to turn into your hair and oh  
Im gonna miss you dear  
But I dont have to cry  
  
Im so glad that you left us now  
Before you had the chance to die  
And oh Im going to miss you dear  
But Im not going to cry  
Im so glad that your life stopped now  
Before it had the chance to die
