These are the best times  
That youll ever have  
Dont throw it away because  
Youre younger that he is  
  
Chorus  
Hes your father  
And hell help you  
If you give him  
Hes your father  
Hell deserve you  
If you give him time  
  
These are the best times  
So well march in time  
The sun is too ripe to let  
The moon shine on your eyes  
  
Chorus  
  
These are the straight ways  
Dont make it long  
Dont get yourself lost because  
Youre following someone elses song  
  
Chorus
