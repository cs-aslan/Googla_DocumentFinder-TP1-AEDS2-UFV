I felt it the wire touched my neck  
And then someone pulled it tighter  
I never saw it coming I started to black out  
And then someone said good morning  
I took it as a warning  
I should have seen it coming  
So now Ill take a chance on  
  
This thing we may have started  
Intentional or not I dont think we saw it coming  
Its all adding up to something  
That asks for some involvement  
That ask for our commitment  
I think I see it coming  
If we step out of that limb  
  
My heart beat beats me senselessly  
Whys everything got to be so intense with me  
Im trying to handle all this unpredictability  
In all probability  
  
Its a long shot but I say why not  
If I say forget it I know that Ill regret it  
Its a long shot just to beat these odds  
The chance is we wont make it  
But I know if I dont take it theres no chance  
Cause youre the best I got  
So take a long shot  
  
I realize that there is all this starting  
Things were both scared about  
That well never see them coming  
Throw caution to the wind  
And well see which way its blowing  
And to this pulling on  
Well never see it coming  
Until its much to close to stop  
  
My heart beat beats me senselessly  
Whys everything got to be so intense with me  
Im trying to handle all this unpredictability  
In all probability  
  
Its a long shot but I say why not  
If I say forget it I know that Ill regret it  
Its a long shot just to beat these odds  
The chance is we wont make it  
But I know if I dont take it theres no chance  
Cause youre the best I got  
So take a long shot  
  
Oh I waited for fact to come of fiction  
And you fit my description  
I never saw you coming  
But well make it  
  
Its a long shot but I say why not  
If I say forget it I know that Ill regret it  
Its a long shot just to beat these odds  
The chance is we wont make it  
But I know if I dont take it theres no chance no chance  
Cause youre the best I got  
  
Its a long shot but I say why not  
If I say forget it I know that Ill regret it  
Its a long shot just to beat these odds  
The chance is we wont make it  
But I know if I dont take it  
Its a long shot but I say why not  
Oh you never saw me coming
