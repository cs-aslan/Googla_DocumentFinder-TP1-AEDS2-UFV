One finger on the button  
one finger up his nose  
Johnnys in some cornfield  
The Early Warning Blows  
Bigger is better  
More is more  
Look up America  
Gonna even up the score  
Get ready boys  
Third times a charm  
Dont need no sweater  
Its gonna keep you warm  
If we cant have the ball there wont be any winner  
this time  
Them and us  
Them and us  
Ashes to ashes  
Dust to dust  
If fortyfive minutes  
Itll all be done  
Well all be good and crispy  
But well still be number one  
And if things go from bad to worse  
We can still kill them if they kill us first  
If we cant have the ball there wont be any winner  
this time  
Hellbent  
Heaven sent  
It all got started by an accident  
If we cant have the ball there wont be any winner  
this time  
Them and us  
Them and us  
Ashes to ashes  
Dust to dust  
Them and us  
Them and us  
Ashes to ashes  
Dust to dust
