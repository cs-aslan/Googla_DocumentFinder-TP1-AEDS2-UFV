Most of my lfe Ive been runnin around  
Playin and havin a ball  
And maybe Ive been on a party too long  
These memries are fond to recall  
You see weve got this thing  
About women smokin and good alcohol  
Now Im lookin for a homelife  
And clean smellin sheets  
And all the soft places to fall  
  
The women weve known have been many  
But they dont understand us at all  
Though weve spent many a long hours  
Hopin some old love would call  
Surely somebody somewhere still wants us  
Or dont nobody wants us at all  
Were lookin for a homelife  
And clean smellin sheets  
And all the soft places to fall  
  
Most of our lives weve been outlaws  
Slept with our backs to the wall  
Im a rambler Im a seeker  
And were gettin weaker  
A whole lot more likely to fall  
Were tired of the rocks and brambles  
Those barbed wire fences and all  
Were lookin for a homelife  
And clean smellin sheets  
And all the soft places to fall  
  
Most of our lives weve been outlaws  
Slept with our backs to the wall  
Im a rambler Im a seeker  
And were gettin weaker  
A whole lot more likely to fall  
Were tired of the rocks and brambles  
Those barbed wire fences and all  
Were lookin for a homelife  
And clean smellin sheets  
And all the soft places to fall
