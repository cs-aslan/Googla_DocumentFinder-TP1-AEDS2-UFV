Save your twisted enemy  
So you might earn forgiveness  
You know youre whole world is waiting  
So why cant you speak  
  
I feel it coming over me  
Im still a slave to these dreams  
Is this the end of everything  
Or just a new way to bleed  
  
So go and tell all your friends  
That Im a failure underneath  
If it makes you feel like a bigger man  
But its my my heart my life  
That youre calling a lie  
Ive played this game before  
And I cant take anymore  
  
I feel it coming over me  
Im still a slave to these dreams  
Is this the end of everything  
Or just a new way to bleed  
  
Ive drifted far beyond the end  
Freedom  
Freedom  
Cant you feel the ground caving in  
Freedom  
Give us a reason to believe again  
  
I feel it coming over me  
Im still a slave to these dreams  
Is this the end of everything  
Or just a new way to bleed
