Tonight Im sad my heart is weary  
Im wondring if Im wrong or right  
although youve gone and found another  
I wonder where you are tonight  
  
Chorus  
That old rain is cold and slowly fallin  
Upon my window pane tonight  
And tho your love was even colder  
I wonder where you are tonight  
  
Your heart was cold you never loved me  
Tho you said you often cared  
And now youve gone and found another  
Someone who knows the love I shared  
  
Chorus  
  
Then came the dawn that day you left me  
I tried to smile with all my might  
But you could see the pain within me  
That lingers in my heart tonight  
  
Chorus
