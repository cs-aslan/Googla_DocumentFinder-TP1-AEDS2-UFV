Did I ever say how I feel about you  
A thing I never found that easy to do  
The things that you do dont need to be heard  
You know your actions baby speak louder than words  
  
Ive got the bottle bring me your cup  
Pop the cork and try a sup  
And when youre empty Ill fill you up  
Well drink it down till the sun comes up  
  
Im heading home like a steaming train  
Foot to the floor in the driving rain  
My head is aching and my mouth is dry  
Ive got a thirst only you can satisfy  
  
Ive got the bottle bring me your cup  
Pop the cork and try a sup  
And when youre empty Ill fill you up  
Well drink it down till the sun comes up
