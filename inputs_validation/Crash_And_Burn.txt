The smoke has cleared  
And Im still standing here  
  
My worlds gone down in flames  
But still I have no fear  
  
Youve lied  
You told your tale  
You tried  
To make me fail  
You took your best shot  
Left me to rot  
Through all this Ill never crash and burn  
Lesson learned  
  
Wearing suits  
And driving shiny cars  
  
You money hungry fools  
  
What gives you the right to say  
Who gets to win who is to lose  
  
Youve lied  
You told your tale  
You tried  
To make me fail  
You took your best shot  
Left me to rot  
Through all this Ill never crash and burn  
Lesson learned  
Crash and burn  
Lesson learned  
Youre such fools  
  
Through all this Ill never crash and burn  
Yeah  
Lesson learned  
Crash and burn  
Lesson learned
