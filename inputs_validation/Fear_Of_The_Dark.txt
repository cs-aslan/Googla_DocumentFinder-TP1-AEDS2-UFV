I am a man who walks alone  
And when Im walking a dark road  
At night or strolling through the park  
  
When the light begins to fade  
I sometimes feel a little strange  
A little anxious when its dark  
  
Fear of the dark fear of the dark  
I have constant fear that somethings  
Always near  
Fear of the dark fear of the dark  
I have a phobia that someones  
Always there  
  
Have you run your fingers down  
The wall  
And have you felt your neck skin crawl  
When youre searching for the light  
Sometimes when youre scared  
To take a look  
At the corner of the room  
Youve sensed that somethings  
Watching you  
  
Have you ever been alone at night  
Thought you heard footsteps behind  
And turned around and no ones there  
And as you quicken up your pace  
You find it hard to look again  
Because youre sure theres  
Someone there  
  
Watching horror films the night before  
Debating witches and folklores  
The unknown troubles on your mind  
Maybe your mind is playing tricks  
You sense and suddenly eyes fix  
On dancing shadows from behind  
  
Fear of the dark fear of the dark  
I have a constant fear that somethings  
Always near  
Fear of the dark fear of the dark  
I have a phobia that someones  
Always there  
  
When Im walking a dark road  
I am a man who walks alone
