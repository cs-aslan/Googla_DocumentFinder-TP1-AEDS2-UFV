Never twenty one when everyones a sailor  
Coming up strong with the animal bar  
Ever loving more with MrNorman Mailer  
Turn another page at the animal bar  
And it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
Because it cant be long  
  
I I I the cry of vacilation  
I I I the higher meditation  
I I I the sweet precipitation  
I I I the higher depravation  
And it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
Because it cant be long  
  
Rain on my frustration  
Save my queen now break this  
Wash me down my station  
Make more rain forsaken  
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth  
One two three lets make this  
Coming through the world I got a feeling of words  
One two three forsake this  
  
All aboard the ship cause  
Your going to need arc when  
The wet comes down youll be swimming like a shark  
Mopping up the pain when Im a little older  
Right as rain at the animal bar  
And it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
Because it cant be long  
  
I I I the cry of vacilation  
I I I the higher meditation  
I I I the mild precipitation  
I I I the higher depravation  
And it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
Because it cant be long  
  
Rain on my frustration  
Save my queen now break this  
Wash me down my station  
Make more rain forsaken  
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth  
One two three lets make this  
Coming through the world I got a feeling of words  
One two three forsake this  
  
Raindrops will fall from the sky  
Stealing the shape from your eye  
Now we can all get some sleep  
The water the water the water  
Saving us from the heat  
Somethings will die in there place  
Others will leave with a trace  
Fire will come by its day  
The water the water the water  
Washing it all away  
  
Rain on my frustration  
Save my queen now break this  
Wash me down my station  
Make more rain forsaken  
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth  
One two three lets make this  
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth  
One two three forsake this  
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth  
One two three lets make this  
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth  
One two three forsake this
