Space girls are as cold as ice  
Theyll kiss you once and kiss you twice  
Youll shiver and shake and then turn blue  
Next you got the space girl blues  
I want your mechanism  
Give me your mechanism  
Space girls always smoke for taste  
Swallow butts and leave no waste  
Sadomaso is the rule  
You want them they dont want you  
Just to show that they dont care  
Theyll bite your face and burn the hair  
The sun comes up the moon boohoos  
Next you got the spacegirl blues  
I need your mechanism  
Destroy your mechanism  
Destroy it
