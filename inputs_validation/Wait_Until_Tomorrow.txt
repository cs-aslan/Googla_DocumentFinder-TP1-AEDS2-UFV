Well Im standing here freezing  
Inside your golden garden  
Got my ladder leaned up against your wall  
Tonights the night we planed to run away together  
Come on dolly may theres no time to stall  
But now youre telling me that a  
I think we better wait till tomorrow  
What you say  
I think we better wait till tomorrow  
Aint gone wait that long  
I think we better wait till tomorrow  
  
Got to make sure its right  
So until tomorrow goodnight  
Oh what a drag  
  
Oh dolly may how can you hang we out this way  
On the phone you said you wanted to run off with me today  
Now Im sanding here like some  
Turned down serenading fool  
Hearing strange words stutter from the mixedup mind of you  
And you keep telling me that ah  
I think we better wait till tomorrow  
What ya say  
I think we better wait till tomorrow  
I aint gonna wait that long  
I think we better wait till tomorrow  
  
Got to make sure its right  
So until tomorrow goodnight  
See if I can talk to this girl a little bit  
  
Hey Dolly may girl you must be insane  
So unsure of yourself  
Leaning from you unsure window pane  
Do I see a silhouette of somebody pointing  
Something from a tree  
Click bang  
Oh what a hang your daddy just shot poor me  
And I hear you say as I fade away  
  
We dont have to wait till tomorrow  
Well I guess we dont have till tomorrow  
We dont have to wait till tomorrow  
That sure is a drag on my part baby  
We dont have to wait till tomorrow  
  
It must not have been right  
So forever goodnight  
  
We dont have to wait till tomorrow  
We dont have to wait  
We dont have to wait till tomorrow  
We dont have to wait  
We dont have to wait till tomorrow  
I wont be around tomorrow  
We dont have to wait till tomorrow  
We dont have to wait  
  
So here I am baby  
Yeah  
Hey man whats gone on
