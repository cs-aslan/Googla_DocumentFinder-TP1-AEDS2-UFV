Anytime you need me babe just call Ill be there  
Call and see what a good friend can be  
When you need someone to care  
Nothing more than understanding just a man whos undemanding  
  
Like a leaf thats only landing suddenly goes when the wind gently blows  
And Im asking nothing of you love only what you want to give  
And I wish you what I wish myself ss long as I may live  
Other arms will surely hold you just remember the things that I told you  
  
When these arms of mine enfold you  
Its not out of greed but for love and for need  
  
I love you so I still do Im sure you know when Im holding you  
The sad part of seeing you is goodbye  
Call and Ill come when your worlds come undone  
Im like you I get lonely too and I need someone to hold  
Knowing well this world can be hell and sometimes very cold  
  
Nothing firm and nothing binding now and then a slight reminding  
Waking up one day and finding somewhere to run somewhere to run  
Somewhere to run when your worlds come undone  
Oh babe Ill be there Ill be there anytime  
  
Theres a certain thing about you summer fall and spring about you  
I could write and sing about you and never run out never run out no  
Never run out of what youre all about  
Oh babe Ill be there  Ill be there anytime
