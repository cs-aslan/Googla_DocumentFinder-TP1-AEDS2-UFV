Everybodys waiting  
Everybodys watching  
Even when youre sleeping  
Keep your aheyes open  
  
The tricky thing  
Is yesterday we were just children  
Playing soldiers just pretending  
Dreaming dreams with happy endings  
In backyards  
Winning battles with the  
Wooden swords  
But now weve stepped into a  
Cruel world  
Where everybody stands and  
Keeps score  
Keep your eyes open  
  
Everybodys waiting to see the breakdown everybodys watching to see the
fallout  
Even when your sleeping sleeping keep your aheyes open  
Keep your aheyes open  
Keep your aheyes open  
  
So here you are  
Two steps ahead and stating  
On guard  
Every lesson forms a new scar  
They never thought youd make it this far  
But turn around  
Now theyve surrounded you  
Its a showdown  
Nobody comes to save you now  
But youve got something they dont yeah youve got something they dont you
just gotta  
Keep your eyes open  
  
Everybodys waiting to see the breakdown everybodys watching to see the
fallout even when your sleeping sleeping keep your aheyes open  
Keep your aheyes open  
Keep your aheyes  keep your feet ready heartbeat steady  
Keep your eyes open  
  
Keep your aim locked  
The night grows dark  
Keep your eyes open  
  
Background  
Keep your aheyes open  
Keep your aheyes open  
Keep your eyes open  
  
Everybodys waiting to see the breakdown everybodys watching to see the
fallout even when your sleeping sleeping keep your aheyes open  
Keep your aheyes open
