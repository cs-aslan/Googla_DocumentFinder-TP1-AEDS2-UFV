I found a picture of you oh oh oh oh  
What hijacked my world that night  
To a place in the past  
Weve been cast out of Oh oh oh oh  
Now were back in the fight  
Were back on the train  
Oh back on the chain gang  
  
A circumstance beyond our control oh oh oh oh  
The phone the TV and the news of the world  
Got in the house like a pigeon from hell oh oh oh oh  
Threw sand in our eyes and descended like flies  
Put us back on the train  
Oh back on the chain gang  
  
The powers that be  
That force us to live like we do  
Bring me to my knees  
When I see what theyve done to you  
But Ill die as I stand here today  
Knowing that deep in my heart  
Theyll fall to ruin one day  
For making us part  
  
I found a picture of you oh oh oh oh  
Those were the happiest days of my life  
Like a break in the battle was your part oh oh oh oh  
In the wretched life of a lonely heart  
Now were back on the train  
Oh back on the chain gang
