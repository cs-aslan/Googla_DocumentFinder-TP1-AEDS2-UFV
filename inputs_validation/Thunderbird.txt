Hello you  
yes its me  
You cant come back  
Your flyin free  
You think you found  
Everything that you need  
  
Fly away fly away  
To your new home  
Across the seas  
Oh leave your nest  
Oh baby leave the best thing  
That youve been  
Whoa whoa whoa  
  
Fly on Thunderbird fly  
Fly on spread your wings to the sky  
Fly on Thunderbird fly  
  
On your own  
And Im alone  
In the shadow  
Of what we done  
And I cant help but think  
That someday  
Youll be back home whoa  
  
Fly away fly away  
To your new home  
Across the bay  
And give your best  
Ooh baby leave the best thing  
That youve been  
Oh oh oh  
  
Fly on Thunderbird fly  
Fly on spread your wings to the sky  
Fly on Thunderbird fly fly on  
Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah  
  
When all is said  
All is done  
Still I live  
And carry on  
Dont look back  
But think of me  
Well meet again  
Fly away oh

Fly on spread your wings to the sky  
Fly on Thunderbird fly

Fly on spread your wings to the sky  
On to the sky  
Fly on Thunderbird
