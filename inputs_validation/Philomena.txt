Ive been a wild wild rover  
Sailed all over the sea  
But this thing that makes me wonder  
Has made a fool of me  
  
For it took me from my childhood  
Underneath the stars and skies  
And I still hear the wind  
Whistling through the wild wood whispering goodbye  
  
Its home boys home  
Shes home boys home  
No matter  
Where I roam  
  
If you see my mother  
Please give her all of my love  
For she has a heart of gold there  
As good as God above  
  
If you see my mother  
Tell her Im keeping fine  
Tell her that I love her  
And Ill try and write sometime
