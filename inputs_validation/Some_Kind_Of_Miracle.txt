Prayed for an angel  
To come in the night  
And shine some sweet light on me  
Found only strangers  
Then you came to me  
Just when Id given up you gave me love  
My world was tumbling down  
You turned it around baby  
  
Chorus  
You youre some kind of miracle  
You are youre a miracle to me  
  
Sweet revelation  
That look in your eyes  
Your touch in the night  
I find the sweetest salvation  
In your arms baby  
Warm as the morning sun your tender love  
Came and just lifted me up  
Look what youve done baby  
  
Chorus  
  
You brought joy to my heart  
I found love in your arms  
See what youve done to me  
You set my soul so free  
You came and you gave me the love that I need  
  
You youre some kind of miracle  
You are youre a miracle a miracle to me  
Baby you are a miracle to me
