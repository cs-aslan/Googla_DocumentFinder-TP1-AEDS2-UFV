If I were your woman and you were my man  
youd have no other woman youd be weak as a lamb  
If you had the strength to walk out that door  
My love would over rule my sense and Id call you back for more  
If I were your woman  
If I were your woman and you were my man Um baby  
  
She tears you down darlin says youre nothing at all  
But Ill pick you up darling when she lets you fall  
Youre like a diamond but she treats you like glass  
Yet you beg her to love you but me you dont ask  
If I were your woman If I were your woman  
If I were your woman heres what Id do  
Id never no no stop loving you  
Yeah yeah um  
  
Life is so crazy a love is unkind  
Because she came first darling will she hang on your mind  
Youre a part of me and you dont even know it  
Im what you need but Im too afraid to show it  
If I were your woman If I were your woman  
If I were your woman heres what Id do  
Never no no no stop loving you ah yeah  
If I were your woman heres what Id do  
Never never stop loving you if
