Yes its true  
  
I want that apple just like William Tell  
No more floor gazing no more head down the well  
Im feeling extrovert  
I should be shaking the stars instead of hugging the dirt  
  
I swear  
  
Im really burning fit to boil up the sea  
Human volcano at a zillion degrees  
Im feeling extrovert  
Instead of quiet and shy Im really dying to flirt  
  
I feel like someone else  
Yes I do yes I do yes I do  
I feel like someone else  
I feel new not so blue  
I feel  
Extrovert  
  
No hidden message nothing political  
You neednt listen I just wanted to show  
Im feeling extrovert  
I am the lion whos roaring not the mouse that gets hurt  
  
I feel like someone else  
Yes I do yes I do yes I do  
I feel like someone else  
I feel new not so blue  
I feel  
My trumpet plays for you  
Im gonna blow it now
