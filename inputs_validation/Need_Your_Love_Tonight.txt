Oh baby Ill buy you a diamond ring  
Oh baby Ill buy you a diamond ring  
If you let me darling  
Ill give you almost anything  
  
Well its early in the morning  
And my baby cant be found  
Well its early in the morning  
And my baby cant be found  
I looking working for my baby  
But she aint nowhere around  
  
Oh baby I need your love tonight  
Oh baby you know I need your love tonight  
I want to make love to you darling  
While the moon is shining bright  
  
Well its high up in the morning  
And Im looking for my babe  
Yes I been up in the morning  
And Im looking for my babe  
If she dont come back to me  
Ill put her six feet in her grave  
  
I said baby I need your love tonight  
Oh baby I need your love tonight  
I want to make love to you baby  
While the moon is shining bright
