Youre far away from me  
And we dont talk enough  
Here at home everythings the same  
Just empty and its tough  
  
Youre far away from me  
And missing in our room  
Here at home time stands in his corner  
Silent as a tomb  
  
The worlds an open window  
The wold is big and youre so small  
What awaits you what do you see  
When youre far away from me  
  
You dont stop for a minute  
Youre always running fast  
No time to talk to me right now  
cause its a quarter past  
  
Youre far away from me  
Our room is not the same  
By chance I heard the radio today  
Mention your name  
  
The worlds an open window  
The wold is big and youre so small  
What awaits you what do you see  
When youre far away from me  
  
You never calm down  
Can the horizon promise you be free  
What awaits you when youre far away from me
