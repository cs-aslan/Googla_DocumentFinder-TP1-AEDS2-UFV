Evening has come to pass  
The time of day doesnt last  
Evening has earned its place today  
Im tired of working away  
  
Working living it brings  
Only way to have those things  
Toiling has bought too many tears  
Turn round all those past years  
  
Evening time to get away  
Evening time to get away  
Evening time to get away  
Til next day  
  
Live all you people you cant see where youre at  
It doesnt really hurt you so that cant be bad  
  
Live all you people you cant see where youre at  
It doesnt really hurt you so that cant be bad  
  
Evening time to get away  
Evening time to get away
