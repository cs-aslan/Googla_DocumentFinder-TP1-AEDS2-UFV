Here I am once again  
This time babe Im gonna do it right  
Minds made up heart is set  
Aint no way Im gonna compromise  
  
Something happened Hollywood skies  
I was mesmerized  
Suits and ties with platinum eyes  
Cold cash junkies got the best of me  
  
Victim of circumstance  
  
Got myself back together  
Learned my lesson well  
I had to put up a fight to make it right  
Freedoms ringing like the sound of a bell  
  
Victim of circumstance  
  
One more thing I want to say to you  
Before you go away  
Dont you let em no  
Dont you let em no
