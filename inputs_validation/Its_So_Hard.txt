When the light comes and yure feelin down  
Cause your babys out there somewhere runnin round  
Dont start feeling blue and feeling lonely too  
Its hard I know when that love aint true  
  
You just cant explain but you know its there  
That empty feeling seems so unfair  
What can you do when its gone its gone  
Cause those lovin feelings seem to hurt so long  
  
So if you feel like cryin go ahead and cry  
A heartbreak will cool as time goes by  
And its so hard baby its so hard to take  
Its so hard baby its so hard to take  
  
Well you work so long every day and night  
Tryin every thing that seems so right  
But when a love falls a heart must break  
And its so hard baby its so hard to take
