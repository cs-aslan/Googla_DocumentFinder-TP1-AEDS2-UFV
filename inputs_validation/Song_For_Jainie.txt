Youve got the untortured mind of a woman  
Who has answered all the questions before  
Youve got the freegivin ways of a woman  
Who has kicked all the heartache out the door  
And Jainie dont you know  
Jainie dont you know I been tryin  
Jainie dont you know  
Jainie dont you know I been tryin  
I brought to you my tired plans and wearied faith to you  
And with a smile you took me in and showed me love again  
Now it has to be say goodbye or stay that I dont know  
But remember please I gave you love thats only mine to give  
And Jainie dont you know  
Jainie dont you know I been tryin  
Jainie dont you know  
Jainie dont you know I been tryin  
Yes I truly love to be with you  
If I wasnt with the one that Im with  
Yes I truly love to lie by you  
If I didnt have to give what I give  
And Jainie dont you know  
Jainie dont you know I been tryin  
Jainie dont you know  
Jainie dont you know I been tryin  
I brought to you my tired plans and wearied faith to you  
And with a smile you took me in and showed me love again  
Now it has to be say goodbye or stay that I dont know  
But remember please I gave you love thats only mine to give  
And Jainie dont you know  
Jainie dont you know I been tryin  
Jainie dont you know  
Jainie dont you know I been tryin
