I know you got a different picture in mind  
Some dream world of a different kind  
I know this rhythm weve been moving to is way too slow  
Each time our bodies aresupposed to meet  
Im here still missing a beat  
And when I look at you I see in your eyes  
Were still dancing to a different tune  
  
Take me to your dreaming place  
Open up my eyes  
Let me see what it takes to be  
Your lover in disguise  
show me how I do those things  
That make you want to stay  
Cause Ill Go crazy if I dont find  
The words I gotta say  
To steal your heart away  
  
Ill buy you diamonds buy you golden rings  
All kinds of Beautiful things  
But that dont matter to a lover with a Restless heart  
Cause you still want to wake up to a Different scene  
Some screen gem like the one in your dream  
And leave me standing like a foolin the wings  
Still waiting for a part to Play  
  
Take me to your dreaming place  
Open up my eyes  
Let me see what it takes to be  
Your lover in disguise  
Show me How I can do those things  
That make you want to stay  
Cause Ill go crazy if I dont find  
The words I gotta say  
To steal your heart away  
  
I know you think shes right for you  
That shes in tune with what you do  
That she can touch you deep inside  
Where all your deepest feelings lie  
But I got something you should know  
Before she starts to hurt you so  
You can bet your life shes gonna hurt you  
  
And maybe you think that its alright  
To leave me waiting every night  
To put me down in company  
In front of everyone we see  
To take my loving when its free  
And then to throw it back at me  
  
Well baby I just cant stand it  
Cause I can be the one for you  
And I can make your dreams come true  
And I can love you like she can  
Cause fancy clothes dont make no woman  
Believe me baby  
I got what it takes to make you feel good  
  
And maybe you think a girl should be  
As perfect as a girl can be  
To love you when your feeling down  
And miss you when youre not around  
Well I cant be that one for you  
I can only be the one that loves you  
  
Hey whats this on your mind  
Hey whats this change of mind  
Hey whats this on your mind
