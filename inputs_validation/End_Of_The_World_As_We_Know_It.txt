Thats great it starts with an earthquake  
Birds and snakes and aeroplanes  
And Lenny Bruce is not afraid  
  
Eye of a hurricane listen to yourself churn  
World serves its own needs dummy serve your own needs  
Feed it off an aux speak grunt no  
Ladder with a clatter fight fear flight down height  
Wire in a fire representing seven games and a government for hire in a combat
site  
Left of west and coming in a hurry with the furies breathing down your neck  
  
Team by team reporters baffled trumped tethered cropped  
Look at that low playing fine then  
Uhoh overflow population common food but itll do  
Save yourself serve yourself world serves its own needs  
Listen to your heart bleed dummy with the rapture and the revered and the
right right  
Vitreolic patriotic stand fight bright light  
Feeling pretty psyched  
  
Its the end of the world as we know it  
Its the end of the world as we know it  
Its the end of the world as we know it  
And I feel fine  
  
Six oclock tv hour dont get caught in foreign towers  
Slash and burn return listen to yourself churn  
Locking in uniforming bookburning bloodletting  
Every motive escalate automotive incinerate  
Light a candle light a votive step down step down  
Watch your heel crush crushed uhoh this means  
No fear cavalier renegade steer clear  
A tournament a tournament a tournament of lies  
Offer me solutions offer me alternatives  
And I decline  
  
Its the end of the world as we know it  
Its the end of the world as we know it Its time I had some time alone  
Its the end of the world as we know it  
And I feel fine  
  
I feel fine  
  
The other night I dreamt of knives continental drift divide  
Mountains sit in a line Leonard Bernstein  
Leonid Brezhnev Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs  
Birthday party cheescake jellybean boom you  
Symbiotic patriotic slam book neck  
Right Right  
  
Its the end of the world as we know it  
Its the end of the world as we know it Its time I had some time alone  
Its the end of the world as we know it  
And I feel fine  
  
I feel fine
