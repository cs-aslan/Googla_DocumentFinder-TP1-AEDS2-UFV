I dont lose my blues  
When I pretend youre with me  
Though I make believe  
Im still alone  
When I think of you  
My empty arms remind me  
That my one true love has gone  
  
I was a fool thats why I cried over you  
I was a fool I only wanted you  
  
When I smile so gay everybody knows  
That Ive lost my love  
But thats the way it goes  
When I think of you  
My empty arms remind me  
That my one true love has gone  
  
I was a fool thats why I cried over you  
I was a fool I only wanted you
