With a little luck this ol truck will get me home today  
With a little more Ill still have this job tomorrow  
Weather man says a wet weekend he just might be right  
But rain or shine youll be mine tonight  
  
Thats all I need to know  
In a world where most things come and go  
Ill always have you to hold  
And thats all I need to know  
  
Heaven knows I aint even close to bein Gods gift to women  
But in your arms I feel like I am  
I dont know it all I sure cant solve  
The problems of the human race  
But I know how to bring a smile to your face  
  
Thats all I need to know  
In a world where most things come and go  
Ill always have you to hold  
And thats all I need to know  
  
Darlin say it one more time  
You will forever be mine  
  
Thats all I need to know  
In a world where most things come and go  
Ill always have you to hold  
And thats all I need to know  
Ill always have you to hold  
Thats all I need to know
