Well come on pretty baby you know what I like now  
Youre shakin all over and its feeling alright now  
Youre rockin and rollin and I dont know what to say  
But daddys little cats gonna rock all day  
Well come on pretty woman you know what I mean now  
The beats just screaming right through your head  
Youre shakin my heart youre shakin my soul   
I just go crazy when you rocknroll  
There you go takin my love from me  
There you go takin my love from me  
Drive you home my country rose now  
Hold you tight never let you go now  
Kissing and huggin outside your door  
Til your pa sees and wants no more
