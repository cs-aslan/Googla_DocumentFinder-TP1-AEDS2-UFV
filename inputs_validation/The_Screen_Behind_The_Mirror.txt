Heres the mirror  
Behind there is a screen  
Turn around  
On both ways you can get in  
The experience of survival  
Look around just people can you hear their voice  
Find the one wholl guide you to the limits of your choice  
  
The experience of survival  
Try to think about it  
Thats the chance to live your life and discover  
Try to think about it  
The experience of survival  
The experience  
The experience of survival  
The experience
