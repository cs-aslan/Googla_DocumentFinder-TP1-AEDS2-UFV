Rebel rebel and yell  
Cause our people still dwell in hell  
Locked in a cell  
Yes the structures a cell  
Mad is the story I tell  
How long can we wait  
Come on seein whats at stake  
Action for reaction  
If your minds in a somewhat complacent state  
Get a check up  
This is a stick up  
Our freedom or your life  
Lord I wish I could be peaceful  
But there can be no sequel  
Now freedom must be fundamental  
In Johannesburg or South Central  
On the mic cause someone should tell em  
To kick in the township rebellion  
  
Yeah what about that sucker Unh  
  
Yeah so you thought you could get with the hard lines  
That fill your mind  
Thoughts battles fought  
And lessons taught  
Yes Ill display the fitness  
And flip like a gymnast  
Raise my fist and resist  
Asleep though we stand in the midst  
Of a war  
Gotta get mine  
Gotta get more  
Keepin the mic warm against the norm  
Cause what does it offer me  
I think often its nothin but a coffin  
  
Gotta get wreck  
Till our necks never swing on a rope  
From here to the cape of no hope  
  
Now freedom must be fundamental  
In Johannesburg or South Central  
On the mic cause someone should tell em  
To kick in the township rebellion  
  
Why stand on a silent platform  
Fight the war fuck the norm  
Why stand on a silent platform

Whats it gonna take  
  
Shackle their minds when theyre bent on the cross  
When ignorance reigns life is lost  
Shackle their minds when theyre left on the cross  
When ignorance reigns life is lost  
Shackled our minds when were bent on the cross  
When ignorance reigns life is lost  
Shackled our minds when were left on the cross  
When ignorance reigns life is lost lost lost  
Shackle your minds and youre left on the cross  
When ignorance reigns life is lost  
Just shackle your minds when youre bent on the cross  
When ignorance reigns life is lost lost
