If you go looking for hot water dont act shocked when you get burned a
little bit  
  
If you really want some hot water I can help you find it  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Ah yeah  
  
Well if they catch me around youre playing rock the boat  
Im gonna catch Hell  
And if youre throwing your voice in bed singing a note  
Im gonna catch Hell  
I know it  
  
Thats right  
Try and catch me  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Tricky tricky  
Yeah  
  
Oh  
Oh  
  
If youre getting tricky lying to yourself  
Youre gonna catch Hell  
And if youre testing God lying to his face  
Youre gonna catch Hell  
Cmon  
  
Hey  
Thats it  
Theyre gonna catch you  
Theyre gonna catch you
