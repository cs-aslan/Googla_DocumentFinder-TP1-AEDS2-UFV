Drive a Chevy cause he drove Chevys  
Like him Im a baseball fan  
Im going back to see him  
While he still knows  
Who I am  
  
Mama says he cant remember  
Daddy thinks that he still can  
Im going back to see him  
While he still knows  
Who I am  
  
This time Im gonna hug him  
Instead of just shaking hands  
Gonna tell him that I love him  
While he still knows  
Who I am  
  
I only knew him as my father  
Im gonna get to know the man  
Im going back to see him  
While he still knows  
Who I am  
  
This time Im gonna kiss him  
Instead of just shaking hands  
Gonna tell him that I love him  
While he still knows  
Who I am  
  
I know I cant turn back time  
Well slow it down while we can  
Im going home to see him  
While he still knows  
Who I am  
  
While he still knows  
Who I am
