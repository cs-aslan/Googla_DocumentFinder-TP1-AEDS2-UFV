A vacation in the foreign land  
Uncle Sam does the best he can  
Youre in the army now  
Oh oh youre in the army now  
  
Now you remember what the draft man said  
Nothing to do all day but stay in bed  
Youre in the army now  
Oh oh youre in the army now  
  
Youll be a hero of the neighborhood  
Nobody knows that you left for good  
Youre in the army now  
Oh oh youre in the army now  
  
Smiling faces on the way to Nam  
But once you get there no one gives a damn  
Youre in the army now  
Oh oh youre in the army now  
  
Hand grenades flying over your head  
  
Missiles flying over your head  
If you want to survive get out of bed  
Youre in the army now  
Oh oh youre in the army now  
  
Shots ring out in the dead of night  
The sergeant calls Stand up and fight  
Youre in the army now  
Oh oh youre in the army now  
  
Youve got your orders to shoot on sight  
Your fingers on the trigger but it dont seem right  
Youre in the army now  
Oh oh youre in the army now  
  
Night is falling and you just cant see  
Is this illusion or reality  
Youre in the army now  
Oh oh you
