Were pretty boys  
For secret girls  
Who never stood a chchchchchance in the world  
Im not ready for sincerity  
Id tell any lie to keep you listenlistenlistenlistening  
  
I gave you pretentious  
I gave you indifference but you only wanted undressed and defenseless  
With all your cheap words about hearts and accidents  
Who are you kidding Who are you kidding  
So listenlistenlisten  
  
Sinceritys in  
So dont you sound like you mean it  
Hold back your breath  
In a year no one will even care  
  
If its in  
So dont you sound like you mean it  
Hold back your breath  
In a year  
  
Everyone loves an underdog  
Thats why youre singing along

And this all ends  
Ill wish it never began  
Oh I will die without the attention  
  
When the hook sets in  
And when this all ends  
I will wish it never began  
Oh I will die without the attention  
Oh I will die without the attention

So dont you sound like you mean it  
Hold back your breath  
In a year no one will even care
