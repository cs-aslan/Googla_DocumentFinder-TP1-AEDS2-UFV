Arguing your point about which race is best  
Think youve got some insight well its just prejudice  
And the more that you argue the more mad you get  
Well I dont want to fill myself with hate like that  
Youre prejudice just look at you  
Youre prejudiced and youre gonna be judged too  
Youve taken your stance youve split us apart  
Lets see how many bad feelings you can start  
Trying to make hatred seem real cool  
Keep talking those facts you come off the fool  
Youre prejudice just look at you  
Youre prejudiced and youre gonna be judged too  
Unite the race what listen  
We may be the same race but were not the same  PREJUDICE   
Youre cowards looking for someone else to blame  
And youre just a few cause most are too smart  
To listen to all the shit that you start
