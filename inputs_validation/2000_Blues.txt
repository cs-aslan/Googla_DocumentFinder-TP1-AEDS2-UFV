A hundred thousand dollars  
Wouldnt touch the price I paid  
Of the hundred thousand moments  
Of the times I wish Id stayed  
But even if I had all the time and money  
Its still the same old news  
Nothin does you any good  
When you got 2000 blues  
  
Ten thousand clouds  
On a rainy rainy day  
Couldnt wash away  
All the dust and the haze  
But I tried and I tried  
To search for all the clues  
Why I cant wash away  
These 2000 blues  
  
If I had an airplane  
With a copilot too  
Id fly to a planet  
That was closest to you  
Id set the tracking system  
With your safety fuse  
And set the countdown  
For 2000 blues
