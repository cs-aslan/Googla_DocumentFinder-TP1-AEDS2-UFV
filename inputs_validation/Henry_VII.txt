Of all the kings called Henry Im the one youve rarely heard  
Shakespeare wrote four five six eight but seven not a word  
People think Im dreary to some extent I am  
But look a little closer glam bam thank you mam  
  
I didnt agree with King Richard three  
So I fought him at Bosworth field and won victory  
How cool does it sound that Im the king who found  
Richards crown in a hedge on the winning battle ground  
The only way to end war and avert further disaster  
Theres got to be a way to unite York and Lancaster  
  
Im the original chchch Tudor  
Founder of that dynasty  
The man who closes the Wars of the Roses  
Thats right thats right thats me  
  
I launched attacks on lords who earned stacks  
Mine was a noble cause to tap them all for tax  
They paid their share was only fair  
To making good rich and be a millionaire  
Elizabeth York became my wife for life that make me a bore  
Joined our family seats thats neat made my rule secure  
  
Im the original chchch Tudor  
Returning power to the state  
It seemed quite toothless but actually ruthless  
I made the monarchy great  
  
Spent a long time fighting pretenders to the throne  
Lambert Simnel Perkin Warbeck said my throne was their own  
They claimed theyd been the princes in the tower their rule delayed  
I said this crown aint big enough for the three of us and had one slayed  
  
Im the original chchch Tudor  
King of foreign policy  
Doing hostile relations with enemy nations  
I asked them amake friends with me  
  
Yeh the original chchch Tudor  
They say dullness my main trait  
Well thats a sad endightment cause if youre looking for excitement  
My son was Henry the Eighth
