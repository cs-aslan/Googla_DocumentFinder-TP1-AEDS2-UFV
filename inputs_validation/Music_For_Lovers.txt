There is music for lovers  
It to be found  
In the sound  
Of a sigh  
And theres music for lovers  
In the hushabye dreams  
Of a child  
When the whole world discovers  
That loves the only thing worthwhile  
Then therell be music for everyone  
And the whole world will smile  
In the willow tree  
Made for you and me  
Theres a silver symphony of birds  
When the poets rhyme  
In the summer time  
Youll hear melodies  
In the words  
There is music for lovers  
It to be found  
In the stream  
Running wild  
And theres music for lovers  
In the hushabye dreams  
Of you child  
When the whole world discovers  
That love is the only thing worthwhile  
Therell be music for everyone  
And the whole world will smile
