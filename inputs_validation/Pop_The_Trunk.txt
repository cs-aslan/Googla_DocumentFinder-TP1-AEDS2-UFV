Meth lab in the back and the crack smoke pills through the streets like an
early morning fog  
Mommas in the slaughter house with a hatchet helping daddy chop early morning
hog  
Im catching Zs like an early morning saw when I woke up to the racket yawn
and pause  
What the fuck man I can never get sleep man peeped out the window whats
wrong with yall  
Stood up in my Crimson Tide Alabama sweat pants and threw my pillow  
Looks like daddy caught the motherfucker that tried to sneak in and steal his
elbows  
They dont know that old man dont hold hands or throw hands naw hes rough
like a brilo  
Went to the Chevy and pulled out a machete and that gun is heavy and tall as
the midget willow

town wobble  
So when we ride around bitches follow but tonight one of the bitches is
giving us problems  
Well one of them bitches be fuckin one of my homeboys favorite bitches  
And has been on his hit list for a minute and I think hes ready to handle his
business  
He told me Yelawolf get this and he handed me the Cartier watch that was on
his wrist  
He said watch this shit and he jumped to the trunk and grabbed his biscuit

Two men stand ones gotta go  
One falls down to the ground one walks down to the road  
Momma better call the police  
Now hes screaming no  
Took a buckshot to the chest with a rock salt shell and hes moving slow  
All this blood has spilled enough to give a penguin chills  
Hot enough to make a potato smoke at the tip of a hollowed steel  
In the valley of the hollowed field  
In the valley of the hollowed til  
This aint a figment of my imagination buddy this is where I live Bama  
  
Think hes playin You better listen what hes sayin punk  
Dont make me go pop the trunk on you  
He got an old Mossberg in the mossy oak duffle bag layin in the back of the
dunk boy  
Dont make me go pop the trunk on you  
  
Think hes playin You better listen what hes sayin punk  
Dont make me go pop the trunk on you
