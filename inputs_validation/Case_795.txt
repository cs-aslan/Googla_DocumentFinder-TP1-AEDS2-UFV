Tony jones stabbed alice jones  
On their first anniversary  
Down in dallas texas  
In a small apartment  
With nobody present  
He pulled out a knife  
And he stuck it to her  
He left her bleeding  
On the floor in the kitchen  
With cake on her fingers  
And her wedding ring holding  
In her hand was a note  
That said the wicked must suffer  
And he drove off quickly  
To his girlfriends apartment  
But who really suffers in the end  
Its easy enough for us to pretend that  
  
Chorus  
Everythings all right with the family  
Everything is safe here at home  
Everythings all right with the family  
The beds are made but theres no sheets on  
  
From the courtroom stand  
Tony said he was sorry  
That he was sad and mixed up  
And he didnt know what he was doing  
That hed always loved alice  
And he begged for forgiveness  
So he threw himself  
On the mercy of the jury  
And he told how his father  
Had beat and abused him  
Back in grade school  
In the basement den  
And that maybe prison  
Was the best thing for him  
And he said oh god can you forgive me yeah  
But who really suffers in the end  
Its easy enough for us all to pretend that  
  
Chorus  
Everythings all right with the family  
Everything is safe here at home  
Everythings all right with the family  
The beds are made but theres no sheets on  
  
How many days does it take to make us weak  
And how many hours do people spend lonely  
In the heart of the heart the family lay dying  
The ruin of a nation lies at our feet yeah  
  
Chorus  
Everythings all right with the family  
Everything is safe here at home  
Everythings all right with the family  
The beds are made but theres no sheets on  
  
Everythings all right with the family  
Everything is safe here at home  
Everythings all right with the family  
The beds are made but theres no sheets on
