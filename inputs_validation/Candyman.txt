Chorus  
And even though Im right behind you  
Shadows haunt and taunt your hand  
I cannot be your everything  
But Ill be your candy man  
  
You move a sudden grace a child upon the Earth  
You wanted love to find you but you found it first  
  
Chorus  
  
We look through antiques on a fuzzy fuzzy day  
But you always know just what you want  
Want right away  
  
Chorus  
  
And though you cry at night  
Its to be expected  
But know youre mine tonight  
  
So when the sun has died you dive into your mind  
But your soul is never lost until the deal is signed  
  
Chorus
