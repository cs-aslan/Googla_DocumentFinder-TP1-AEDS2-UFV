Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot  
Watching the sun set  
Ill never forget  
Watching all the reds and oranges slip away  
Letting go of yet another dirty day  
  
Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars  
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the sun the sun  
Watching the sun go down  
  
Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot  
Watching you leave me  
Not quite believing  
Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot  
Watching the sun set  
Ill never forget  
  
Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars  
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the sun the sun  
Watching the sun go down  
Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars  
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the sun the sun  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the sun the sun  
Watching the sun go down  
Watching the the sun go down
