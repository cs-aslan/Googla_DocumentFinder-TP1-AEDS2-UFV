The lights are on but youre not home  
Your mind is not your own  
Your body sweats your body shakes  
Another kiss is what it takes  
You cant eat you cant sleep  
Theres no doubt youre in deep  
Your throat is tight you cant breathe  
Another kiss is all you need  
  
You like to think that youre immune to the stuff oh yeah  
Its closer to the truth you know  
Youre gonna have to face it  
You might as well face it youre addicted to love  
  
You see the signs but you cant read  
Youre running at a different speed  
Your heart beats at double time  
Another kiss and youll be mine  
Onetrack mind you cant be saved  
Another young love is all you crave  
And if the sun left you  
You dont mind if you do  
  
You like to think that youre immune to the stuff oh yeah  
Its closer to the truth you see  
Youre gonna have to face it  
Youre gonna have to face that youre addicted to love  
  
You might as well face it youre addicted to love
