Ive been stranded on a lonely street  
Got lost in the shadows  
Fell hard in the battle  
Heard cries and the suffering  
I walked through the darkness  
Left broken and heartless  
  
Im calling out can you hear my voice  
Im gonna find you through all the noise  
Ooh whoa  
You know theres nothing that I wouldnt do  
Shine your light as I reach for you  
  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
Its the sound that I hear tells me not to give up  
It breathes in my chest and  
It runs through my blood  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
  
Whoa ooh oh oh oh yeah  
  
And Ive been told at least a thousand times  
Its not worth the struggle the hurt or the trouble  
I keep running up to these front lights  
No I wont surrender  
Ill wait here forever  
  
Standing here with my flag held high  
Oh cant you see that its worth the fight  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
Its the sound that I hear tells me not to give up  
It breathes in my chest and  
It runs through my blood  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
  
Whoa ooh oh oh oh yeah  
  
Im not to cross this battle field  
Im screaming out can you hear me now  
Im holding on I stand my ground  
Im screaming out can you hear me now  
  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
Its the sound that I hear tells me not to give up  
It breathes in my chest and  
It runs through my blood  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
Its the sound that I hear tells me not to give up  
It breathes in my chest and  
It runs through my blood  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love love
