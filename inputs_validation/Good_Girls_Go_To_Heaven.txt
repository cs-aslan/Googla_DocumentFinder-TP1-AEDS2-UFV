Some girls do some girls dont  
Dont mean type dont mean smoke  
Lay me down cant seem to sleep  
My minds been thinkin real deep  
bridge 1  
All my thoughts are runnin wild out of controloutta my mind  
Chorus  
cause good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere  
If I had my choice of women  
Id pick the ones thatd go anywhere  
All good girls they go to heaven  
All bad girls go everywhere they like  
Late at night when she comes out  
The lady moves prowls the town  
A perfect match of looks and charm  
Where she goes its light and dark  
Shes so hot I burn my tongue when I kiss her lips she turns me on  
Good girls go to heaven  
Bad girls go everywhere  
If I had my choice of women  
Id pick the ones thatd go anywhere  
All good girls they go to heaven  
All bad girls go everywhere they like  
solo  
Made my choice made it well had my pick of heaven or  
Good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere  
If I had my choice of women Id pick the ones thatd go anywhere  
All good girls they go to heaven all bad girls go everywhere they like  
Good girls theyve got manners bad girls got what matters  
Good girls leave at home bad girls come with the singer  
Good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere that they like
