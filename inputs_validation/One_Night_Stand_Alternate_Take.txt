When Im on the road playin in a town without a name  
And Im feelin low everybody looks the same  
Well you catch my eye and then you come on strong  
An try to make your play  
Just because we love tonight  
Please dont you think its gonna stay that way  
  
Dont you know that youre nothin more than a one night stand  
Tomorrow Ill be on my way baby catch me if you can  
Honey take me by the hand and play that game again  
  
Everywhere I go the people try to get next to me  
Thats alright but tomorrow Ive got to be free  
Weve got good a thing baby and its all up on us tonight  
Dont you go and spoil it dear by trying to get yourself all uptight  
  
Dont you know that youre nothin more than a one night stand  
Tomorrow Ill be on my way baby catch me if you can  
Honey take me by the hand and play that game again
