How many sorrows  
Do you try to hide  
In a world of illusion  
Thats covering your mind  
Ill show you something good  
Oh Ill show you something good  
When you open your mind  
Youll discover the sign  
That theres something  
Youre longing to find  
  
Chorus  
The miracle of love  
Will take away your pain  
When the miracle of love  
Comes your way again  
  
Cruel is the night  
That covers up your fears  
Tender is the one  
That wipes away your tears  
There must be a bitter breeze  
To make you sting so viciously  
They say the greatest coward  
Can hurt the most ferociously  
But Ill show you something good  
Oh Ill show you something good  
If you open your heart  
You can make a start  
When your crumbling world falls apart  
  
Chorus
