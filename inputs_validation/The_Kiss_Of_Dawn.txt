Blinded I am  
And so are you  
By shedding tears  
Confusion that separates us two  
We hold dear  
  
Just look into my eyes  
Kiss our fears goodbye  
  
Im reaching for your shadow  
Drowning in the kiss of dawn  
Touching the pain that you left me with  
At the kiss of dawn  
  
Im tired of the games  
Im playing with you  
When youre not here  
Death frees from the fear of dying  
Its true have no fear  
  
Let me look into your eyes  
And see death pass us by  
  
Im reaching for your shadow  
Drowning in the kiss of dawn  
Touching the pain you left me with  
At the kiss of dawn  
  
Im reaching for your shadow  
Drowning in the kiss of dawn  
Touching the pain you left me with  
At the kiss of dawn  
  
Im reaching for your shadow  
Drowning in the kiss of dawn
