Livin livin is dyin dyin cause love you left me cryin  
Now theres no use tryin to go on  
Each night and day baby  
Pretendin therell be a happy endin  
Burning down deep inside  
Got a heart break that I cant hide  
  
Im not the proud one  
I need you  
Im beggin to you baby please  
Youre the proud one  
Believe me  
This big man is down on his knees  
Baby please  
  
Oh baby baby remember baby when you were warm and tender  
Beggin me surrender to your charm  
You gave me your sweet lips  
Said use them  
Oh why did I abuse them  
Didnt know good from bad  
Girl I didnt know what I had  
  
Im not the proud one  
I need you  
Im beggin to you baby please  
Youre the proud one  
Believe me  
This big man is down on his knees  
Baby please  
  
Oh baby I love you  
Please come back  
I need you  
I need you  
  
Im not the proud one  
I need you  
Im beggin to you baby please
