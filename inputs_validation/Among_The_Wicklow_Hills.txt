The autumn evenings filled with copper shades  
I see the birds neck in the frame  
A figure walks into the sunset  
Someone goes past suspended from the sky  
  
Takes more imagination  
When everythings remote control  
For me its just a case of  
Whats on the far side of the road  
  
Tell everybody  
Im going away for ten years  
Im going to wander  
Among the Wicklow hills  
  
The travelling children in their Sunday clothes  
Lost on the corner of the Street  
Fat gypsy lady smacks the windowpane  
A farm dog gets out on the motorway  
  
Takes more imagination  
When everythings remote control  
For me its just a case of  
Whats on the far side of the road  
  
Tell everybody  
Im going away for ten years  
Im going to wander  
Among the Wicklow hills
