Its three oclock in the morning  
And theyre sayin youve had enough  
But you want another drink  
Good old north or southern stuff  
Youre a boy from way down south  
Folks from the old north  
And its Friday night  
Its party night for you  
  
King George he sent the excise men  
The Yankee revenuers  
It dont matter what they try  
Theyll never stop the brewin  
Because a man will take a glass  
To make his spirits fly  
On a Friday night  
Its party night for you  
  
They bring out laws and taxes  
Try to cut you down  
If you cant go to the corner bar  
Then youll go underground  
So come on down to your local still  
And buy yourself a thrill  
On a Friday night  
Its party night for you  
  
1 Whiskey the water of life  
Theres more to it than the pourin  
Oiled the reel on the fiddle bow  
And sent the music soarin  
My old man and his old man  
They knew what they were doin  
Lovin malt from the old land  
And the corn from Tennessee  
  
If youre feelin lowdown  
You dont need no pill  
Come along and join the clan  
Support your local still  
You can win your barroom blues  
Find that hazy delight  
On a Friday night  
Its party night for you  
  
Whiskey the water of life  
Theres more to it than the pourin  
Oiled the reel on the fiddle bow  
And sent the music soarin  
My old man and his old man  
They knew what they were doin  
Lovin malt from the old land  
And the corn from Tennessee  
  
Its three oclock in the morning  
And theyre sayin youve had enough  
But you want another drink  
Good old north or southern stuff  
Youre a boy from way down south  
Folks from the old north  
And its Friday night  
Its party night for you
