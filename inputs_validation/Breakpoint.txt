Make up the rules for me to live by  
Rules you break and just let it slide  
You try and find you inside of me  
Be as great as you want me to be  
Hypocrite the word that fits  
Do as you say  
Not as you do  
Youre pushing me to a breakpoint  
Pushing me to a breakpoint  
Pushing me to a breakpoint  
Pushing me push push me to a breakpoint  
Self esteem you seem to lack  
Point the finger  
Theres three pointing back  
Controls the illusion with all good intent  
Bad times are contagious  
You laugh and infect  
Criticist the word that fits  
Put me down to lift you up  
Watching pains your only pleasure  
Fascination for sick disaster  
Suffering since you were born  
Mess with the bull and you get the horns  
Misery the word that fits  
Times are good when times are bad  
In my opinion as a professional I recommend we straightjacket the son of a  
bitch lock him in a rubber room sedate him heavily and when he wakes up
if  
he wakes up well see if he can be a nice boy  
Well I dont know Its gonna hurt me more than its gonna hurt him  
Lets do it  
Sedate me Cool a straight jacket Hey hey let go of me  
You push me to a breakpoint  
Push me to a breakpoint  
Push me to a breakpoint  
Dont push me you piece of shit
