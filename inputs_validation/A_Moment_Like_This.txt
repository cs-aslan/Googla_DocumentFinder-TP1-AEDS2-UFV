What if I told you it was all meant to be  
Would you believe me Would you agree  
Its almost that feeling weve met before  
So tell me that you dont think Im crazy  
When I tell you love has come here and now  
A moment like this  
  
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this  
Some people search forever for that one special kiss  
Oh I cant believe its happening to me  
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this  
Everything changes but beauty remains  
Something so tender I cant explain  
  
Well I may be dreaming but still lie awake  
Cant we make this dream last forever  
And Ill cherish all the love we share  
A moment like this  
  
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this  
Some people search forever for that one special kiss  
Oh I cant believe its happening to me  
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this  
Could this be the greatest love of all  
I want to know that you will catch me when I fall  
So let me tell you this  
  
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this  
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this  
Some people search forever for that one special kiss  
Oh I cant believe its happening to me  
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this  
Oh like this  
Oh I cant believe its happening to me  
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this  
Oh like this
