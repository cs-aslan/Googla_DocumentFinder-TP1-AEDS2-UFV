Chorus  
Im wishing on a star to follow where you are  
Im wishing on a dream to follow what it means  
Im wishing on the rainbows that Ive seen  
Im wishing on the people who really dream  
Im wishing on tomorrow pray never comes  
Im wishing on all of the things weve never done  
  
I never thought Id see the time where you would be  
So far away from home so far away from me  
Just think of all the moments that we spent  
I just cant let you go for me you were meant  
And I didnt mean to hurt you but I know  
In the game of love you reap what you sow  
  
I feel its time we should make up baby  
I feel its time for us to get back together  
And make the best of things oh baby when were together  
Whether or never  
  
Chorus  
Im wishing on a star wishing on a star  
To follow where you are aaaare  
Im wishing on a dream to follow what it means  
And I wish upon the rainbows that Ive seen  
Im wishing on the people who really dream  
And Im wishing on tomorrow pray never comes  
Im wishing on all the things that we we never toooold  
Woo Jls 1D  
  
Chorus  
Im wishing on a star Oh wishing on a star  
To follow where you are Oh anywhere you go  
Im wishing on a star Im wishing on a star  
To follow where you are To where you where you go  
Im wishing on a star
