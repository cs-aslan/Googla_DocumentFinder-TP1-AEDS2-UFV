I know youre ready you show all the signs  
Your eyes sparkle oh how they shine  
But you keep saying  
You cant take another heartache  
The way you hold me the way that you move  
Your feelings keep showing through  
You cant hide it  
Its written all over your face  
Dont tell me youre not in love  
When your heart beats like it does  
Your trembling body tells on you  
Each time we touch  
You can tell me youre afraid  
I am too and thats okay  
I got eyes I can see  
Baby dont tell me youre not in love  
Sweet love songs bring you to tears  
Come on baby dont hide in your fear  
Let your lips say  
What your heart already knows  
Your denial is a last thing to fall  
The only brick left holding the wall  
Dont hold back  
Speak with your heart and your soul  
Dont tell me youre not in love  
When your heart beats like it does  
Your trembling body tells on you  
Each time we touch  
You can tell me youre afraid  
I am too and thats okay  
I got eyes I can see  
Baby dont tell me youre not in love  
I got eyes I can see  
Baby dont tell me youre not in love
