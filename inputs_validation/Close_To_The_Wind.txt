Ah  
Lately it hasnt been easy  
Ive been wanderin all night  
Searchin tryin to find an answer  
Why Im in this situation  
Ive been sailing close to the wind  
Trying to keep my head above water  
Close to the wind without you  
Ive been sailing close to the wind  
Everyday it just gets harder  
But youre all I need to survive  
For so long it felt like  
I was walking on the water  
I found the hard part  
Is waking without you in the morning  
Ive been sailing close to the wind  
The weight of the worlds on my shoulders everyday now  
Close to the wind without you  
Ive been sailing close to the wind  
The loneliness its neverending yes Im falling  
Open your heart come aboard  
And if were back together  
I know our love will be everlasting  
I still believe that theres a chance  
For us to have a happy ending  
Peace will reign on earth  
LIfe for all its worth oh yeah  
I pray every single morning  
That this time we will be much stronger  
Ive been sailing close to the wind  
Help me try to find a shelter to protect you  
Close to the wind without you  
Ive been sailing close to the wind  
But inside its safe and warm now were together  
Dont be afraid of the storm  
Ive been sailing close close to the wind been sailing in  
Close to the wind Dont be afraid of the storm  
Ive been sailing close close to the wind been sailing in  
Close to the wind Dont be afraid of the storm
