jack hues  
I feel the tension  
In your hand  
Im on a plane to a  
Foreign land  
So far away with no  
Telephone line  
Im flying into spring  
And leaving winter behind  
I know itll be winter  
In your heart  
Icy stone cold winter  
All the time were apart  
Chorus  
As I look at you  
Looking back at me  
The wordless tears in your eyes  
Whats inside of you  
Whats inside of me  
You may not realize for days and days  
The consequences of that gaze  
When love looks back at you  
When love looks back at you  
Love is a monster  
With a need to devour  
All who fall  
In her power  
And love is a sweet thing  
With a need to caress  
Security stability and happiness  
Im flying flying from  
Reality  
Where two things can be true  
Simultaneously  
Repeat chorus  
I feel a cold wind  
In the street outside  
A plane flies low  
Through the rainfilled sky  
Winters come to get me  
And its tearing me apart  
As cool blue summer  
Floods your open heart  
Repeat chorus
