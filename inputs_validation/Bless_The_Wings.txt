Like the rose that blooms in the wintertime  
As it reaches up through the snow  
The more life keeps apart  
The more love will grow  
Like the seed that grows in the darkness  
As it reaches up to the sun  
I will always reach out for you  
Cause you are the one  
  
I bless the wings that bring you back to me  
Back across the shore  
If I could touch you now my darling  
And love you just once more  
If I could hold you hold you hold you  
I know youd understand  
I know youd understand  
  
As I cross the bridge by the waterfall  
As I make my way by the stars  
Theres a shadow walking beside me  
Here in my heart  
Like the restless wind in the tree tops  
Like a whispered voice in my ear  
I will always be there for you  
Ill always be here  
  
I bless the wings that bring you back to me  
Back across the shore  
If I could touch you now my darling  
And love you just once more  
If I could hold you hold you hold you  
I know youd understand  
I know youd understand  
  
In a far off wonderland  
That flashes past my eyes  
The kiss of inspiration that was mine  
The dust of many centuries  
Has blown across this land  
But love will not be scattered by the sand  
  
Like the sunrise over the mountainside  
Like the bird that has to be free  
Theres a part of you that will always be  
Part of me  
Like the seed that grows in the darkness  
I will always reach out for you  
Cause you are the one  
  
I bless the wings that bring you back to me  
Back across the shore  
If I could touch you now my darling  
And love you just once more  
If I could hold you hold you hold you  
I know youd understand  
I know youd understand  
I know youd understand  
I know youd understand
