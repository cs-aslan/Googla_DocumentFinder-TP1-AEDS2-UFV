3 30  
Somewhere in this crazy night  
With all this noise and all this light  
Im out upon the crowded street  
I play the game and I keep the beat  
Woooo  
But Im thinking of you  
Woooo  
But Im thinking of you  
And I remember the summer days  
Your strenght and yet your gentle ways  
Now Im back on the crowded street  
Through the darker days I keep the beat  
Woooo  
But Im thinking of you  
Woooo  
But Im thinking of you  
Through all the grey I see skies of blue  
I close my eyes cause Im thinking of you  
And I pray to god that what we had  
We will have again someday  
So I telephoned to tell you what  
Id hoped youd like to hear me say  
Woooo  
But Im thinking of you  
Woooo  
But Im thinking of you
