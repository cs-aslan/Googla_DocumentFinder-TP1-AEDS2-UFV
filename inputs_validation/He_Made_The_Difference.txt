Verse 1  
If it wasnt for the Lord where would I be  
My life was nothing until He set me free  
What a change He made in my life  
No more compromising the wrong for the right  
He made the difference  
He made the difference in my life  
  
Chorus  
I dont walk like I used to walk  
He made the difference  
I dont talk like I used to talk  
He made the difference  
I dont live like I used to live  
He made the difference  
I dont give like I used to give  
He made the difference  
He made the difference  
He made the difference in my life  
  
Verse 2  
He gives me joy that cannot be surpassed  
Im on a cloud from the first moment to the last  
He walks with me talks with me  
Telling me Im His own  
He calms all my fears  
Telling me I am not alone  
He made the difference  
He made the difference in my life
