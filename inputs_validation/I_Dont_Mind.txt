I dont mind I dont mind I did for a time but I dont mind  
It used to break my heart each time you cheated  
I tried to leave the Lord knows how I tried  
But I stay here no matter how Im treated and all it really cost me was my
pride  
But I dont mind I dont mind I did for a time but I dont mind  
You and I have a perfect understanding you come and you go as you please  
And I never get too angry or demanding its hard to get mad on your knees  
But I dont mind I dont mind I did for a time but I dont mind  
Once I was strong as a mountain I stood tall like a giant oak tree  
Now my blood runs thin like water in a fountain you took all the man out of me  
But I dont mind baby I dont mind I did for a time but I dont mind
