What was it you said to me  
Back in the days when things looked fine  
Bout how we would be together  
Until we left the earth behind  
Oh its funny how things can change  
Cause there was a time I thought Id be the one  
Whod leave and start again  
But now Id stay forever  
  
Ooh my hopes are as the leaves upon the water  
Just sunk in the night  
And though I know you couldnt care you oughtta  
Ah the end of a life  
Or maybe when youre older and youre thinking back  
You might recall  
Now did I act carefully did I do right  
Or were we meant to be all of our lives  
In love and harmony all of our lives  
  
So now take my hand  
Come hold me closely  
As near as you can  
Believing all that we could be  
And all that we have been  
And all that we are  
  
Everyday seems summertime  
The river flow with wine  
Ooh when you were here with me  
I wish wed stayed that way forever  
  
Oh my hopes are as the leaves upon the water  
Just sunk in the night  
And though I know you couldnt care you oughtta  
Ah the end of a life  
Or maybe when youre older and youre thinking back  
Well you might recall  
Now did I act carefully did I do right  
Or were we meant to be all of our lives  
In love and harmony all of our lives  
  
So now take my hand  
Come hold me closely  
As near as you can  
Believing all that we could be  
And all that we have been  
And all that we are  
  
Oh my hopes were as the leaves upon the water  
Ah sunk in the night  
And though I know you couldnt care you oughtta  
Oh the end of a life  
And maybe when youre older and youre thinking back  
Oh you might recall  
Now did I act carefully did I do right  
Or were we meant to be all of our lives  
In love and harmony all of our lives  
  
So now take my hand  
Come hold me closely  
As near as you can  
Believing all that we could be  
And all that we have been  
And all that we are
