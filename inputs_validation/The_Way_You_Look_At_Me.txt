Youre beautiful eyes  
Sparkle like two diamonds on fire  
Why am I still surprised  
At the way they make me feel  
Thought I could get no higher  
If you showed me a whole new deal  
  
Its not the way you look  
Even though heaven knows  
Youre a sight to see  
Its not the way you look  
Its the way you look at me  
Its not the way you look  
Its the way you look at me  
  
Most any old time  
Could be a special occasion  
Just call me  
And Im already halfway there  
You choose the destination  
Ill go with you anywhere  
  
Its not the way you look  
Even though heaven knows  
Youre a sight to see  
Its not the way you look  
Its the way you look at me  
Its not the way you look  
Its the way you look at me  
  
Like Im all you ever wanted me to be  
Its not the way you look  
Even though heaven knows  
Youre a sight to see  
Its not the way you look  
Its the way you look at me  
Its not the way you look  
Its the way you look at me
