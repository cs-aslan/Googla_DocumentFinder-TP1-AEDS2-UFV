Well I think Im goin out of my head  
Yes I think Im goin out of my head  
Over you  
Over you  
I want you to want me  
I need you so badly  
I cant think of anything but you  
And I think Im goin out of my head  
Cause I cant explain the tears that I shed  
Over you  
Over you  
I see you each morning  
But you just walk past me  
You dont even know that I exist  
  
Chorus  
Goin out of my head over you  
Out of my head over you  
Out of my head day and night  
Night and day and night  
Wrong or right  
  
I must think of a way  
Into your heart  
Theres no reason why  
My being shy  
Should keep us apart  
Well I think Im goin out of my head  
Yes I think Im goin out of my head  
  
Chorus  
  
Night and day and night  
Wrong or right  
Well I think Im goin out of my head  
Yes I think Im goin out of my head  
I see you each morning  
But you just walk past me  
You dont even know that I exist  
  
Chorus
