Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Once on a tree top tall a little bird  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Sang out the sweetest song I ever heard  
  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
He sang to me so merrily  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
The little birdie on the tree  
  
Lifes such a lovely thing it seemed to say  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
If youd only sing your cares away  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Chee cheeoo chee so merrily it went along  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Chee cheeoo chee so happily his little song  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
And so and so I sing I sing  
Chee cheeoo chee the happy happy little thing  
  
If you if you feel blue feel blue  
Sing chee cheeoo chee and you can be as happy too  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Sing this happy little song  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Chee cheeoo chee  
Chee cheeoo chee it sang to me so merrily  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Chee cheeoo chee the little birdie on the tree  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
If you feel blue  
Sing chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee and you can be as happy too  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee  
Sing this happy little song  
Sing chee cheeoo chee chee cheeoo chee and you can be as happy as can be
