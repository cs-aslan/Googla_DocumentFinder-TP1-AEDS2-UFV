Im hangin around I not puttin down the state Im in  
Ive never been proud And now Im allowed to shed my skin  
  
Im driving away I know if I stay Ill sit and spin  
Imagine the day Im drowing that they can reel me in  
Pick up where I left off  
  
Lets make a bet  
Well make a bargain and call this truce  
Lets make a bet  
Im in loss and win or lose with you  
  
I see it all now Im taking my bow in every sense  
Im scratchin around its getting too loud the space Im in  
  
So now I can leave Too decent of me so evident  
The one that relieves The others disease like medicine  
Pick up where I left off  
  
Lets make a bet  
Well make a bargain and call this truce  
Lets make a bet  
Im in loss and win or lose with you  
  
Speakin in tounges I cant get through  
Think of runnin but  
Im tired of runnin into you  
Speakin in tounges the way I do  
Found that you understand quite well  
Cause thats your language too  
  
Im hangin around Im not puttin down the state Im in  
In love with the sound its gettin too loud  
  
Lets make a bet  
Well make a bargain and call this truce  
Lets make a bet  
Im in loss and win or lose with you  
  
Lets make a bet  
I never wanted to call this truce  
Lets make a bet  
Always lost and win or lose with you
