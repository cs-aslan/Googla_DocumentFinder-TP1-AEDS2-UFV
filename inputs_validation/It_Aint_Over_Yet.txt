Well its raining out the window  
With no sadness on your face  
As youre cleaning out your closet  
Throw your clothes around the place  
  
I cant stand to see you leaving  
Im not ashamed to beg you to stay  
I cant lock the door and keep you  
I wont stand in your way  
  
Guess Ive got to let you go  
But theres just one thing you should know  
  
It aint over it aint over yet  
You might walk away but you wont forget  
Ill never stop loving you  
My mind is set  
So do what you gotta do yeah  
Cause it aint over yet  
  
Guess I should have seen it coming  
But I can see it clearly now  
Gonna change my way of living  
Try to get you back somehow  
Some night when youre lonely  
And your thoughts have turned to me  
Just when you least expect it  
Ill come walking through your dreams  
  
So go on take that taxi ride  
Cause I know time is on my side  
  
It aint over it aint over yet  
You might walk away but you wont forget  
Ill never stop loving you  
My mind is set  
Do what you gotta do baby  
It aint over
