I judge by what shes wearing  
Just how many heads Im tearing  
Off of assholes keep coming on to her  
Each night seems like its getting worse  
And I wish shed take the night off  
So I dont have to fight off  
Every asshole coming on to her  
It happens every night she works  
Theyll go and ask the DJ  
Find out just what would she say  
If they all tried coming on to her  
Dont they know its never going to work  
They think theyll get it inside her  
With every drink they buy her  
As they all try coming on to her  
This time somebodys getting hurt  
  
Chorus  
Here comes the next contestant  
Is that your hand on my girlfriend  
Is that your hand  
I wish youd do it again  
Ill watch you leave here limping  
I wish youd do it again  
Ill watch you leave here limping  
There goes the next contestant  
  
I even fear the ladies  
Theyre cool but twice as crazy  
Just as bad for coming on to her  
Dont they know its never gonna work  
Each time she bats an eyelash  
Somebodys grabbing her ass  
Everyone is coming on to her  
This time somebodys getting hurt  
  
Chorus  
  
Im hating what shes wearing  
Everybody here keeps staring  
Cant wait till they get what they deserve  
This time somebodys getting hurt  
  
Here comes the next contestant  
Is that your hand on my girlfriend  
Is that your hand  
I wish youd do it again  
Ill watch you leave here limping  
I wish youd do it again  
Ill watch you leave here limping  
I wish youd do it again  
Each night seems like its getting worse  
I wish youd do it again  
This time somebodys getting hurt  
  
There goes the next contestant
