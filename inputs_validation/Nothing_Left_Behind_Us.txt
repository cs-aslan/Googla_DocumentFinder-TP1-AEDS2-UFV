You never know what we could be in store for  
The way it goes were in for more of the same  
One step beyond the flame  
The thread of life the finely woven pattern  
Reveals designs in silent laughter and rhyme  
One picture at a time  
  
Chorus  
There aint nothing left behind us  
Not a doubt inside us  
If the angel calls tomorrow theres nothing we havent said  
There aint nothing left behind us  
Nothing but a blind trust  
I would beg steal or borrow to never lose you again  
  
Its down to us to figure out the secret  
Its not enough to wait for pieces to fall  
The writing isnt on the wall  
Take my hand well face the fire together  
To distant lands but we can weather the storm  
Keeping each other warm  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres never been an easy way  
Everybody is bound to make mistakes  
You just do what you think is right  
Then laugh til you cry til you scream at the night  
  
Chorus
