The bias of the father runs on through the son  
And leaves him bothered and bewildered  
The drugs in his veins only cause him to spit  
At the face staring back in the mirror  
  
How can he tell a good act from the bad  
He cant even remember his name  
How can he do what needs to be done  
When hes a follower not a leader  
  
The sickness of the mother runs on through the girl  
Leaving her small and helpless  
Liquor files through her brain with the force of a gun  
Leaving her running in circles  
  
How can she tell a good act from the bad  
When shes flat on her back in her room  
How can she do what needs to be done  
When shes a coward and a bleeder  
  
The man if he marries will batter his child  
And have endless excuses  
The woman sadly will do much the same  
Thinking that its right and its proper  
  
Better than their mommy or their daddy did  
Better than the childhood they suffered  
The truth is theyre happier when theyre in pain  
In fact thats why they got married
