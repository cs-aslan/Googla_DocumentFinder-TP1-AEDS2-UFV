Its a cold day for September was all I thought to say  
When I saw you on the street the other day  
I knew something changed between us all the talk we made was small  
But what do you say to someone when theyve heard you say it all  
Its an awkward conversation in a most peculiar way  
Chorus  
How did we get from saying I love you to Ill see you around  
Someday   
It seemed like only days ago we had so much to say  
Did we take it all for granted did it all gets thrown away  
It calls for rain this afternoon she finally replied  
Then there was such a stuttering silence that I felt my mouth go dry  
Well talk about the weather cause theres not much more to say  
Chorus x 2  
Has all the ice been broken  
All our surfaces been scratched  
Have all the words been spoken  
Have we finally met our match  
Cause its an awkward conversation  
In a most peculiar way  
Chorus x 3
