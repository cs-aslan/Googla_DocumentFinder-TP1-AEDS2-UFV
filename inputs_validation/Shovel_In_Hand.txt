Life can change in the blink of an eye  
You dont know when and you dont know why  
Forever Young is a big fat lie  
For the one who lives and the one who dies  
  
I watched my son  shovel in hand  
Go from bulletproof boy to a fullgrown man  
The cool dark dirt on the casket lands  
Nineteen years old and hes buryin a friend  
Oh goodbye two boys hello one man  
  
This son of mine is gonna leave in the fall  
Some might ask how he stands so tall  
His life was changed with a telephone call  
Not even he understands it all  
  
I watched my son  shovel in hand  
Go from bulletproof boy to a broken man  
The cool dark dirt on the casket lands  
Nineteen years old and hes buryin a friend  
Oh goodbye two boys hello one man  
  
I watched my son  shovel in hand  
Go from bulletproof boy to a fullgrown man  
The cool dark dirt on the casket lands  
Nineteen years old and hes buryin a friend  
Oh goodbye two boys  
Oh goodbye two boys  
Oh goodbye my boys
