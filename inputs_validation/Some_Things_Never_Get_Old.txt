Have you ever watched the sunset  
Disappear in the water down in Mexico  
The sky on fire melting into the ocean  
Man theres some things that never get old  
  
Have you ever seen a baby walk for the first time  
Its like watching a sparrow a sparrows wings unfold  
And when that baby she smiles up at you  
Man theres some things that never get old  
  
Makin sweet love to that gal of mine  
My first taste of bluebird wine  
Eatin watermelon down to the rind  
Any old song by brother John Prine  
  
Sometimes that face looking back in the mirror  
It make that mirror make that mirror cold babe  
But in my heart oh Im a hundred years younger  
Man theres some things that never get old no no  
  
I ride into town with some friends of mine  
Its a twotone Chevy shes a 59  
Ice cold beer in the summertime  
Pickin on the back porch with brother John Prine  
  
Well I think livin is one long highway  
Im bettin Heaven is at the end of the road  
And I think love just might be the answer  
Man theres some things that never get old  
And I think love oh Lord I know its the answer  
Oh theres some things that never get old
