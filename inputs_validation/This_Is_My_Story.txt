Superstar I am I havent dropped the classic  
No Ill matter it was written all I am  
Honest to the public that I am  
 That I am  
 Perhaps thats you  
A hater Im not so perhaps thats you  
Send a fucked up deal perhaps thats you  
But I own my public sin unlike you  
Go and just look pass all my hits  
Notice when I say All my hits   
Petes got a track record unlike them  
Money made me see  
My enemies is really just my friends  
Riding a Lamborghini but  
Moneys what you got not what you spend  
Listen to this verse here closer  
These boys are soft like butter  
But they still wanna toast me  
So put your hands up nice and slowly  
This is stick up now  
Give me what you own me  
T V teen now you know what it is  
Ima make your name world wide  
For not paying enough
