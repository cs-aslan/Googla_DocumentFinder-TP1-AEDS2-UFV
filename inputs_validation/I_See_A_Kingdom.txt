Listen up cause this is all I have to say  
This could be the thing to get you on your way  
Just imagine what is old and new again  
Maybe then youll understand  
I tell you  
Take a look around and tell me that you dont see  
Just a worthless pile of garbage and debris  
I see a kingdom  Shining bright  
I can see the colors coming through yeah  
Youll find the beauty if you look at something right  
Its all about your point of view  
And life is all about your point of view  
Everywhere you look a story can be told  
And the tales they tell are worth their weight in gold  
In a place thats filled with mountains made of trash  
Rotting castaways and broken bits of glass  
I dare you  
Take a look around and tell me that you dont see  
Just a worthless pile of garbage and debris  
Cause I see a kingdom  Shining bright  
And if you try then you can see it too yeah  
Youll see the beauty if you look at something right  
Its all about your point of view  
And life is all about your point of view  
I see a kingdom  Shining bright  
I can see the colors coming through  
Youll find the beauty if you look at something right  
Its all about your point of view  
And life is all about your point of view  
Your point of view  
Your point of view
