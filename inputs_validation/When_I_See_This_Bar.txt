Well I see the souls of so many friends  
And I see us all back here again  
With sandy floors and ceiling fans  
A Rastafarian oneman band with songs  
That fill my memories like a tip jar  
Yeah thats what I see  
When I see this bar  
  
I see tourists at Christmas time  
And I taste beers with a hint of lime  
I feel lonely cause its not the same  
Different faces and different names  
Living like pirates out among the stars  
Yeah thats what I see  
When I see this bar  
  
Pieces of our past slowly slip away  
But time just stands still when I walk in this place  
  
And I see a kid coming into his own  
And a man learning to move on  
Somehow trying to find his way  
A dreamer betting on blind faith  
Chasing that sun and following his heart  
Yeah thats what I see  
When I see this bar  
  
Pieces of our past slowly slip away  
But time just stands still when I walk in this place  
  
A few have moved on back to Maine  
Jacksonville and Key Biscayne  
Some are still living the dream  
Stuck in still life it seems  
No matter where theyve been  
Or where they are  
Yeah I see em here  
When I see this bar  
When I see this bar  
  
I wonder where we go from here  
Thats what I see when I see this bar  
Life aint over but its always near  
Thats what I see when I see this bar  
I think about all the good times that we had  
Thats what I see when I see this bar  
Makes me happy and it makes me sad  
Thats what I see when I see this bar  
How could we be so close now so far apart  
Thats what I see when I see this bar  
Thats what I feel thats what I see  
Yeah we were living like pirates and wannabe stars  
Thats what I see when I see this bar  
  
Thats what I see when I see this bar
