On the wires I can hear you comin  
With a rush and a strummin  
This electric phase aint no teenage craze  
In your house a phone is ringin  
  
Just a hot touch that keeps lingerin  
You said lovings easy only if you please  
All I need is communication  
Not a line on your reputation  
  
I dont want a handshake  
There aint no big mistake  
  
Theres no illusion in this wild confusion  
Who knows Im crazy no chance of maybe  
Id like to know you better  
But Im goin down so fast  
  
Help me now to feel it I just cant conceal it  
Sweet time Ive got to show you how its really got to be  
Just let me be alone left with your dialing tone  
  
Theres no illusion in this wild confusion  
Who knows Im crazy no chance of maybe  
Id like to know you better  
But Im goin down so fast  
  
On the wires I can hear you comin  
With a rush and a strummin  
This electric phase aint no teenage craze  
In your house a phone is ringin
