So much for your moment of prayer  
Gods not at home there is no there there  
Lost in the stars thats what you are  
Left here on your own  
  
You can only hope to live on this earth  
This here is it for all its worth  
Nothing else awaits you no second birth  
No starry crown  
  
For an unbeliever like you  
Theres not much they can do  
That would turn you away  
Though I hate to see you surrender  
You need to surrender  
We must find you a way to  
Look up from your life up from your life  
Look on up from your life look up from your life  
  
Theres a river running under your feet  
Under this house under this street  
Straight from the heart ancient and sweet  
On its way back home  
Even in the middle of your sadness  
The everyday madness the ongoing game  
Even when you cant find a reason  
Still there is a reason  
You dont need to name it  
Look on up look up from your life  
Look on up from your life look up from your life  
  
Oh even for a minute to find yourself in it  
To wait by the stream to drop out of your dream  
Look on up look up from your life  
Look on up from your life look up from your life  
Look up from your life up from your life  
Look on up from your life look up from your life
