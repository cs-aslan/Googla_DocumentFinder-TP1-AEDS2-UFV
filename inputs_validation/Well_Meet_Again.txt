Well meet again  
Dont know where  
Dont know when  
But I know well meet again some sunny day  
Keep smiling through  
Just like you always do  
Till the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away  
  
So will you please say Hello  
To the folks that I know  
Tell them I wont be long  
Theyll be happy to know  
That as you saw me go  
I was singing this song  
  
Well meet again  
Dont know where  
Dont know when  
But I know well meet again some sunny day  
  
Well meet again  
Dont know where  
Dont know when  
But I know well meet again some sunny day  
Keep smiling through  
Just like you always do  
Til the blue skies  
Drive the dark clouds far away  
So will you please sayHello  
To the folks that I know  
Tell them it wont be long  
Theyll be happy to know  
That as you saw me go  
I was singin this song  
  
Well meet again  
Dont know where  
Dont know when  
But I know well meet again some sunny day
