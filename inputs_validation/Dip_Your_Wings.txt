If you see me coming up an open road  
With an empty glass and a single rose  
Take a turn towards the shifting light  
There youll see my shadow lost in the night  
  
Endless flight has no directions now  
To a cowards kiss from a heros vow  
If I could find the words Id pick up the phone  
If I was half a man I wouldnt sleep alone  
  
Chorus  
Send me no more angels on a restless wind  
All I ever wanted were the simple things  
If a love like ours means anything  
Show me a sign honey dip your wings  
  
Oh you shook your head like a wild horse  
Beneath the southern cross in the frozen North  
Oh when our bodies touched on that burning beach  
I could have sworn that heaven was within our reach  
  
Chorus  
  
Time just crawls here behind my eyes  
If the scar heals can our love survive  
Lifes only purpose seems so distant now  
If theres a chance at all wont you show me how  
  
Chorus
