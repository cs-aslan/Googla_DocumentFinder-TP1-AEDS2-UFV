Aye yo this shit doesnt come easy but hey dont misjudge me whatever might
displease you still couldnt touch me I dont care what I write is what Im
gonna bust fights on round one if you fuck with anyone of us What Please
you better run till your knees concede shit hits the fan next time you see me
And I dont stall about whats up with yall now freeze on the spot when its
time to let it all out And I dont know I just dont know why things always
get little bit out of control why people get rowdy when I come into the place
Whoops there goes my glass in your face  
Chorus  
One time for my posse Posse  
Two times for my homes Homes  
Well be chillin in the backseat Backseat  
Where we bury the bone Bury the bone

Heres a birdie who plays dirty in this game Its a shame that my ex wants to
act this way What a hag man what a bunch of crap to say When Ive been
nothing but fair with you up till this day But hey you got what you wanted
so choke on this shit to You got issues why you think I broke up with you
Damn it cant you see I dont need this crap I cant believe this bitch
give me my cds back Infact hows that for a turn on For your ugly ass and a
face I wouldnt even shoot  on Ill tell you this much you really got me
pissed off You flatchested bitch you really thought I went this soft I tried
to be nice but if all you want is beef then a word of advice so you can sink
your teeth in I can be your bearer of ill rotten blues when you disregard me
this way I bring bad news  
chorus slow  
One time for my posse  
Two times for my homes  
Well be chillin in the backseat  
Where we bury the bone  
My experience limited reputation discredited The locals read it man I have
to live here please edit it You can type that Im quite nice if they buy it
I like my weekends private real peaceful and quiet I dont condone violence
read books for recreation I interfere with politics and public relations So
put that in your peace and a lid on it please Doesnt matter if you bend the
truth a little bit see Next time Im in the studio Ill take my grudges out
and you can get the clean version sent to your house This is my scene now
and Im a crake for more till the world breaks what the fuck you take me
for  
One time for my posse Posse  
Two times for my homes Homes  
Well be chillin in the backseat Backseat  
Where we bury the bone Bury the bone
