I hear you found a brand new friend  
Well if I try to take you back again  
If I decide to make amends  
Dont let me in  
You know Id like to be inside  
But dont you listen when you hear me cry  
Not even just to say goodbye  
Dont let me in  
I say no no no no oh no  
Dont let me in  
I say no no no no oh no  
Dont let me in  
Dont let me in  
I never wanna do you harm  
Dont pay no head to all my false alarm  
If I should come with pleading arms  
Dont let me in  
You hear it knocking on your door  
You pound another heart you cant ignore  
But soon it isnt there no more  
Chorus  
Solo  
Chorus 3x
