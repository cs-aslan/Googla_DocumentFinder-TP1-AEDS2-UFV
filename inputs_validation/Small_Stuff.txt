Theres a little cafe on the corner of town  
Lucy works there til the sun goes down  
It aint very much but she brings home the bacon and the bread  
  
We got a mortgage we pay just a little bit on  
But it seems like all of our money is gone  
Before we get a chance to get ahead  
Thats small stuff we dont sweat the small stuff  
  
Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage  
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age  
Small stuff  
Theres a comfort in the knowing theres a spirit in us  
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust  
In a love thats so much greater than all the small stuff  
So we dont sweat the small stuff  
  
Theres a little bitty hole in the ceiling above  
Sometimes the rain drips down on our temple of love  
We have to put a pot smack dab in the middle of the bed  
Somebody hit my car at the diner last night  
Had to drive it home with one taillight  
When I went out this morning the engine was dead  
Thats small stuff we dont sweat the small stuff  
  
Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage  
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age  
Small stuff  
Theres a comfort in the knowing theres a spirit in us  
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust  
In a love thats so much greater than all the small stuff  
So we dont sweat the small stuff  
  
Theres a little cafe on the corner of town  
Lucy works there til the sun goes down  
And she dont sweat the small stuff
