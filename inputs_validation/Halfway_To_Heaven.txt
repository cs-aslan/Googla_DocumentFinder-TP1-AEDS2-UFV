Were halfway to heaven  
Dont leave me now  
  
The angels are singing  
Your lips are so near  
The bells are ringing  
And all cause youre hear  
Now were halfway to heaven  
Darlin stay say youll stay with me  
  
Your heavenly kisses  
Could take me there  
Oh dont leave me stranded  
My hearts in midair  
Now were halfway to heaven  
Darlin stay say youll stay with me  
  
Oh dont you know  
The closer you hold me  
The closer well be  
The gates of heaven  
Are now in sight  
If you really love me  
Youll be there tonight  
Oh were halfway to heaven  
Darlin stay say youll stay with me  
  
Oh dont you know  
The closer you hold me  
The closer well be  
The gates of heaven  
Are now in sight  
If you really love me  
Youll be there tonight  
Oh were halfway to heaven  
Darlin stay say youll stay with me
