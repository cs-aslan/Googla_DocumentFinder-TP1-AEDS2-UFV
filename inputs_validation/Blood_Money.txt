Whos the one you pray to  
Whos your Jesus man  
Where you go when its over and done even if you cant  
With bruises on your ego personality in a sling  
Clinging to self righteous pity never meant a thing  
  
So who is your big brother  
Whos your savior man  
Just some ink on the dotted line an X if ya cant  
See misery loves company youll never feel a need  
Were guaranteed a lifetime at least until ya bleed  
  
Suck the life out through the eyes  
Windows to another world  
Sifting through assorted lies  
Welcome to another brand new world  
  
A lot of people do it  
It happens everyday  
Doubt youll ever know its gone dont use it anyway  
So come on in youll sit right down I gotta deal for you  
A matter of integrity heres all ya gotta doo  
  
Im not dealing with you  
Not the one to thank  
Execution therapy  
Put that in your bank  
  
Youre a liar  
Blood money Liar  
Due now Liar  
Blood money Liar  
  
Payment due an Im collecting you  
  
I am dealing with you  
No one here to thank  
Too much insecurity  
Put that up your bank  
  
Im not dealing with you  
No one here to thank  
Fuck you insecurity  
Put that up your bank
