Verse 1 The Weeknd  
Only losers go to school  
I taught myself how to move  
Im not the type to count on you  
Because stupids next to I love you  
  
Hook The Weeknd  
No So what can you show me  
That my heart dont know already  
We make our own sense  
And youre qualified to me  
What can you show me  
That my heart dont know already  
We make our own sense  
And youre qualified  
And youre qualified

Only losers go to school  
They cant teach what they cant prove  
Come put this inside a testtube  
Because stupids next to I love you

Bridge The Weeknd  
And now that were all grown up  
Who do we owe it to  
And now that weve gone this far  
Who do we owe it all to  
We did it all alone  
Now were coming for the throne  
We did it all alone  
Now were coming for the throne  
And now that we all came up  
Do we lose Do we lose  
  
Hook The Weeknd  
So what can you show me  
That my heart dont know already  
Cause we make our own sense  
And youre qualified to me  
What can you show me  
That my heart dont know already  
Cause we make our own sense  
And youre qualified to me  
And youre qualified to me
