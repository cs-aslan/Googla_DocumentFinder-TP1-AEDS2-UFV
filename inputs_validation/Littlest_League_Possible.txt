Gonna have a lot of fun  
Gonna hit a home run  
In the littlest league possible  
In the littlest league possible  
  
Go and make a big splash  
Dont have the song trashed  
In the littlest league possible  
In the littlest league possible  
  
The nurse went through  
The division of conversation  
Where words collide  
To be the biggest fish in the smallest pond  
  
Im the middlesest spider in the arachnid design  
Looking and fading out in the Texas league  
And meanwhile I took too much and also  
From running too fast  
  
You ran out of gas  
But thats not possible  
In the littlest league possible
