Ill be true to you yes I will  
Ill be true to you yes I will  
I wont look twice when  
The other girls go by  
Ill be true to you yes I will  
  
Somehow this time its all so clear to me  
The way to go is easy to see  
My heart is sure youre  
The girl Ive waited for  
And Ill be true to you yes I will  
  
Yes I will  
I used to be the kind  
Who said that every girls the same  
And love was just a game for having fun  
But when I looked at you  
I knew that I was wrong  
And that I really could belong to only one  
  
Ill be true to you yes I will  
Every dream that you have Ill fulfill  
I never promised this to anyone before  
But Ill be true to you yes I will  
  
Ill be true to you yes I will  
Every dream that you have Ill fulfill  
  
I never promised this to anyone before  
But Ill be true to you yes I will  
Yes I will yes I will
