Weve waited all this time  
This long and lonely time  
The light that trickles down  
It soaks into your eyes  
All I can send her  
The awkward pretender in this life  
I wonder if youll love me tonight  
So delicate and lovely  
Wonder if you love me  
Are you on my side  
My dark and lonely side  
Ill make it worth your while  
Ill give you every reason why  
All well remember  
The simple surrender just in time  
You and I could wait and see  
A single note dont make a melody  
All together you and me  
A single note dont make a melody  
All Ive been saying  
The one thing thats been weighing on my mind
