Verse 1  
She got she got she got  
Her own reasons  
For talking to me  
And she dont she dont she dont  
Give a fuck  
About what I need  
And I cant tell you why  
Because my brain cant equate it  
  
Refrain  
Tell me your lies  
Because I just cant face it  
  
Chorus  
Its you its you  
Its you  
Its you its you  
Its you  
  
Verse 2  
I wont I wont I wont  
Cover the scars  
Ill let em bleed  
So my silence  
So my silence wont  
Be mistaken for peace  
Am I wrong for wanting us to make it  
  
Refrain  
Tell me your lies  
Because I just cant face it  
  
Chorus  
Its you its you  
Its you  
Its you its you  
Its you  
  
Bridge  
Could it be that its a lesson  
That I never had to learn  
I looked at it like a blessing  
And now its just a curse  
I dont know why  
I dont know why  
  
Chorus  
Its you its you  
Its you its you  
Its you
