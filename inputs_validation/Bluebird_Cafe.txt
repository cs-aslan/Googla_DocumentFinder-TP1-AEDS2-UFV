Her ID says shes 21  
But shes just 17  
Her apron says Mary  
But her real name is Jean  
  
Shes working cleaning tables off  
At the local Dairy Queen  
And shes the real thing  
Yeah  
  
Young hearts can fly restless and wild  
Though its a thousand days away  
Shes got the will and shell find a way  
To the stage of the Bluebird Cafe  
  
To the stage of the Bluebird Cafe  
Shes got her boyfriends name  
Carved in the back of her guitar  
Its a beat up old Epiphone  
  
With painted on stars  
She wears her brothers 501s  
And keeps her tips in a jar  
By a picture of Patsy Cline  
  
Shes fine  
Young hearts can fly restless and wild  
Though shell get out of this town someday  
Shes got the will and shell find a way  
  
To the stage of the Bluebird Cafe

Shes into country body and soul  
  
But nobodys future is written in stone  
And to get what she wants  
Shes gonna have to walk alone  
And she will  
  
All the way to Nashville  
To Nashville  
Yeah yeah  
She comes out of work some nights  
  
Stops and stares down the road  
Through the heat and the crickets  
And the telegraph poles  
Out in the darkness  
  
Hanks Blue Highway calls  
And she just stops and smiles  
Yeah  
Young hearts can fly restless and wild  
  
Though its a thousand days away  
Shes got the will and shell find a way yeah  
To the stage of the Bluebird Cafe  
Yeah  
  
To the stage of the Bluebird Cafe  
Shes got the will and shell find a way  
To the stage of the Bluebird Cafe
