Your reputations bad and its getting worse  
You couldnt get a dollar for what your word is worth  
Your bad luck runs you down like bad boys at your heels  
But I could never deny your eyes begging for one more meal  
  
Sister wild rose its the hard road  
But you and I know you cant ever let go  
  
You took it a long long way  
You back out and faith doing up  
All that good good stuff thinking  
It was worth the trade  
  
You let hold you down  
You let tear you apart  
And hold you in them  
Dirty hands squeeze your hostage heart  
  
Sister wild rose its the hard road  
But you and I know you cant ever let go  
Keep your love alive it keeps you warm at night  
Coming from the cold my sister wild rose  
  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
  
Oh no no sister wild rose its the hard road  
But you and I know you cant ever let go  
No keep your love alive Lord it keeps you warm at night  
Coming from the cold my sister wild rose
