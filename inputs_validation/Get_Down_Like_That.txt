When Im single it dont really matter who it is  
Or how many I decide to kick it with  
Long as she can understand how I do this  
Im a man with a very healthy appetite for chicks  
  
But when I settle down  
Find a woman to look for  
Still may be a couple cuties at my door  
Baby we cant get down like we did before  
  
And get mad when I tell them  
I cant be like that no more  
  
Girl you know I got a girl  
I just dont get down like that  
I dont get down like that  
Baby you fine  
Baby yous a dime  
But I just dont get down like  
I dont get down like that  
  
Understand baby girl that Im a totally new man  
I dont live to crush as many as I can  
No more I found a girl that changed my whole game plan  
She the one she the one only one that Im wanting  
  
And I know girl I know that you really want it bad  
Id be lying if I said I wasnt tempted  
All the things we used to do I kinda miss it  
It aint nothing you cant get as good as this is  
  
Girl you know I got a girl  
I just dont get down like that  
I dont get down like that  
Baby you fine  
  
Baby yous a dime  
But I just dont get down like  
I dont get down like that  
  
Baby all I can say is Im sorry  
Since I found me my lady  
Thinkin about cheating would be crazy  
I dont get down  
  
Baby all I can say is Im sorry  
Since I found me my lady  
Thinkin about cheating would be crazy  
And I dont get down  
  
Girl you know I got a girl  
I just dont get down like that  
I dont get down like that  
Baby you fine  
Baby yous a dime  
But I just dont get down like  
I dont get down like that
