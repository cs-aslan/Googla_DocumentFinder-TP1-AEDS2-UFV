Last night you were on my balcony  
You neednt try know the whole story  
Before its too late I must get away  
But both of us know you must stay  
Oh come on Carmilla  
Surrender into the roses  
Go back home under the posies  
Surrender into the roses  
Carmilla Carmilla Carmilla  
Tying dying flowers around the room  
It keeps me safe but oh The sickly perfume  
Well it makes me long for the good times  
When you were really alive  
Oh come on Carmilla  
Surrender into the roses  
Go back home under the posies  
Surrender into the roses  
Carmilla Carmilla Carmilla
