Is there ever enough space between us  
To keep us both honest and true  
Why is it so hard just to sit in the yard  
And stare at the sky so blue  
Ive got a new way of walking and a new way of talking  
Honey when Im around you  
But it gives me the blues when Ive got some good news  
And youre not there to bring it to  
  
Life is a blessing its a delicatessen  
Of all the little favors you do  
All wrapped up together no matter the weather  
Baby you always come through  
Its a measure of treasure that gives me the pleasure  
Of loving you the way I do  
And you know I would gladly say I need your love badly  
And bring these little things to you  
  
Cause you got gold  
Gold inside of you  
You got gold  
Gold inside of you  
Well I got some  
Gold inside me too  
  
Well Im thinking Im knowing that I gotta be going  
You know I hate to say so long  
It gives me an ocean of mixed up emotion  
Ill have to work it out in a song  
Well Im leaving a lot for the little I got  
But you know a lot a little will do  
And if you give me your love  
Ill let it shine up above  
And light my way back home to you  
  
Cause you got gold  
Gold inside of you  
Cause you got gold  
Gold inside of you  
Well I got some  
Gold inside me too  
  
You got wheels  
Turning inside of you  
You got wheels  
Turning inside of you  
Well I got wheels  
Turning inside me too
