Cheers  
Thanks for everything  
You hung me out by my heart  
Youre just so selfish jean  
Yes you are  
  
Hey you  
Threw it all away  
By holding everything in  
Hey Jean dont rock the boat  
When you cant swim  
  
With a perfect understanding of the finer things in life  
A quite alarming knack of knowing when to twist the knife  
Ooh  
Selfish Jean  
  
Heres to you  
Who read everything  
Left it out on the shelf  
Theres no one else to blame  
Except yourself  
  
Well a perfect combination of good etiquet and charm  
You keep the chocolate biscuits wired to a car alarm  
Ooh  
Selfish Jean  
  
Well Im standing on my own  
And this house is not a home  
Its so sad to see you go  
Things are high things are low  
And its good to know you know  
If youve got nowhere to go  
Well you could spend the night with me  
There will be no guarantee that Ill be here  
  
In the morning  
Or any time that you call  
I hear you snoring Jean  
Through the wall  
  
So hey  
Heres to everything  
To peace and love in our time  
Ah Jean the slate is clean  
I guess were fine  
  
Well I dont expect a miracle  
Not asking you to change  
If you can see me happy  
Well just look the other way  
Ooh  
Selfish Jean  
  
Heah  
Selfish Jean  
  
Jean  
Oh yeah  
Jean
