Now Pluto girls are neat but you know theyll  
Eat you up alive  
Although theyre nice to know when its a thousand below  
It isnt easy to survive  
And Neptune girls are great for dancing  
With a dozen arms and legs  
They really hold you tight and they can boogie all night  
But its so hard to kiss three heads  
  
Chorus  
I wish they all could be California girls  
I wish they all could be California girls  
  
Now Martian girls are really pretty  
With complexions bright and green  
But nothing can surpass an andromeda lass  
I think their pointed heads are keen  
And Saturn girls are really funny they can  
Make you laugh to death  
With methane clouds alas combined with hydrogen gas  
Why its a chore to take a breath  
  
Chorus  
I wish they all could be California girls  
I wish they all could be California girls  
  
guitar solo  
  
Chorus  
I wish they all could be California girls  
I wish they all could be California girls etc Etc  
  
Chours ii  girls girls girls girls I need  
Girls girls girls girls  I need etc Etc  
  
Chorus iii California California Calif ornia  
California California Calif ornia
