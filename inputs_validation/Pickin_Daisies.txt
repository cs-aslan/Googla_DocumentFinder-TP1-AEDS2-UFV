Whats the matter honey are you not feeling well  
Its okay Momma will take care of you  
Not really sick but dont you know I still say I am  
Dad just mumbles There goes my girlie son acting up again  
  
How could you be my kid  
Mom knows Im faking it  
But she understands whatll happen if I go  
The last four days  
  
The tough guys have been on a roll  
They show him no mercy  
Plenty of name calling  
And pushing my head in the toilet bowl  
  
They call him a loser  
But they wont get their hands on me today  
Cause home with Momma is where Im gonna stay  
  
Were pickin daisies  
Who cares about them anyway  
Pickin daisies  
Theyll all be working for you someday  
  
Pickin daisies  
Theyre just jealous of you  
Pickin daisies  
Next year youll go to private school  
  
Cant play sports or games  
Im only really good at reading  
He cant catch a football  
Apparently thats not too cool  
  
Thats why my nose is usually bleeding  
Plus they give him fat lips  
At this time yesterday my underwear was over my head  
But Ill be safe today I know cause Momma said  
  
Were pickin daisies  
Who really cares what they think  
Pickin daisies  
You should talk about it with your shrink  
  
Pickin daisies  
Theyll all end up in jail  
Pickin daisies  
Marshalls is having a sale  
  
I know tomorrow itll all start up again  
Hell be greeted with a headlock  
And all I can do is sit and pray for the weekend  
But I know when Im older  
  
Ill look back and laugh  
At all those kids who pulled my pants down  
And took that photograph  
Cause well be through with kickball  
  
Well all be weak and slow  
But I will be the only one  
With a magic place to go  
  
Pickin daisies  
Youre better off in the end  
Pickin daisies  
Who cares Ill be your friend  
  
Pickin daisies  
You can always count on me  
Pickin daisies  
I made you some iced tea  
  
Pickin daisies  
Dasies  
Pickin daisies  
Dasies  
  
Pickin daisies  
Dasies  
Pickin daisies  
Dasies  
Pickin daisies  
  
You are too very handsome just not in a traditional way  
When I was a kid we didnt have video games we had pinball but I could
learn  
Well theyre just upset that they dont have earmuffs  
You can come to aerobics class with me and watch all the ladies love you  
Who needs brand name shirts Yours is the same thing without a fancy tag  
Why dont you go to sleep And when you wake up then Ill play you the Eddie
Fisher record
