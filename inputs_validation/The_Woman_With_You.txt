She hit the door 655 sack full of groceries split down the side  
Can goods scattered all the way to the curb  
Look on her face saying dont say a word  
So its me and her and a can of beans sitting there on the front porch swing  
Western sky all turning red  
Head on my shoulder she sighed and said  
  
Been gopherin chaufferin company chairmen  
Coffee maker copy repairman  
Anymore there aint nothin I swear man that I dont do  
Been juggling struggling closing big deals  
Dancing backwards in high heels  
Just when it feels like I cant make it through  
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you  
  
She said the girl I was with the business degree probably wouldnt recognize
me  
I was gonna run the bank  
I was gonna run the map  
Now all I want to run is a bubble bath  
Back then you know I had this plan  
Before all of this reality set in  
Here comes life boy ready or not  
Hey I wanted it all and thats what I got  
  
Cause Im gopherin chaufferin company chairmen  
Coffee maker copy repairman  
Anymore there aint nothin I swear man that  
I dont do  
Been juggling struggling closing big deals  
Dancing backwards in high heels  
Just when it feels like I cant make it through  
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you
