Living in a big world  
that aint too kind to me  
lookin for some changes  
that no one wants to see  
running round in circles  
nowhere left to go  
too many uniforms  
tryin to run this show  
I dont know  
its never what i wanted  
living in this heap  
got to get the hell out  
Im in too fuckin deep  
this world is a crazy place  
Ill take it day by day  
lord wont you help me  
I got to get away  
I dont know
