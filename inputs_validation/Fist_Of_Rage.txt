Gotta make this money  
Gotta make this money  
This money is me  
This money is everything I do and see  
  
Who are you to judge me  
Just let me be  and let me breathe  
I see this whole world headed for damnation  
And Im ready to leave  
  
I cant believe this whole world twisted me  
You fuckin biggets you fakes you want tobes  
I see the future and its lookin grim  
A lake of fire lookin like a gonks whip  
  
Chorus  
Im a fist of rage one foot in the grave  
Im a fist of rage far from saved  
Im a fist of rage in a broken state  
Im a razor blade slippin through a bale of hay  
Im a fist of rage Repeat x 4  
Crack another bottle and let me knock one back  
  
Huhhuh Slim Jims  
And the tin men grins  
Fat heads with dreads  
And all the feds growing shark fins  
  
Huhhuh my girls knocked up  
Were in love but shes young and I think Im being locked up  
I couldnt cut the mustard with a Ginsu  
And a twist of brown for all the bullshit I been through  
  
Im looking for love but its got too many dam faces  
I cant win even with these four aces  
My place is here with the mix and the tricks and sickos  
I spend gs but only make nickels  
  
My soul tickles  
But this aint even fun and games  
My heart bleeds from the pleasures of the pain  
My fuse is short and its lit like me Im short  
  
Its sketchy  
Its getting hard to see  
My heart bleeds believe it every dying breath  
These people take and they take  
Until theres nothing left  
  
Chorus  
  
Ya feeling bold with me  
Your up a creek  
And you dont know it  
Finger on the trigger but your punk ass is scared to pull it  
And I know it  
  
Cause the fear you hide your eyes show it  
Payback on your ass cause I know I owe it  
Now when your goin down bet Ill be blowing up  
Hear the sound of a shotgun cock and know youre fucked  
  
I hope you see my middle finger from the stage  
Coming  Come and feel me Repeat x 4  
  
Chorus
