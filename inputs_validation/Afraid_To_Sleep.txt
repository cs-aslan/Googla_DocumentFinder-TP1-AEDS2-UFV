The night is still the wind is chilled  
I hear the rain falling on my window pane  
Cant close my eyes afraid to sleep  
Cause when I do I would only dream of you  
Im trying to forget that we ever met  
But how can I forget and dream of you  
Afraid to sleep because Id dream of you  
Afraid to sleep because Id wake up feeling blue  
If I stay awake foreverwed never be together  
So Ill close my eyes and go ahead and dream  
Sweet dreams  
Sweet dreams  
Sweer dreams
