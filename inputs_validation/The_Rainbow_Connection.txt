Why are there so many songs about rainbows and whats on the other side  
Rainbows are visions but only illusions and rainbows have nothing to hide  
So weve been told and some choose to believe it  
I know theyre wrong wait and see  
  
Someday well find it the rainbow connection  
The lovers the dreamers and me  
Who said that wishes would be heard and answered when wished on the
morningstar  
  
Someone thought of that and someone believed it  
Look what its done so far  
Whats so amazing that keeps us stargazing and what do we think we might see  
  
Someday well find it the rainbow connection  
The lovers the dreamers and me  
All of us under its spell  
We know that its probably magic  
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices  
Ive heard them calling my name  
  
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors  
The voice might be one and the same  
  
Ive heard it too many times to ignore it  
Its something that Im supposed to be  
  
Someday well find it the rainbow connection the lovers the dreamers and
me  
Someday well find it the rainbow connection the lovers the dreamers and
me
