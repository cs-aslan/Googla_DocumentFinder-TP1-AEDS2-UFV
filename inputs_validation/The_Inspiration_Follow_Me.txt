Whats up  
Ha ha  
Yeah Yes Its real talk can I talk to yall for a minute  
I was in the streets the other day  
I had a homie come through and he ask me  
Say Yo Everybody listen to you  
Everybody all ears what you gonna do to give back  
I told him Look homie Im ten steps ahead of you if not thirty  
Real talk listen up I got one song lets make it right lets go  
  
Im high on life and a fifth of Remy  
From the city where them young niggas die skinny  
Keep work on deck if you need any  
Just holler at them boys cause they keep plenty follow me  
Got the weight of the world on my shoulders  
And I swear it feels like ten thousand boulders  
And its so heavy but Im so ready  
Feels like I was born for this  
If not at least Ill die for it  
They said I couldnt do it but Ill still try for it  
The big question is what can I do for the youth  
Everybody lyin to em so I told em the truth  
  
Chorus  
Im a hustler So one man one stage one mic  
One song one chance to get it right  
I really thank yall we gon see the night  
And I think I know the way follow me  
I got hustle One man one stage one mic  
One song one chance to get it right  
I really thank yall we gon see the night  
And I think I know the way follow me  
Im a hustler  
  
Real niggas dont die they go to the Feds  
Fresh out right back chasin bread  
My lifes so hard so concrete  
I was raised by em homie thats why I think so street  
Take me for instance  
My life is not about you think me for instance  
I did the impossible I made it out  
Got dealt a bad hand but I played it out  
Im a left lane nigga my lifes so fast  
Now Im thinking holmes got my right blinker on  
Spread my word got my Kirk Franklin on  
Stuntin in traffic like This my car  
Sometimes I wonder how I made it this far  
Lifes a bitch so Im tryna wife her  
Just ball around you know buy her some things  
Lovin every minute of it still breakin chains  
  
Chorus  
  
Yall my brush let me paint a perfect picture  
Gotta pay attention cause its three dimensional  
Same picture see it one of three ways  
Let it marinate it might take a few days  
They say all I talk about is drugs and violence  
So I shouldnt say nothin Get a moment of silence  
If it dont make dollars it dont make sense  
Words to live by took it out of context  
They say your pass is your present and your present is your cash  
So I look forward to the future  
Get a lil paper your baby momma wont have  
Part of the college so I need a forecast  
Wheres the weatherman at when you need him  
A hungry nigga eat anything you feed him  
A rich nigga will buy anything you sell him  
And a broke nigga believe anything you fuckin tell him  
  
Chorus
