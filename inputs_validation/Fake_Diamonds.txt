Youre like a fake diamond  
Sparkling when the lights are on  
But when the night time comes  
And all the lights go off  
You turn off with them  
Where do you go  
When the lights turn low boy  
  
Youre like an old film reel  
Kissing me when the crowd can watch  
But when the velvet falls  
And the projector coughs  
I can be sure youre gone  
You say its not true  
But I know how you do boy  
  
Im like a child who belongs to nobody  
So I wear you like my clothes  
Hold you close to my body  
Because you hurt so good  
Feel so bad honey  
I just want you to want me  
Want you to want me  
  
Youre like a fake diamond  
Sparkling in the moon and sun  
You shine like the only one  
But when the darkness comes  
Baby youre on the run  
Where do you go  
When the lights turn low boy  
  
Youre like my exboyfriend  
Kissing me when the cameras on  
Im candy for your arm  
Look like a debutante  
But Im not what you want  
You say its not true  
But I know how you do boy  
  
Im like a child who belongs to nobody  
So I wear you like my clothes  
Hold you close to my body  
Because you hurt so good  
Feel so bad honey  
I just want you to want me  
Want you to want me  
  
Im like a child who belongs to nobody  
So I wear you like my clothes  
Hold you close to my body  
Because you hurt so good  
Feel so bad honey  
I just want you to want me  
Want you to want me  
  
You say its not true  
But I know how you do boy  
  
Im like a child who belongs to nobody  
So I wear you like my clothes  
Hold you close to my body  
Because you hurt so good  
Feel so bad honey  
I just want you to want me  
Want you to want me  
  
Im like a child who belongs to nobody  
So I wear you like my clothes  
Hold you close to my body  
Because you hurt so good  
Feel so bad honey  
I just want you to want me  
Want you to want me
