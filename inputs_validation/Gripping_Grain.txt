What is this bitch fucking with ZRo  
Motherfucking Mo City Don bitch  
Yeah I know yall hate the way we stare at yall face  
  
ZRo  
Rap game phenomenon lyrically I drop bombs  
With feddy up in my palms and I show you why Im the Don  
ZRo the soldier with a chip on my shoulder  
I get you if I owe you X your file like Scully and Mulder  
Colder with the pen pimping thang fuck bringing it to your ass  
Me and that boy Den Den gon bring it to your brain  
Sit back get it together take a chill really sit back  
When Im on swangas never hear no noise cause them hoes dont clickclack  
Im thinking thoed about to unload on anything that dont mind  
Slapping patches up out your hair better say better somebody to find  
Straight up and down and rap flawn these jackers aint on  
Thats why I skip the slab and I move straight to foreign  
Everybody has collided with The Screwed Up Click  
And when I pick up the mic and I go off they say how he do that shit  
Im a mic wrecker about to checkmate like checkers  
A pine breasher with 25 bags of light green on my dresser  
  
Gripping grain my screen is gonna fall like rain  
Cause I get mymy grind and mymy shine on Im balling  
Crawling in the turning lane we tipping and we earning mayn  
Cause we get ourour grind and ourour shine on we hauling  
  
Den Den  
Gripping grain on the feeter switching lanes with Aaliyah  
Top down low to the ground car looking completed  
Balling hard like Kobe put two inches on tobe  
Pack a seventeen shot hope a nigga dont provoke me  
Cars they smoking with herbal incent  
Mashing horses flipping tortoise candy up like sip  
Beat the toll for a dolla as I smash right under  
On the passenger of me riding underground under  
I ponder in the game passing laws gripping grain  
Screens fall like rain leaving puddles and stains  
For my grind be major hit me on two way pager  
All my tools theres a later for a safe place hater  
So when you see me in them streets you best bow down  
Im gripping grain causing pain hold it down HTown  
Like a king or a chief Im blowing endo sweets  
Saving my change pushing my Range starched up looking sweet  
  
Gripping grain my screen is gonna fall like rain  
Cause I get mymy grind and mymy shine on Im balling  
Crawling in the turning lane we tipping and we earning mayn  
Cause we get ourour grind and ourour shine on we hauling  
  
ZRo  
Twelve inches of dope candy coat gon float  
Got a beach house in Galveston with woofers on bump  
And we gon choke on smoke and swallow drank as we sail  
Atlantic Ocean the Pacific man Im making my mail  
From selling yale to record sales to fatten our pocket  
Murdering motherfuckers on wax cant nobody can stop it  
With the checks and a black X and a rolex make niggas check  
Got my nose wide open smelling nothing but plex  
I get deep like a dimple complicated but simple  
From rags to riches on these bitches Screwed Up medallion with a symbol  
Aint no mo chains and pieces for my nephews and nieces  
When the record stores get empty my ass get money increases  
You cant walk on my lawn better leave my Vipor alone  
Got a house in Sweet Water Texas Lexus and a pond with a swan  
They call me a swanga not a diss I broke up on and made her bitch  
Now affiliated on a candy coated yacht eating on shrimp fish  
  
Gripping grain my screen is gonna fall like rain  
Cause I get mymy grind and mymy shine on Im balling  
Crawling in the turning lane we tipping and we earning man  
Cause we get ourour grind and ourour shine on we hauling  
  
Straight Profit taking over and you cant stop it  
Cause we get ourour grind and ourour shine on we balling  
Crawling in the turning lane we tipping and we earning mayn  
Cause we get ourour grind and ourour shine on we hauling  
  
Gripping grain grind on and mymy shine on
