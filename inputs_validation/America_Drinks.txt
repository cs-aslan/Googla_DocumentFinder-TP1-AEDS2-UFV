One Two Buckle my Shoe  
Dodos and yips yips assorted improv  
I tired to find How my heart could be so blind  
Wanna buy some Penzo  
Dear  
How could I be fooled just like the rest  
You came on strong with your  
Fast car and your class ring  
Sad eyes and your    
I fell for the whole thing  
I dont regret for having met  
Up with a girl who Breaks hearts  
Like they were nothing at all Heres one for mother  
Ive done it too  
Now I know just what it feels like
