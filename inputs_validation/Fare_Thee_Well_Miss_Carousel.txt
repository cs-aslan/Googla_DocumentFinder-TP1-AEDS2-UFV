The drunken clowns still hanging round  
But it plain the laughters all died down  
The tears you tried so hard to hide  
Are flowin  
A blind man with his knife in hand  
Has convinced himself that he understands  
I wish him well Miss Carousel  
But I gotta be agoin  
  
Wont you come and get me when  
Youre sure that you dont need me then  
I stand outside your window  
And proudly call your name  
  
The ladies been told that all of gold  
Is worth so much it cant be sold  
No time to weep shell need her sleep  
Tomorrow  
When she carries her face to the market place  
And bets it on the opening race  
She can ring her bells Miss Carousel  
But her singing brings me sorrow  
  
Its always done every mothers son  
Is shown that grown men never run  
And so they fight with all the might  
Inside them  
When the battles been fought and they all been taught  
That the trick is just not being caught  
Will you give them hell Miss Carousel  
When theyre begging you to hide them  
  
When the need arose your eyes fell closed  
You clamped your fingers round your nose  
Would you say thats any way  
To judge him  
You havent got the authority  
To kill him in the first degree  
But would you feel compelled Miss Carousel  
If you have something to begrudge him  
  
On a velvet beach far beneath the reach  
Of those that come to pray and preach  
The natural man who tries to stand  
Is fallin  
How long will it be before he sees  
You own his legs but his mind is free  
Only you can tell Miss Carousel  
How long will he be crawling  
  
The castle walls has grown so tall  
Seem there aint no hope at all  
To reach the top even though you stop  
For breathin  
But I aint gonna try to make you cry  
The tear drops couldnt find your eye  
Its all been swell Miss Carousel  
But the time has come for leavin
