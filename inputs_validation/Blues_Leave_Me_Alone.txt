Blues blues trying to drive me away from home  
Blues blues trying to drive me away from home  
Had the blues so bad blues followed me all day long  
  
Blues blues wont let me take my rest  
Blues blues wont let me take my rest  
My mind is rambling like a wild geese out in the west  
  
Well youre my all day steady baby youre my midnight dream  
Yes youre my all day steady baby youre my midnight dream  
I love that woman better than anyone Ive ever seen  
  
Blues blues follow me all day long  
Blues blues follow me all day long  
Blues blues wont you please leave me alone
