Never should have tasted that forbidden fruit  
Tell me why do I always do  
What I dont want to do  
Now Im the only reaper of the seeds that I sow  
And when I walk the field of my stubborn will  
Its a hard row to hoe  
Theres a price for getting smarter  
So I pay what I owe  
While bridges burn  
Let the shadow fall behind me  
I am wiser I know  
We live and learn  
Always living and learning  
Always living and learning  
Is it out of the fire back in to the pan  
Is once enough to let it all sink inor will I do it again  
A time for understanding has now come of age  
So I heed the word of the counselor and the voice of the sage  
Try to see the meaning  
Read between every line  
When pages turn  
Therell be no room for explaining what has been welldefined  
We live and learn  
Always living and learning  
Always living and learning  
  
An engaging temptation had me doing time  
Cause when it starts a fire under strong desire  
We are partners in crime  
But hindsight is clearer  
I can where Ive gone and never return  
Its a new man in the mirror  
Its a new freedom song to live and learn  
Always living and learning  
Always living and learning
