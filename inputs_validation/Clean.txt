There was a time  
When crazy days would start with wine  
And now I tow a different line  
I stay in bed and use my loaf instead of my bread  
And stroll on cos Ive been thinking so long  
That somethings gonna go wrong  
Its gone to my head my visions all blurred  
And my legs feel like lead  
  
But Im clean yeah  
Friends with Mr Sheen yeah  
Dont have to wean myself up on nothing  
Im two minutes clean and thats not very often  
Stroll on  
  
There was a time  
When I would dread what I had said  
Waking up in someones bed  
Wondering who I was  
Naked and cold  
With an ache in my head  
And stroll on cos Ive been thinking so long  
Thats somethings gonna go wrong  
Its gone to my head my visions all blurred  
And my legs feel like lead  
  
But Im clean yeah  
Friends with Charlie Sheen yeah  
Dont have to wean myself up on nothing  
Im two minutes clean and thats not very often  
  
Im clean yeah  
Gonna meet the queen yeah  
I wont be obscene yeah  
Cos Im two minutes clean and thats not very often  
Stroll on and on and on and on and on  
Oh yeah
