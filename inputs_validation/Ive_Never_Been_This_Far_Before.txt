I can almost hear the stillness  
As it yelds to the sound of my heart beating  
And I can almost hear the echo  
Of the thoughts that I know you must be thinking  
You can feel my body tremble  
As I wonder what this moment holds in store  
And as you put my arms around me  
You can tell Ive never been this far before  
I can hear you say you love me  
As your trembling fingers touch forbidden places pum pum pum  
But you dont know how Ive waited  
So long for the chance that were finally takin pum pum pum  
I dont know and I dont care  
What made you tell her you dont love her anymore  
As I taste your tender kisses  
You can tell Ive never been this far before pum pum pum  
And as you take the love Im givin  
I can feel the tension buildin in my mind pum pum pum pum pum pum  
Now I wonder if tomorrow  
Will you still love me like youre lovin me tonight pum pum pum pum pum pum  
Oh you have no way of knowin  
But tonight will only make me want you more  
And I hope that youll believe me  
Cause you know Ive never been this far before pum pum pum pum pum pum  
Pum pum pum
