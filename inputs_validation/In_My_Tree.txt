Up here in my tree yeah  
Newspapers meant enough to me yeahno  
No more crowbars to my head yeah  
Im trading stories with the leaves instead yeah  
Wave to all my friends yeah  
They dont seem to notice me no  
All their eyes trained on the street yo oh  
Sidewalk cigarettes and scenes yeahyeah  
Up here so high I start to escape  
Up here so high the sky I scrape  
Im so high I hold just one breath here within my chest  
Just like innocence  
I remember him yeah  
I swore I knew everything oh yeah  
They say knowledge is a dream yeah  
Hes growing up just like me yeah  
Im so light the wind he shakes  
Im so high the sky I scrape yeah  
Im so light I hold just one breath and go back to my nest  
Sleep with innocence  
Up here so high the bars they break  
Up here so high the sky I scrape  
Had my eyes peeled both wide open and I got a glimpse  
Of my innocencegot back my innocence  
Baby got itstill got it
