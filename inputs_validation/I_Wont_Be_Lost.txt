Fallen three times in a row  
Waking up with vertigo  
But you were there to break my fall  
Before I had to face it all  
  
Dont let me go  
Dont let me go  
Cause I wouldnt want to move on  
Without you  
  
I wont be lost  
Next time you see me  
My pain will be gone  
Baby believe me I been trying  
But my heart keeps on breaking  
I wont be lost  
  
Smiling like a billionaire  
Hoping you were unaware  
The walls in side were caving in  
My world had come apart again  
  
Dont let me it show  
Dont let them know  
That I wouldnt be very strong  
Without you  
  
I wont be lost  
Next time you see me  
My pain will be gone  
Baby believe me I been trying  
But my heart keeps on breaking  
I wont be lost  
  
Dont you give up on me  
Cause I wouldnt be very strong  
And I wouldnt want to move on  
Without you  
  
I wont be lost  
Next time you see me  
My pain will be gone  
  
Baby believe me  
I been trying but my heart keeps on breaking  
I wont be lost  
  
I wont be lost
