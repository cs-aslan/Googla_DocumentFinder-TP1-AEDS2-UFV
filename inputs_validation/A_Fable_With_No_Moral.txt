I went and sold my soul so I could pay my rent  
I waited by the mail but the check was never sent  
So I called the Devil up but I just got his machine  
I left an angry message said I gotta have the green  
I didnt give up then but I made another plan  
If Satan didnt want my soul Id sell it to the man  
I tried to find the number but it wasnt in the book  
Id get the money anyhow no matter what it took  
No matter what it took  
  
No paragon of virtue at least Im not a thief  
Its so easily justified but always leads to grief  
So I got a piece of cardboard and made myself a sign  
To sell my soul below the market rate was my design  
I went down on the street and I tried to make the deal  
A Land Rover drove right by with Satan at the wheel  
He saw what I was doing and said  
Thats not yours to sell  
Youll get your check tomorrow  
and Ill see your ass in Hell  
So youd better spend it well
