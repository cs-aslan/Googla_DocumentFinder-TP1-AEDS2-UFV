Dolly Parton  
I cant be true no matter what I do  
Its a weakness of mine nothin to do with you  
So dont expect it of me though I expect it of you  
I love you I do but I cant be true  
Men are my weakness Ive got a roving eye  
And Ive fallen victim to many a smile  
I just love the excitement of love when its new  
Im just a hopeless romantic so I cant be true I cant be true  
I cant be true no matter what I do  
Its a weakness of mine nothin to do with you  
So dont expect it of me though I expect it of you  
I love you I do but I cant be true I cant be true  
Some play it safe while some like it hot  
I guess you could say I never knew when to stop  
But when Im lovin you Ill give it all that I got  
It might be different with you to know I cant be true  
I cant be true no matter what I do  
Oh I get around and I break all of the rules  
Now that you know its true Ill leave the rest up to you  
Ill be good to you but I cant be true I cant be true  
I cant be true no matter what I do  
Its a weakness of mine its not a weakness in you  
So dont expect it of me though I expect it of you  
I really love you I do but I cant be true I cant be true  
I cant be true no matter what I do  
Oh I get around and I break all of the rules  
Now that you know its true Ill leave the rest up to you  
Ill be good to you but I cant be true I cant be true
