Have you heard the news  
Im doing what I said I would  
So now you say  
Boy I always knew you could  
My wildest dreams  
Murdered by reality  
I gave you all I could give to you  
But now Im taking back what belongs to me  
  
I read you like a drugstore book  
Howd I ever think you were cool  
You got no bait left on your hook  
Youre no friend and buddy Im no fool  
  
Chorus  
Aint nothin you can do about it  
Aint nothin you can say  
aint nothin you can do about it  
No ones gonna stand in my way  
  
Ive done my time  
Ive given up my pound of flesh  
So why cant the man seem to understand  
That Ive already passed the test  
  
You did your best to keep me down  
Tried to make my spirit give in  
But Im here to make a big big sound  
Its your turn to lose and its my turn to win  
  
Chorus  
  
I know you can never go back  
Once you turn and walk out that door  
Got no time for worries like that  
Im not a kid anymore  
  
You did your best to keep me down  
Tried to make my spirit give in  
But Im here to make a big big sound  
Its your turn to lose and my turn to win  
  
Chorus
