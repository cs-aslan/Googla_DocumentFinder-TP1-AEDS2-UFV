I never kicked a dog a child or my wife  
I never looked at pornography  
I swear it on my holy saint mothers life  
But somehow shes down here with me  
  
The road to hell is littered with nice guys with good intentions  
But once youre there youre there its much too late  
I can cry and scream its just not fair  
To leave me here like you dont care  
There must be some mistake up there in heaven  
  
Now its much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now its much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I dont know the God Ive offended  
Its too late  
  
I never stole a thing a toy or a kiss  
My conscience is a clear as can be  
And when I was a teen all the sex that I missed  
Was an abstinence blessing to me  
  
The road to hell is littered with nice guys with good intentions  
But once youre there youre there its much too late  
I can cry and scream its just not fair  
To leave me here like you dont care  
There must be some mistake up there in heaven  
  
Now its much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now its much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I dont know the God Ive offended  
Its too late  
  
Now its much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now its much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I dont know the God Ive offended  
Its too late  
Its much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now its much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I dont know the God Ive offended  
Its too late  
Its much to late
