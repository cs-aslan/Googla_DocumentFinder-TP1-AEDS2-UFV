Santas stressed out as the holiday season draws near  
Hes been doing the same job now going on two thousand years  
Hes got pains in his brain and chimney scars cover his buns  
He hates to admit it but Xmas is more work than fun  
  
He needs a vacation from bad decorations and snow  
Mr Claus has a has escape plans a secret that only he knows  
Beaches and palm trees appear night and day in his dreams  
A break from his wife halffrozen in life  
The elves and that damn reindeer team  
  
Ho ho ho and a bottle of rum  
Santas run off to the Caribbean  
He thinks about boat drinks and fun in the sun  
Ho ho ho and a bottle of rhum  
  
Plastic creations and crass exploitations arent good  
He wants to go back to simple toys made out of wood  
Just for the weekend hes like to be Peter Pan  
Get out of his long johns and dance with a sword in the sand  
  
Ho ho ho and a bottle of rhum  
Snatas off to the Caribbean  
Marimbas calimbas hes playing steel drums  
Ho ho ho and a bottle of rhum  
  
Ho ho ho and a bottle of rhum  
Santas off to the Caribbean  
A week in the tropics and hell be alright  
Sporting a tan as he rides out of sight  
  
Merry Christmas to all and to all good night
