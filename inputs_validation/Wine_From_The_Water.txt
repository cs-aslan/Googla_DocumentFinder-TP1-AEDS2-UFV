You can take me up you can wind me down  
Theres no escape but Ill never drown  
No wires or strings no rough and smooth  
Just fire and stings watch me closely watch my every move  
I can count your money while I check your hand  
And you know I just cant lose  
Wine from the water gold from a tree  
I wouldnt fool you theres nothing up my sleeve  
Look for a mirror theres nothing there  
I get rings out of nowhere money from thin air  
I can break these chains while Im upside down  
Well it may seem strange I dont hit the ground  
Now you see my hand is quicker than your eye  
You should know by now what you see here all of its a lie  
I can count your money while I check your hand  
And you know I just cant lose  
Wine from the water gold from a tree  
I wouldnt fool you theres nothing up my sleeve  
Think of a number Ill get it right  
Throw me in the river tie my hands up tight  
I can wind you up I can turn you round  
No cunning stunts till the ladys found  
No coils or springs just nice and smooth  
No knaves or kings find the lady watch my every move  
I can count your money while I check your hand  
And you know I just cant lose  
Wine from the water gold from a tree  
I wouldnt fool you theres nothing up my sleeve  
Look for a mirror no nothing there  
I get rings out of nowhere money from thin air  
Wine from the water gold from a tree  
Now I wouldnt fool you theres nothing up my sleeve  
Think of a number Ill get it right  
You can throw me in the river tie my hands up tight  
Wine from the water gold from a tree  
Now I wouldnt fool you theres nothing up my sleeve  
Look for a mirror theres nothing there  
I get rings out of nowhere money from thin air
