I will stop I will stop at nothing  
Say the right things when electioneering  
I trust I can rely on your vote  
  
When I go forwards you go backwards  
And somewhere we will meet  
When I go forwards you go backwards  
And somewhere we will meet  
Ha ha ha  
  
Riot shields voodoo economics  
Its just business cattle prods and the IMF  
I trust I can rely on your vote  
  
When I go forwards you go backwards  
And somewhere we will meet  
When I go forwards you go backwards  
And somewhere we will meet
