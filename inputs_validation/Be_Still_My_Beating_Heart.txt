Be still my beating heart  
It would be better to be cool  
Its not time to be open just yet  
A lesson once learned is so hard to forget  
  
Be still my beating heart  
Or Ill be taken for a fool  
Its not healthy to run at this pace  
The blood runs so red to my face  
  
Ive been to every single book I know  
To soothe the thoughts that plague me so  
  
I sink like a stone thats been thrown in the ocean  
My logic has drowned in a sea of emotion  
Stop before you start  
Be still my beating heart  
  
Be still my beating heart  
You must learn to stand your ground  
Its not healthy to run at this pace  
The blood runs so red to my face  
  
Ive been to every single book I know  
To soothe the thoughts that plague me so  
Stop before you start  
Be still my beating heart  
  
Never to be wrong  
Never to make promises that break  
Its like singing in the wind  
Or writing on the surface of a lake  
  
And I wriggle like a fish caught on dry land  
Struggle to avoid any help at hand  
  
I sink like a stone thats been thrown in the ocean  
My logic has drowned in a sea of emotion  
Stop before you start  
Be still my beating heart
