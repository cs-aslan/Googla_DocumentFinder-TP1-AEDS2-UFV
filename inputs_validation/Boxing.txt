Howard the strangest things  
Have happened lately when I  
Take a good swing  
And all my dreams  
They pivot and slip  
I drop my fists  
And theyre back laughing  
  
Howard my intentions  
Become not to lose what Ive won  
Ambition has given way  
To desperation and I  
Ive lost the fight from my eyes  
  
Boxings been good to me Howard  
Now Im told  
Youre growing old  
The whole time we knew  
A couple of years Id be through  
Has boxing been good to you  
  
Howard now I confess  
Im scared and lonely and tired  
Everyone says Im made of clay  
That Ive had my day  
That Im not cut out for this  
I just know what to say  
And I say  
  
Boxings been good to me Howard  
Now Im told  
Youre growing old  
The whole time we knew  
A couple of years Id be through  
Has boxing been good to you  
  
Well sometimes I punch myself  
Hard as I can  
Yelling nobody cares  
Hoping someone will tell me how wrong I am  
Howard  
  
Boxings been good to me Howard  
Now Im told  
Youre growing old  
The whole time we knew  
A couple of years Id be through  
Has boxing been good  
Has boxing been good  
Has boxing been good
