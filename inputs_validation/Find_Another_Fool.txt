I should have learned this lesson long ago  
That friends and lovers always come and go  
And now you claim  
that everythings OK but Ive got just one thing to say  
  
Why dont you  
Find another find another  
Find another fool to love you  
Find another find another  
Find another fool to love you  
Find anotherfind anotherfind another foolto love you  
To love youfind another  
  
I dont believe that I deserve this ride  
Youtook me for my very heart and pride  
You let me downand now your hand is out  
Well heres somespare changeyou can count  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
You pulled this onceyou pulled it twice  
Its time you listened to my adviceoh baby  
  
Id never take advantage of our love  
I cant imagine what youre thinkin of  
Youre over dueyou think this storm is through  
Well baby Ive got news for you  
  
Repeat Chorus
