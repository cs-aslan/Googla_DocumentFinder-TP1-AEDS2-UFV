Have you ever thought that the sky was just endlessly dark  
And then look up and see a million stars  
Have you ever been scare off the water its stuck on the edge  
And then you dive in how quickly youll forget  
  
You know fears they capture the way get by  
Now that Im back in the light so warm I feel it like a  
  
Chorus  
Wave of love coming over me  
Got greater drop fall and Im on my knees  
Got the sound of you ringing in my ears  
Sun coming up on another day  
Got a second hand change gonna do it again  
Got rainbow colors and no more rain  
  
Rain no more  
Rain no more  
Rain no more  
Rain no more  
  
Have you ever dreamed you were flying until you look down  
You never moved an inch feet firmly on the ground feet on firmly on the
ground  
  
Our love carries a hurt that you hold  
Funny how live can unfold oh yeah I feel it like a  
  
Chorus  
  
Rain no more  
Rain no more  
Rain no more  
Rain no more  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Rain no more  
Rain no more  
Rain no more  
Rain no more
