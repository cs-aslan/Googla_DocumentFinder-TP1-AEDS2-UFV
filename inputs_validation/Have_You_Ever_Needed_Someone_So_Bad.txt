Here I am Im in the wrong bed again  
Its a game I just cant win  
There you are breathin soft on my skin yeah  
Still you wont let me in  
  
Why save your kisses for a rainy day  
Baby let the moment take your heart away  
  
Chorus  
Have you ever needed someone so bad yeah  
Have you ever wanted someone  
You just couldnt have  
Did you ever try so hard  
That your world just fell apart  
Have you ever needed someone so bad  
  
And to the girl I gotta have  
I gotta have you baby  
  
There you go midnight promises again yeah  
But theyre broken by the dawn  
You want to go further faster every day baby  
But in the morning youll be gone  
And Im alone  
  
Why save your kisses for a rainy day  
Baby let the moment take your heart away  
  
Chorus  
  
Every dream I dream is like  
Some kinds rash n reckless scene  
To give out such crazy love  
You must be some kind of drug  
And if my time dont ever come  
For me youre still the one  
Damned if I dont damned if I do  
I gotta get a fix on you  
  
Chorus
