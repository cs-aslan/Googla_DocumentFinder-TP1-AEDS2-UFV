I got the time I got my feet  
Lets go hit the street  
High in the city high in the city  
I got my mace and you got your knife  
You gotta protect your own life  
High in the city high in the city  
  
I want to get high high in the city  
I want to stay alive here in the city  
I want to stay high high in the city  
High in the city high in the city  
  
Lets not walk down Sutton Place  
You know everybody there got an Akitas  
High in the city high in the city  
Dont want to talk politics today  
I feel too good let me have my way  
High in the city high in the city  
  
Lets grap a pie lets hit the park  
Ill kiss and hug you till it gets dark  
Here in the city getting high in the city  
High in the city and youre looking so pretty  
Feelin pretty witty gettin high off of the city  
High in the city  
  
Watch out for that guy on your right  
Seen him on the news last Saturday night  
He was high in the city  
Hey look theyre setting fire to that jeep  
Theres not much you can keep  
High in the city high in the city  
  
I want to get high high in the city  
I want to stay alive alive in the city  
I want to stay high high in the city  
High in the city high in the city  
So many people feeling low  
And theres only one way to go to  
Get high in the city high in the city
