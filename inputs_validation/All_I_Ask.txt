Every time Im around you  
Im caught by surprise  
A sense of electric anticipation  
Rolls into me when you smile  
  
And I know that youre filled by emotion  
Cause I see it in the tear  
That you hide  
Girl I dont want you to go  
N I dont need you to know  
If forever is a part of your life  
  
horus  
All I ask of you  
Is hear your heart  
All I ask of you  
Is trust it babe  
  
They call love illusion  
They say falling in loves a mistake  
It could be just about anybody  
But I dont see it that way  
  
Hey I know whats in you  
Because I can feel it too  
And Ive never been more scared in my life  
  
N I dont want you to go  
N girl I dont need to know  
If forevers what I see in  
Your eyes  
  
Chorus  
  
Just as the night  
Knows the suns comin home  
Trust that our love  
Has a mind of its own
