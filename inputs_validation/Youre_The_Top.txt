At words poetic Im so pathetic  
That I always found it best  
Instead of getting em off my chest  
To let em rest unexpressed  
  
I hate parading serenading  
As Ill probably miss the bar  
But if this ditty is not so pretty  
At least itll tell you how great you are  
  
Youre the tops  
Youre the Colosseum  
Youre the top  
Youre the Louvre Museum  
  
Youre a melody from a symphony by Strauss  
Youre a Bendel bonnet  
A Shakespeares sonnet  
Youre Mickey Mouse  
  
Youre the Nile  
Youre the Tower of Pisa  
Mama youre the smile  
On the Mona Lisa  
  
Im a worthless check  
A total wreck a flop  
But if baby Im the bottom  
Youre the top  
  
Youre the top  
Youre Mahatma Gandhi  
Youre the top  
Youre Napoleon Brandy  
  
Youre the purple light  
Of a summer night in Spain  
Youre the National Gallery  
Youre Crosbys salary  
Youre cellophane  
  
Mama youre sublime  
Youre a turkey dinner  
Oh youre the time of a Derby winner  
Im a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop  
  
But if baby Im the bottom  
Youre the top
