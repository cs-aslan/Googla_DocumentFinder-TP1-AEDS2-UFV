Well Im a steamroller baby  
Im bound to roll all over you  
Yes Im a steamroller now baby  
Im bound to roll all over you  
Im gonna inject your soul with some sweet rock n roll  
And shoot you full of rhythm and blues  
  
Well Im a cement mixer  
A churning urn of burning funk  
Yes Im a cement mixer for you baby  
A churning urn of burning funk  
Well Im a demolition derby yeah  
A hefty hunk of steaming junk  
  
Now Im a napalm bomb baby  
Just guaranteed to blow your mind  
Yeah Im a napalm bomb for you baby  
Oh guaranteed just guaranteed to blow your mind  
And if I cant have your love for my own now  
Sweet child wont be nothing left behind  
It seems how lately baby  
Got a bad case steamroller blues
