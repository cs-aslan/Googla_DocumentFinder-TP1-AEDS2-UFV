Babys Got Her Blue Jeans On  
Conway Twitty  
  
Down on the corner by the traffic light  
Everybodys lookin as she goes by  
They turn their heads and they watch her till shes gone  
Lord have mercy babys got her blue jeans on  
  
Up by the bus stop and across the street  
Open up their windows to take a peek  
As she goes walkin rockin like a rollin stone  
Heaven help us babys got her blue jeans on  
  
She cant help it if shes made that way  
Shes not to blame if they look her way  
She aint really tryin to cause a scene  
It just comes naturally  
No the girl cant help it  
  
Well up on main street by the taxi stand  
Theres a crowd of people and a traffic jam  
She dont look back she aint doin nothin wrong  
Lord have mercy babys got her blue jeans on  
  
She cant help it if shes made that way  
Shes not to blame if they look her way  
She aint really tryin to cause a scene  
It just comes naturally  
No the girl cant help it  
  
Down on the corner by the traffic light  
Everybodys lookin as she goes by  
They turn their heads and they watch her till shes gone  
Lord have mercy babys got her blue jeans on  
Heaven help us babys got her blue jeans on
