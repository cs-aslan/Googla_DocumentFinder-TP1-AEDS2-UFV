Ooowe baby dont you count on me  
To be here when the sun goes down  
Cause all those mean old friends of mine are calling  
Calling way down the line  
Somebody send me a one way ticket  
Got to get away from here  
Put me on a jet back to London city  
Gotta get a belly full of beer  
  
Smile for the camera please mind your manner  
Youve got to keep your image clean  
Clench your fist and dont you take a piss  
Makes you want to slash your wrist  
Stand up shut up sit down throw up  
All I want to do is sing  
Responsibility and fidelity  
Never meant a thing to me  
  
I was born loose  
Running wild  
Keep your hands off child  
Cant change me now  
I was born loose  
Running wild  
Keep your hands off me baby  
Cause youre too late too late  
  
Big bombs are crashin  
Never stop clashin  
Wanting every woman in town  
Some tried to train me  
One tried to maim me  
But you cant keep a good man down  
  
Church bells ringin  
All the kids singin  
When we played the last date on the tour  
Janis and Jimi cant you hear me  
Knockin on heavens door  
  
Born loose  
Was born loose baby  
Slow me down  
You cant slow me down  
  
I was born loose  
Born loose  
Born loose  
Wrong side of my mama  
Wrong side of my daddy  
Wrong side of the tracks  
  
I was born loose baby  
I was born loose  
Cant change me now  
Cant change me now  
Cause youre too late now  
Too late now  
Too late now baby  
Too late now  
To change me now  
Never change me now  
Born loose  
Born loose
