It looked so good your perfect plan  
You had to get greedy to be the man  
Now youre holding the bag paying the price  
Gonna get burned by the heat of the ice  
  
Dirty diamonds  
  
You rolled the dice you bet your life  
You put your trust in your trophy wife  
Got stabbed in the back in the blink of an eye  
Shes in bed with the boys and the FBI  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and youre on their list  
Ah ah oh yeah  
  
Youre tied to a chair witha gun at your head  
Your face is all smeared with the blood thats been shed  
You were gonna be rich  
Now youre gonna be dead  
And all that glitters turns to lead  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and youre on their list  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and youre on their list  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
  
Diamonds dont cheat  
Diamonds dont lie  
Diamonds are forever  
Diamonds never die  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and youre on their list  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and youre on their list  
  
Run for your life you cant hide  
Cant you hear em coming  
Youre gonna die  
You better run for your life you cant hide  
Cant you hear em coming  
Youre gonna die  
You better run for your life you cant hide  
Cant you hear em coming  
Youre gonna die  
You better run for your life you cant hide  
Cant you hear em coming  
Youre gonna die
