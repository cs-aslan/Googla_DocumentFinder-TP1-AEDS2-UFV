Dry your eyes and take your song out its a newborn afternoon  
If you cant recall the singer you can still recall the tune  
Dry your eyes and play it slowly like youre marching off to war  
Sing it like you know hed want it like we sang it once before  
  
From the center of the circle to the midst of the waving crowd  
If it ever be forgotten sing it long and sing it loud  
Come dry your eyes  
And he taught us more about giving than we ever cared to know  
  
But we came to find the secret and we never let it go  
And it was more than being holy though it was less than being free  
And if you cant recall the reason can you hear the people sing  
Through the lightning and the thunder to the dark side of the moon  
  
To that distant calling angel who descended much too soon  
And come dry your eyes  
  
Come dry your eyes
