I had a hundred dollar ring in my hand  
So weak and tiredI can barely stand  
From being up all night praying shed say yes  
So with a hopeful heart I hit one knee  
With a tear in her eye she looked at me  
It was the moment of truth I was scared to death  
My life hung on what that tear meant  
Then she smiled at me  
And I lost it  
  
Chorus  
No one can make me cry  
Make me laugh  
Make me smile  
Or drive me mad  
Like she does  
Its like a curse  
That is the cure  
Better or worse  
One things for sure  
Its real love  
And I dont know what Id do  
If I lost it  
  
Well the honeymoon ended and life began  
Jobs and bills losing touch with friends  
And the apartment got smaller every day  
Then one night the walls finally closed in  
I came home late she said Where have you been  
You used to call and tell me youre on your way  
She said If this is how this is gonna be then I quit  
She walked out the door  
I lost it  
  
Chorus  
  
I picked myself up off the floor  
She walked back through the door  
We made love like it was the first time  
  
Chorus
