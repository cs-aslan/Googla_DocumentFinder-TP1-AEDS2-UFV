Girl dont you know its all I can do  
To keep my hands off of you  
Anytime youre around  
And when the stars come out at night  
I dream of holdin you tight  
Every time I lay down  
It feels so good to me to have you this bad  
The only other thing I wish I had was  
  
A chance  
A chance  
To tell you how I feel about you  
How it feels to live without a chance  
A chance  
To tell you Ill love you forever  
Knowing that Ill never have a chance  
  
Sometimes reality hurts  
And you wonder if lifes worth living at all  
Knowing no matter how much you care  
Youll never have a prayer  
Of having what you want  
At least Ive been close enough I could taste  
Beauty at its best but never a trace of  
  
A chance  
A chance  
To tell you how I feel about you  
How it feels to live without a chance  
A chance  
To tell you Ill love you forever  
Knowing that Ill never have a chance  
  
A chance  
A chance  
To tell you Ill love you forever  
Knowing that Ill never have  
The chance
