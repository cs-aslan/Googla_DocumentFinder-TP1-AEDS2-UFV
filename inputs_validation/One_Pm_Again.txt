Well its 1 PM again  
I guess Im ready to begin  
And its reeling there is a feeling  
Lets not make any sudden moves  
You dont have to show me how  
But Im not ready to right now  
There is a feeling and its reeling  
Lets not make any sudden moves  
And if we dont leave today  
Theres no hurry anyway  
Im on the road here safe at home here  
So lets make sure were sure  
That it is reeling and Im pleading  
Lets not make any sudden moves
