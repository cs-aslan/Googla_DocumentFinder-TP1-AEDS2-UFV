I met you in biology in high school  
You told me after college wed be wed  
You were my favorite lab partner  
Till you ran off with that brilliant young premed  
  
My pain would show up on a catscan  
My optic nerves are only seeing blue  
My blood hates to flow  
Because it has to go  
Through the fourchambered heart that cries for you  
  
Im in the lonely lab of broken hearts  
I dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart  
Im in the lonely lab of feelin blue  
And my pheremones can find no trace of you  
  
You were as sweet as crystalline carbohydrates  
The rods and cones in my optical receptors are filled with tears  
I wanted to elope  
So we could make some isotopes  
With a halflife of a million thousand years  
  
If I suspended my trachial dilations till you returned here  
My muscles would need atp anarobic respiration  
Adenine cidozine guanine and thianine  
Might make up my dna  
But my love gene must be missin from its station  
  
Im in the lonely lab of broken hearts  
I dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart  
Im in the lonely lab of feelin blue  
And my pheremones can find no trace of you  
  
The metallurgist is the musicians best friend This statement  
Has been echoed throughout the ages for without the metallurgist we  
Could not have such musical things as triangles cymbals margerine  
Tubs or guitar strings Guitar strings are produced by the  
Wiredrawing process where solid metal is pulled through dies with  
Progressively smaller diameters until the desired diameter or guage  
Is reached The ability to be drawn into wires is called ductility  
And seperates metals from other materials such as wood ceramics or  
Plastic milk jugs which are made by the blowmolding process You  
Put the milk in later  
  
Im in the lonely lab of broken hearts  
I dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart  
Im in the lonely lab of feelin blue  
And my pheremones can find no trace of you  
  
Im in the lonely lab of broken hearts  
I dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart  
Im in the lonely lab of feelin blue  
And my pheremones can find no trace of you  
And my pheremones can find no trace of you  
  
You stands for uranium There are several isotopes of uranium  
Three of which are radioactive
