Verse 1  
I had a zig zag story just the other day  
I rolled a fat blunt and yo it ripped this way  
I took a puff uhhuh and what did I see  
Those motherfuckers still want to IseeE  
To blaze up a sac of that green bombay  
And when I reach my peak I explode like dante  
Tha ganjay has got my mind wide open Im soakin  
In the music I use it And dont abuse it  
And true It gets me high like the sky  
I will buy till the day that I die  
You aint gotta ask me why  
I take tokes from the smoke I cant deny  
Got a lifetime supply  
Chorus  
And I want to get you high  
Get you high all night  
cause I want to get you high  
Get you high all night  
And I want to get you high  
Bang another joint  
Zig zag stories  
Bang another joint  
Zig zag stories  
Verse 2  
This is a zig zag story that I had last night  
A sixpack a joint And I was feeling all right  
Lit up tha chronic And what did I see  
This badass bitch creeping up on me  
She had the look that could get the ice cooked up in a second  
I pictured her undressing and gettin buttnaked  
She walked up to me and said her name was mary jane  
Aint no shame in my game Down to do anything  
Took me by the hand Ask me if id like to fly  
You know I like to fly  
Chorus  
Verse 3  
Now heres a zig zag story that Im havin right now  
Gotta get myself together Cause some shit is goin down  
Hit you people off with my new cd  
Hard to swallow Like saying fuck the industry  
Im stompin through the bayou with my black boots laced  
And takin out you motherfuckers acting twofaced  
For the people out there gonna blaze till I die  
Blaze up the thai  
Chorus
