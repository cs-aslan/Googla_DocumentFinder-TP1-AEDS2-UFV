Baby since the day you came into my life  
You made me realize that we were born to fly  
You showed me everyday new possibilities  
You proved my fantasies of love could really be  
  
Lets go to a place only lovers go  
To a spot that weve never known  
To the top of the clouds were floating away yeah  
Ooh this feels so crazy  
Oh this love is blazing  
Baby were so high  
Walking on cloud nine  
  
Youve got me up so high So high  
My shoes are scraping the sky So high  
Youve got me up so high Oh  
My shoes are scraping the sky  
  
Maybe later we can go up to the moon  
Or sail among the stars before the night is through  
And when morning comes well see the sun is not so far  
And we cant get much closer to God than where we are  
  
Well go to a place only lovers go  
To a spot that weve never known  
To the top of the clouds were floating away yeah  
Ooh this feels so crazy  
Oh this love is blazing  
Baby were so high  
Walking on cloud nine  
  
Youve got me up so high So high  
My shoes are scraping the sky So high  
Youve got me up so high Oh  
My shoes are scraping the sky  
  
Ooh yeah  
Ooh oh hey  
  
Ooh this feels so crazy  
Oh this love is blazin  
Baby were so high  
Walking on cloud nine  
You got me up so high  
You got me up so high  
You got me up so high  
My shoes are scraping the sky  
  
You got me up so high  
You got me up so high  
You got me up so high  
My shoes are scraping the sky ooh ooh
