Armalite street lights nightsights  
Searching the roofs for a sniper a viper a fighter  
Death in the shadows hell maim you hell wound you hell kill you  
For a long forgotten cause on not so foreign shores  
Boys baptised in wars  
Morphine chill scream bad dream  
Serving as numbers on dogtags flakrags sandbags  
Your girl has married your best friend loves end poison pen  
Your flesh will always creep tossing turning sleep  
The wounds that burn so deep  
Your mother sits on the edge of the world  
When the cameras start to roll  
Panoramic viewpoint resurrect the killing fold  
Your father drains another beer hes one of the few that cares  
Crawling behind a Saracens hull from the safety of his living room chair  
Forgotten sons forgotten sons forgotten sons  
And so as I patrol in the valley of the shadow of the tricolour  
I must fear evil for I am but mortal and mortals can only die  
Asking questions pleading answers from the nameless faceless watchers  
That stalk the carpeted corridors of Whitehall  
Who orders desecration mutilation verbal masturbation  
I in the guarded bureaucratic wombs  
Minister minister care for your children order them not into damnation  
To eliminate those who would trespass against you  
For whose is the kingdom the power the glory forever and ever Amen  
Halt who goes there Death approach friend  
Youre just another coffin on its way down the emerald aisle  
When your childrens stony glances mourn your death in a terrorists smile  
The bombers arm placing fiery gifts on the supermarket shelves  
Alley sings with shrapnel detonate a temporary hell  
Forgotten Sons  
From the dole queue to the regiment a profession in a flash  
But remember Monday signings when from door to door you dash  
On the news a nation mourns you unknown soldier count the cost  
For a second youll be famous but labeled posthumous  
Forgotten sons forgotten sons  
Peace on earth and mercy mild Mother Brown has lost her child  
Just another Forgotten Son
