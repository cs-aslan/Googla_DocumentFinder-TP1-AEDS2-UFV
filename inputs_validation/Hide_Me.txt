Verse 1  
I know you see us  
I know you hear us  
And you fill us when we pray  
You understand us see deep inside us  
Translate tears and take them away  
Im a be honest there are times  
Your ways and methods I dont understand  
It seems so far tell me who you are  
I know your touch but cant see your plan  
Im lost in this thing called life  
Left to me now feels right  
Its your turn now I wanna be where you are  
  
Chorus  
Hide me  
Let me live behind you  
Cause I need  
Shelter from the rain  
Remind me  
The only way my faith can grow  
Is when you let your winds blow  
Youre making me stronger now so rain  
Dont go away  
Dont go away  
  
Verse 2  
Id admit  
Itd be nice  
To have some light shine down on me  
Especially  
When lord I shall be you dont always let me see  
It aint easy  
But Im trying hard to get out of your way  
To believe  
That what you say  
That my change begins today  
The road includes some pain  
And to grow you need some rain  
And when it falls I wanna be where you are  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
Cause theres some much I see  
Needs to grow inside of me  
In the fire I realize  
Before I live I have to die  
Please believe me when I say  
I cant waste another day  
Its so easy to complain  
But complain dont make a change  
Not the victim anymore  
All the things god has in store  
If I aint ready dont let the rain  
Go away  
Dont go away  
  
Chorus  
Hide me  
Cause I need  
Remind me  
The only way my faith can grow  
Is when you let your winds blow  
Youre making me stronger now  
  
Youre making me stronger now x7  
You made me stronger now x4  
  
x2  
He made me stronger now  
She made me stronger now  
They made me stronger now x2  
  
You made me stronger now x8
