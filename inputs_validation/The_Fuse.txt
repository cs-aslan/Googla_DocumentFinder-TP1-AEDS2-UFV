Its coming from so far away  
Its hard to say for sure  
Whether what I hear is music or the wind  
Through an open door  
Theres a fire high in the empty sky  
Where the sound meets the shore  
Theres a long distance loneliness  
Rolling out over the desert floor  
  
And the years that I spent lost in the mystery  
Fall away leaving only the sound of the drum  
Like a part of me  
It speaks to the heart of me  
Forget what life used to be  
You are what you choose to be  
Its whatever it is you see  
That life will become  
  
Whatever it is you might think you have  
You have nothing to lose  
Through every dead and living thing  
Time runs like a fuse  
And the fuse is burning  
And the earth is turning  
  
Though the years give way to uncertainty  
And the fear of living for nothing strangles the will  
Theres a part of me  
That speaks to the heart of me  
Though sometimes its hard to see  
Its never far from me  
Alive in eternity  
That nothing can kill  
  
Oh Lord  
Are there really people starving still  
Look out beyond the walls of Babylon  
How long will their needs go unfilled  
I want to say right now Im going to be around  
Im going to be around  
When the walls and towers are crumbling  
When the towers are tumbling down  
And I will tune my spirit to the gentle sound  
I want to hear the sound  
Of the waters lapping on a higher ground  
Of the children laughing
