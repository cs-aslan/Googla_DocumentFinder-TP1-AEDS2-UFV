Cigars in the summertime under the sky by the light  
I can feel you read my mind  
I can see it in your eyes  
Under the moon as it plays  
Like music every line  
Theres a rug with bleeding dye under the fan in the room  
Where the passions burning high  
By the chair with the leopard skin under the light  
Its always Penny and me tonight Sayin Ohoh Mmmmm  
On the plane step up with both my feet  
Riding in seat number 3 on a flight to nyc  
Got my bean in a coffee cup next to my seat  
Catch the view and another good book to read  
Sitting at home on the friendly skies  
Missin her eyes  
Its always Penny and me tonight  
Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down  
Turn the radio up and push the pedal to the ground  
And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies  
Close our eyes pretend to fly  
Its always Penny and me tonight Singing Ohoh Nonono  
Staring at a million city lights  
But its still Penny and I all alone beneath the sky  
Feel the wind brushing slowly by  
If I could soar I would try to test these wings and fly  
Away to where the leaves turn red  
But no matter where I am instead  
Singin along to feelin alright Mmmm  
Were makin it by in the pink moonlight  
Its always Penny and me tonight  
Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down  
Turn the radio up push the pedal to the ground  
And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies  
Close our eyes pretend to fly Singn Ohoh  
Close our eyes pretend to fly  
Its always Penny and me tonight  
Penny likes to get away  
And drown her pain in lemonade  
And Penny Dreams Of Rainy Days  
And Nights Up Late By The Fireplace  
And aimless conversations bout the better days  
Mmmmmmm  
Singin along to feeling alright yeah  
Were makin it by in the pink moonlight  
Its always Penny and me tonight  
Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down  
Turn the radio up push the pedal to the ground  
And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies  
Close our eyes pretend to fly  
Its always Penny and me tonight Sing Ohoh  
Penny and me tonight  
Penny and me tonight  
JustPenny and me tonightyeah
