I come home in the morning light  
My mother says when you gonna live your life right  
Oh mother dear were not the fortunate ones  
And girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls just wanna have fun  
  
The phone rings in the middle of the night  
My father yells what you gonna do with your life  
Oh daddy dear you know youre still number one  
But girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls just wanna have  
  
Chorus  
Thats all they really want  
Some fun  
When the working day is done  
Girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls just wanna have fun  
  
Some boys take a beautiful girl  
And hide her away from the rest of the world  
I want to be the one to walk in the sun  
Oh girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls just wanna have  
  
Thats all they really want  
Some fun  
When the working day is done  
Girlsthey want to have fun  
Oh girls just want to have fun  
They wanna have fun  
They wanna have fun  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh oh oh  
Girls girls girls  
Wanna have fun fun fun fun yeah  
Girls just have fun
