I wish I had all you ever wanted  
Id give it right to you  
But I dont have it  
How could I ever find it  
The strength to let you go cause I dont have it  
When will I have it  
And it goes and it goes on  
And it goes on  
  
You wont see me cry  
You know I decided  
that Im gonna pull myself together and find a way to fight it  
Im gonna have to hide it  
You wont see me cry  
You wont see me cry  
  
Ive got no choice but to face it  
I have to let you know that I dont like it  
My love is good for someone and it may take some time  
but I will find him  
Why should I waste it  
When I go when I go  
when I go on I will go on  
  
You wont see me cry  
You know I decided  
that Im gonna pull myself together and find a way to fight it  
Oh no Even if I have to hide it  
You wont see me cry  
You wont see me cry  
You wont see me cry  
  
You know I decided That Im gonna pull myself together  
I finally decided and I found the way to fight it  
So you wont see me cry
