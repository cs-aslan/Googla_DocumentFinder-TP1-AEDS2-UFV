Thank you very much  
This next song was written by a man right here in Folsom prison  
And last night was the first time Ive ever sung this song  
Anyways this song was written by our friend Glen Shirley  
Um hope we do your song justice Glen were going to do our best  
  
Inside the walls of prison my body may be  
But my Lord has set my soul free  
Theres a greystone chapel here at Folsom  
A house of worship in this den of sin  
You wouldnt think that God had a place here at Folsom  
But he saved the souls of many lost men  
Now theres greystone chapel here at Folsom  
Stands a hundred years old made of granite rock  
It takes a ring of keys to move here at Folsom  
But the door to the House of God is never locked  
  
Inside the walls of prison my body may be  
But my Lord has set my soul free  
  
There are men here that dont ever worship  
There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray  
But Ive got down on my knees in that greystone chapel  
And I thank the Lord for helpin me each day  
Now theres greystone chapel here at Folsom  
It has a touch of Gods hand on ever stone  
Its a flower of light in a field of darkness  
And its givin me the strength to carry on  
Inside the walls of prison my body may be  
But my Lord has set my soul free
