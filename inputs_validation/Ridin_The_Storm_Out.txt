Ridin the storm out waitin for the thaw out  
On a full moon night in the Rocky Mountain winter  
My wine bottles low watching for the snow  
Thinkin about what Ive been missin in the city  
  
And Im not missin a thing  
Watchin the full moon crossing the range  
Ridin the storm out  
Ridin the storm out  
  
My ladys beside me shes there to guide me  
She says that alone weve finally found home  
The wind outside is frightening  
but its kinder than the lightning life in the city  
Its a hard life to live but it gives back what you give
