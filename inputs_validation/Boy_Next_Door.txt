Hello mister how youre doing  
I didnt catch your name  
No Im not from here  
Ive just moved in its only been a few days  
No I dont mind that could be fine  
We could hang out some time oh  
But I gotta run now hope to see you soon  
Oh oh  
  
Bridge  
Wake up in the morning get that paper  
Walking on the hallway heading forward  
And we pass by and this is how  
He doesnt know what he does to my heart  
Gotta catch him by the afternoon  
If I miss him I dont know what I do  
Yeah it might sound crazy but it could be my baby  
  
Chorus  
I think Im in love with the boy next door  
Dont ask if he feels that same way sure  
I can tell by the way he turns to look at me  
I believe I fall in for the boy next door  
Yeah  
The boy next door oh yeah  
  
I check the man everyday  
But about the same time I know hes there  
So I can catch a quick glimpse of his smile  
Make it seem as a coincidence  
I know I can see right through my eyes that Im falling for him  
And thats no lie no no  
  
Bridge

Chorus

Dont ask if he feels that same way sure  
I can tell by the way he turns to look at me  
I believe I fall in for the boy next door  
Yeah  
The boy next door oh yeah  
  
I get butterflies when hes around  
And I cant help to wonder if he knows  
But when I feel my Sweaty  
 Says lets go Im ready  
Cant remember having a crush like this before  
  
Chorus x2  
I think Im in love with the boy next door  
Dont ask if he feels that same way sure  
I can tell by the way he turns to look at me  
I believe I fall in for the boy next door  
Yeah  
The boy next door oh yeah
