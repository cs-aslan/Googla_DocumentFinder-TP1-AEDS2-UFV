Silence beating down  
Silence all around  
Well Im peaceful  
At least for now  
Silence beating down  
  
Here other people they wont see me sad  
And if Im happy they wont share my happiness  
For this is peacefulness that wont be shared  
For its time for the spirit  
Its time unsaid  
This peacefulness that wont be shared  
For its time alone  
  
Silence beating down  
Silence all around  
And Im peaceful  
At least for now  
Silence beating down  
  
Here other people they wont see me sad  
And if Im happy they wont share my happiness  
For this is peacefulness that wont be shared  
For its time for my spirit and me to spend  
This is peacefulness that wont be shared  
For its time alone
