You must understand though the touch of your hand  
Makes my pulse react  
That its only the thrill of boy meeting girl  
Opposites attract  
Its physical  
Only logical  
You must try to ignore that it means more than that  
  
Whats love got to do got to do with it  
Whats love but a second hand emotion  
Whats love got to do got to do with it  
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken  
  
It may seem to you that Im acting confused  
When youre close to me  
If a tend to look dazed Ive read it someplace  
Ive got cause to be  
Theres a name for it  
Theres a phrase that fits  
But whatever the reason you do it for me  
  
Whats love got to do got to do with it  
Whats love but a second hand emotion  
Whats love got to do got to do with it  
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken  
  
Ive been taking on a new direction  
But I have to say  
Ive been thinking about my own protection  
It scares me to feel this way  
  
Whats love got to do got to do with it  
Whats love but a sweet old fashioned notion  
Whats love got to do got to do with it  
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
