Good thing got yourself a good thing Its a good thing Ooooh  
Its a good thing got yourself a good thing Im gonna let you go  
So you met someone who set you back on your heels Goody Goody  
So you met someone and now you know how it feels Goody Goody  
So you gave him your heart too just as I gave mine to you  
And he broke it in little pieces Now how do you do  
So you lie awake just singin the blues all night Goody Goody  
So you think that loves a barrel of dynamite Goody Goody  
Hurray and Hallelujah You had it comin to ya  
  
Goody goody for him Goody Goody for you  
And I hope youre satisfied you rascal you  
Good thing got yourself a good thing Ooooh  
Its a good thing got yourself a good thing Im gonna let you go  
So you met somebody who set you back on your heels Goody Goody  
So you met somebody and now you know how it feels Goody Goody  
So you gave him your heart too just as I gave mine to you  
And he stuck it in his collection section 92  
So you lie awake just singin the blues all night Goody Goody  
So you think that loves a barrel of dynamite Goody Goody  
Hurray and Hallelujah You had it comin to ya  
Goody goody for him Goody Goody for me  
And I hope youre satisfied you rascal you  
Good thing got yourself a good thing Its a good thing Ooooh  
Its a good thing got yourself a good thing Im gonna let you go  
till end
