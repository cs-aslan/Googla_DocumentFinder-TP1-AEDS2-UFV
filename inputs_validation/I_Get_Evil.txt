Theres two kinds of people that I just cant stand  
An evil hearted woman and a lyin man  
But dont you lie to me dont you lie to me  
Because it makes me feel like its as evil as I can be  
Told me that you loved me a long time ago  
The woman that you had you dont want her no more  
But dont you lie to me dont you lie to me  
Because it makes me feel like its as evil as a woman can be  
  
You told me that you loved me a long time ago  
The woman that you had you dont want her no more  
But dont you lie to me dont you lie to me  
Because it makes me feel like its as evil as a woman can be  
  
Hey dont you lie to me  
Dont you lie to me  
No no dont you lie to me  
Dont you lie to me  
Because it makes me feel like its as evil as a woman can be  
Dont you lie to me  
Dont you lie to me baby  no  
Dont you lie to me  
No dont you lie to me
