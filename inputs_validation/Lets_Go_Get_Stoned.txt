I swear sometimes youre taking me for granted  
I swear sometime youre a whore  
I swear but I know there aint no reason  
Cause everything is such a bore  
  
At night I had a dream though it made me sick  
Saw you in your bedroom sucking someone elses dick my goodness  
My friends all laughed said it was my fault  
Said its time that it happened to me  
But I know that the show was much more than a blow  
So Im waiting for the tide to get low  
Waiting for the tide to get low  
  
If I was an ant live upon the wall  
Tell me baby would it make any difference at all  
If I was a roach on a tree tell me would you smoke me  
Bright lights put me in a trance  
But it aint house music makes me want to dance word  
I dont gamble but I bet  
Im gonna die if I dont get a cigarette  
Hold me close I always play the mack  
With the monkey on my back
