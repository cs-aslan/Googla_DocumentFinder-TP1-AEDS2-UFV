Ill never open my legs again  
To a man whos insecure  
Ill never open my legs again  
Unless Im really sure  
  
No Ill never never  
Never be another fool  
  
Sad but true I slept with you  
I thought we were in love  
I even got me a rose tattoo  
But that was not enough  
  
No Ill never never  
Never be another fool  
  
Never no  
Never never never  
  
Nothing but the best of me  
I gave with open arms  
Alive and well Im back from hell  
Released from your charms  
Its time to go  
  
Scene 23 exit fade to black  
Tell me whyd you have to come back  
  
This love you need to fade  
Leave the best to yesterday  
If this only one thing is true  
I aint gonna be another fool  
  
Never be another fool  
  
You think about callin Dont
