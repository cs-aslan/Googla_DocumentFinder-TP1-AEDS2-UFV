If you want love  
You gotta be cool  
And if you deny it  
Then baby youre a fool  
Im telling you now  
Dont you hide it away  
Because you need to keep you warm both night and day  
  
I could come home  
Late at night  
And after some loving  
Baby it would be alright  
Ive given up trying  
Lying my way  
Because you need love to keep you warm both night and day  
You gotta have love to keep you warm both night and day  
  
I said baby if you need my love  
You better come home with me  
Maybe if you want my love  
You know you got it easily  
But when the sun goes down  
And the night is cold  
You know I wont be far away  
Because you need love to keep you warm both night and day  
You gotta have love to keep you warm both night and day  
  
You gotta have love  
  
If you want schooling baby  
Ill be around  
Im ready for fooling  
But dont hang around  
And every morning I know I will say  
Because you need love to keep you warm both night and day  
You gotta have love to keep you warm both night and day  
  
I said baby if you need my love  
You better come home with me  
Maybe if you want my love  
You know you got it easily  
But when the sun goes down  
And the night is cold  
You know I wont be far away  
Because you need love to keep you warm both night and day  
You gotta have love to keep you warm both night and day  
You gotta have love to keep you warm both night and day  
I said you need love to keep you warm both night and day
