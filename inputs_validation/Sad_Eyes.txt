Every day here you come walking  
I hold my tongue  
I dont do much talking  
You say youre happy and youre doin fine  
Well go ahead baby I got plenty of time  
Sad eyes never lie  
Sad eyes never lie  
Well for a while Ive been watching you steady  
Aint gonna move til youre good and ready  
You show up and then you shy away  
But I know pretty soon youll be walking this way  
Sad eyes never lie  
Sad eyes never lie  
Baby dont you know I dont care  
Dont you know that Ive been there  
Well if something in the air feels a little unkind  
Dont worry darling itll slip your mind  
I know you think youd never be mine  
Well thats okay baby I dont mind  
That shy smiles sweet thats a fact  
Go ahead I dont mind the act  
Here you come all dressed up for a date  
Well one more step and itll be too late  
Blue blue ribbon in you hair  
Like youre so sure Ill be standin there  
Sad eyes never lie  
Sad eyes never lie  
Sad eyes never lie  
Sad eyes never lie
