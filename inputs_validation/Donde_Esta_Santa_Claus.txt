Mamacita donde esta Santa Claus  
Donde esta Santa Claus  
And the toys that he will leave  
Mamacita oh where is Santa Claus  
I look for him because its a Christmas Eve  
  
I know that I should be sleeping  
But maybe hes not far away  
Out of the window Im peeping  
Hoping to see him in his sleigh  
  
I hope he wont forget to clack his castinet  
And to his reindeer say  
Oh Pancho Oh Vixen Oh Pedro Oh Blitzen  
Ole Ole Ole Cha cha cha  
  
Mamacita donde esta Santa Claus  
Oh Where is Santa Claus  
Its Christmas Eve  
Mamacita donde esta Santa Claus  
I look for him because its Christmas Eve  
  
I know that I should be sleeping  
But maybe hes not far away  
Out of the window Im peeping  
Hoping to see him in sleigh  
  
I hope he wont forget to crack his castinet  
And to his reindeer say  
Oh Pancho Oh Vixen Oh Pedro Oh Blitzen  
Ole Ole Ole Cha cha cha  
  
Mamacita donde esta Santa Claus  
Oh Where is Santa Claus  
Its Christmas Eve  
Its Christmas Eve
