You talk too much  
Never saying whats on your mind  
Its written on your face  
An in the words you hide behind  
I know what you want  
I can see what youre looking for  
I know what you want from me  
An Im gonna give you more  
  
Im gonna slide it in  
Right to the top  
Slide it in  
I aint never gonna stop  
Slide it in  
Right to the top  
Im gonna slide it in slide it in  
Slide it in baby  
  
Sometimes you seem  
Just like a stranger to me  
But all the games you play  
Make it so easy to see  
Youre looking for love  
Tho you try to deny  
The things you put me through  
Tell me what Ive got to do to you  
  
Im gonna slide it in  
Right to the top  
Slide it in  
I aint never gonna stop  
Slide it in  
Right to the top  
Im gonna slide it in slide it in  
  
You talk too much  
Always treating me so unkind  
I know what Ive got to do  
To get me some peace of mind  
  
Im gonna slide it in  
Right to the top  
Slide it in  
I aint never gonna stop  
Slide it in  
Right to the top  
Im gonna slide it in slide it in  
Slide it in  
Right to the top  
Slide it in  
I aint never gonna stop  
Slide it in  
Right to the top  
Im gonna slide it in slide it in slide it  
Slide it in slide it in  
Right to the top baby
