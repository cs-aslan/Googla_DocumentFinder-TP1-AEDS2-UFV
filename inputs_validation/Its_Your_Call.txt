Its your call Its her  
Would you rather take it in the other room  
Shes hangin on and so am I  
Yeah I know all about it dont act so surprised  
  
Its time to end this game youre playin  
Shes not the only one whos waitin on the line  
  
Its your call  
Its up to you  
And I wont try to stop you if you go  
But if you stay tell her goodbye  
I cant take another minute  
I cant stand another night  
  
Of wondering if I even matter  
Its something only you can answer  
Heres the phone Its your call  
  
Theres no easy way out this time  
Cause I wont live this way  
She called here to talk to you  
With a message that I cant take  
  
Oh Ive got to know if I still matter  
Its somethin only you can answer  
Heres the phone Its your call
