Mary had a little lamb  
His fleece was white as snow  
And everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go  
Now aint that just like me  
Well you know crackin up over you  
You know that I love you yeah love you yeah  
Wont you come along there too  
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall  
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall  
All the kings horses and all the kings men  
Couldnt put him back again  
Now aint that just like me  
Well you know crackin up over you  
You know that I love you yeah love you yeah  
Wont you come along there too  
Hey diddlediddle the cat had a fiddle  
The cow jumped over the moon  
The little dog laughed to see such fun  
And the dish ran away with the spoon  
Now aint that just like me  
Well you know crackin up over you  
You know that I love you yeah love you yeah  
Wont you come along there too
