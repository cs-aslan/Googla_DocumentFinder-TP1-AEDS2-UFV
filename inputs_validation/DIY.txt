Dont tell me what I will do cause I wont  
Dont tell me to believe in you cause I dont  
Be on your guard better hostile and dont risk affection  
Like flesh to the bone in the nogo zone  
Youre still waiting for the resurrection  
Come up to me with your What did you say  
And Ill tell you straight in the eye  
  
DIY DIY DIY DIY DIY DIY DIY DIY  
Do it yourself  
  
Everyone want to be what he not what he not  
Nobody happy with what he got what he got  
You function like a dummy with a new ventriloquist  
Do you say nothing yourself  
Hanging like a thriller on the final twist  
You know youre getting stuck on the shelf  
Come up to me with your What did you say  
And Ill tell you straight in the eye  
  
DIY DIY DIY DIY  
  
When things get so big I dont trust them at all  
You want some controlyouve got to keep it small  
  
DIY DIY DIY DIY  
Do it yourself
