I dont understand it cause you wont say yes  
But you dont say no  
Sayin no shouldnt you keep holdin out  
But you dont let go  
Im givin up on trying  
To sell you things that you aint buying  
  
Its your move  
I played all of mine  
Time is running out  
Make your move  
Or we cant go on  
Till you understand  
Its all in your hands  
Its your move  
  
Youre giving me the business with that old come on  
But you dont come across  
You get me so excited dont you know youre such a tease  
When I think youre gettin hot youre not  
So whats the problem whats wrong  
This kiss and miss you know it cant go on  
  
Its your move  
I played all of mine  
Time is running out  
Make your move  
Or we cant go on  
Till you understand  
Its all in your hands  
Its your move

Girl if you aint buyin now its

Time is running out  
Make your move  
Or we cant go on  
Till you understand  
Its all in your hands  
Its your move

I played all of mine  
Time is running out  
Make your move

I played all of mine  
Time is running out  
Make your move  
Or we cant go on  
Till you understand  
Its all in your hands
