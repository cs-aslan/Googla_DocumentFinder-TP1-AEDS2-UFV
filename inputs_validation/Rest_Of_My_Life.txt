Am I the only one that feels alone  
Though all is home  
Emotions flow  
  
Am I the only one that hears the tears  
Run down my face  
Would anybody recognize at all  
  
cause I know  
Im so slow  
But Im trying  
And Im still dying to know  
Say you wont leave for the rest of my  
  
Lifes the only thing that deals the pain  
Like pouring rain now  
Breeding hate  
  
And I dont want to do no wrong  
My God its been so long  
Please comfort me before I go insane  
  
cause I know  
Im so slow  
But Im trying  
And Im still dying to know  
Say you wont leave for the rest of my life  
  
I know  
Im so slow  
But Im trying  
And Im still dying to know  
Say you wont leave for the rest of my life  
  
The rest of my life  
Na na na na na na  
  
She said  
  
Im slow  
But Im trying  
And Im still dying to know  
Say you wont leave for the rest of my  
I cant have you leave for the rest of my  
Say you wont leave for the rest of my life
