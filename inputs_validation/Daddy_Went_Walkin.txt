My old dad went a walkin one day  
Pushing tall weeds right outta his way  
My old dad went a walkin one day  
Hey now hey now  
  
Corduroy pants and an old plaid shirt  
Daddy went a walkin just to feel the earth  
Got a little dirty but thats all right  
Hey now hey now  
  
Old man crossing the road  
Youve got to let him go  
Old man crossing the road  
Hes feelin fine  
  
Daddy went a ridin in his old car  
Took the dog with him cause it aint too far  
Daddy went ridin in his old car  
Hey now hey now  
  
Brown leather boots and an old straw hat  
Daddys getting wood with the barnyard cat  
Got a little dirty but thats all right  
Hey now hey now  
  
Old man crossing the road  
Youve got to let him go  
Old man crossing the road  
Hes feelin fine  
  
Mamas waiting  
At the top of the hill  
Theyll be laughing  
Oh the stories theyll tell  
When he holds her  
In his arms again  
Theyll be sweethearts  
With time on their hands
