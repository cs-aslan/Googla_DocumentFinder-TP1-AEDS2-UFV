Shes gonna pack her bags  
Shes gonna find her way  
Shes gonna get right out of this  
She dont want New York  
She dont want LA  
  
Shes gonna find that special kiss  
She dont want no sleep  
She dont want no high  
Oh like peaches n cream  
  
Shes gonna wish on stars and touch the sky  
Ah you know what I mean  
  
She wants a good time  
No need to rewind  
She needs to really really find what she wants  
She lands on both feet  
Wont take a back seat  
Theres a brave new girl  
And shes comin out tonight  
  
Shes gonna step outside  
Uncover her eyes  
Who knew she could feel so alive  
Her MOs changed  
She dont wanna behave  
Aint it good to be a brave girl tonight  
  
Tonight its alright  
A brave girl tonight  
  
So she met this man  
He was kinda rough  
He said girl what you lookin for  
She said I dont know  
  
I go with the flow  
He said lets get on the floor  
He said you look real cute with your low ride jeans  
And your pink little baby tee  
  
Lets get a room girl  
Come and ride with me  
  
She wants a good time  
No need to rewind  
She needs to really really find what she wants  
She lands on both feet  
  
Wont take a back seat  
Theres a brave new girl  
And shes coming out tonight  
  
Shes gonna step outside  
Uncover her eyes  
Who knew she could feel so alive  
Her MOs changed  
She dont wanna behave  
Aint it good to be a brave girl tonight  
  
Tonight its alright  
A brave girl tonight  
Tonight its alright  
A brave new girl tonight  
  
Keep on  
  
Shes gonna step outside  
Uncover her eyes  
Who knew she could feel so alive  
Her MOs changed  
  
She dont wanna behave  
Aint it good to be a brave girl tonight  
Tonight its alright  
A brave girl tonight  
  
Tonight its alright  
A brave girl tonight  
A brave girl tonight  
A brave girl tonight
