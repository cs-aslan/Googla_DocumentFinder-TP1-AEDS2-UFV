Wheels are turning  
I remember when you were mine  
Now just to reach you  
Baby Id stand in line  
  
But theres another world  
Were living in  
Tonight  
  
And theres another heart  
Thats fading in  
The light  
  
Dont want your picture  
On my cell phone  
I want you here with me  
Dont want your memory  
In my head now  
I want you here with me  
  
Spent the summer just laying out in the sun  
Time seems to move so slow  
When youre taking it as it comes  
Maybe we were just too young  
  
Your body was tanned and your hair was long  
You showed me your smile and my cares were gone  
Falling in love filled my soul with fright  
You said Come on babe itll be alright  
I must have been a fool to the bitter end  
Now I hold on to hope to have you back again  
Id bargain and Id fight  
  
But theres another world  
Were living in  
Tonight  
  
Dont want your picture  
On my cell phone  
I want you here with me  
I dont want your memory  
In my head now  
I want you here with me  
  
Well I saw you in a restaurant  
The other day  
And instead of walking towards you  
I ran away  
And Ill keep on waiting for you  
Till youll come around  
Come around and say  
  
Dont want your picture  
On my cell phone  
I want you here with me  
Dont need those memories  
In my head now  
I want you here with me  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Here with me  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Here with me
