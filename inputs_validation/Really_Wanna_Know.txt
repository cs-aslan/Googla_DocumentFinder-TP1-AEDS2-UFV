The people come from all around  
And lay their precious money down  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
No distractions all you need  
Spend a weekend in paradise  
Try this on its very nice  
Youre having fun  
Stick around and well sell you the sun  
  
And soon ya learn to play the game  
Ya lose ya win its all the same  
Catch your dream before it fades  
And join the endless masquerade  
Where pain relievers speak to you  
A make believers dream come true  
You learn so well  
No one not even you can tell  
  
Chorus  
But I really wanna know  
But I really wanna know  
But I really wanna know  
And Ive got no choice  
Can ya tell me whats goin on  
  
Now every game begins and ends  
And though the player still pretends  
In mausoleums on painted walls  
The tale of those whod have it all  
The slave of glorys lost demands  
To always leave with empty hands  
The conqueror  
Tell me what have you come here for  
  
Chorus  
  
This life it is your only friend  
Its whispered in your ear  
In a voice it seems like ages  
Youve been waiting so long just to hear  
And suddenly the mystery and  
Meaning become so clear  
Hold on yesterdays gone  
  
Chorus  
Oh I really wanna know  
I really wanna know  
I really wanna know  
I really wanna know  
And Ive got no choice  
Can you tell me whats goin on
