Finn  
There is freedom within there is freedom without  
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup  
Theres a battle ahead many battles are lost  
But youll never see the end of the road  
While youre traveling with me  
Hey now hey now  
  
Finn with Tina  
Dont dream its over  
  
Finn  
Hey now hey now

When the world comes in  
They come they come  
To build a wall between us  
We know they wont win  
  
Tina and Blaine  
Now Im towing my car theres a hole in the roof  
My possessions are causing me suspicion but theres no proof  
  
Sam and Brittany  
In the paper today tales of war and of waste  
But you turn right over to the TV page
