We drove right past  
That no trespassing sign  
We sat on the tailgate  
And watched the planes take off  
  
We thought we had all night  
There was no need to rush  
Thats when those cops  
Came pulling up  
And I thought  
Man aint this some shhhh  
  
Your daddys gonna kill me  
But if I survive tonight  
I wouldnt change one thing  
Baby yeah  
I know it sounds crazy  
  
But there was somethin bout the way  
The blue lights were shinin  
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes  
I was too busy watching you  
Going wild child  
To be worried about going to jail  
You were thinking that  
Running for it  
Would make a good story  
I was thinking you were crazy as hell  
And you were so  
Innocent  
But you were stealing my heart  
I fell in love in the back of a cop car  
  
Man they werent playin  
They sure threw those cuffs on quick  
You tried to sweet talk em  
They didnt fall for it  
But I did  
You were on the left  
I was on the right  
I knew you didnt smoke  
When you asked him for a light  
And I laughed  
He got mad and slammed the door  
  
Your daddys gonna kill me  
But if I survive tonight  
I wouldnt change one thing  
Baby yeah  
I know it sounds crazy  
  
But there was somethin bout the way  
The blue lights were shinin  
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes  
I was too busy watching you  
Going wild child  
To be worried about going to jail  
You were thinking that  
Running for it  
Would make a good story  
I was thinking you were crazy as hell  
And you were so  
Innocent  
But you were stealing my heart  
I fell in love in the back of a cop car  
  
Side by side  
And locked in tight  
They were taking their time  
But we didnt mind  
  
We talked  
And we laughed  
We sat real close  
By the time they let us go  
I was already gone  
  
But there was somethin bout the way  
The blue lights were shinin  
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes  
I was too busy watching you  
Going wild child  
To be worried about going to jail  
You were thinking that  
Running for it  
Would make a good story  
I was thinking you were crazy as hell  
And you were so  
Innocent  
But you were stealing my heart  
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
