Chorus  
Its in the way that you use it  
It comes and it goes  
Its in the way that you use it  
Boy dont you know  
  
And if you lie you will lose it  
Feelings will show  
So dont you ever abuse it  
Dont let it go  
  
Nobodys right till somebodys wrong  
Nobodys weak till somebodys strong  
No one gets lucky till luck comes along  
Nobodys lonely till somebodys gone  
  
Chorus x2  
  
And if you lie you will lose it  
Feelings will show  
So dont you ever abuse it  
Dont let it go  
  
Ive seen dark skies never like this  
Walked on some thin ice never like this  
Ive told you white lies never like this  
Looked into true eyes never like this  
  
Chorus
