Hello its late  
You know Ive tried to stop the rain  
Did you read about it  
Did you think about it  
Did you cry but nothing came  
  
Hello its late  
I know we tried to win the game  
Did you hear about it  
Did you dream about it  
I know you cried but nothing changed  
Nothing matters again  
I didnt think itd last that long  
But Im just sittin on this merrygoround  
And the music is too loud  
  
Its just a game  
That we used to play  
I didnt think wed  
Take it all the way  
It kills me just because  
It cant be erased  
Were married
