When I come home its late I feel so all alone  
What was my mistake baby why dont you care at all  
Well if its just a change in you Ill adjust  
But if youre true give me a sign of your trust  
And am I supposed to be true to you  
  
Dont keep me wonderin do I still have your love  
Dont keep me wonderin if youve given up  
  
When I come to bed youre there but I feel so all alone  
What can I do short of sleepin on the floor  
I might be slow girl but Im not dumb  
The question arises am I the only one  
And am I supposed to be in love with you  
  
Dont keep me wonderin do I still have your love  
Dont keep me wonderin have you given up  
Dont you keep me baby  
  
I might be slow girl Im not dumb  
The question arises am I the only one  
And am I supposed to be in love with you  
  
Dont keep me wonderin do I still have your love  
Dont keep me wonderin have you given up  
Dont keep me wonderin do I still have your love  
Dont keep me wonderin have you given up  
Dont you give up baby
