How many times have you tried to pull one over on me  
Always mess with me and try to get the best of me  
Lookin back all the pain that you put me through  
Why would i fall for a fool like you  
Now youre talkin like Ive never played the game before  
Save your empty words cause I dont want to hear no more  
Basically youre trying to take control of me  
But youre not what i want to be  
  
I know everything about you  
Yesterday has come and gone  
Id be better off without you  
No lookin back Im moving on  
  
Youll never steal the song of my lips  
Ill never bow down to give you a kiss no  
Youll never steal my innocence  
Youve been dismissed  
Do your best to try to pull me down  
Im never going back even if I see you around no  
No Im never going down like this  
Youve been dismissed  
  
Let me break it down one more time  
No youre never gonna change my mind  
That was thenm this is now things are different no  
Oh youre not what Im livin for  
  
I know everything about you  
Its funny how the tables turned  
Id be better off without you  
Now youre the one whos gettin burned  
  
Youll never steal the song of my lips  
Ill never bow down to give you a kiss no  
Youll never steal my innocence  
Youve been dismissed  
Do your best to try to pull me down  
Im never going back even if I see you around no  
No Im never going down like this  
Youve been dismissed  
  
On a falling star you got to where you are  
And you think youve got the right to own my heart  
But my affection doesnt lie in your direction  
You want to hold me with a lock and key  
Cover my eyes so i cannot see  
But in the end we all know who wins  
You are over over over  
  
Youll never steal the song of my lips  
Ill never bow down to give you a kiss no  
Youll never steal my innocence  
Youve been dismissed  
Do your best to try to pull me down  
Im never going back even if I see you around no  
No Im never going down like this  
Youve been dismissed
