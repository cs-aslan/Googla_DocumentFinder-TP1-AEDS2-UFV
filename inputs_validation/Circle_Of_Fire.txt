We came together in 1982  
Through stormy weather we sang the blues  
You and me baby in a circle of fire  
Ive had my troubles you had yours  
Weve had those feeling but weve endured  
You and me baby in a circle of fire  
River of passion  
River of love  
You and me babe  
Its a lovers moon and the stars are out  
Were living stories that love writes about  
And Im caught in the heat of passions womb  
And Im drawn in close like the tides to the moon  
Its a lovers moon and the stars are out  
Were living stories that love writes about  
And Im caught in the heat of passions womb  
And Im drawn in close like the tides to the moon  
The river is wide  
The river is deep  
The river is swift  
But its oh so sweet  
You and me baby in a circle of fire  
Just you and me baby in a circle of fire  
Just you and me baby in a circle of fire  
And Im burnin  
Feel me burnin in a circle of fire
