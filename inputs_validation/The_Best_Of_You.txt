Ive got another confession to make  
Im your fool  
Everyones got their chains to break  
Holdin you  
  
Were you born to resist or be abused  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
  
Are you gone and onto someone new  
I needed somewhere to hang my head  
Without your noose  
You gave me something that I didnt have  
But had no use  
I was too weak to give in  
Too strong to lose  
My heart is under arrest again  
But I break loose  
My head is giving me life or death  
But I cant choose  
I swear Ill never give in  
I refuse  
  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Has someone taken your faith  
Its real the pain you feel  
You trust you must  
Confess  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Oh  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Has someone taken your faith  
Its real the pain you feel  
The life the love  
You die to heal  
The hope that starts  
The broken hearts  
You trust you must  
Confess  
  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
  
Ive got another confession my friend  
Im no fool  
Im getting tired of starting again  
Somewhere new  
  
Were you born to resist or be abused  
I swear Ill never give in  
I refuse  
  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Has someone taken your faith  
Its real the pain you feel  
You trust you must  
Confess  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Oh
