Legalized theft  
Leaves me bereft  
I get it straight in the neck  
Somehow expecting no less  
A court of justice  
With no use for truth  
Lawyerliar  
Lawyerliar  
You pleaded and squealed  
And you think youve won  
But sorrow will come  
To you in the end  
And as sure as my words are pure  
I praise the day that brings you pain  
QCs obsessed with sleaze  
Frantic for fame  
Theyre all on the game  
They just use a different name  
You lied  
And you were believed  
By a JP senile and vile  
You pleaded and squealed  
And you think youve won  
But sorrow will come  
To you in the end  
And as sure as my words are pure  
I praise the day that brings you pain  
So dont close your eyes  
Dont close your eyes  
A man who slits throats  
Has time on his hands  
And Im gonna get you  
So dont close your eyes  
Dont ever close your eyes  
You think youve won  
Oh no
