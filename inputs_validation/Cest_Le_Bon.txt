I never knew what a man was supposed to be  
I never wanted the responsibility  
I still remember what they tried to make of me  
They used to wonder what they couldnt get through to me  
  
Cause all that I had as this music  
Acoming to me  
And all that I had was this rhythm  
Arunning through me  
  
I took a tip from the man in the ministry  
He said My son better work in the factory  
Well there were days I can tell you quite honestly  
I saw myself winding up in the military  
  
So lucky to have all this music  
Acoming to me  
Im lucky to have all this rhythm  
Arunning through me  
  
Im watching the movie go down  
Around about me  
Im watching the merrygoround  
Go down about me  
  
I said Lovers youre needed in the garden  
Cause theres a lot of crazy people  
Whove forgotten where their heart is  
And they dont give a damn  
About hurting those flowers and those trees  
Cest bon sailing on and on  
  
Sometimes I wonder where my life is taking me  
Sometimes I wonder what they all expect of me  
Well there were days I can tell you quite honestly  
I saw myself winding up in the monastery  
  
Cause all that I have is this music  
Acoming to me  
And all that I have is this rhythm  
Arunning through me  
  
Im watching the movie go down  
Around about me  
Im watching the merrygoround  
Go down about me  
  
I said Lovers youre needed in the garden  
Cause theres a lot of crazy people  
Whove forgotten where their heart is  
And they dont give a damn  
About hurting that small child in me  
Cest le bon sailing on and on
