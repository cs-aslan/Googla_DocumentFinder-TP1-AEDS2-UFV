Some humans aint human  
Some people aint kind  
You open up their hearts  
And heres what youll find  
A few frozen pizzas  
Some ice cubes with hair  
A broken Popsicle  
You dont want to go there  
  
Some humans aint human  
Though they walk like we do  
They live and they breathe  
Just to turn the old screw  
They screw you when youre sleeping  
They try to screw you blind  
Some humans aint human  
Some people aint kind  
  
You might go to church  
And sit down in a pew  
Those humans who aint human  
Could be sittin right next to you  
They talk about your family  
They talk about your clothes  
When they dont know their own ass  
From their own elbows  
  
Jealousy and stupidity  
Dont equal harmony  
Jealousy and stupidity  
Dont equal harmony

Have you ever noticed  
When youre feeling really good  
Theres always a pigeon  
Thatll come shit on your hood  
  
Or youre feeling your freedom  
And the worlds off your back  
Some cowboy from Texas  
Starts his own war in Iraq  
  
Some humans aint human  
Some people aint kind  
They lie through their teeth  
With their head up their behind  
You open up their hearts  
And heres what youll find  
Some humans aint human  
Some people aint kind  
  
Repeat x4  
Mm Mm
