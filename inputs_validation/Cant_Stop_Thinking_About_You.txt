Cant stop thinking about you  
Cant stop thinking about you  
Its no good living without you  
I cant stop thinking about you  
  
Cant stop thinking about you  
Cant stop thinking about you  
And its no good living without you  
I cant stop thinking about you  
  
When the nighttime comes around  
Daylight has left me I  
I cant take it if I dont see you no more  
I cant help it I need your loving so much more  
  
And I cant stop thinking about you  
Cant stop thinking about you  
And its no good living without you  
I cant stop thinking about  
I cant stop thinking about  
I cant stop thinking about you ooh  
  
Cant stop thinking about  
Cant stop thinking about  
Cant stop thinking about you  
  
When the morning comes around  
And the daylight gets to me I  
I cant take it if I dont see you no more  
I cant help it I need your loving so much more  
  
And I cant stop thinking about you oh yeah  
I cant stop thinking about you  
And its no good living without you  
I cant stop thinking about  
I cant stop thinking about  
I cant stop thinking about you  
  
I cant stop thinking about  
Cant stop thinking about  
Cant stop thinking about you  
  
repeat and fade  
I cant stop thinking about  
I cant stop thinking about  
I cant stop thinking about you
