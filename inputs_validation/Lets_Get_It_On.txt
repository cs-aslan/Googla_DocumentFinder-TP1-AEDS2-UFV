Ive been really tryin baby  
Tryin to hold back this feeling for so long  
And if you feel like I feel baby  
Then cmon oh cmon  
Lets get it on  
Ah baby lets get it on  
Lets love baby  
Lets get it on sugar  
Lets get it on  
Were all sensitive people  
With so much to give  
Understand me sugar  
Since weve to be here  
Lets live  
I love you  
Theres nothing wrong with me  
Loving you baby no no  
And giving yourself to me can never be wrong  
If the love is true  
Dont you know how sweet and wonderful life can be  
Im asking you baby to get it on with me  
I aint gonna worry  
I aint gonna push wont push you baby  
So cmon cmon cmon cmon cmon baby  
Stop beatin round the bush  
Lets get it on
