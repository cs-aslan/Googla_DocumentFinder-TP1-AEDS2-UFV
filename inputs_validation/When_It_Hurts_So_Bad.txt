Whys it feel so good when it hurts so bad

I loved real real hard once  
But the love wasnt returned  
Found out the man Id die for  
He wasnt even concerned  
I tried and I tried and I tried  
To keep him in my life to keep him in my life  
I cried and I cried and I cried  
But I couldnt make it right  
  
But I I loved the young man  
And if you ever been in love  
Then youd understand  
  
That what you want might make you cry  
What you need might pass you by  
If you dont catch it if you dont catch it  
if you dont catch it  
  
And what you need ironically  
Will turn out what you want to be  
If you just let it if you just let it  
If you just let it if you just let it  
  
See I thought this feeling  
It was all that I had  
But how could this be love  
And make me feel so bad gave up my power  
Gave up my power  
I existed for you  
But whoever knew  
The voodoo youd do  
  
But I I loved the young man  
And if you ever been in love  
Then youd understand  
  
What you want might make you cry  
What you need might pass you by  
If you dont catch it if you dont you dont  
if you dont you dont  
  
And what you need ironically  
Will turn out what you want to be  
If you just let it if you dont you dont  
If you just let it if you dont you dont  
  
See what you want might make you cry  
What you need might pass you by  
If you dont catch it if you dont you dont  
if you dont you dont  
  
And what you need ironically  
Will turn out what you want to be  
If you just let it  
If you just let it
