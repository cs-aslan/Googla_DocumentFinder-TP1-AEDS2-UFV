I was up in the morning with the TV blarin  
brush my teeth sittin watchin the news  
All the beaches were closed the ocean was a Red Sea  
but there was no one there to part it in two  
There was no fresh salad because theres hypos in the cabbage  
Staten Island disappeared at noon  
And they say the midwest is in great distress  
and NASA blew up the moon  
The ozone layer has no ozone anymore  
and youre gonna leave me for the guy next door  
Im Sick of You  
They arrested the Mayor for an illegal favor  
sold the Empire State to Japan  
And Oliver North married William Secord  
and gave birth to a little Teheran  
And the Ayatollah bought a nuclear warhead  
if he dies he wants to go out in style  
And theres nothing to eat that dont carry the stink  
of some human waste dumped in the Nile  
Well one thing is certainly true  
no one here knows what to do  
Im Sick of You  
The radio said there were 400 dead  
in some small town in Arkansas  
Some whacked out trucker  
drove into a nuclear reactor  
and killed everybody he saw  
Now hes on Morton Downey  
and hes glowing and shining  
doctors say this is a medical advance  
They say the bad makes the good  
and theres something to be learned  
in every human experience  
Well I know one thing that really is true  
This heres a zoo and the keeper aint you  
And Im sick of it Im Sick of You  
They ordained the Trumps  
and then he got the mumps  
and died being treated at Mt Sinai  
And my best friend Bill  
died from a poison pill  
some wired doctor prescribed for stress  
My arms and legs are shrunk  
the food all has lumps  
They discovered some animal no ones ever seen  
It was an inside trader eating a rubber tire  
after running over Rudy Giuliani  
They say the Presidents dead  
but no one can find his head  
Its been missing now for weeks  
But no one noticed it  
he has seemed so fit  
and Im Sick of it
