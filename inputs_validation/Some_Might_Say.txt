Some might say that sunshine follows thunder  
Go and tell it to the man who cannot shine  
Some might say that we should never ponder  
On our thoughts today cos they hold sway over time  
  
Some might say we will find a brighter day  
Some might say we will find a brighter day  
  
Cos Ive been standing at the station  
In need of education in the rain  
You made no preparation for my reputation once again  
The sink is full of fishes  
Shes got dirty dishes on the brain  
It was overflowing gently but its all elementary my friend  
  
Some might say they dont believe in heaven  
Go and tell it to the man who lives in hell  
Some might say you get what youve been given  
If you dont get yours I wont get mine as well  
  
Some might say we will find a brighter day  
Some might say we will find a brighter day  
  
Cos Ive been standing at the station  
In need of education in the rain  
You made no preparation for my reputation once again  
The sink is full of fishes  
Cos shes got dirty dishes on the brain  
And my dogs been itchin  
Itchin in the kitchen once again  
  
Some might say Some might say  
Some might say Some might say  
You know what some might say  
You know what some might say  
You know what some might say  
You know what some might say  
You know what some might say  
You know what some might say  
You know what some might say  
You know what some might say
