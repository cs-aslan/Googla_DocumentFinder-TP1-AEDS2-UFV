Well hello whats your name  
Can I take you by the hand  
Wont you please come with me  
To a place of ecstasy  
Paradise by the sun  
Girl Im sure well have some fun  
By your eyes I can see  
That you want to be with me  
Ive been waiting for so long  
Now that Ive found you  
Aint no way Im gonna let you go  
  
Chorus  
Let me inside  
Open up your heart  
Come on and  
Let me inside  
Open up your heart  
  
Night is clear moon is bright  
Stars are shining everywhere  
In my arms youll be safe  
Theres no need to be afraid  
Its a warm summer night  
And the temperature is right  
Let your hair hang low  
Girl I want to feel the flow  
Ive been waiting for so long  
Now that Ive got you  
Aint no way Im gonna let you go  
  
Chorus
