Thought youd relate every will  
Perish it  
Your chocolate soul  
Help us wrong  
Deny your past  
  
Ive got pictures on my mind  
Ive got pictures on my mind  
Ive got pictures on my mind  
Ive got pictures on my mind  
  
Circumvent your Tiki doll  
When in fights  
Theyre on the go  
  
Ive got pictures on my mind  
Ive got pictures on my mind  
Ive got pictures on my mind  
Ive got pictures on my mind  
  
When the present can be sealed  
Away  
Cold rust  
For the mighty conquered meal  
  
Fair ways  
For us  
When the present can be sealed  
  
Away  
Cold rust  
For the mighty conquered meal  
  
Cant you look at my shamed ass  
Now shes gone and got us once  
You cant see me Saturday  
  
Ive got pictures on my mind  
Ive got pictures on my mind  
Ive got pictures on my mind  
Ive got pictures on my mind  
Ive got pictures on my mind
