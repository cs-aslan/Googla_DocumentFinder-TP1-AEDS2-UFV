Study war no more  
Lay down your arms  
Study war no more  
Lay em down lay em down now  
Study war no more  
Lay down your arms  
Study war no more  
  
Newsreels rattle the Nazi dread  
The ablebodied have shipped away  
Molly McGee gets her tealeaves read  
Youll be married in a month they say  
These leaves are crazy  
Look at this towntheres no men left  
Just frail old boys and babies  
Talking to teacher in the treble clef  
  
She plants her garden in the spring  
She does the winter shoveling  
Tokyo rose on the radio  
She says shes leavin but she dont go  
  
Out of the blue just passin through  
A young flight sergeant  
On two weeks leave  
Says Molly McGee no one else will do  
And seals the tealeaf prophecy  
Oh these nights are strong and soft  
Private passions and secret storms  
Nothin about him ticks her off  
And he looks so cute in his uniform  
  
She plants her garden in the spring  
He does the winter shoveling  
But summers just a sneeze  
In a longlongbadwinter cold  
She says Im leavin here but she dont go  
  
Sleep little darlin  
This is your happy home  
Hiroshima cannot be pardoned  
Dont have kids when you get grown  
Because this world is shattered  
The wise are mourning  
The fools are joking  
Oh what does it matter  
The wash needs ironing  
And the fire needs stoking  
  
She plants her garden in the spring  
He does the winter shoveling  
The three of em laughing round the radio  
She says Im leavin here but she dont go  
  
She plants her garden in the spring  
They do the winter shoveling  
They sit up late and watch the  
Johnny Carson show  
She says Im leavin here but she dont go
