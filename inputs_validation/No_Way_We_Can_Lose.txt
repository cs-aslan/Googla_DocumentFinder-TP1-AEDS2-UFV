There can be no answer for us all  
There can be no stopping what is ever changing  
Living for the perfect dream  
Its time to make a resolution  
There will be some peace in our hearts and our minds  
  
Chorus  
We can all find a way to resolve our differences  
Theres no way we can lose  
When we all realize that there are no differences  
Theres no way we can lose  
  
Ready or not  
We can all find a way  
  
We will be forgiving to the ones we love  
We will see the blossoming of the new spirit  
Shaping everything to our design  
Well build a brighter future  
We will free ourselves from the chains that would bind  
  
Chorus  
We can all find a way to resolve our differences  
Theres no way we can lose  
When we all realize that there are no differences  
Theres no way we can lose  
No way we can lose  
  
Ready or not Repeat x1  
  
Theres no way we can lose  
  
We can all find a way  
Ready or not Repeat x1  
  
Chorus  
We can all find a way to resolve our differences  
Theres no way we can lose  
When we all realize that there are no differences  
Theres no way we can lose  
No way we can lose  
  
Ready or not Repeat x2  
  
No way we can lose
