When you give it up you get it on  
What happened to you yeah  
From the beginning I knew what I was getting  
But I was with it and Ill admit that  
She was clear it was a kinda thing  
It wouldnt be easy for me to let it go  
For my time I got money but money dont buy time  
I got a head some got left behind  
The world is yours just sign this dotted line  
  
And in no time I hear money clothes fancy cars  
Big old cribs platinum on the wall seven Grammys  
Sold out concerts damn Ive been working hard  
Private jets to France many women  
I didnt have a ball  
You can say Ive made it  
But Ive faded cause I miss you  
Can we go back  
But the issue is time we cant get back  
What happened to you yeah come back  
Cause I miss you can we go back  
What happened to you  
What happened to you  
  
Did what I wanted freaked all the honeys  
I stayed only mine mind was on the money  
Had whatever whenever heart throb forever  
Black young and clever  
  
When you give it up you get it on  
Love would be the only reason to look back  
And once you turn it on you cant turn it off  
But picture me complaining with all this  
  
Money clothes fancy cars  
Big old cribs platinum on the wall seven Grammys  
Sold out concerts damn Ive been working hard  
Private jets to France many women  
I didnt have a ball  
You can say Ive made it  
But Im faded cause I miss you  
Can we go back  
But the issue is time we cant get back  
What happened to you yeah come back  
Cause I miss you can we go back  
What happened to you  
What happened to you  
  
What sense does it make to have everything and nothing  
At the same time  
Where are you  
I need you yeah  
Im looking for you  
Girl come and share all this  
  
Money clothes fancy cars  
Big old cribs platinum on the wall seven Grammys  
Sold out concerts damn Ive been working hard  
Private jets to France many women  
I didnt have a ball  
You can say Ive made it  
But Im faded cause I miss you  
Can we go back  
But the issue is time we cant get back  
What happened to you yeah come back  
Cause I miss you can we go back  
What happened to you  
Im happy for you wherever you are
