The truth about love comes at 3am  
You wake up fucked up and you grab a pen  
And you say to yourself  
Im gonna figure it out Im gonna crack that code  
Gonna break it break it down  
Im tired of all these questions  
And now its just annoying  
Cause no one has the answer  
So I guess its up to me  
To find the truth about love  
As it comes and it goes  
A strange fascination with his lips and toes  
Morning breath bedroom eyes on a smiling face  
Sheet marks rug burn and a sugar glaze  
The shock and the awe that can eat you raw  
If the truth about love  
  
I think it just may be perfect  
Youre the person of my dreams  
I never ever ever ever been this happy  
But now something has changed  
And The Truth About Love is its all a lie  
I thought you were the one and I hate goodbyes  
  
Oh you want the truth  
  
The truth about love is its nasty and salty  
Its the regret in the morning its the smelling of armpits  
Its wings and songs  
And trees and birds  
Its all the poetry that you ever heard  
Terror coup detat life line forgetmenots  
Its the hunt and the kill  
The schemes and the plots  
The truth about love is its blood and its guts  
Purebreds and mutts  
Sandwiches without the crust  
It takes your breath cause it leaves a scar  
But those untouched never got never got very far  
Its rage and its hate  
And a sick twist of fate  
And thats the truth about love  
The truth about love  
  
I think it just may be perfect  
Youre the person of my dreams  
I never ever ever ever been this happy  
But now something has changed  
And The Truth About Love is its all a lie  
I thought you were the one and I hate goodbyes  
  
Oh you can lose your breath and  
Oh you can shoot a gun and  
Convince youre the only one thats ever felt this way before  
It hurts inside the hurt within and  
It folds together pocket thin and  
Its whispered by the angels lips and  
It can turn you into a son of a bitch man
