Sail down the stream  
Such a beautiful dream  
Never stopping  
Never touching anything  
Till dawn awakes you  
With a breath of the Spring  
  
Far from the crowds  
Way above the clouds  
We can take you to  
The edge of the day  
And show you living in  
A new kind of way  
  
Well take you floating to  
A sea of morning dew  
Where everyones the same  
And noone knows your name  
And there youll see that you can  
Live your life to the extreme  
Such a beautiful dream
