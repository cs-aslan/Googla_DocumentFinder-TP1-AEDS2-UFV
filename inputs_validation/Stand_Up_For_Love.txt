Baby weve been in and out of love so many times  
We keep reaching the end of the line and giving up on each other  
And darling I dont think we can survive one more goodbye  
Cant cry one more tear or lie one more lie  
We got one last chance to make it  
But thats all we need if we just take it  
  
Chorus  
Baby we gotta stand up for love gotta hold on  
Cause I know what we got is worth fighting for  
And I know for sure right or wrong this is where we belong  
Baby this time we gotta stand up for love stand together  
Cant settle for less than forever  
I know theres nothing we cant rise above  
If we just stand up for love  
  
Baby after everything we put each other through  
And no matter what damage we do we still need one another  
And sometimes when I hold you in my arms somehow I see  
As bad as weve been thats how good we can be  
But we cant just say we want it  
Gotta lay all our tomorrows on it  
  
Chorus  
  
For all the dues weve paid  
The magic we two have made  
For all weve meant to one another  
Once and for all weve gotta stand up for each other  
  
Baby we gotta stand up for love gotta hold on  
Cause we know what we got is worth fighting for  
And we know for sure right or wrong  
Baby this time we gotta stand up for love now or never  
Cant settle for less than forever  
I know theres nothing we cant rise above  
If we just stand up for love
