Some people aint no damn good  
You cant trust em you cant love em  
No good deed goes unpunished  
And I dont mind being their whipping boy  
Ive had that pleasure for years and years  
No no I never was a sinnertell me what else can I do  
Second best is what you gettill you learn to bend this rules  
Time respects no personwhat you lift up must fall  
Theyre waiting outsideto claim my crumblin walls  
  
Saw my picture in the paper  
Read the news around my face  
And now some people  
Dont want to treat me the same  
  
When the walls come tumblin down  
When the walls come crumblin crumblin  
When the walls come tumblin tumblin down  
  
Some people say Im obnoxious and lazy  
That Im uneducated and my opinion means nothin  
But I know Im a real good dancer  
Dont need to look over my shoulder to see what Im after  
Everybodys got their problemsaint no new news here  
Im the same old trouble youve been having for years  
Dont confuse the problem with the issue girl  
Cause its perfectly clear  
  
Just a human desire to have you come near  
Want to put my arms around you  
Feel your breath in my ear  
You can bend me you can break me  
But you better stand clear  
  
When the walls come tumblin down  
When the walls come crumblin crumblin  
When the walls come tumblin tumblin down
