Baby you drive me so crazy  
Baby you drive me so crazy  
Baby you drive me so mad  
You got me running round town  
Like a woman on a warpath

Got me rooted in the ground like an old oak tree  
Its so good cant you see  
That youve go the magic to set me free  
  
Baby you drive me so crazy  
Baby you drive me so crazy

You got the hands to make em all buckle and blush  
Blood runs fast yeah you make it rush  
Im gonna live forever and it hurts so much  
  
Baby you drive me so crazy  
Baby you drive me so crazy  
Baby you drive me so mad  
You got me running round town  
Like a woman on a warpath  
  
There was a time when you were howlin over me  
But then the darkness fell  
And now you sail the sea  
  
Baby you drive me so crazy  
Baby you drive me so crazy  
Baby you drive me so mad  
You got me running round town  
Like a woman on a warpath  
  
Baby you drive me so crazy  
Baby you drive me so crazy

You got me running round town  
Like a woman on a warpath  
Baby you drive me so mad
