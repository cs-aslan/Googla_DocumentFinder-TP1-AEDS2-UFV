I left you some kisses on the door  
Your mama says I cant see you the judge says that its right  
We cant be together cause me and mommie fights  
But youre my little girl and daddy loves you more and more  
  
And I left you some kisses on the door  
I came by to see you but mommie just said no  
I knocked but mommie saw me as she peeked through the hole  
I only want to hold you honey mommie thinks its war  
But I left you some kisses on the door  
  
You know your daddy worries honey but its not mamas fault  
You do what your mommie says you know that shes the boss  
No matter what I gave you mommie thought you needed more  
But I left you some kisses on the door  
  
Hey youre my little angel babe and it dont make much sense  
To only get to watch you play through that old schoolyard fence  
Someday youll come to me sweetheart thats all Im waitin for  
Cause I left you some kisses on the door
