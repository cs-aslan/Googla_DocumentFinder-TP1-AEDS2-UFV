Look at the sky baby  
What do you see  
Looks like the tears that I cry  
Fallin down like rain on the ground  
Every time you say goodbye  
  
Take a look around now  
Why dont you feel  
The way that cold wind stings and bites  
And your words just are like arrows through my heart  
Every time you say goodbye  
  
Theres a restless feeling knocking at my door today  
Theres a shadow hanging round my garden gate  
I read between the lines of words you cant disguise  
Love has gone away and put these tears in my eyes  
  
Look at the sky baby see how it cries  
Aint it just like my tears  
Fallin down like rain on the ground  
Every time you say goodbye  
  
Theres a restless feeling knocking at my door today  
Theres a shadow hanging round my garden gate  
I read between the lines of words you cant disguise  
Love has gone away and put these tears in my eyes  
  
Theres a restless feeling knocking at my door today  
Theres a shadow hanging round my garden gate  
I read between the lines of words you cant disguise  
Love has gone away and put these tears in my eyes
