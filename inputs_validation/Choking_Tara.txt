Days into weeks  
She rattled my mind  
We stayed out all week  
And got happy this time  
She fills empty space  
I kinda need it that way  
Crybaby says bye to me  
I cant imagine that all our troubles will go away  
But I could catch her and break the falls  
I could snatch her with breaks and claws  
Today when every fake it  
Decides to make it  
They just cant take it away  
Shove it cus Ill just stay  
Like an ugly unwanted stray  
Dont care what you say  
intermission  
no more skinny cheeks  
And distributors of poison
