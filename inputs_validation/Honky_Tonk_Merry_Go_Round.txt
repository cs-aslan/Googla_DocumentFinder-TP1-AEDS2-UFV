Im on a honky tonk merrygoround  
Makin ever spot in town  
Startin out early comin home late  
Ever night with a brand new date  
  
Im on a honky tonk merrygoround  
Actin like a foolish clown  
Still racin those blues that you left with me  
Wondrin if Ill ever be free  
  
Chorus  
Round and around and around I go  
Ridin high and feelin low  
Round and around just like a top  
Well Im agettin dizzy but I cant stop  
  
Im on a honky tonk merrygoround  
Actin like a foolish clown  
Still racin those blues that you left with me  
Wondrin if Ill ever be free  
  
Chorus  
  
Im on a honky tonk merrygoround  
Actin like a foolish clown  
Still racin those blues that you left with me  
Wondrin if Ill ever be free  
  
Yes Im wonderin if Ill ever be free
