Hollis Brown  
He lived on the outside of town  
Hollis Brown  
He lived on the outside of town  
With his wife and five children  
And his cabin broken down  
Where you looked for work and money  
And you walked a rugged mile  
You looked for work and money  
And you walked a rugged mile  
Your children are so hungry  
That they dont know how to smile  
Your babys eyes look crazy  
Theyre atuggin at your sleeve  
Your babys eyes look crazy  
Theyre atuggin at your sleeve  
You walk the floor and wonder why  
With every breath you breathe  
The rats have got your flour  
Bad blood it got your mare  
The rats have got your flour  
Bad blood it got your mare  
Is there anyone who knows  
Is there anyone who cares  
So you prayed to the Lord above  
Please send you a friend  
Yes you prayed to the Lord above  
Please send you a friend  
But your empty pockets tell you  
That you aint got no friends  
Your babies are cryin louder now  
Its poundin in your brain  
Your babies are cryin louder now  
Its poundin in your brain  
Your wifes screams are stabbin you  
Like the dirty drivin rain  
Your grass is turnin black  
Theres no water in your well  
Your grass is turnin black  
Theres no water in your well  
You spent your last dollar  
On seven shotgun shells  
Way out in the wilderness  
A cold coyote calls  
Way out in the wilderness  
A cold coyote calls  
Your eyes fix on the shotgun  
Thats hangin on the wall  
Your brain is ableedin now  
Your legs cant seem to stand  
Your brain is ableedin now  
Your legs cant seem to stand  
Your eyes fix on the shotgun  
That youre holdin in your hand  
Theres seven breezes blowin  
All around the cabin door  
Theres seven breezes blowin  
All around the cabin door  
Seven shots ring out  
Like the oceans poundin roar  
Theres seven people dead  
On a south Dakota farm  
Theres seven people dead  
On a south Dakota farm  
Somewhere in the distance  
Seven new people are born
