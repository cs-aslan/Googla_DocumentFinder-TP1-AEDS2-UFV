Up and down the puppies hair  
Fleas and ticks jump everywhere  
Cause of original sin  
  
Down the hill fell Jack and Jill  
And you came tumbling after  
Cause of original sin  
  
Rip away the tears  
Drink a hope for happy years  
And you may find  
A lifetimes passed you by  
  
What would you say  
If you a monkey on a string  
If you a doggie on a chain  
What would you say  
  
I was there when the bear  
Ate his head thought it was a candy  
Everyone goes in the end  
  
Knock knock on the door  
Whos it for nobody in here  
Look in the mirror my friend  
  
I dont understand at best  
I cannot speak for all the rest  
In the morning rise a lifetimes passed me by  
  
What would you say  
dont drop the big one  
If you a monkey on a string  
Dont cut my life line  
If you a doggie on a chain  
Dont bite the mailman  
What would you say  
  
Every dog has its day every day has its way  
Of being forgotten Mom its my birthday  
  
What would you say  
dont drop the big one  
If you a monkey on a string  
Dont cut my life line  
If you a doggie on a chain  
Dont bite the mailman  
What would you say
