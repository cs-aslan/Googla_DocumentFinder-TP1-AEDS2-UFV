I saw you yesterday  
I was not phased I did not care  
You you turned and walked away  
As if I was not even there  
  
I dont know you dont know  
We dont know why  
I tell myself like these little white lies  
These little white lies  
Like I dont miss you  
I tell myself these little white lies  
These little white lies  
And I just walk around  
With my eyes closed Repeat x3  
  
I dont miss you all that much  
Dont miss your kiss dont miss your touch  
Im so happy to be free  
I dont need you you dont need me  
  
If you dont care then I dont care  
Please tell my why  
I tell myself these little white lies  
These little white lies  
Like I dont miss you  
I tell myself these little white lies  
These little white lies  
And I just walk around  
With my eyes closed Repeat x4  
  
I tell myself these little white lies  
These little white lies  
Like I dont miss you  
I tell myself these little white lies  
These little white lies  
Like I dont love you  
  
I tell myself these little white lies  
These little white lies  
Like I dont miss you  
I tell myself these little white lies  
These little white lies  
And I just walk around  
With my eyes closed Repeat x8
