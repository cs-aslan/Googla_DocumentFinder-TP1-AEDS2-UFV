Well I met my little blueeyed dog  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
Well I met my little blueeyed dog  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
Well I asked him for a little kiss  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
Well I asked him for a little kiss  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
I said have patience little man  
But Im sure youll understand  
I hardly know your name  
You said If I can have my way  
But it maybe some sweet day  
Your name and my will be the same  
Well I wed that little blueeyed dog  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
Well I wed that little blueeyed dog  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside
