The sanest days are mad  
Why dont you find out for yourself  
Then youll see the price  
Very closely  
  
Some men here  
They have a special interest  
In your career  
They want to help you to grow  
And then siphon all your dough  
Why dont you find out for yourself  
Then youll see the glass  
Hidden in the grass  
  
Youll never believe me so  
Why dont you find out for yourself  
Sick down to my heart  
Thats just the way it goes  
  
Some men here  
They know the full extent of  
Your distress  
They kneel and pray  
And they say  
Long may it last  
  
Why dont you find out for yourself  
Then youll see the glass  
Hidden in the grass  
Bad scenes come and go  
For which you must allow  
Sick down to my heart  
Thats just the way it goes  
  
Dont rake up my mistakes  
I know exactly what they are  
And what do you do  
Well you just sit there  
Ive been stabbed in the back  
So many many times  
I dont have any skin  
But thats just the way it goes
