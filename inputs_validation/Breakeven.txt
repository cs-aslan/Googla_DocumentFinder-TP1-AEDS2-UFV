Im still alive but Im barely breathing  
Just prayin to a god that I dont believe in  
Cause I got time while she got freedom  
Cause when a heart breaks no it dont break even  
  
Her best days will be some of my worst  
She finally met a man thats gonna put her first  
While Im wide awake shes no trouble sleeping  
Cause when a heart breaks no it dont break even even no  
  
What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you  
And what am I supposed to say when Im all choked up and youre OK  
Im falling to pieces yeah  
Im falling to pieces  
  
They say bad things happen for a reason  
But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding  
Cause shes moved on while Im still grieving  
And when a heart breaks no it dont breakeven even no  
  
What am I gonna to do when the best part of me was always you  
And what am I supposed to say when Im all choked up and youre OK  
Im falling to pieces yeah  
Im falling to pieces yeah  
Im falling to pieces  
One still in love while the other ones leaving  
Im falling to pieces  
Cause when a heart breaks no it dont breakeven  
  
Oh you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain  
You took your suitcase I took the blame  
Now Im tryna make sense of what little remains ooh  
Cause you left me with no love and no love to my name  
  
Im still alive but Im barely breathing  
Just prayed to a god that I dont believe in  
Cause I got time while she got freedom  
Cause when a heart breaks no it dont break  
No it dont break  
No it dont breakeven no  
  
What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you and  
What am I suppose to say when Im all choked up and youre OK  
Oh glad your okay now  
Im falling to pieces yeah  
Im falling to pieces yeah  
Im falling to pieces  
One still in love while the other ones leaving  
Im falling to pieces yeah  
Cause when a heart breaks no it dont breakeven  
  
Oh it dont breakeven no  
Oh it dont breakeven no  
Oh it dont breakeven no
