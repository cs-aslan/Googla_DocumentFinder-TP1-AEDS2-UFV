Lightning in the sky  
Thunder on the ground  
Man and beast alike  
Seeking shelter from the storm  
All around there is fear in the air  
All around there is fear in the air  
  
Burning drops of rain  
Flood my thirsty soul  
Cold chills to the bone  
Glowing eyes filled with pain  
All around theres a cry no one hears  
All around theres a cry no one hears  
  
Always on the run  
Never taking time to see  
Beauty all around  
Natures dance is just for me  
All around Natures dance  
Just for me  
All around Natures dance  
Just for me  
  
Rainbows glowing high  
Evening shadows fall  
Dont you wait for me  
I wont be back for your call  
  
I am free from your spell I am free  
I am free from your spell I am free  
I am free from your spell I am free  
Free free free  
Free from your spell I am free
