Gangsters bangin nuts straight hanging  
Chillen in the allyway signs straight beemin  
Up in the air I hear they dont care  
Get your mutha fuckin melon busted for a stare  
Luv pumpin through the heart flowin through the veins  
Pop a mutha fucka like it aint no thang  
Blood shoot eyes from pufin on the bud  
Let me see that rag let me see that luv  
Roamin through the hood top cut down  
Car packed so full its fuckin on the ground  
Max with the homies spitten on the hoes  
Stop in the store for a cold 40  
Grabbin on your balls straight slanging stalls
