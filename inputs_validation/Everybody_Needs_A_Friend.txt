Trust in me Ill try to do  
Everything to help you that I can  
Broken wings can heal and mend again  
Dont be afraid to cry your tears out loud  
Everybody needs to have a friend  
  
Its only love that I can give  
And I give to you the only love I have  
When I see youre so unhappy  
It makes me want to try and understand  
Everybody needs a helping hand  
  
If everything should turn around  
And its me who feels so down and out  
You could be the kind of company  
To share a load and know how bad it feels  
Everybody needs to have a friend
