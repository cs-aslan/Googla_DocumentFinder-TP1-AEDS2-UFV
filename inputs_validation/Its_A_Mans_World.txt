Women theyre good for nothing no maybe one thing  
To serve needs to my dingaling  
Im a man who loves the onenight stand  
Cause after I do ya  
Huh I never knew ya  
Cause to kick it man it gives me the fits  
They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits  
Ice Cube wont wait so give it up cow  
After we do it you can go home now  
Im a brother with a big long  
  
First of all let me tell you my name its YoYo  
When down on a girl first the fist and thats a nono  
YoYo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in  
Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in  
No YoYos not a hoe or a whore  
And if thats what youre here for  
Exit through the door  
Theres more  
To see of me but youre blind so  
Women like me are fading brothers in the 90  
  
Ay what up buttercupper Miss YoYo  
I know you like to rap and like to flow so  
But when it comes to hiphop this is a mans world  
Stay down and play the playground you little girl  
  
What youre saying I dont consider it as rapping  
Cause youre on rewind and Im the new whatshappening  
It never fails Ill always get respect  
And you lose so take a rain check  
  
Hell no cause you know that Im first and youre second  
If it wasnt for me you probably be pregnant  
And barefoot complaining that your back is aching  
Shaking and faking while Im bringing home the bacon  
  
Well youre mistaken  
Its not going that far  
I make brothers like you play the back yard  
You used to flow with the title but I took it  
Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it  
  
Damn it look it  
Cause youre talking a lot of bull  
  
Well Im not your puppet so dont even try to pull  
  
This is a mans world thank you very much  
  
But it wouldnt be a damn thing without a womans touch  
  
Ah Miss YoYo so what gives  
I hear females always talkin about womens lib  
Well get your own crib  
And stay there  
Instead of having more babies for the welfare  
Cause if you dont Ill label you a gold digger  
The name is Ice Cube you know that I aint the nigga  
For you to look at when your hair get nappy  
So take a piece of the pole and be happy  
  
Hell no because to me youre not a thriller  
You come in the room with your threeinch killer  
Thinking you can do damage to my backbone  
Leave your child in the yard until its fullgrown  
Im a put it like this my man  
Without us your hand would be your best friend  
So give us credit like you know you should  
If I dont look good you dont look good  
  
I doubt it baby cause were still most dominant  
  
But you dont know how funky that I can get  
  
This is a mans world thank you very much  
  
But it wouldnt be a damn thing without a womans touch  
  
Man women I put a lot of fear in em  
Cause I had it up to here with em  
Drink a beer with em  
No way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day  
Yeah if you know what I mean baby  
  
Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe  
If you was more of a man instead of faking it  
Women deserve the credit when theyre making it  
  
Yeah so whats the problem  
  
Well I think we solved it  
I know they know the best male from whos doggin it  
  
Yeah I admit you can flow  
  
Well thats true  
  
But you see Im a pro with the bank too  
  
Yeah I can see you got it good  
  
Oh that I know  
  
But you see youre not better than YoYo  
The brandnew intelligent black lady  
  
Youre kinda dope but you still cant fade me  
  
So what up then  
  
Girl what you tryin to do  
  
To prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through  
  
This is a mans world thank you very much  
  
But it wouldnt be a damn thing without a womans touch  
  
Or a big butt
