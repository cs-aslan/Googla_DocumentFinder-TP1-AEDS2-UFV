Hard to thrill nothin really moves me anymore  
Hard to thrill nothin really moves me anymore  
There is nothin you can show me  
That I havent seen before  
I got the time to kill keepin to myself inside this room  
Time to kill keepin to myself inside this room  
Over forty years of Fridays  
And you give up tryin too  
Hard to thrill nothin really moves me anymore  
Im hard to thrill nothin really moves me anymore  
There aint nothin you can show me  
That I havent seen before  
Hard to thrill but nothin really moves me anymore  
Hard to thrill but nothin really moves me anymore
