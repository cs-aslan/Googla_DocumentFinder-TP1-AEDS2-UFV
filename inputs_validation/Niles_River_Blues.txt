On the banks of the Niles I courted my love  
I walked with her soft as a mournin dove  
I loved her true I swear I still do  
And now shes gone without me  
  
I walk by the banks and give the Lord thanks  
That I had the chance to court her  
I dont know why he flew her away  
I dont know why Im left here  
  
The Niles runs cold and clear  
As cold and clear as my tears  
Ill never forget Ill never regret  
Those days on the beautiful Niles  
  
Her name was Diane her beautiful hands  
Were soft as the pearls in the water  
I looked in her eyes they were blue as the skies  
And now Ive gone and left her  
  
Ill follow her down the way to the river  
Follow her now now and forever  
Shes my one and only smile  
On the beautiful banks of the Niles  
  
Someday soon neath the light of the moon  
When the sun and the rain shine together  
Ill meet her down where the waters flow  
And continue to flow forever  
  
Down on the banks of the beautiful Niles  
I wonder what I can be thinking  
Down on the banks of that beautiful river  
Ill wander look for her forever  
Ill wander look for her forever
