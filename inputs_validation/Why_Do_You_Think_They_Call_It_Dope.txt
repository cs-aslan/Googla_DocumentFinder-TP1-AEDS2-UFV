Warning MCs stand back  
You better take a chill and observe the skill  
of the man who can so understand god damn  
I got a masterpiece a master plan and a brand new  
way to attack the wack cut em down to size  
to realize LLs back  
Dont sleep Im too sweet to repeat a beat  
a lyric or rhyme I wouldnt waste your time  
with weak words thats for nerds you never heard a rhyme  
So you deserve a line rougher than rough enough is enough  
Im gonna slaughter choke ya smoke ya like a sauna  
You dont really wanna  
But if you wanna battle on heres a lesson stop fessin  
Im a lethal weapon you better get to steppin  
off the stage and outta my face  
Youre too light  save the bass  
  
Chorus  
Why do you think they call it dope  
Why do you why do you think they call it dope  
  
It seems like peoplell never understand  
On the microphone Im not your average man  
I cool out sometimes I save my best rhymes  
and then the toy boy thinks that he can come and get mine  
Let your friends gas him up talk trash and make bets  
then gets played like those kids who tried to rob Goetz  
You dont know what Im sayin Yo check it  
Give me any microphone and god dammit Ill wreck it  
Im coldblooded Im about to mutilate  
Last year before I left I told you to wait  
But you couldnt stay loyal started goin astray  
Thinking Tom Dick and Harry can mess with Cool J  
Is you crazy Im booming got the talent of two men  
The stamina and skill in battle to kill a few men  
The heart of a lion the loyalty of a soldier  
I wreck your whole mob then tell ya I told ya  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause I dont jab around you I come inside  
Bob and weave deceive until you get tongue tied  
Brawl for all give a lyrical display  
and next time you know better than to get in my way  
Yo whassup wit LL  
Will he ever make another Rock the Bells  
Yo brothers is coming up I think hes falling off  
I dont think hes still hard as hell  
See this is the attitude of ignorant ones  
cause they dont know all them MCsll get done  
One or two might say Yo Lll be back  
but the rest they be sucking on sugar smacks  
Talking that crap about whos better than me  
You think so Just let a MC  
make me mad enough to really wanna battle  
I put a L on his ass like he was cattle  
  
Chorus  
  
Just cause I make a love song or say a simple rhyme  
Boom move over L its Miller Time  
I dont know whether to laugh get ill or get wild  
Cause brothers dont realize I got so many styles  
like tripling up the words confusing all the nerds  
Heard put my sights on mics and  flipping above the word  
to the mother no other  
MC brother can mess with Ladies Lover  
Im original Im bright under color  
And when I get on the mic yo I burn rubber  
Cant stand criticism give em an exorcism  
Been rocking for years now I have wisdom  
The way Im kicking the lines you can hear my tongue twist  
and itll have your neck spinning like youre spineless  
Im picking em up throwing em down  
Hyping em up and slowing em down  
All of these words with only one tongue  
Shaking em up and then baking em up  
Smash boom bash scraping em up  
Now you thought that was hard I just begun  
Cause Im a roll on the microphone  
And take control just like Al Capone  
Im notorious youre foolish if you sleep on me  
Cause Im too slick to let a rapper get sweet on me  
Try to make a move for my heavyweight belt  
You get played like the Wizard of Oz witch you melt  
Yo Im crazy dope with super hype lines  
and a lot of hype lines make one dope rhyme  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Cause thats what it is  
  
Why do you think they call it dope  
Why do you why do you think they call it dope  
Why do you think they call it dope
