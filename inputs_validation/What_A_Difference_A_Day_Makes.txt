What a difference a day makes  
Twentyfour little hours  
Brought the sun and the flowers  
Where there used to be rain  
  
My yesterday was blue dear  
Today Im part of you dear  
My lonely nights are through dear  
Since you said you were mine  
  
What a difference a day makes  
Theres a rainbow before me  
Skies above cant be stormy  
Since that moment of bliss that thrilling kiss  
  
Its heaven when you  
Find romance on your menu  
What a difference a day makes  
And the difference is you  
  
What a difference a day makes  
Theres a rainbow before me  
Skies above cant be stormy  
Since that moment of bliss that thrilling kiss  
  
Its heaven when you  
Find romance on your menu  
What a difference a day makes  
And the difference is you
