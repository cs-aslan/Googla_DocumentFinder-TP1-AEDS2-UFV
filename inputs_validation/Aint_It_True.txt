Aint it true  
No matter what you do  
Someday when life is through  
Theyre gonna bury you  
Beneath the cold cold ground girl  
  
Big or small  
Or short or fat or tall  
Its gonna get us all  
Someday were gonna fall  
Beneath the cold cold ground girl  
  
So you best believe it  
No matter what you do  
Yes you best believe it  
Aint it true aint it true  
Aint it true  
  
My poor heart  
Was almost torn apart  
Because you played a part  
You thought that you were smart  
And now youre gone  
Gone gone girl  
  
All your life  
You treated me so bad  
You took the love I had  
And left me feeling sad  
But Ill go on on on girl  
  
Cause I know that someday  
Your time will be due  
Yes youd best believe it  
Aint it true aint it true  
Aint it true  
  
I dont want to be the one  
To see you in such misery  
Not even for the things  
You went and done done done girl  
  
There is time for  
You to change your mind  
And leave your cheating heart behind  
And turn the righteous kind  
Come back to me girl  
  
And I will forgive you  
Heres what Ill say  
On that final day  
They lay you away  
There was never another like you  
  
Aint it true girl  
Aint it true girl  
  
And I will forgive you  
Heres what Ill say  
On that final day  
They lay you away  
There was never another like you  
  
Aint it true girl  
Aint it true girl
