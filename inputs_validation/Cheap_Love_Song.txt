Take your time to unwind  
You will find its love you are living  
Clear the space find a place  
You will see its love you are giving  
  
Take you time to make things last  
Love for the future not the past  
I cant change the way I am  
This is all I got this Cheap Love Song  
  
Take your time make it rhyme  
You will see its all believing  
One fine day well find a way  
You will reach your own destination  
  
Seven clowns with different faces  
Love weve lost but were still chasing  
One day well leave this town  
Its all weve got this Cheap Love Song  
  
Take your time feel fine  
You will see its all believing  
One fine day well find a way  
You will reach your own destination  
  
Come on carry on now  
  
Better make a try now  
Hold your head up high now  
Win love  
Its nothing superficial  
Been wrote to break the dish oh  
Im making it ficial  
In love  
  
Carry on now
