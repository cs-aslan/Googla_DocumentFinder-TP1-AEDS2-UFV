Last night you breathed the deepest sigh  
Turned away with those cold cool eyes  
You said wont you give me space to breathe  
And my tears gave it confidence to leave  
Now you say Im just to much for you  
There are things youll never know  
If you lie and cheat so easily  
Youd better go  
Go go go yeah  
All I know is how I feel  
And my heart was always yours to steal  
But you take and never give to me  
Your kisses are charity  
Your kisses are charity  
Yesterday you were my brightest star  
But even when youre near  
I dont know where you are  
I was wrong to show my weaker side  
Now its much too late to cry cry cry  
I was blind to put my trust in you  
If you leave me Ill fall apart  
Did you plan to make a fool out of me  
From the start  
Yeah yeah yeah  
All I know is how I feel  
And my heart was always yours to steal  
But you take and never give to me  
Your kisses are charity  
Your kisses are charity  
Now you say Im too much for you  
There are things youll never know  
If you lie and cheat so easily  
Youd better go  
Go go go yeah  
All I know is how I feel  
And my heart was always yours to steal  
But you take and never give to me  
Your kisses are charity  
Your kisses are charity
