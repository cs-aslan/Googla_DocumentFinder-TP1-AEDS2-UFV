One mistake in a subtle way  
Like Im walking again all on me  
Step slowly you know that you fall between  
Dark places what a simple web we weave  
  
Weve seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak  
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in  
Weve seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak  
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in  
  
Know myself  
Know myself  
Well oh hell  
Prissy queen  
Iron bars  
Iron heart  
Iron bars  
Everything  
  
A hundred years old  
A hundred years old  
  
Last on the village scene  
Fall apart  
Iron heart  
More alive than youve ever been  
  
Weve seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak  
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in  
Weve seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak  
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in  
  
Well its a dull life  
Its a dull life  
Its a dull life  
Its a dark place  
Its a dull life  
Its a dull life  
Its a dull life  
Its a dull life  
  
Know myself  
  
Weve seen the nightmare of your lies Repeats  
Weve seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak  
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in  
Weve seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak  
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in  
  
Know myself
