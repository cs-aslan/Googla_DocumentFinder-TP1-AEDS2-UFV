Drive me home silver eagle  
Drive me away from last nights news  
Empty beds crowds of people  
Oh come on white girl sing the blues  
  
Warm mister hold me like you love me  
Why dont you make me  
Feel real good for free  
And if free dont mean for nothin  
Lets just say this ones on me yeah  
  
You know I sold my soul to rock n roll  
I bought these devil chains  
My baby wants me home Cant refuse him  
Sold my soul to rock n roll  
Its time to take that train  
The one that goes from heaven  
Straight to Houston ho  
  
Whoa I need a short vacation  
Restin in my babys arms  
But the road goes on  
Forever forever forever  
It keeps on going  
But Im gone gone gone  
  
Sold my soul to rock n roll  
Bought these devil chains  
Whoa baby wants me home Cant refuse him  
I sold my soul to rock n roll  
Its time to take that train  
The one that goes from heaven  
Straight to Houston ho  
  
Did you like it  
Was it good  
Dont it make you want to cryhihi  
Did you like it  
Oh Am I good  
Is it worth another tryyy  
Aaaaaaa  
  
Sold my soul to rock n roll  
Its time to take that train  
The one that goes from heaven  
Straight to Houston ho  
The one that goes from heaven  
Straight to Houston ho
