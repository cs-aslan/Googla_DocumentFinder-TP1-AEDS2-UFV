I got a girl that aint got no home  
She aint very fat just skin and bones  
She dont cast no shadow because shes so thin  
Never knows where she going but she knows were shes been  
She Never knows where she going but she knows were shes been  
  
The girl I love aint got no name  
But I love her just the same  
Shes a little peculiar but it aint no sin  
She never know where she going but know were shes been  
She never knows where she going but she knows were shes been  
Never know where she going but she knows were shes been  
  
Shes six feet tall and got long black hair  
Runs around in her sack dress but I dont care  
She got great big feet with size number 10  
She never know where she going but know were shes been  
She never know where she going but know were shes been  
  
The girl I love aint got no name
