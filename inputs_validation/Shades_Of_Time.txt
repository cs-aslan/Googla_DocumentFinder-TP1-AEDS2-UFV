Tell me the things that you see  
Or is it some time that you need  
All of the things that youve done  
Im certain that you had your fun  
  
Go out and make it better  
You can make it if you try  
Try to make it better  
  
Somebody calls in the night  
Says he can make things go right  
I know therell soon come a day  
Things will start falling your way  
  
Ill try to help if I can  
So dont hide your head in the sand oh no  
Why are you feeling so low  
Youre wondering where will you go
