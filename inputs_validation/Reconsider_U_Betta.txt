Please forgive me I dont know what to say  
Except Im sorry to scare you away from me  
I get crazy and dont know what Ive done  
Its all hazy thought we were having fun  
Was it so bad  
You feel you had to leave me baby  
Now that youre gone  
I need to belong believe me baby  
I would be so glad  
If you would reconsider and stay  
Reconsider reconsider reconsider  
Babys cryin its so cold in our place inside Im dyin  
We need the smile on your face dont need no money  
I dont need no girlfriends want my daddy  
To love me again and again and again and  
I would be so glad  
If you would reconsider and stay  
Reconsider reconsider reconsider  
Sometimes honey I know I talk too loud  
Short temper Im apt to cuss you you  
I dont mean it passion gets the best of me  
Still I love you and I feel like you love me too  
I would be so glad  
If you would reconsider and stay  
Reconsider reconsider reconsider  
If you walk out that door  
You betta reconsider this if you dont call me no more  
You betta reconsider reconsider that reconsider  
If you think you were lonely before  
you betta reconsider reconsider this  
That I changed the lock on this door  
You betta reconsider that if you stop payin these bills  
You gotta reconsider I betcha somebody will  
You betta reconsider
