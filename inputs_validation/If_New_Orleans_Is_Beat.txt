Your smile is fading a bit so I ration it  
Dont think about it  
Here where the Mississippi quits  
Where its still got a bit of Minnesota in it  
No one will give you a thing these days  
Theyd rather kill it or throw it away  
Dont do dark American streets so  
If New Orleans is beat if New Orleans is beat  
If New Orleans is beat if New Orleans is beat  
If New Orleans is beat where does that leave you and me  
The river takes takes takes and takes  
It doesnt change and only changes  
See it there in a picture with me  
Theres a caption beneath New Orleans is beat  
And if New Orleans is beat if New Orleans is beat  
If New Orleans is beat if New Orleans is beat  
Where does that leave you and me  
Where does that leave you and me  
Where does that leave you and me  
Your smile is fading a bit so I ration it  
Dont think about it
