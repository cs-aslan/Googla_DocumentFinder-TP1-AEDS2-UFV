Someday I wont come running when you call  
The way you hurt me its a wonder Im still here at all  
Someday youll wake up and youll find yourself alone  
Lock stock and teardrops Ill be gone  
  
I cant go on the way you make me live  
Make me cry and every time expect me to forgive  
Someday youll wake up to a cold and lifted dawn  
Lock stock and teardrops Ill be gone  
  
Someday Ill wake up find me strength and move along  
Lock stock and teardrops Ill be gone  
Lock stock and teardrops Ill be gone
