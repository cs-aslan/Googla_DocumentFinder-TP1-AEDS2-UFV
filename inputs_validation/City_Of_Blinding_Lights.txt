The more you see the less you know  
The less you find out as you grow  
I knew much more then than I do now  
  
Neon heart dayglow eyes  
The city lit by fireflies  
Theyre advertising in the skies  
And people like us  
  
And I miss you when youre not around  
Im getting ready to leave the ground  
  
Oh you look so beautiful tonightin the city of blinding lights  
  
Dont think before you laugh  
Look ugly in a photograph  
Flash bulbs purple irises the camera cant see  
  
Ive seen you walk unafraid  
Ive seen you in the clothes youve made  
Can you see the beauty inside of me  
What happened to the beauty I had inside of me  
  
And I miss you when youre not around  
Im getting ready to leave the ground  
  
Oh you look so beautiful tonighttonight  
In the city of blinding lights  
  
Timetimetimewont leave me as I am  
But time wont take the boy out of this man  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight  
  
The more you know the less you feel  
Some pray for  others steal  
Blessings not just for the ones who kneelluckily
