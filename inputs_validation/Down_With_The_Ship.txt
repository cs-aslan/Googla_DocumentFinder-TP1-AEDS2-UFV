It could have been helped it might have been saved  
With me and the helm I could have found ways  
To keep it afloat and find a new course  
But I steered the ship right into the cliffs  
  
The easy way out a cowardly move  
A short sighted plan made by a selfcentered man  
The crew stayed with the ship and bailed as one  
They didnt know irreparable damage was done  
  
They had so much pride and camaraderie  
But that was all lost when tey spotted me  
Rowing to shore with treasure on board  
A cowardly plan mad by a self loathing man  
  
Without regrets without looking back  
I coose to walk on the less beaten sociopath  
With all the spoils of an island of one  
I dont need dynasty I dont need anyone  
  
I knew the consequence when I plotted this trip  
Im not a man wholl go sown with the ship
