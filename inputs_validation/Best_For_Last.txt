Wait do you see my heart on my sleeve  
Its been there for days on end and  
Its been waiting for you to open up  
Yours too baby come on now  
Im trying to tell you just how  
Id like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally  
Say that its always been me  
  
Chorus  
Thats made you feel the way youve never felt before  
And Im all you need and that you never want more  
Then youd say all of the right things without a clue  
But youd save the best for last  
Like Im the one for you  
  
You should know that youre just a temporary fix  
This is not rooted with you it dont mean that much to me  
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free  
How dare you think youd get away with trying to play me  
  
Why is it every time I think Ive tried my hardest  
It turns out it aint enough  
Youre still not mentioning love  
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly  
Im taking these chances and getting nowhere  
And though Im trying my hardest you go back to her  
And I think that I know things may never change  
Im still hoping one day I might hear you say  
  
I make you feel the way youve never felt before  
And Im all you need and that you never want more  
Then youd say all of the right things without a clue  
But youd save the best for last  
Like Im the one for you  
  
You should know that youre just a temporary fix  
This is not rooted with you it dont mean that much to me  
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free  
How dare you think youd get away with trying to play me  
  
But despite the truth that I know  
I find it hard to let go and give up on you  
Seems I love the things you do  
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am  
To persist with this heartbreak and running around  
And I will do until Im finding myself you  
  
And make you feel a way youve never felt before  
And be all you need so that you never want more  
And youll say all of the right things without a clue  
And youll be the one for me and me the one for you
