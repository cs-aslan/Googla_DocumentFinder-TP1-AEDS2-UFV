  
It doesnt take a lot to confuse me  
Im not aware of the passing of time  
And Id like to say to those who accuse me  
Could you do it while you looked in my eye  
  
If you hold on primitive notion  
And if you think youd like to try  
You can drink this magic potion  
And you can do it til the day that you the day that you die  
  
Ive done it before and Ill do it again  
Charged with a life thatll burn til the end  
How can it be that were so far apart  
I want it to feel like it did at the start  
  
Im doing my best to confound you  
Your behaviour is so volatile  
Not even a zoo would impound you  
Dont look at me with your criticle smile  
  
Well Ive been driving in the wrong gear  
Its been a long and lonely ride  
Its been winter for a whole year  
But you couldnt hurt me if you tried  
  
Ive done it before and Ill do it again  
Charged with a life thatll burn til the end  
How can it be that were so far apart  
I want it to be like it was at the start  
  
Ive done it before and Ill do it again  
Charged with a life thatll burn til the end  
How can it be that were so far apart  
I want it to feel like it did at the start  
  
Ive got a message that I need to send  
Its coming to you straight from a friend  
I wanted to see whats inside my heart  
I wanted to be like it was in the start
