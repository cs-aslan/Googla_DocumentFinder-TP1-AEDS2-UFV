I got no money got no job Im just another shufflin slob  
Well weve all been disappointed weve had our dreams before  
For with dreams you learn to take your turn  
In a world that dont believe in nothin anymore  
  
Some believe in Jesus They dont act like they do  
Some believe in Mohammed I dont believe thats true  
Cause they do believe in money and gold is what its for  
All the gold cant buy no peace of mind  
In a world that dont believe in nothin anymore  
  
She is a woman with a baby child A sacrificed human Now shes runnin wild  
Well her dreams have all been shattered her dignity defiled  
She has lost her way but she must stay  
In a world that dont believe in nothin anymore  
  
Some believe in love Where did it go  
Some believe in children Even they now know  
That we do believe in money and gold is what its for  
All the gold cant buy no peace of mind  
In a world that dont believe in nothin anymore  
  
I believe in you I believe in me and I dont care what the papers say  
I believe in struggle I believe in life I believe that we will find a way  
I believe in hope I believe in dreams I believe in luck I believe in
schemes  
I believe in fate I believe in time I believe what I believe aint worth a
dime  
  
Cause we do believe in money and gold is what its for  
All the gold cant buy no peace of mind  
In a world that dont believe in nothin anymore  
  
Ill go on livin Ill pay the cost Ill keep on givin to those who are
lost  
Cause the children will be coming and theyll soon know the score  
They must understand Ive played my hand  
In a world that dont believe
