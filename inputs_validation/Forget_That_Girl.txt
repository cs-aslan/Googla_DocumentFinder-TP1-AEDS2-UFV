Forget that girl  
Shell only make you sad someday  
Forget that girl  
  
Shell never make you happy  
Stay away from her my friend  
Stay away from her  
  
Forget that girl  
Shell only bring you down again  
Forget that girl  
Shell only make you lonely  
Stay away from her my friend  
Stay away from her  
  
There was a time when she could really love you  
When she was thinking only of you  
But now shes thrown herself above you  
And theres nothing you can do  
  
Forget that girl  
Even tho you find its hard  
Forget that girl  
Even though you love her  
  
Shes in love with him my friend  
Shes in love with him  
Oh yeah shes in love with him
