Even though your winds blow I want you to know  
You cause me no alarm cause Im safe in His arms  
Even though your rain falls I can still make this call  
Let there be peace now I can say go away  
I command you to move today  
Because of faith I have a brand new day  
The sun will shine and I will be okay  
Thats what I told the storm  
the storm the storm  
  
Chorus  
I told the storm oh yes I did  
To pass ohhhhh  
Storm you cant last go away  
Go away I command  
I command you to move today  
oh stormStorm when God speaks when God speaks  
Storm you dont have a choice in the matter you have to cease  
You have to cease yes thats  
Thats what I told the storm what I told the storm  
repeat once more  
  
Hook  
I told the storm  
No weapons formed against me shall prosper I dont have to worry about a
thing  
I told the storm  
Im more than a conqueror through Jesus Christ and hes gonna bring me out
alright  
I told the storm  
Its amazing grace thats brought me safe thus far and grace is gonna lead
me home  
I told the storm  
I stood on solid ground and told my storm and you need to tell your storm
today  
  
Vamp 1  
Oh wind Wind stop blowing  
Flood stop flowing Flood stop flowing

Breakers stop dashing Breakers stop dashing  
Darkness go away Darkness go away  
Clouds move away Clouds move away  
Thats what I told Thats what I told the storm  
  
Vamp 2  
Oh death Death cant take me  
Job cant make me Job cant make me  
No matter how the fares of this world Bills cant break me may seem to
way me down  
Disease cant shake me  
You wont drown me  
My God surrounds me  
Thats what I told the storm  
repeat vamp 2 one more time  
  
Thats what I told the storm repeat until end and fade
