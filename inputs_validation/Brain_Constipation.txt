Somebody hear me somebody listen to me  
Am I alone in this world  
Is there anyone listening  
Appease me cant find a reason to be  
Alienation is taking over me  
  
Im going away cant go on any longer  
I really dont know why I just gotta die  
I never thought this was how it would end  
  
The body swinging  
I see it over and over again  
Vanian singing can I ever listen to it again  
A cry for attention was a cry I never heard  
  
With no one listening  
There was nothing to be heard  
Nothing to be heard
