In the cities of the world  
You know every boy and girl  
Goes crazy to the beat of rock n roll  
And as the volume is soaring all the crowd is roaring  
Let it roll  
  
Well we dont care in the least cause our metal is a feast  
But theres always someone tryin to put it down  
So we crank the music louder  
And our voices turn to power  
With a wall of sound well blow em all away  
  
Rock you all around the world  
Were gonna rock  
Were gonna roll  
Were gonna shake you down  
Were gonna lose control  
  
No one can hold us down just look around and see  
This generations getting up and breakin free  
  
Rock you all around the world  
Were gonna rock were gonna rock you
