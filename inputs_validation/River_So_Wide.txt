If we can cross at the place that divides us  
Cross the river the river so wide  
If we can smother the pain thats inside us  
Deny the demons that wait bu our side  
We can find find the light  
  
Our nights are filled with the light of the same moon  
We share the comfort of the same stars  
Our days are bright with the light of the same sun  
That dont matter cant you see what we are  
What we are what we become  
  
Keep our sights on the way ahead  
Dont look back it wont help us now  
The storm we left so far behind  
Seems a dark memory that starts to fade  
But till we see the light we will not be safe  
  
We all sink or swim in the same ocean  
Break our skin and we will bleed  
Our minutes pass with the same motion  
We face the same danger we share the same needs  
Were all the same you and me  
  
Keep our sights on the way ahead  
Dont look back that wont help us now  
Upstream the river gets too wide  
So we must build that bridge right here  
Cause if we wait we will not reach the other side  
See under that clear blue sky  
The winds of change are blowing hard and long  
And theyll not stop to rest cause the change is gonna come  
  
Our nights are filled with the light of the same moon  
We share the comfort of the same stars  
Our days are bright with the light of the same sun  
That dont matter cant you see what we are  
What we are what we become  
  
Keep our sights on the way ahead  
Dont look back it wont help us now  
Cause upstream the river gets too wide  
And if we dont build that bridge right here right now  
You know well never ever reach the other side
