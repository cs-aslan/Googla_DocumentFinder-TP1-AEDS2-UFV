It was a Friday morning I was really boring  
I wish it was night a struggle and a fight  
When I saw her there was a good affair  
Shes so nice shes so cool I dont think shes a fool  
When I saw her last time was a day at school  
But at school it isnt fine yeah the school isnt cool  
I was drunken that night without thinking about  
I was really gone cause we had much fun  
  
Without thinking about I went go more far  
I was really almost knocked down by a car  
  
Chorus 2X  
I would take her I would find her shes my target  
The way I want her and her money thats sounds funny  
  
I hope her friends like me or do they hate me  
My friends dont like her but I really dont care  
She is more important than my stupid friends  
They can say what they want to just do what you want to   
When I saw her last time was a day at school  
But at school it isnt fine yeah the school isnt cool  
I was drunken that night without thinking about  
I was really gone cause we had much fun  
  
Without thinking about I went go more far  
I was really almost knocked down by a car  
  
Chorus 4X
