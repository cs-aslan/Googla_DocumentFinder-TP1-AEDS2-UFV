Goddamn your righteous hand  
I eat innocent meat  
The housewife I will beat  
The prolife I will kill  
What you wont do I will  
I bash myself to sleep  
What you sow I will reap  
I scar myself you see  
I wish I wasnt me  
I am the little stick  
You stir me into shit  
I hate the fool I am  
Goddamn your righteous hand  
Goddamn goddamn oh lord  
Goddamn goddamn  
Pseudomorals work real well  
On the talk shows for the weak  
But your selective judgements  
And goodguy badges  
Dont mean a fuck to me  
I throw a little fit  
I slit my teenage wrist  
The most that I can learn  
Is in records that you burn  
Get your gunn get your gunn  
Get your gunn get your gunn  
Pseudomorals work real well  
On the talk shows for the weak  
But your selective judgements  
And goodguy badges  
Dont mean a fuck to me  
I am the vhs  
Record me with your fist  
You want me to save the world  
Im just a little girl  
Pseudomorals work real well  
On the talk shows for the weak  
But your selective judgements  
And goodguy badges  
Dont mean a fuck to me  
Get your gunn get your gunn  
Get your gunn get your gunn Get
