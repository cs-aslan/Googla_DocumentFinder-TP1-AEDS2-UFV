Check out some memories I dont recognise  
Another country and another life  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
I find Im strolling on a distant shore  
To meet someone Ive never seen before  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
Ohohoh ohohoh oh  
Chorus  
Im wearing someone elses clothes again  
Walking in the streets I know again  
Back in the old familiar glow again  
Im wearing someone elses clothes  
Painting quiet pictures in my ear  
Were driving past without a wish to steer  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
Driving underneath the deep blue sea  
Im always surfacing in summer sheets  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
Ohohoh ohohoh oh  
Chorus  
Chorus  
Transfer me into a Saturday crowd  
Or merge me back into a factory town  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
Im opened up for such a splendid move  
Im making  with someone I dont know who  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
Ohohoh ohohoh oh  
Chorus
