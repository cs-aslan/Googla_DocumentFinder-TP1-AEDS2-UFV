No river can hold you darlin  
No covers can hide you tying your shoes  
My cupboards are overflowing  
The wine is sublime Im flyin too  
  
So slide on over and forget its wrong  
Were two lights in the nighttime baby  
Come on over and pick up your song its new  
And darlin so are you  
Dont know nothin bout no here and gone  
Were two lights in the nighttime baby  
Aint nothin that a fightin heart wont do  
No no no  
  
My government owns the bible  
My government owns the title too  
The car that I got this mornin  
The car that I got for me and you  
  
So whats comin on down that road  
Its two lights in the nighttime baby  
You know that Im gonna wanna  
Share my load with you  
And boy you know its true  
Well stay together til the end of time  
Were two lights in the nighttime baby  
Aint nothin that a fightin heart wont do  
No no no  
  
So slide on over and forget its wrong  
Were two lights in the nighttime baby  
Come on over and pick up your song its new  
And darlin so are you  
Dont know nothin bout no here and gone  
Were two lights in the nighttime baby  
Aint nothin that a fightin heart wont do  
No no no  
  
So whats comin on down that road  
Its two lights in the nighttime baby  
You know that Im gonna wanna  
Share my load with you  
And boy you know its true  
Well stay together til the end of time  
Were two lights in the nighttime baby  
Aint nothin that a fightin heart wont do  
Honey you know its true
