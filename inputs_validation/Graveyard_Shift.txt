Hometown same town blues  
Same old walls closing in  
Oh what a life a mess can be  
Im sitting here thinking of you once again  
Wont you talk to me  
  
Well time wont wait better open the gate  
Get up and start what needs to be done  
Its winding down theres much you missed  
Working on that graveyard shift  
  
Well Im not saying theres nothing wrong as the day comes along  
If what I see is true I could learn to believe  
Cant look away  
The powers that be might take it all away  
Together we burn together we burn away  
  
Some say a land of paradise  
Some say a land of pain  
Well which side are you looking from  
Some people have it all  
Some all to gain  
  
Well a man in a tie gonna break his twenty dollar bill  
Theres plenty of reasons in this world  
Were no longer standing still  
  
But Im not saying theres nothing wrong as the day comes along  
If what I see is true I could learn to believe  
Cant look away  
The powers that be might take it all away  
Together we burn together we burn away  
  
Theres too much time spent looking for a reason  
Its the simple ones that beat the most truth  
Oh what a life a mess can be  
Im sitting here thinking of you once again  
Give a thought to me  
  
Well time wont wait better open the gate  
Get up and start what needs to be done  
Its running down theres much you missed  
Working on that graveyard shift  
  
But Im not saying theres nothing wrong as the day comes along  
If what I see is true I could learn to believe  
Cant look away  
The powers that be might take it all away  
Together we burn together we burn away
