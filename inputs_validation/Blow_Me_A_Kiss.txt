Take one in the leg Think about your baby  
Take one in the side Think about your girl  
Take one in the head Think about your mother  
Take one in the heart Its the end of the world  
  
So blow me a kiss cause Im black  
Blow me a kiss cause Im gay  
Blow me a kiss cause Im shakin  
Say goodnight then blow me away  
Blow me away  
Blow me away  
Tell me what youre thinkin tell me why  
Blow me a kiss then blow me away  
  
Take one in the face Think about your life  
Take one in the eye Think about your soul  
Take one in the mouth Think about your savior  
Take one in the thigh Are you ready to go  
  
So blow me a kiss cause Im lonely  
Blow me a kiss cause Im afraid  
Blow me a kiss cause you dont know me  
Say goodnight then blow me away
