Verse 1  
From my iPhone to my sidekick  
Jet planes schedule hectic  
My love life I neglect it  
Had a fast car but I wrecked it  
Plenty chances to fall in love man  
So many weekends I went to clubs man  
In the fast lane my lifes a picture flick  
Let my drink decide who is the next chick  
I aint gone lieall the blanck it matter to me  
She say she me love me but its just chit chatter to me  
But deep inside I was always missing something  
But Im a thug so Im always on something  
So many girls always drinking and having fun  
Lifes a beauty shop and I keep my hair done  
Seem like Im on a marry go ride  
Man it makes a thug wanna settle down  
Chorus  
Sometimes sometimes sometimes  
Playas get lonely toooh I do toooh I do  
Sometimes sometimes sometimes  
Playas get lonely toooh I do too  and you know I do  
Verse 2  
I wanna settle down with you  
Baby you and me  
A Life thats brand new  
Quit running these streets  
Take away your pain  
Chase away the rain  
Off my love game  
I might even change my name  
Chorus  
Sometimes sometimes sometimes  
Playas get lonely toooh I do toooh I do  
Sometimes sometimes sometimes  
Playas get lonely toooh I do too  and you know I do  
Verse 3  
Uh uh VIP  
Uh uh ROB  
Always in the spot light  
Living the good life  
All of that something still just aint right  
Videos and all of these interviews  
When all I really want is to be next to you  
I spend more time with my cars now  
Land of the Hollywood sign Im a star now  
My life is more than the cars and awards  
It gets lonely and I cant ignore  
Always in the streets going hardcore  
I spend a couple of Gs when Im bored  
Chorus  
Sometimes sometimes sometimes  
Playas get lonely toooh I do too oh I do  
Sometimes sometimes sometimes  
Playas get lonely too oh I do too  and you know I do  
Verse 4  
Party lights mixed with lonely  
Nights mixed with birds grass  
Flights mixed with  
Nobody to share it with  
Out of all the after parties  
I still need somebody  
To be there when a playas going through some shit  
To be there when a playa cant ever see  
Chorus
