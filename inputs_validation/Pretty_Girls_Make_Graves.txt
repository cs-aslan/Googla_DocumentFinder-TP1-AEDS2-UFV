Upon the sand upon the bay  
There is a quick and easy way you say  
Before you illustrate  
Id rather state   
Im not the man you think I am  
Im not the man you think I am  
  
And sorrows native son  
He will not smile for anyone  
  
And pretty girls make graves  
Oh  
  
End of the pier end of the bay  
You tug my arm and say  give in to lust  
Give up to lust oh heaven knows well  
Soon be dust   
  
Oh Im not the man you think I am  
Im not the man you think I am  
  
And sorrows native son  
He will not rise for anyone  
  
And pretty girls make graves  
Oh really   
Oh  
  
I could have been wild and I could have  
Been free  
But nature played this trick on me  
  
She wants it now  
And she will not wait  
But shes too rough  
And Im too delicate  
  
Then on the sand  
Another man he takes her hand  
A smile lights up her stupid face  
and well it would  
  
I lost my faith in womanhood  
I lost my faith in womanhood  
I lost my faith  
Oh  
  
Hand in glove  
The sun shines out of our behinds  
Oh
