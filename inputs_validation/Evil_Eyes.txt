evil eyes  
stole my heart on a dark December night  
souls of flame  
loving her has made me half insane  
  
the way she cast me  
in her spell  
secrets I couldnt tell  
were for me  
and for you  
  
once I knew  
the joys of loving were for me and you  
but now shes here  
and with her secrets I know Ill have to bear  
  
to let her take me  
from your side  
rob me of all my pride  
and my love  
oh sweet love  
  
evil eyes  
shes got those  
evil eyes  
though Im only her friend  
I know Ill love her till the end  
of my life  
oh sweet life  
  
evil eyes  
shes got those  
evil eyes  
though Im only her friend  
I know Ill love her till the end  
of my life
