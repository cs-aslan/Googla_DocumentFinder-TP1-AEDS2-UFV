I remember when you used to be mine  
Way back when  
I was too naive to love you right  
But now if I only had the opportunity  
I would do anything  
Because my heart still believes  
  
Maybe you could be mine again  
Maybe we could make that dream for real  
Like way back then  
When love was yours and mine  
Maybe we could bring it back to life  
  
Its irrelevant to dwell on the past  
Im accountable for what went bad  
And I mean that  
But I keep on praying for another chance  
Just to have you back  
Cause Ive grown  
And I know how to be your everything  
  
Maybe you could be mine again  
Maybe we could make that dream for real  
Like way back then  
When love was yours and mine  
Maybe we could bring it back to life  
  
No no it aint over yet  
I just cant accept the possibility  
We werent made for each others arms  
I know youre my destiny  
We cant erase what was meant to be  
Part of you and part of me  
If we try one more time  
Maybe somehow well survive  
  
Maybe you could be mine again  
Maybe we could make that dream for real  
Like way back then  
When love was yours and mine  
Boy maybe we could bring it back  
Maybe we could bring it back  
Maybe we could bring it back to  
Life  
Maybe you could be mine
