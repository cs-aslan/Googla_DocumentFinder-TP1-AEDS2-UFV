Follow me Ill lead the way your fears will soon overtake  
Hide your infinite tears inside it seeks your smallest break  
Screaming as if nothing helps you press on to survive  
Playing out the fantasies of a force that keeps you alive  
  
Hell have you down on your knees  
You play his fatal game  
Hell satisfy your every need  
Youll never be the same  
  
Take my hand Ill show you how  
Youve just one life to live  
The road youre on goes straight to hell  
Your life is yours to give  
His fantasies of all of you are much too great to see  
This world your living is so unreal perfected just for me  
  
Hell have you down on your knees  
You play his fatal game  
Hell satisfy your every need  
Youll never be the same
