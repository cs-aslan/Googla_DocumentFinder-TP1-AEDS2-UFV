So how does it feel  
To stand so close  
And never understand  
How do you feel  
When you mean so much  
But you dont even give a damn  
  
Chorus  
You let a lotta people down  
You let a lotta people down  
Youve got a lot to learn  
You cant do that  
Just who the hell do you think you are  
You cant do that  
  
Well you rode upon a wicked fence  
Couldve fallen either way  
But youve chosen other losers  
In your sick sick game  
  
Chorus  
  
Just how can you keep goin  
With all thats goin on  
The best thing about knowing you  
Is knowin when youre gone  
You let a lotta people down  
  
Your conscience has ghost writers  
Your dirty hands are clean  
Flesh and blood and life and death  
No its no mystery  
  
Chorus  
You cant do that  
Cause you aint seen nothin til a man starts comin with a gun  
No you aint seen nothin til some nut starts comin with a gun
