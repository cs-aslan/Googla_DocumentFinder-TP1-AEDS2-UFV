So cool calm and collected  
You had a style a rakish style  
Well my poor heart never connected  
Youd stay so long on my mind  
  
Well isnt it midnight on the other side of the world  
Do you remember t  
The face of a pretty girl  
The face of a pretty girl  
  
Looking back so long ago  
You had a knack a knack of making women know  
Ooh there wasnt the time  
And i knew youd nver be mine  
  
Well isnt it midnight on the other side of the world  
Do you remember  
The face of a pretty girl  
The face of a pretty girl  
The face of a pretty girl  
  
Isnt it midnight on the other side of the world  
Do you remember  
The face of a pretty girl  
The face of a pretty girl  
The face of a pretty girl
