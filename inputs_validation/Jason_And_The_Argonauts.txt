There may be no golden fleece  
But human riches Ill release  
  
Oh my head is spinning like the world and its filled with beasts Ive seen  
Let me put my bag down and Ill tell you it all right from the start  
Like the scarlet woman who would pick on the boys she thought were green  
And the two faced man who made a hobby of breaking his wifes heart  
  
Seems the more I travel  
From the foam to gravel  
As the nets unravel  
All exotic fish I find like Jason and the Argonauts  
  
There may be no golden fleece  
But human riches Ill release  
  
I was in a land where men force women to hide their facial features  
And here in the west its just the same but theyre using makeup veils  
Ive seen acts of every shade of terrible crime from manlike creatures  
And Ive had the breath of liars blowing me off course in my sails  
  
Seems the more I travel  
From the foam to gravel  
As the nets unravel  
All exotic fish I find like Jason and the Argonauts  
  
There may be no golden fleece  
But human riches Ill release  
  
I have watched the manimals go by  
Buying shoes buying sweets buying knives  
I have watched the manimals and cried  
Buying time buying ends to other peoples lives  
  
Jason and the Argonauts  
  
There may be no golden fleece  
But human riches Ill release  
  
Jason and the Argonauts  
  
There may be no golden fleece  
But human riches Ill release
