This land is a lovely green  
It reminds me of my own home  
Such children Ive seldom seen  
Even in my own home  
The sky is so bright and clean  
Just like my home  
Kind people as have ever been  
Wont you take me back to my own home  
  
Jump up behind me my love jump up behind me  
Old Dan can bear us both jump up behind me  
We follow this road till we reach the sea  
Jump up behind me  
Well catch the tide and set Dan free  
Jump up behind me  
  
Ive been in this world awhile  
And Ive seen a lot of country  
Many days and many miles  
All various and sundry  
Ive had my way and Ive had my fun  
And Ive had my chance to run free  
Burning hot beneath the sun  
Freezing cold and wintry  
  
Jump up behind me my love jump up behind me  
Old Danny can carry us both jump up behind me  
We follow this road till we reach the sea  
Jump up behind me  
Well catch the tide and set old Dan free  
Jump up behind me  
  
I know now only one thing matters in these day  
One thing true love love and love alone true love  
  
Came out of a dream last night  
Thought I was back in my old home  
Mom and Dad were both still alive  
And the babies not yet born no  
Felt like a festival  
And it felt like a Christmas morning  
Felt the darkness fall away  
Even as the world was turning on  
I mean even as the world was turning on  
La la la la la la la la la I say  
Jump up behind me my love jump up behind me  
Follow the road to the western sea
