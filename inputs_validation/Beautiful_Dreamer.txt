Beautiful dreamer you are like magic to me  
Cause you share all your love  
And your life and your love is so fine in my life  
Its just what Ive been looking for  
Searching for and you care  
Beautiful dreamer not an illusion to me  
You know I can tell by the way that youve taken my hand  
In a moment of sadness your gladness is there to surround me  
Astound me and you care  
  
Ive seen all the people waiting at the station  
Waiting at the station  
No imagination no imagination  
Theyre too busy doing nothing  
Making all kinds of arrangements  
Nothings really but nothings really changing them  
Changing them  
  
Theyre theyre still asking why why their well is dry  
I tried to tell them that love is the answer  
They need a beautiful dreamer  
If I could Id share you with them  
Oh but you know it took so very long to find what Ive needed  
And my greatest obsession is doing my best  
Just to keep you and love you cause you care  
  
Youre one in a million  
Always giving into always giving into  
Me whenever I begin to me whenever I begin to act  
A little like Im crazy  
Still still you never faulter you never faulter  
Never try to alter or never try to alter my integrity  
How I could I not be proud to have your wisdom  
Youre such a beautiful dreamer beautiful dreamer  
  
You are like magic to me  
Cause you share all your love  
And your life and your life  
And your love is so fine  
So fine in my life in my life  
And you know its just what Ive been searching for  
Looking for and you care  
Beautiful beautiful dreamer dreamer
