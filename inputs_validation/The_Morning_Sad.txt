Wake up and talk to me  
Its a long time since last night  
I know we said things the saddest things  
And Im not sure it was wise  
When the mornings sad  
You dont look back  
And you sure dont look ahead  
The morning sad  
You know the morning sad  
The morning sad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Im writing desperate songs  
While youre fast asleep inside  
I could try to sing  
I could try to bide my time to wake up  
Until it rings  
But my voice comes out uptight  
So when the mornings sad  
You dont relax  
No you cannot clear your mind  
The morning sad  
You know the morning sad  
The morning sad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
I tried a little  
I tried a lot  
Im not a window  
And youve seen through everything Ive got  
Oh I dont think that Ill be safe  
Until everyones awake  
Everybody everybody everybody yeah  
So wake up and talk to me  
Such a long time since last night  
I know we said things the maddest things  
And Im not sure who was right  
When the mornings sad  
You wont attack  
Cause youre much to weak to bite  
The morning sad  
You know the morning sad  
The morning sad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
Never had it so bad  
No  
Never had it so bad  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Never had it so bad
