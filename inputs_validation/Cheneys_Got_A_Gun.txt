Cheneys Got A Gun  
Jamies Got A GunAerosmith  
  
Dick Cheyneys got a gun  
Dick Cheyneys got a gun  
The safetys come undone  
Squinting in the Texas sun  
  
What did our leader do  
Whod he put a bullet through  
  
They say when Cheyney goes to Texas  
Youll find him hunting fish and game  
His buddy had it coming cause  
When Cheyneys got a gun hes just  
Not that good at taking aim  
  
Cheyneys got a gun  
Dick Cheyney shot someone  
Cindy Sheehan better run  
Gotta watch her liberal buns  
  
Tell him that the wars not through  
Hell probably put a hole in you  
  
He tracked a little bitty birdie  
Hoping to blow out its brains  
They say the spell that he gets under  
From doublebarrelled thunder makes his  
Eyes bug out like hes insane  
  
Run away run away from the Vice President Yeah Yeah Yeah  
Run away run away run from dick Cheyeyeyeyeyeyney  
  
Dick Cheyneys got a gun  
The safetys come undone  
Cindy Sheehan better run  
Hes a weapon of mass destruction  
Dick Cheyney shot someone
