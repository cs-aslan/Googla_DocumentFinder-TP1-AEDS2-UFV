Oh no not you again  
I paid you already  
Too much times ten  
Oh no not you again  
I dont know how it started  
But this is the end  
Theres a gap in your teeth  
The words fall through  
They spread a virus  
And they stick like glue  
Theres a pain in my neck  
And a stone in my shoe  
Theres a lump in my throat  
It was more than I could chew  
Oh no not you again  
With your cheque book religion  
And your diet coke friends  
Oh no not you again  
Theres a hole in your foot  
You shot it yourself  
Pulled the silver trigger  
And damaged your health  
Ive been dying from exposure  
Since I shook your hand  
I see California gave you more than a tan  
Oh no not you again  
With your world in a bubble  
And your gossamer smile  
Oh no not you again  
So nice to hear from you  
Once in a while  
You stuck a knife  
In my back  
And my blood ran cold  
I think you mistook  
Me for a bag of gold  
But theres justice in  
The valley and they  
Say its divine  
Ive heard all about  
Your problems  
Now heres some of mine
