Here I finally come to stand  
My pen and paper in hand  
To write to you  
  
To tell you what I feel inside  
To say to you I cant survive  
Without you  
  
For all the things Ive come to see  
I now beleive theres only you  
Only you for me  
  
Im standing here so lost in you  
Thats all my heart and soul can do  
Is say whats true  
  
I love you  
I love you  
  
The first time I looked in your eyes  
It was so clear to my surprise  
My heart stood still  
  
Iv eheard it time and time again  
That when you fall you cant pretend  
True love is real  
  
I know with you I do belong  
You are my voice my simple song  
Youre all I need  
  
The joy I feel when love is blind  
Youre everything I need to find  
My search is through  
  
Babe I love you  
I lvoe you  
Babe I love you  
I love you  
  
Cause I know with you I do belong  
You are my voice my simple song  
Youre all I need  
  
And the joy I feel when love is blind  
Youre everything I need to find  
My search is through  
  
Babe I love you  
I love you
