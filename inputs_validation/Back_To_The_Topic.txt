Voice gone and sht I think its gonna make it sound a little ill just a
little iller  
Yup Fayettenam ngga  
  
Yea Carolina blue kicks pedal to the medal  
Feeling like a puppet and the devil is Geppetto  
Letter to the ghettohold ya head high  
You can pick apart my raps I aint told ya na lie  
I want a little darker like to fcking tan line  
Go on look for a better ngga girl you cant find  
Fine young man with an old man mind  
No time for the tickle fck the whole mankind  
Aw no maam Im an old land mine  
I been waiting to blow up for a long damn time now Im armed and Im  
Fayettenams finest Carolina saviour marijuana blazer  
Only on occasion cause my mind be racing  
Lost in my thoughts so my eyes be Asian  
Thinking how these rap nggas got to be faking  
Whole style obviously copied pastedplagiarized swag  
May arrived last but when its all said and done Ima be ahead of them  
Way that I describe it prescribe a ngga medicine  
Way that I be flyI be higher than the Jetesons  
Moving on up ngga higher than the Jeffersons  
All about the Benjamins bad chicks send em in  
Basic hoes toss em out Cant even get waffle house  
Hating nggas chalk em out Go and get the coffin out  
What chu talking bout  
Little man my sht hair burning you not even a little tan  
Im Ill enough to kill cancer baby Im Chemo  
Down in Miami and I throw like Marino  
Get a whole lot of you know and she bald like an eagle  
No not up top but down there  
She said she want to hop on top girl I dont care  
You better get yours before I reach mines cause then Im throwing peace signs  
If you a freak I can take you to ya peak girl I do it to the maximaNissan  
And I hope you a believer  
Im quarterbacking trynna get cha open like receivers  
Far from an overnight achievers Cole is like the leader of the new nggas  
To tell the truth Im only fcking with a few nggas if that  
The rest of yall nggas get lapped  
I sit back and reflect on the rap game I came from out of no where  
Ngga I swear them lames aint know how to prepare  
Got nggas shouting out The VilleI got to go there   
Boy dont you know you get shot over there  
I say my prayers cause this life aint fair  
A bunch of backstabbing nggas hope the knife aint there  
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife aint there  
Yea late at night when I got the phone call and made her right  
When my crib was straight ahead shorty gave me head hit it then I quit it
fore she even made the bed  
Damn Im no good  
But damn its so good  
Im picturing that body like a camera phone would  
Something like Rihanna while Im up in that vagina  
Type of chick that only dress in something thats designer  
I could give a fck long as theres something thats behind her  
Got the type of bump that make a dog want to hump her  
Back to the topicactually forgot it  
Hoes money Im the shit Oh yea Im reminded  
The way I put the words together cleverly align them  
These other rap nggas shouldnt never be a problem  
And Im ghost
