Id heard rumors and Id heard talk  
About the trail youd left of broken hearts  
About the sea of tears too wide to cross  
But a little bad press has never scared me off  
So I burned a path to figure out  
How to get me some of what you got  
  
Ive got a red hot heart  
If the talk is true yours is the same  
And we should be together  
And let our passions fan loves flame  
  
When I looked for you I almost passed you by  
You were so cool and calm  
I thought my friends had lied  
But I thought so much reserve must make you wild inside  
It was there and then that I knew  
I had to get some of what you got  
  
Ive got a red hot heart  
If the talk is true yours is the same  
And we should be together  
And let our passions fan loves flame  
  
I thought Id won your heart when I held you hand in mine  
I thought it was true love the way we complemented each other  
But my right is your wrong  
And when youre right then Im left with nothing  
Your light and your heat have all been spent  
Leaving only smoke and ashes  
Only smoke and ashes baby  
  
Ive got a red hot heart  
And your hearts as blue as the blood in your veins  
I say theres fire down below  
You say its only smoke and ashes baby  
  
Im crying all the time  
Salty stinging tears  
And mourning for the past carbondated years  
But knowing now for certain that you were always right  
Because if a breeze could blow you out of my life  
Its only smoke and ashes baby  
Only smoke and ashes baby  
  
Ive got a red hot heart  
And your hearts as blue as the blood in your veins  
I say theres fire down below  
You say its only smoke and ashes baby  
  
I was blinded by devotion  
My unwavering love for you  
So blinded that I thought all your lies were true  
But now I know for certain since youve gone away  
It was just a smoldering fire I mistook for a blaze  
Only smoke and ashes baby  
  
Ive got a red hot heart  
And your hearts as blue as the blood in your veins  
I say theres fire down below  
You say its only smoke and ashes baby  
Only smoke and ashes baby baby
