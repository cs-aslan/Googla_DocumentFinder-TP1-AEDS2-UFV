I dont know  
Well theres no charge for the haircut  
And the bullets come free  
My Uncle Sam sent a letter said  
Hes got a mission for me  
  
Now Im a ranger not a stranger  
And I live in Saigon  
Weve got a team of special forces  
And we deliver napalm  
  
But if they tell you that Ive lost my mind  
Maybe its not gone just a little hard to find  
About the time this letter gets home  
Ill be gone gone yeah gone  
  
And if they tell you that Im MIA  
Think a little less about me each day  
Cause if I ever get back  
Ill be shell shocked  
  
Feels funny riding in my car  
Used to drive a tank and shoot a BAR  
I know Im home  
But I feel gonegone yeah gone  
  
Now its over and the homelands safe  
Got a purple heart to show the world Im brave  
The businessmen sat home  
Well I got shell shocked
