Blimps go 90 on with the show  
Couldnt you see that  
Now didnt you know  
Aerosol halosfilms of the flag  
Rifle games for sevenyearolds  
What a drag  
Yeah now thats a drag  
  
This is not a vacation  
There is no place to go  
Weep sad freaks of the nation  
Where blimps go 90  
And you cant find me  
  
Senator sipping on gentleman jack  
Oh boy they told me now dont you look back  
But dont you worry  
I promise to not  
Ill join your canary court  
Fit into the slot  
Say now what have you got  
  
Oftentimes Im reminded  
Of the sweet young days  
When I poured punch for the franchise  
And thus was knighted  
Got so excited  
  
Blimps go 90 on with the show  
Couldnt you see that  
Now didnt you know  
Hey now didnt you know
