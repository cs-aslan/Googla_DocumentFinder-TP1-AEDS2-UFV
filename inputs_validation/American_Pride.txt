American pride something you feel inside  
Something you cant describe American pride  
Dad said Son Im proud you won  
But the game is more than any toy  
Mama said Now Son say sir and say maam  
And be proud youre southern born  
You play when youre hurt and you work when youre tired  
Cause that was Grandpas way  
And the biscuits are better at Grannys house  
And the gravy taste great all day  
American pride yes it is something you feel inside  
Something you cant describe something you cannot hide  
American pride something you feel inside  
Traditions run deep and wide with American pride  
When a baby is born we all celebrate  
With tears of joy in family eyes  
Cause we all know the baby will grow up with American pride  
Yeah we work and we play and we have our own ways  
And we dont all look alike  
But if the cause is right we stand up and fight  
To protect our American pride  
Sing it sing it sing it  
American pride yes it is something you feel inside  
Its something you cant describe its something you cant hide  
American pride something you feel inside  
Traditions run deep and wide with American pride  
With American pride its American pride
