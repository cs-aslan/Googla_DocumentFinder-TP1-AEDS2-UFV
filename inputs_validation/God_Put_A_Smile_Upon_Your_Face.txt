Where do we go nobody knows  
Ive gotta say Im on my way down  
God give me style and give me grace  
God put a smile upon my face  
  
Where do we go to draw the line  
Ive gotta say  
I wasted all your time honey honey  
Where do I go to fall from grace  
God put a smile upon your face  
Yeah  
  
Now when you work it out Im worse than you  
Yeah when you work it out I wanted to  
Now when you work out where to draw the line  
Your guess is as good as mine

God gave you style and gave you grace  
And put a smile upon your face  
Ah yeah

Now when you work out where to draw the line
