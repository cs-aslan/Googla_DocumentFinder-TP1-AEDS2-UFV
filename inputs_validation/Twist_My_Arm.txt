Thar she blows Jacques Cousteau  
Hear her sing so sweet and low  
Lull me overboard outcold  
Gathered in and swallowed whole  
  
Do I want to With all that charm  
Do I want to Twist my arm  
  
You just hit me where I live  
I guess it looked quite primitive  
What was that supposed to prove  
Throw the calf or hell throw you  
  
Sucked in by the victim world  
Thirsty as a cultured pearl  
Culled and wooed bitten chewed  
It wont hurt if you dont move  
  
Do I want to With all that charm  
Do I want you Twist my arm  
  
Musical chairs double dares memorized stairs  
Shootin off flares springtime hares and brokendown mares  
  
Coward phones big soup stones prideless loans  
Grill sick crows motel groans and big fat Jones  
  
Martyrs dont do much for me  
Though I enjoy them vicariously  
After you No After me  
No I insist Please after me  
  
Do I want to With all that charm  
Do I want you Twist my arm
