Chronomentrophobia  
The fear of clocks  
The fear of time  
  
High as the cost of living  
I take what Ive been given  
Pastor say be strong  
Ooh hey hey  
I aint got time leave me alone  
  
I aint got much time left  
Ive got to funk you now  
  
Chorus  
Chronomentrophobia Repeat x8  
  
Lord be having mercy on my soul  
Im having the impression that my life goin be a bowl  
Of cherries but its very hard for me to cope  
Got tired of being broke  
This ATLien aint got no time to sit and mope  
Made up my mind while yall made up yall beds  
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head  
Born in 1975 never thought Id make it this far  
Still battling in this racial war  
Trying to find solutions to the situation Im facing  
Only thing thats free is my flow that yall be chasing  
Letting my niggas know before I go I drop that knowledge  
Like dropping books lets stop the crooks  
From robbing you of your brains and such using welfare as a crutch  
Im in it for good you into my hood you wont be finding much  
Hope that when Im gone yall remember this  
What we stood for fuck that fame and that glitz  
Its beginning to look a lot like the ending  
And got to be more careful know what corners you be bending  
Revelations getting impatient and now Im dead  
Remember what I said Im gone bow ya heads
