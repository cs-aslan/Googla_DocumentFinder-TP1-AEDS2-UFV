Here we are at last suddenly the pieces fit  
All at once I make sense of this crazy world  
Loved you for so long now your hand is holdin mine  
Its like were standing still in time  
This is our moment this is our night  
A new beginning of the rest of our lives  
With every heartbeat with every kiss  
Lets always remember that love is a gift  
With each passing year we will keep our love alive  
I will be here by your side forever  
Looking in your eyes I believe in destiny  
I believe in you and me  
This is our moment this is our night  
A new beginning of the rest of our lives  
With every heartbeat with every kiss  
Lets always remember that love is a gift  
The rarest thing we have on earth  
Is so special theres no measuring its worth  
This is our moment this is our night  
A new beginning of the rest of our lives  
With every heartbeat with every kiss  
Lets always remember forever and ever  
Lets always remember that love is a gift  
Its a gift
