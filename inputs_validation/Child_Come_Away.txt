Child come away  
Its the girl with the deputy walking by  
Child go and play  
No I wont give you reasons so dont ask why  
  
I read the story about a week ago  
They found her on the beach that night  
They thought the light had gone out of her eyes  
and noone thinks shell ever be right  
She was so full of her life  
Happy with the people she knew  
But then noone can tell  
  
Child come away  
Its the girl with the deputy walking by  
Child go and play  
No I wont give you reasons so dont ask why  
  
Guess all they found were some marks in the sand  
A message saying She is mine  
Nobody touched her as she got in the car  
Well nobody dares to anytime  
She was so full of her life  
The girl that everybody once knew  
But now noone can tell  
  
Child come away  
Its the girl with the deputy walking by  
Child go and play  
No I wont give you reasons so dont ask why  
  
And when they read a story out to the judge  
I heard they had to turn away  
Its all over town  
  
I saw her face in the back of a car  
As they were speeding out of town  
Shes got a mark on the side of her face  
that noones ever seen around  
And what she is or what shes become  
I guess the town will never know  
  
Child come away  
Its the girl with the deputy walking by  
Child go and play  
No I wont give you reasons so dont ask why
