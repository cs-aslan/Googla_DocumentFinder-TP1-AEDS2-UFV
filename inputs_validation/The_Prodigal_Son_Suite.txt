I was done hoeing out in the fields for the day  
I was thinking of going I had to leave right away  
My life is just fading and oh I felt so alone  
The nearest young maiden was a full days ride from home  
  
My father was reading the holy books in his room  
My heart was just bleeding I knew I had to go soon  
He smiled and pointed at an old wooden chair  
I wanted to hold him but then I just wouldnt dare  
  
I said father theres so much to know  
Theres a world of things to see  
And Im ready to go and make a life for myself  
If you give me what is mine  
I will go if I can have your blessing  
But if you wont bless my journey Im gonna leave anyway  
Son Ive always tried my best for you  
And if you must be leaving home then go with the blessing of God  
  
Not too many days later I was well on my way  
I met a travelling stranger who seemed to have much to say  
He told me tales of the city and all the women hed had  
I asked him wasnt that sinful  
He said no it isnt that bad  
And then a few days later on an old city road  
We were drowning in laughter and we had women to hold  
And this went on quite a long time my father gave me a lot  
But when my pockets were empty my friends all left me to rot  
  
Then a famine hit and drained the land  
Everywhere I looked I saw starvation and a job was so hard to find  
I wandered through the city streets competing for the food of common beggers  
Until then Id never known hunger but now I wasnt too proud  
I finally found some employment feeding pigs on a farm  
I wasnt treated to kindly I had to sleep in the barn  
I had to eat with the swine  
The bread I ate was like stone  
It didnt take too much time until I was dreaming of home  
Oh the servants there are better fed  
If I could only have what my father gives them  
I would truly need nothing more  
Oh I will go and say to him  
Im no longer worthy to be in your family  
Will you take me as your servant and let me live with them  
  
It didnt take too long to pack my things  
I left with only what I wore  
As I prayed that I still had a home  
I was near home in site of the house  
My father just stared dropped open his mouth  
He ran up the road and fell to my feet and cried and cried  
Father Ive sinned heaven ashamed  
Im no longer worthy to wear your name  
Ive learned that my home is right where you are  
Oh father take me in  
Bring the best robe put it on my son  
Shoes for his feet hurry put them on  
This is my son who I thought had died  
Prepare a feast for my sons alive  
Ive prayed and prayed never heard a sound  
My son was lost oh thank you God hes found  
My son was dead and hes now alive  
Prepare a feast for my sons alive  
My son was dead  
My son was lost  
My sons returned in the hands of God
