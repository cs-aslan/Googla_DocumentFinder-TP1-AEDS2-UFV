I called you today  
Wanting a change  
I never meant to hurt anyone  
Never meant for you to pull out your guns  
But feelings wont stay  
In this meager parade  
Youre beating to a different drum  
In this lack of all the luster weve become  
  
Save your breath  
You know weve both  
Tried our best  
But its leaving  
  
This might as well be done  
Im falling with the sun  
When the hours getting sour wont save with time  
Im waving off the one  
Who wouldnt let me run  
Though we tried its a lie I cant keep dragging on  
Im untying this sinking stone  
  
Dont sit on the fence  
Living past tense  
Holding on to wishes and words  
Folding out a picture we blur  
Cause here in the end  
Im losing a friend  
Fighting back a tear when it burns  
Dividing up the pieces that we were  
  
Save your breath  
You know weve both  
Tried our best  
But its leaving  
  
This might as well be done  
Im falling with the sun  
When the hours getting sour wont save with time  
Im waving off the one  
Who wouldnt let me run  
Though we tried its a lie I cant keep dragging on  
Im untying this sinking stone  
  
I cant say youre all alone  
Im accepting what I own  
Here lies a blanket and not a bandage  
  
Im unable to restrain  
When the wake that we became  
Is drawing me under  
  
This might as well be done  
Im falling with the sun  
When the hours getting sour wont save with time  
Im waving off the one  
Who wouldnt let me run  
Though we tried its a lie I cant keep dragging on  
  
This might as well be done  
Im falling with the sun  
When the hours getting sour wont save with time  
Im waving off the one  
Who wouldnt let me run  
Though we tried its a lie I cant keep dragging on  
Im untying this sinking stone
