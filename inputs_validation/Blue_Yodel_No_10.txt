Something about you mama  
That sure gives me the blues  
It aint your drop stitch stockings  
It aint your blue buckled shoes  
  
You know purdy mama  
Im bound to love you some  
You know purdy mama  
Im bound to love you some  
Cause Ive done more for you  
Than anybody ever done  
You know it baby  
  
Got me a purdy mama  
Got me a bulldog too  
Got me a purdy mama  
Got me a bulldog too  
My purdy mama dont love me  
But my bulldog do  
  
Theres been a groundhog rootin  
Around my yard at night  
Theres been a groundhog rootin  
Around my yard at night  
From the way my mama been treatin me

Dont try to fool no girls  
I aint no cheatin man  
Dont try to fool no girls
