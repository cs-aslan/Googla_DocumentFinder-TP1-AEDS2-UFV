If youve ever had  
A broken heart  
You promise yourself  
To never let it happen again  
Ddont wanna think about it  
Dont wanna dream about it  
But it finds  
Its way back into your head  
  
The i love you s  
The i need you s  
Theyre only words  
That people say  
Theyre just words  
When theyre hand in hand  
With the games that people play  
  
If i never see  
The top of a mountain  
If i never set  
One foot in the sea  
I promise you  
Ill love you forever  
Youll always be  
The biggest part of me  
  
Chorus  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
I will follow  
Youve changed the way  
That i need to think  
In promise you  
Ill love you forever  
Youll always be  
The biggest part of me  
  
Take a look at me  
I let you have my heart  
I swore id never let it  
Happen again  
Im not mad about it  
But i know on you girl  
I can depend  
  
I love you s  
I need you s  
Are only words  
That people say  
Theyre just words  
When theyre hand in hand  
With the games  
That people play  
  
If i never see  
The top of a mountain  
If i never set  
One foot in the sea  
I promise you  
Ill love you forever  
Youll always be  
The biggest part of me  
  
Chorus  
  
I believe  
Yes i believe  
I believe in love again  
And i swear  
Ill always be there  
Isnt that the way  
That it should be  
  
If i never see  
The top of a mountain  
If i never set  
One foot in the see
