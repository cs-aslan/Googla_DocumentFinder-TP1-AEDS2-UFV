Theres a time for lies  
And a time for truth  
I say eye for an eye  
Eye for a tooth  
  
When I roamed young  
Id scavenge around  
Every nook and cranny  
Of our little town  
Its nice so nice to be  
  
Pull out the cannon boys  
Steal us some wine  
Puff Tijuana Smalls  
Shake hands with beef  
  
Shes so fine  
Shes so sweet  
Mom and Pop they raised her  
On huge slabs of meat  
  
Shes fine  
A man of nine  
Water derby day  
Twenty six pumps  
On a Crossman  
And its time to play  
  
Its nice so fine to be  
  
Pull out the cannon boys  
Steal us some wine  
Puff Tijuana Smalls  
Shake hands with beef
