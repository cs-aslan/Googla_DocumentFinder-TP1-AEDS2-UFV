Im leaving it all up up to you  
You decide what youre gonna do  
Now do you want my love  
Or are we through  
Thats why Im leaving it up to you  
You decide what youre gonna do  
Now do you want my love  
Or are we through  
Heres my heart in my hand  
And I I dont understand  
What did I what have I done wrong  
You know I worship the ground you walk on  
Thats why Im leaving it up to you  
You decide what youre gonna do  
Now do you want my love  
Or are we through
