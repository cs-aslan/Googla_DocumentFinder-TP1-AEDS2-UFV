Never gave you nothin  
People couldnt explain away  
Never gave you nothin  
Without something to gain  
Never could slow down enough  
To study a face but now  
I wanna know your name  
  
Chorus  
Hold my feet to the fire  
Til Im breaking a sweat  
Til I never forget  
Your calling  
Keep me on the line  
Give me the nerve  
Here its all in the serve  
  
Locked in the diamond lane  
I kept driving past it  
Better to be safe than learn  
What youre about  
Give me another chance  
To go where youre going now  
Im here to walk it out  
Im here to walk it out  
Im here to walk it out  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Its all in the serve  
Its all in the serve  
Here its all in the serve
