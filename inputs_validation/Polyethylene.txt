Go  
Disjointed we scare ourselves with all that we wanna be  
Just got paid and now youre going how long should you be  
If I get scared I just call you  
And I miss your glow as I unsettle  
Oh Ill always feel Ill always be  
Right  
  
One two three four  
  
So sell your suit and tie and come and live with me  
Leukemia schizophrenia polyethylene  
There is no significant risk to your health  
She used to be beautiful once as well  
  
Plastic bag middle class polyethylene  
Decaffeinate unleaded keep all surfaces clean  
If you dont believe in it sell your soul  
If you dont get into it no one will  
Oh Oh
