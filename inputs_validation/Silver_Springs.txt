You could be my silver spring  
Bluegreen colors flashin  
I would be your only dream  
Your shinin autumn ocean crashin  
Dont say that shes pretty  
And did you say that she loves you  
Baby I dont want to know  
  
So Ill begin not to love you  
Turn around youll see me runnin  
Ill say I loved you years ago  
And tell myself you never loved me no  
Dont say that shes pretty  
And did you say that she loves you  
Baby I dont want to know oh no  
And can you tell me was it worth it  
Baby I dont want to know  
  
Time cast a spell on you but you wont forget me  
I know I couldve loved you  
But you would not let me  
  
Time cast a spell on you but you wont forget me  
I was such a fool  
I know I couldve loved you  
But you would not let me  
Give me one more chance  
Ill follow you down til the sound of my voice  
Will haunt you  
Youll never get away from the sound  
Of the woman that loves you
