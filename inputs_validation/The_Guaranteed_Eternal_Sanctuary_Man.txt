I know a farmer who looks after the farm  
With water clear he cares for all his harvest  
I know a fireman who looks after the fire  
You cant you see hes fooled you all  
Yes hes here again cant you see hes fooled you all  
Share his peace  
Sign the lease  
Hes a supersonic scientist  
Hes the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man  
Look look into my mouth he cries  
And all the children lost down many paths  
I bet my life youll walk inside  
Hand in hand  
Gland in gland  
With a spoonful of miracle  
Hes the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man  
We will rock you rock you little snake  
We will keep you snug and warm
