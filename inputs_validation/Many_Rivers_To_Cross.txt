Many rivers to cross  
But I cant seem to find my way  
Wandering I am lost as I travel along  
The white cliffs of Dover  
Many rivers to cross and its only my will  
That keeps me alive  
Ive been licked washed up for years and  
I merely survive because of my pride  
  
And this loneliness wont leave me alone  
Its such a drag to be in on your own  
My woman left and she didnt say why  
Well I guess I gotta try  
Many rivers to cross but where to begin  
Im playing for time  
Therell be times when I find myself thinking  
Of committing some dreadful crime  
  
Ive got many rivers to cross  
But I cant seem to find my way  
Wandering I am lost as I travel along  
The white cliffs of Dover  
Many rivers to cross and its only my will  
That keeps me alive  
Ive been licked washed up for my years and  
I merely survive because of my pride
