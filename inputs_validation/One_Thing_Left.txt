My life is one big smile  
As I cross off the things on my list  
The splendor goes on for miles  
I dont know what could be left to wish  
Im just living the dream  
I do all right if you know what I mean  
  
Chorus  
And Ive closed the door  
And locked it tight  
And turned off every single light  
Another perfect day is all but through  
Now me getting over you  
Is the one thing left to do  
Yeah yeah yeah  
The whole world has gone insane  
The paper says so every day  
And I can always feel the rain  
Even when the suns in the way  
Yeah just living the dream  
I wish my eyes could forget what theyve seen  
  
Chorus  
Ive closed the door  
And locked it tight  
And turned off every single light  
And walked away just like you asked me to  
Now me getting over you  
Is the one thing left to do  
Yeah I know that its me whos not well  
But theres no one but you I can tell  
  
Chorus  
As I close the door  
And lock it tight  
And turn off every single light  
And walk away just like you asked me to  
But me getting over you  
Is the one thing left to do  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Is the one thing left to do
