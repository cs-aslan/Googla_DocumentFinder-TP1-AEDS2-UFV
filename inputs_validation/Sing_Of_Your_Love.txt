I love who Ive become in You  
Youve changed me from deep within  
Without You I cant live  
I need the touch of Your strong hand  
  
I only live and breathe in You  
Because of You Ive been made whole  
Without You I cant live  
I need the touch of Your strong hand  
  
And I will sing of Your love  
And Your mercy forever  
Reaching down from above  
With a plan for my future  
Ill forever proclaim  
All the goodness and power of Your name  
I will worship You Lord all my days  
  
I will worship You forever  
I will worship You forever
