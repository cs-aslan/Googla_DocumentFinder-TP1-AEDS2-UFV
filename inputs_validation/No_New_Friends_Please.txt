Id like to be your friend but think of all the friends Ive been  
I never thought thered come a day I never thought Id hear me say  
Id disappoint you in the end no new friends please no new friends for me  
Memories of old acquaintances keep on coming back  
Some I met at garden parties buddies by the railroad track  
Id like to be your friend  
  
What we are is selfappointed theres nothing we can do  
Wed lose touch with one another and that aint fair to me or you  
Id like to be your friend
