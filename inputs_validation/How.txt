I have been searching for your touch  
Unlike any touch Ive ever known  
  
And I never thought about you much  
Till Im broken down and all alone  
  
No I dont understand the meaning of love  
I do not mind if I die trying oh  
  
Took you for granted  
When you lifted me up  
  
Im asking for your help  
I am going through hell  
Afraid nothing can save me  
But the sound of your voice  
  
You cut out all the noise  
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now  
Id kill if I could take you back  
But how  
But how  
  
I can feel it in my guts  
Whats going on with him now  
  
Dont patronize me with lies  
Ima man be a woman now  
  
I have been bound by the shackles of love  
And I dont mind if I die tied up  
  
Took you for granted  
When you lifted me up  
  
Im asking for your help  
I am going through hell  
Afraid nothing can save me  
But the sound of your voice  
  
You cut out all the noise  
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now  
Id kill if I could take you back  
But how  
But how  
But how  
But how  
  
Why must we be so ugly  
And please do not speak ill of me  
Why does the one you love  
Become the one who makes you want to cry  
  
And why  
Why  
Why  
  
No I dont understand the meaning of love  
I do not mind if I die trying  
I do not mind if I die trying  
I do not mind if I die trying
