From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore  
From the queen of flowing mountains to the south bells by the shore  
Shes mighty tall and handsome shes known quite well by all  
Shes the combination on the Wabash Cannonball  
She came down from Birmingham one cold December day  
As she rolled into the station you could hear all the people say  
Theres a gal from Tennessee shes long and shes tall  
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball  
Our eastern statesre dandy so all the people say  
From New York to St Louis and Chicago by the way  
From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall  
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball  
So heres to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand  
And always be remembered in the ports throughout the land  
His earthly race is over the curtains round him fall  
Well carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball  
So listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar  
As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore  
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hobos squall  
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball  
Youre traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
