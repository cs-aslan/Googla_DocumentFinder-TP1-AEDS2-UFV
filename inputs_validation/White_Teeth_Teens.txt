We wouldnt be seen dead here in the day yeah  
I guess youre lucky that its dark now  
And if I like it then well stay  
Impress the empress take a shot now  
  
We got the glow in our mouths  
White teeth teens are out  
White teeth teens are  
  
Up for it  
I know you love it when the hairpins started to drop  
I like your reckoning  
But we got our methods and theres nothing here to stop  
To stop this  
  
If you want well help tonight to split his schemes  
Give the bruises out like gifts  
Youll get the picture of your dreams  
I wont be smiling but the notes from my admirers  
Fill my dashboard just the same  
  
We got the glow in our mouths  
White teeth teens are out  
White teeth teens are  
  
Up for it  
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop  
I like your reckoning  
But we got our methods and theres nothing here to stop  
To stop this when were  
  
Up for it  
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop  
I like your reckoning  
But we got our methods and theres nothing here to stop  
To stop this  
  
And everything works out so good  
I wear the robe like no one could  
  
Ill let you in on something big  
I am not a white teeth teen  
I tried to join but never did  
The way they are the way they seem is something else its in the blood  
Their molars blinking like the lights in the underpass where we all sit  
And do nothing and love it  
  
And everything works out so good  
I wear the robe like no one could  
  
And everything works out so good  
I wear the robe like no one could  
  
And everything works out so good  
I wear the robe like no one could  
  
White teeth teens are out  
And everything works out so good  
I wear the robe like no one could  
White teeth teens are out
