I was so close to the edge  
I was falling down  
You come and turn it around  
And let me see again let me see you again  
Caught in the eye of the storm  
I was sure Id drown  
But you made me reach deep down  
Assured of the strength Id found  
The strength Id found yeah  
  
Mighty rivers run right through me  
I fall in if I dive in too deep  
In the shadows swim with daydreams  
As far away as they can take me oh  
  
There was the time  
I would go with the rolling tide  
I wanted an easy ride  
I thought it was all a game  
The thunder struck and it changed  
  
And then I was scared I was scared I was terrified  
But you made me reach inside  
As certain that Id survive Id survive  
But all night Im lying awake  
It feels like my bodys afraid to say  
Too much to put into words  
A dam about to burst ohhoh  
  
Mighty rivers run right through me  
I fall in if I dive in too deep  
In the shadows swim with daydreams  
As far away as they can take me oh  
  
Only you understand me  
Want the truth not the fantasy  
Im as true as I can be  
Hear me now  
  
Mighty rivers run right through me  
I fall in if I dive in too deep  
In the shadows swim with daydreams  
As far away as they can take me oh  
As far away as they can take me oh  
  
Mighty rivers run right through me  
I fall in if I dive in too deep  
In the shadows swim with daydreams  
As far away as they can take me oh
