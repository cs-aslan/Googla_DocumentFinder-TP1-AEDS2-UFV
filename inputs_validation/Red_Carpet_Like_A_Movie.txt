Yea  
Gettin more scrill deal or no deal uh  
Yea chubby bags  
Heavy hustle course the gang uh  
  
On and on and on and on and  
We just drink and smoke until the morning  
Youre homegirls texting you ignoring them  
Hit the weed giggle a little then you get horny  
I hit the weed get on my mission and then Im goin in  
Knowin damn well they got boyfriends  
Till they get the front door asked her which floor Im on  
Im at the top polo socks and pajamas on  
She smoke chronic know the lyrics to all my songs  
Its like I died and went to heaven me and all my dogs  
Thats why we sip champagne till the bottles gone  
Roll weed on ya take the bitches I dont follow yall  
  
Chorus  
I can never make up this if I wanted to  
Its real talk what Im saying to you  
I dont wanna wake up knowing just one thought of you  
Got me fallen I cant get up get up  
So will you costar with me  
Cause my life is like a movie  
  
Champagne parties in my hotel  
Her friends dont even smoke but they diggin the smell  
Exboyfriend ringin ya cell  
But every effort to save yous to no avail  
Nothin but starters on my team nigga coach fail  
And all we do is get high and watch the dough swim  
Relatively fly like a meteor or spaceship  
Party every night and early morning get wasted  
All the way 100 you others niggas are makeshift  
Roll that rapper weed you smoke and dont wanna taste it lets face it  
She wanna fly where the planes is  
Got her testin out all of my trees mintflavors  
She  the paper  
  
Chorus x2  
  
We stay smokin that lalala  
Easy rider joint roller my 95  
You can prolly smell it in the car when we ridin by  
More like all the way up we aint kinda high  
We more than fly introduce you to the gang members  
Thats Taylor like blood no gang members  
No names enter and now you on champagne land  
Im on an island of hard liquor  
It be fans joint lit and guitar pickers  
Goin nowhere for awhile I got good snickers  
Now you wanna mingle heard young single  
Big face chips baby stack my Pringles  
You call it tight I say wellfit  
And we aint takin no prisoners now you jealous  
In ya state please make sure the weed great  
Fresh produce purple and green crates  
Groove crisp bills in my jean pants  
Telly room prolly doin the Uncle Snoop dance yea  
  
Chorus x2
