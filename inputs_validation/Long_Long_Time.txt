Love will abide take things in stride  
Sounds like good advice but theres no one at my side  
And time washes clean loves wounds unseen  
Thats what someone told me but I dont know what it means  
  
Cause Ive done everything I know to try and make you mine  
And I think Im gonna love you for a long long time  
  
Caught in my fears  
Blinking back the tears  
I cant say you hurt me when you never let me near  
And I never drew one response from you  
All the while you fell all over girls you never knew  
Cause Ive done everything I know to try and make you mine  
And I think its gonna hurt me for a long long time  
  
Wait for the day  
Youll go away  
Knowing that you warned me of the price Id have to pay  
And lifes full of flaws  
Who knows the cause  
Living in the memory of a love that never was  
Cause Ive done everything I know to try and change your mind  
and I think Im gonna miss you for a long long time  
Cause Ive done everything I know to try and make you mine  
And I think Im gonna love you for a long long time
