Oh when you cross that line that you know you cant erase  
To fall in lust not love aint no sin at all  
And tell me when your witchor best friends friend  
Do you still feel outta place  
No thanks I took that ride  
God only knows I tried believin  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their heart and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies  
The first time you look for love  
You find you dont know jack yeah  
So much for mind games you play to win  
Cuz first you lose your hearts desire  
Then you get it back  
But ignorance aint bliss  
Theres so much more behind the kissIm feelin  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their heart and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies  
When loneliness and paranoia feeds me  
God help the personfffwho needs meyeaah  
If ignorance is bliss then take me off the list  
Im leaving  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their hearts and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies
