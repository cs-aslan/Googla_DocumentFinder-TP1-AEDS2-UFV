Your precious sweetheart shes so faithful  
Shes so true oh yeah  
Her dreams are tumblin  
Her world is crumblin  
Because of you uh uh  
One day youll hurt her just once too much  
And when you finally lose your tender touch  
  
Chorus  
Shoobedoobedoobedoodaday  
Her feet may wander her heart may stray  
Shoobedoobedoobedoodaday  
You gonna send your baby straight to me  
  
Im gonna give her all the lovin  
Within my heart oh yeah  
Im gonna patch up every single little dream  
You torn apart understand me now  
And when she tells you shes cried her last tear  
Heaven knows Im gonna be somewhere near  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh yeahyeah you better  
You better listen to me yeah  
  
Heartaches are callin and tears are fallin  
Because of you oh yeah  
And when youre gone shell know  
Im the one to go to her rescue  
Maybe you didnt know that baby  
Youre gonna leave her one too many times  
And when you come back that  
Girls gonna be mine all mine
