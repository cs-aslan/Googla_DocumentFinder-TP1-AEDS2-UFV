Children grow and women producing  
Men go working  
Some go stealing  
Everyones got to make a living

Went from a little to a lot this year  
Everybody mad at the socks that I wear  
I know where Im goin and I croydons where Im from  
You hear LOX in your ear

No matter where I go I know where I came from from the Bronx  
Dont be fooled by the jocks that I got

Im down to earth like this  
Rockin this business

Rumors got me laughing kid  
Love my life and my public  
Put God first  
Then cant forget to stay real  
To me its like breathing

No matter where I go I know where I came from from the Bronx  
  
It take hard work to cash checks  
So dont be fooled by the rocks that I got now assets  
You get back what you put out  
Even if you take the good route  
Cant count the hood out  
After a while you know who to blink with  
Just keep it real with the ones came in with  
Best thing to do is stay low LOX and JLo  
Act like they dont but they know

Dont be fooled by the cocks that I got  
Im still Im still timmy from the block  
Used to have a little now I have a lot  
No matter where I go I know where I came from from the Bronx  
Dont be fooled by the rocks that I got  
Im still Im still timmy from the block  
Used to have a little now I have a lot  
No matter where I go I know where I came from from the Bronx
