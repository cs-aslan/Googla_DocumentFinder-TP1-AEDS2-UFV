Ive been waiting every night after school  
For five long years five long years  
Ill keep waiting there for five nights a week  
Cause Im no fool  
  
Ooh reeling and arocking  
Rolling till the break of  
Ooh reeling and arocking  
Rolling till the school breaks out  
  
Im thirty but I feel like sixteen  
I might even know your daddy  
Im dirty but my body is clean  
I might even be your daddy  
  
Ooh reeling and arocking  
Rolling till the break of  
Ooh reeling and arocking  
Rolling till the break of  
  
I like you will you like me yes  
Sorry but I have to grab you  
You look better completely undressed  
Sorry but I have to have you  
  
Im thirty but I feel like sixteen  
How would you like some candy  
Im thinking more than a kiss  
With me spank me grab me
