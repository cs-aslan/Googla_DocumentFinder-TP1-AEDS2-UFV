First verse  
  
I thought love was only true in fairy tales  
Meant for someone else but not for me  
Love was out to get me Baddabudumbadum  
Thats the way it seems Baddabudumbadum  
Dissapointment Haunted all my dreams  
  
Chorus  
  
And then I saw her face  
Now Im a believer  
Not a trace  
Of doubt in ma mind  
Im in love Oh Im a believer  
I couldnt leave her if I tried  
  
Verse 2  
  
I thought love was more or less a given thing  
Seems the more you give  
The less I got  
Whats the use in trying Baddabudumbadum  
All you get is pain Baddabudumbadum  
When I needed sunshine I got rain  
  
Chorus
