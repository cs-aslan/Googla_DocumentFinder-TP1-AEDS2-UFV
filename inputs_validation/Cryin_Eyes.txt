Whos gonna dry your cryin eyes  
Whos gonna wake you up  
To that big surprise  
Whos gonna dry your cryin eyes  
  
You say that all your life  
Youve been a free bird  
Theres been nobody over you  
And you always have to  
Have the last word  
Because one feels better than two  
  
Whos gonna dry your cryin eyes  
Whos gonna wake you up  
To that big surprise  
Whos gonna dry your cryin eyes  
  
You say your lifes  
Like riding on a fast train  
Its easy to see far away  
But right up close  
Its just a blurry haze  
Flyin by from day to day  
  
Whos gonna dry your cryin eyes
