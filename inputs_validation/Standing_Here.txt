Im standing on a hilltop  
A hundred miles from home  
I can see the light surrounds me  
I want you to show me round  
Im standing here  
I really dont think you could know  
That Im in heaven when you smile  
  
Im drifting through the city  
Im swinging from a tree  
I can touch but you cant feel me  
You hear me as you sleep  
  
Im standing here  
I really dont think you could know  
That Im in heaven when you smile  
And Im everywhere  
I really dont think you could know  
That Im in heaven when you smile  
But I dont think you think like I do  
No matter how how hard I try  
I always thought Id have the answer  
Let me tell you what Ive got  
  
Im looking through your window  
I might just have the key  
Over me my freefall baby  
You hear me as you speak  
  
Im standing here  
I really dont think you could know  
That Im in heaven when you smile  
Im standing here  
I really dont think you could know  
That Im in heaven when you smile  
  
But Im everywhere  
I really dont think you could know  
That Im in heaven when you smile  
But I dont think you think like I do  
No matter how how hard I try  
I always thought I had the answers  
Let me tell you what Ive got  
Oh let it rot I made them stop  
  
I could park a juggernaut in your mouth  
And I can feel a hurricane when you shout  
I should be safe forever in your arms  
I should be safe forever in your arms  
I could park a juggernaut in your mouth  
And I can feel a hurricane when you shout  
I should be safe forever in your arms  
I should be safe forever in your arms
