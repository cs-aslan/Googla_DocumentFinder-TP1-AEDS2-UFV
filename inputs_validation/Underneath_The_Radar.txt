Unknown  
Unseen  
We live underneath the radar  
No sign  on screen  
We dance underneath the radar  
  
Between the walls  well hey  
Were just too small to make a fuss about it  
Did something fall well hey  
What is the point in losin sleep about it  
  
See ya later  see ya later  
Hipanononono  
Hipanononono  
See ya later  call me  
  
We dance underneath the radar  
We live underneath the bomb  
When you live underneath the radar  
Theres no way that youre ever gonna get far  
So get hip  
  
We speak  
Unheard  
Like ants we dance between the towers  
We sleep  
They move  
Come sailin over the horizon  
  
Between the walls  well hey  
Were just too small to make a fuss about it  
Did something fall well hey  
What is the point in losin sleep about it  
  
See ya later  see ya later  
Hipanononono  
Hipanononono  
See ya later  call me  
  
We dance underneath the radar  
We live underneath the bomb  
When you live underneath the radar  
Theres no way that youre ever gonna get far  
So get hip  
  
He says I am the doctor   
In a be 52  
I come across the horizon   
Drop my love on you  
Im gonna WOOOOO ya all  Watch out  
Im gonna WOOOOO ya all  
See ya later  
  
See ya later  see ya later  
Hipanononono

See ya later  call me  
  
Between the walls  well hey  
Were just too small to make a fuss about it  
Did something fall well hey  
What is the point in losin sleep about it  
  
We dance underneath the radar  
We live underneath the bomb  
When you live underneath the radar  
Theres no way that youre ever gonna get far  
So get hip  
  
All the best
