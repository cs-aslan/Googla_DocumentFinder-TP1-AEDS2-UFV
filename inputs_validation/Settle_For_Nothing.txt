A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home  
Hatred passed on passed on and passed on  
A world of violent rage  
But its one that I can recognize  
Having never seen the color of my fathers eyes  
Yes I dwell in hell but its a hell that I can grip  
I tried to grip my family  
But I slipped  
  
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane  
I gotta nine a sign a set and now I gotta name  
  
Read my writing on the wall  
Noones here to catch me when I fall  
Death is on my side suicide  
  
A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home  
Hatred passed on passed on and passed on  
A world of violent rage  
But its one that I can recognize  
Having never seen the color of my fathers eyes  
Yes I dwell in hell but its a hell that I can grip  
I tried to grip my family  
But I slipped  
  
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane  
I gotta nine a sign a set and now I gotta name  
  
Read my writing on the wall  
Noones here to catch me when I fall  
Caught between my culture and the system genocide  
  
Read my writing on the wall  
Noones here to catch me when I fall  
If ignorance is bliss then knock the smile off my face  
Yeah  
  
If we dont take action now  
We settle for nothing later  
Settle for nothing now  
And well settle for nothing later  
If we dont take action now  
We settle for nothing later  
Well settle for nothing now  
And well settle for nothing later  
  
If we dont take action now  
Well settle for nothing later  
We settle for nothing now  
And well settle for nothing later  
If we dont take action now  
We settle for nothing later  
Well settle for nothing now  
And well settle for nothing later
