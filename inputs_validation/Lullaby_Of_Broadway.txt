Come on along and listen to  
The lullaby of Broadway  
The hip hooray and ballyhoo  
The lullaby of Broadway  
The rumble of a subway train  
The rattle of the taxis  
The daffodils who entertain  
At Angelos and Maxis  
  
When a Broadway baby says good night  
Its early in the morning  
Manhattan babies dont sleep tight  
Until the dawn  
  
Good night baby  
Good night the milkmans on his way  
Sleep tight baby  
Sleep tight lets call it a day  
Hey  
  
The band begins to go to town  
And everyone goes crazy  
You rockabye your baby round  
Til everything gets hazy  
Hushabye Ill buy you this and that  
You hear a daddy saying  
And baby goes home to her flat  
To sleep all day  
  
Good night baby  
Good night the milkmans on his way  
Sleep tight baby  
Sleep tight lets call it a day  
  
Listen to the lullaby  
Of old Broad way
