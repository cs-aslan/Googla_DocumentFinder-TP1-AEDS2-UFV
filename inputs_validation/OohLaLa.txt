Poor old granddad I laughed at all his words  
I thought he was a bitter man  
He spoke of womens ways  
He said theyll trap you and theyll use you and before you even know  
For love is blind and youre far too kind  
Boy dont ever let it show  
  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was younger  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was stronger  
  
The cancan such a pretty show  
It will steal your heart away  
But backstage back on earth again  
All them dressing rooms are grey  
They come on strong and it aint too long  
For they make you feel a man  
But love is blind and you soon will find yeah  
Youre just a boy again  
  
He said I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was younger  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was stronger  
  
When you want her lips you get her cheek  
Makes you wonder where you are  
And if you want some more then shes fast asleep  
Leaves you twinkling with the stars  
I say poor young grandson theres nothing I can say  
Youll have to learn it just like me  
And thats the hardest way ooh la la  
Yeah ooh la la  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Oh ooh la la  
Everybody sing  
  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was younger  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was stronger  
  
I said I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was younger  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was stronger  
  
Hey I said ooh la la ooh la la yeah yeah  
Ooh la la oh ooh la la la la la la  
Say ooh la la  
Oh ooh la la la la la la la la la  
Oh ooh la la  
I said ooh la la  
Everybody sing  
  
I said I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was younger  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was stronger  
  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was younger  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was stronger  
Ooh la la
