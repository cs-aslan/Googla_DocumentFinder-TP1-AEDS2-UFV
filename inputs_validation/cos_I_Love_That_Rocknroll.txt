Where has all that Rocknroll gone  
Oh wont somebody tell me where  
Cause it used to be when I was young  
That you could hear them playing it everywhere  
But now it seems theyre all so hooked on fashion  
The musics taken second place  
Everyone it seems has one obsession  
To beat the others in the race  
And it just dont feel right to me  
No no it just dont feel right to me  
  
Cause I love that Rocknroll too much  
And I dont wanna see it ever waving goodbye  
Yeah I love that Rocknroll too too much  
And I couldnt bear to see it go by  
Rocknroll youre too much to deny  
  
Oh where has all that music gone  
There must be some mistake  
From something that was so much fun  
They were burning bridges in their wake  
O K Everything has got to keep changing  
I know it has to be that way  
But isnt it too high a price were paying  
Were losing most of yesterday  
And it just dont feel right to me
