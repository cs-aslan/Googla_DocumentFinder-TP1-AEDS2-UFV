What am I gonna do when the sun goes down  
And all the lights are low  
What am I gonna do when I recall  
The love we used to know  
I remember the happiness we knew  
Darling cant we make up soon  
Cause I dont know what Im gonna do  
  
What am I gonna do on Wednesday night  
When I used to call you on the phone  
What am I gonna say at the Record Hop  
When I show up alone  
There all ask me whats become of you  
Darling cant we make up soon  
Cause I dont know what Im gonna do  
  
At the movies or at the football game  
Please believe me nothings gonna be the same  
  
So what am I gonna do on Saturday night  
Whan everything goes wrong  
How am I gonna feel when the radio  
Plays our favourite song  
Im so lonely just like Mr Blue  
Darling cant we make up soon  
Cause I dont know what Im gonna do
