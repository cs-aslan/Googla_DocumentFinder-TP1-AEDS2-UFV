So now theres somebody new  
These dreams Ive been dreaming  
Have all fallen through  
You say Ill be fine  
It only takes time  
Someday that may be true  
  
But its too soon to tell  
Its too soon to say  
Maybe someday Ill be able to wish you well  
But right now  
Its just too soon to tell  
  
Its all for the best so you say  
You never intended to hurt me this way  
You want to hear  
I wont drown in my tears  
Well baby the best that I can say  
  
Is its too soon to tell  
Its too soon to say  
Maybe someday Ill be able to wish you well  
But right now its just too soon to tell  
Well right now  
Its just too soon to tell
