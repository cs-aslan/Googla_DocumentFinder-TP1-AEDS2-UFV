Im calling to tell you its over yes darling youre now free to go  
Youre saying youre sorry you hurt me but you hurt me much more than you know  
Youre asking me where this call comes from oh I hope that you wont interfere  
In your new romance turns out a failure heres where youll find me my dear  
Im just on the blue side of lonesome right next to the Heartbreak Hotel  
In a tavern thats known as Three Teardrops on a barstool not doing so well  
The hands of the clock never alter for things never change in this place  
Theres no present no past and no future for the ones who have lost in loves
race  
  
The hands of the clock
