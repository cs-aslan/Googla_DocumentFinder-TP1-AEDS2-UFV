But you wanna be you aint shit to me  
Playa It aint hard for you to get to me  
Playa my real dogs theyll spit for me  
So if you want whats mine you gots to have the heart  
Ive seen em come and Ive seen em part  
If you aint want beef then why did you start  
Front from the light catch shots after dark  
Suffer duck or youll catch these  
On the spot red dots make em all believe  
Aint nobody kicking the rhymes like these  
See I do the things that they cant achieve  
So dont start bassin n Ill start pacing  
Bets on that youll be disgracing  
More hotter than the sun  
Im living on the run  
Because im public enemy number one

OneOneOneOneOne  
  
Let me ask you what you got against me  
Is it my girl or is it the bentley  
Is it my house or maybe its all three  
I just came up and youre all against me  
Now ask yourself why is he number one  
Now ask yourself whos done what hes done  
Then ask yourself youre fit for the long run  
You think its a game cause you fucked the wrong one  
Always with God and I dont swing solo  
Never back down when I gotta throw dolo  
Wanna see me out but I just wont go though  
Pretty young things wanna have my photo  
One in the room hangin on the wall  
In rememberance that I rocked em all  
Got no time for those that think small  
Grill me in the club cause they cant ball  
Hate shot callers  
Hate them ballers  
Back in control now I call orders  
Its no fun fleeing under the gun  
Cause they got me public enemy number one

OneOneOneOneOne  
  
All you suckers liars court testifiers  
Wanna infiltrate and break my empire  
I spit lines hit rhymes  
Keep dimes sweating  
Giving them the juice that theyre not gettin  
A bona fide playa now who got the flavor  
A non stop rhythm rock poetry sayer  
Im the life saver the New York mayor  
Before you try me you better say your prayers  
My word to the wise is Do not cry  
You know that im gone then say dont die  
I take what I find put a beat to they rhyme  
Thought it was over but I crept from behind  
Wanna try to stop me from speaking my mind  
Almost 2000 and running out of time  
Almost to the point when I wanna bust nines  
A lot of strange faces I can only trust mine  
Soldiers in position all on the front line  
Dont make a move till I give them the sign  
Known as the poetical lyrical miracle son  
Because im public enemy number one  
  
OneOneOneOneOne  
OneOneOneOneOne  
  
Yeah yeah thats right Puff  
Thats what Im talkin about love  
Sparklin and glistenin on these motherfuckers  
These niggas is walkin around like little bitches  
Talkin about what you got and what they aint got  
They got a little jealous and wanna bring you down  
But fuck dat they just mad  
Cause you got all the ladies  
And you pushin them bentleys not mercedes bentleys  
You know and thats just the way the story goes  
And thats just the way the story goes  
Fuck you niggas and hoes
