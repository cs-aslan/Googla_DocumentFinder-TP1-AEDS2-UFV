Had a dream about you baby had a dream about me and you  
Had a dream and woke up crying  
Well I can roll but I just cant rock  
And the times going by ticktock  
For the heart I just cant love noone but you  
  
Well Im high and dry and lonely Im as lonely as can be  
And I stare out of my window  
Well I can play but I just cant win  
And the weathers looking dim  
For the heart I just cant love noone but you  
  
For the heart  
For the heart  
For the heart I just cant love noone but you  
  
For the heart  
For the heart  
For the heart I just cant love noone but you  
  
Had a dream about you baby had a dream about me and you  
Had a dream and woke up crying  
Well I can roll but I just cant rock  
And the times going by ticktock  
For the heart I just cant love noone but you  
  
For the heart  
For the heart  
For the heart I just cant love noone but you  
  
For the heart  
For the heart  
For the heart I just cant love noone but you  
Well for the heart  
For the heart  
For the heart I just cant love noone but you  
Yes for the heart  
For the heart  
For the heart I just cant love noone but you
