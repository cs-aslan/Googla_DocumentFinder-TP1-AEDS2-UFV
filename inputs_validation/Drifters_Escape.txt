Oh help me in my weakness  
I heard the drifter say  
As they carried him from the court room  
And were taking him away  
Well my trip hasnt been a pleasant one  
And my time it isnt long  
And I still do not know  
What is was that Ive done wrong  
  
Well the judge he cast his robe aside  
A tear came to his eye  
Well you fail to understand he said  
Why must you even try  
Outside the crowd was stirring  
You could hear it from the door  
Inside the judge was stepping down  
While the jury cried for more more more  
Cried for more cried for more  
  
Hey you better leave that boys soul alone  
  
Oh stop that passing the jury  
Grab me a tendon and me a nurse  
Oh the trial was bad enough  
Yes but this is ten times worse  
Just then bolt of lightning  
Showed the court house out of shape  
And while everybody knelt to pray  
The drifter made his escape  
The drifter did his escape  
Yeah  
So long
