You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand  
You see somebody naked and you say Who is that man  
You try so hard but you dont understand  
Just what you will say when you get home  
Because something is happening here but you dont know what it is  
Do you Mr Jones  
  
You raise up your head and you ask Is this where it is  
And somebody points to you and says Its his  
And you say Whats mine and somebody else says Well what is  
And you say Oh my God am I here all alone  
But something is happening and you dont know what it is  
Do you Mr Jones  
  
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek  
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak  
And says How does it feel to be such a freak  
And you say Impossible as he hands you a bone  
And something is happening here but you dont know what it is  
Do you Mr Jones  
  
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks  
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination  
But nobody has any respect anyway they already expect you to all give a check  
To taxdeductible charity organizations  
  
Ah youve been with the professors and theyve all liked your looks  
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks  
Youve been through all of F Scott Fitzgeralds books  
Youre very wellread its wellknown  
But something is happening here and you dont know what it is  
Do you Mr Jones  
  
Well the sword swallower he comes up to you and then he kneels  
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels  
And without further notice he asks you how it feels  
And he says Here is your throat back thanks for the loan  
And you know something is happening but you dont know what it is  
Do you Mr Jones  
  
Now you see this oneeyed midget shouting the word Now  
And you say For what reason and he says How  
And you say What does this mean and he screams back Youre a cow  
Give me some milk or else go home  
And you know somethings happening but you dont know what it is  
Do you Mr Jones  
  
Well you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown  
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground  
There ought to be a law against you comin around  
You should be made to wear earphones  
Cause something is happening and you dont know what it is  
Do you Mr Jones
