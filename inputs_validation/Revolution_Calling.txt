For a price Id do about anything  
Except pull the trigger  
For that Id need a pretty good cause  
Then I heard of Dr X  
The man with the cure  
Just watch the television  
Yeah youll see theres something going on  
  
Got no love for politicians  
Or that crazy scene in DC  
Its just a power mad town  
But the time is ripe for changes  
Theres a growing feeling  
That taking a chance on a new kind of vision is due  
  
I used to trust the media  
To tell me the truth tell us the truth  
But now Ive seen the payoffs  
Everywhere I look  
Who do you trust when everyones a crook  
  
Revolution calling  
Revolution calling  
Revolution calling you  
Theres a Revolution calling  
Revolution calling  
Gotta make a change  
Gotta push gotta push it on through  
  
Im tired of all this bullshit  
They keep selling me on TV  
About the communist plan  
And all the shady preachers  
Begging for my cash  
Swiss bank accounts while giving their  
Secretaries the slam  
  
Theyre all in Penthouse now  
Or Playboy magazine million dollar stories to tell  
I guess Warhol wasnt wrong  
Fame fifteen minutes long  
Everyones using everybody making the sale  
  
I used to think  
That only Americas way way was right  
But now the holy dollar rules everybodys lives  
Gotta make a million doesnt matter who dies  
  
Revolution calling  
Revolution calling  
Revolution calling you  
Theres a Revolution calling  
Revolution calling  
Gotta make a change  
Gotta push gotta push it on through  
  
I used to trust the media  
To tell me the truth tell us the truth  
But now Ive seen the payoffs  
Everywhere I look  
Who do you trust when everyones a crook  
  
Revolution calling  
Revolution calling  
Revolution calling you  
Theres a Revolution calling  
Revolution calling  
Gotta make a change  
Gotta push gotta push it on through
