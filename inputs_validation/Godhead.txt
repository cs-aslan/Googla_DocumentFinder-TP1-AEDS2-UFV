No Krishna Buddha Jesus in my soul  
Til the sun breaks through again  
Down into nothing as I lose myself  
In the perfections of Zen  
She said I got the answer  
I said Im curious can you write that down my friend  
It said theres nothing in the real world  
So why should we pretend zero  
Godhead  
We got nothing  
We got everything  
I took a page out of Unpunished  
And I flew a paper plane  
But there is nothing in the real world  
But the cool cool cool of soul  
And Ive got nothing in my pockets  
But lose change and gold zero  
And Im trying to get somewhere  
In a room with glow  
The church mice are singing now  
What John Lee Hooker knows  
Godhead  
We got nothing  
We got everything  
Im falling backwards in her mirrored room  
In her mirrored room tonight  
She looks so good  
And I feel fine  
As she says we might make it to Godhead
