I could tell you a story from another day in time  
How a high falootin woman tried to make me walk the line  
She was into changin too damn hard to please  
And the last time I saw her she was down on her knees  
  
Born under the sign of the Gemini twins  
Theres two sides to me and they aint even friends  
All sides are rising and there aint no in between  
When Im bad Im bad when Im good Im the best you ever seen  
  
Sometimes Im out a prowlin and carryin on  
Too high to know when its time to take it home  
When Im like that its hard to leave the women alone  
It aint easy thinkin right with a good looking wrong  
  
For another sign of the Gemini twins  
This two sides to me and me aint even friends  
All sides are rising in the rainbow in between  
When Im good Im good when Im bad Im the worst you ever seen  
  
Theres a good hearted woman waitin when I come in  
She dont wasting time and asking me about where Ive been  
She keeps it all together and to wish that you could see  
Know she goes about bring it out the best side of me  
  
Born under the sign of the Gemini twins  
Theres two sides to me and they aint even friends  
All signs are rising and there aint no in between  
When Im bad Im bad when Im good Im the best you ever seen
