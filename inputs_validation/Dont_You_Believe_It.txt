If you should hear  
That someone new  
Has eased the pain  
Of losing you  
  
Chorus  
Dont you believe it  
Not for a moment  
Dont you believe it  
Because it isnt true  
  
Those angry words  
That made us part  
Put out the flame  
Thats in my heart  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I havent changed  
I still love you  
And it will always be  
  
I only hope and  
I pray each night  
Youll feel the  
Same about me  
  
So if you hear  
Some false alarms  
Like youre not welcome  
In my arms  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Oh how I still love you
