Why cant I lay low  
Why cant I say what I mean  
Why dont I stay home  
And get myself into some boring routine  
  
Why cant I calm down  
Why is it always a fight  
I cant get unwound  
Why do I throw myself into the night  
  
Im on the outside  
I dont fit into the groove  
Now I aint a bad guy  
So tell me what am I trying to prove  
  
Why cant I cool out  
Why dont I button my lip  
Why do I lash out  
Why is it I always shoot from the hip  
  
I cruise from Houston to Canal Street  
A misfit and a rebel  
I see the winos talking to themselves  
And I can understand  
Why is it everytime I go out  
I always seem to get in trouble  
I guess I made an impression on somebody  
North of Hester and south of Grand  
  
And so in my small way  
Im a big man on Mulberry street  
I dont mean all day  
Only at night when Im light on my feet  
  
What else have I got  
That Id be trying to hide  
Maybe a blind spot  
I havent seen from the sensitive side  
  
But you know in my own heart  
Im a big man on Mulberry street  
I play the whole part  
I leave a big tip with every receipt  
  
Im so romantic  
Im such a passionate man  
Sometimes I panic  
What if nobody finds out who I am
