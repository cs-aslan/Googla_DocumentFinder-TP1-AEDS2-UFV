Take me now baby here as I am  
Pull me close try and understand  
Desirous hunger is the fire I breathe  
Love is a banquet on which we feed  
  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel when Im in your hands  
Take my hand come undercover  
They cant hurt you now  
Cant hurt you now cant hurt you now  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to lust  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to us  
  
Have I doubt when Im alone  
Love is a ring the telephone  
Love is an angel disguised as lust  
Here in our bed until the morning comes  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel under your command  
Take my hand as the sun descends  
They cant touch you now  
Cant touch you now cant touch you now  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
  
With love we sleep  
With doubt the vicious circle  
Turn and burns  
Without you I cannot live  
Forgive the yearning burning  
I believe its time too real to feel  
So touch me now touch me now touch me now  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
  
Because tonight there are two lovers  
If we believe in the night we trust  
Because tonight there are two lovers
