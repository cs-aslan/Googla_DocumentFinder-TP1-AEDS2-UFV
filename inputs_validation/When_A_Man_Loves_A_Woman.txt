When he held me in his arms  
When he held me in his arms and said  
Baby baby baby you are the only one for me  
  
When a man loves a woman  
Cant keep his mind on nothing else  
Hell trade the world  
For the good thing he found  
Yeah if shes bad he cant see it  
She can do no wrong  
Turn his back on his best friend  
If he put her down  
  
When a man loves a woman  
Spend his very last dime  
Tryin to hold on to what he needs  
Hell give up all his comforts  
Go out and sleep out in the rain  
If she says baby that is how its gonna be  
  
When a man loves a woman  
Gives her everything that he has  
Tryin to hold on to her precious love  
Cryin baby baby please dont treat me bad  
  
When a man loves a woman  
Down deep in his soul  
She can bring him such misery  
Yeah shes bad but oooh  
Hes the last one to know  
Lovin eyes dont ever see  
  
So this man says he loves me he loves me  
He gives me everything everything  
Everything that he has  
Tryin to hold on to my precious love  
Cryin baby baby baby dont you dont you  
Treat me treat me bad  
Ohhhh yeah  
  
When a man loves a woman  
He can do her no wrong  
He could never hold another girl  
Oh you tell me you love me baby  
And gonna hold me tight  
Baby baby this is a mans world  
No no  
Oh baby a change is gonna come down  
In this mans world
