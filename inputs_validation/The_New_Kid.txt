The new kid hes got money  
The money I deserve  
I should be rolling in it  
Ive been a working stiff  
As for the justice  
No one knows where it went  
  
Im gonna toil away  
Until my judgment day  
I will be rewarded for the good things I did  
Believe me every year  
There is another one here  
Dont you see I used to be the new kid  
I am sorry to say youll get carried away  
Oh you will be replaced  
You will be replaced  
Ill tell you again  
Dont get too settled in  
You will be replaced  
You will be replaced  
  
the new kid hes got my girl  
The girl I used to have  
Hes got the looks  
You know got them from his dad  
I should be kissin that girl  
We should be so in love  
There is no justice  
Theres just dark stars above  
  
Im gonna toil away  
Until my judgment day  
I will be rewarded for the good things I did  
Believe me every year there is another one here  
Dont you see I used to be the new kid  
Believe me every year  
There is another one here  
Dont you see I used to be the new kid  
I am sorry to say  
Youll get carried away  
Oh you will be replaced  
You will be replaced  
Ill tell you again  
Dont get too settled in  
Oh you will be replaced  
You will be replaced  
By the new kid  
By the new kid  
By the new kid  
By the new kid
