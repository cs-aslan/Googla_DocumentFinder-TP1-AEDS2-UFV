Shit man fuck  
  
Drivers license and registration please  
  
Hey whats up sir um look um  
  
Sir could you please step out the car  
  
Oh not a problem officer its all good  
Im just know what Im sayin  
Comin from droppin ma lil boy off at ma baby momma house  
Here go ma license right here  
  
Trunk full of yoda heated situation  
Flashlight in ma eyes he want ma registration what  
Should I stay should I run  
Got hard got soft got bills got guns 4real  
Ma drivers license is revoked  
Just got done burnin so I know he smell the smoke damn  
But never let em see you see sweat  
Cause if he search ya trunk he might find the tec  
Or a bag full of Os  
Wrapped in duck tape nigga between some dirty ass clothes  
But I talk to him the right way he told me  
Slow it down and have a nice day  
  
Chorus  
You can do ya thang shawty its okay  
To floss but its still one rule player dont get caught  
cause everything you gain dog and everything you lost  
but its still one rule pimpin dont get caught  
Fuck every hoe you hit dog and every hoe you toss  
cause its still one rule player dont get caught  
You can ride clean shorty you aint gotta walk  
But its still one rule player dont get caught  
  
Some niggas rob what some niggas slang for real  
Some niggas stack naw some niggas bang chea  
But I congratulate not playa  
Hate you in the streets pimpin make ya move get ya cake  
Fuck what you heard through the grapevine get outta line  
Nigga Im a straighten mine  
And I dont believe in wastin time well catch them hoes later  
Stay on ya grind thats right  
Gotta a low tolerance for ignorance ignorance  
You thinkin pleasure Im thinkin business  
The streets didnt raise no fool  
When you live by the code nigga its only one rule  
  
Chorus  
  
Got the phone call call had a funny feeling feeling  
Told him everything was cool and I was chillin chillin  
We use to chill out and smoke blunts  
And I aint seen him in a while maybe a couple months  
Said he want to holla he seemed anxious  
First thing on ma mind go and get tha strainers  
Make his folks pay a ransom bout him  
On that bullshit make a good example out him  
This nigga hot he on fire fire  
I hope his ass aint wearin no wire naw dog he bullshittin  
Said his partner set him up the nigga snitchin  
  
Chorus x2
