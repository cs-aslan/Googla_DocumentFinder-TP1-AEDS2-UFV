Traded in my bible for a little black cat  
The time of Armageddons here  
Some call me the son of the morning  
God knows Im the angel of light  
  
I drink my water from a wolfs footprint  
My souls redemptive work of Christ  
God knows Im the angel of light  
  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Devil  
  
Believers be on guard  
Be strong and take a stand  
The time of Armageddons here  
Some call me the son of the morning  
  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Devil devil
