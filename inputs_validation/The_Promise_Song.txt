Oh if you keep my word  
Ill make you as a tree  
Planted by the streams of life  
If youll submit to me  
  
And if you love the hateful ones  
Who mistreat you constantly  
The book of life shall bear your name  
If you love your enemies  
  
Yes lord Jesus  
Yes lord Jesus  
  
And if you do my will  
Ill make you living stones  
To build up in my fathers house  
If you serve me alone  
  
And if you love all men  
Especially the least  
Ill raise you up the lowest ones  
And make you kings and priests  
  
Yes lord Jesus  
Yes lord Jesus  
  
And if youll seek my face  
And set your life apart  
Ill let myself be found by you  
When you search with all your heart  
  
And if you never turn aside  
To the left or to the right  
Ill be a lamp unto your feet  
And keep you on the path of light  
  
Yes lord Jesus  
Yes lord Jesus  
  
Yes lord Jesus  
Yes lord Jesus
