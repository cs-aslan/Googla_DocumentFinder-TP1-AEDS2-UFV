Look at the sky  
Tell me what do you see  
Just close your eyes  
And describe it to me  
The heavens are sparkling  
With starlight tonight  
Thats what I see  
Through your eyes  
  
I see the heavens  
Each time that you smile  
I hear your heartbeat  
Just go on for miles  
And suddenly I know  
My life is worth while  
Thats what I see  
Through your eyes  
  
Here in the night  
I see the sun  
Here in the dark  
Our two hearts are one  
Its out of our hands  
We cant stop what we have begun  
And love just took me by surprise  
Looking through your eyes  
  
I look at myself  
And instead I see us  
Whoever I am now  
It feels like enough  
And I see a girl  
Who is learning to trust  
Thats who I see through your eyes  
  
Here in the night  
I see the sun  
Here in the dark  
Our two hearts are one  
Its out of our hands  
We cant stop what we have begun  
And love just took me by surprise  
Looking through your eyes  
  
And there are some things we dont know  
Sometimes a heart just needs to go  
And there is so much that Ill remember  
Underneath the open sky with you forever  
  
Here in the night  
I see the sun  
Here in the dark  
Our two hearts are one  
Its out of our hands  
We cant stop what we have begun  
And love just took me by surprise  
Looking through your eyes  
Looking through your eyes
