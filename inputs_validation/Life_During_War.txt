Yeah we say making changes  
Starts in the little things you do  
Revolution begins at home  
But for most of us it ends there too  
Were doing something  
Were making changes  
Like changing the brand of crap we buy  
We say it makes a difference  
But thats just another lie  
It used to be us and them  
And you and me  
And now we cant reach our potential  
Without a common enemy  
A real war to fight against  
Instead of our petty disagreements  
But how can I rationalize  
My life during wartime lie  
A call to action and a reaction  
Taking our lives in our own hands  
Instead of sitting around and talking  
About the same old shitty bands  
But war is going on right now  
And Im not doing anything about it  
Without a crowd Im not so loud  
I cant do anything by myself  
But thats just another lie
