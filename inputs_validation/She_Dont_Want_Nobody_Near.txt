She dont want nobody near  
But you cant get away from that  
They appear and disappear  
And they all get a string attached  
Pretty soon they got you hanging on a line  
Pretty soon theyre singing one by one the same old rhyme  
They say Im alright I just cant get home tonight  
  
She dont want nobody home  
Cause its a little too crowded then  
But she dont wanna be alone  
So they just keep pouring in  
Pretty soon they got her headed for the door  
She comes home to find that theyre not hanging round no more  
She says Im alright you just cant get home tonight  
  
Dont you wonder what she looks like in the light  
She says Im alright I just cant get home tonight  
  
Pretty whitewashed lies  
Endless alibis  
And the reasons that need cleaning every night  
Half a world away  
You cant wash away the stain of the deceiving  
And the things that you cannot believe and well  
  
She dont want no one around  
Cause she dont want anybody to see  
What she looks like when shes down  
Cause thats a really sad place to be  
Pretty soon she gets them crawling up the walls  
Then she wonders why they beg her please to never call  
She says Im ok Its alright Hey look whos on TV tonight  
She says Im alright I just cant get home tonight  
  
Dont you wonder why its dark outside at night  
She says Im alright I just cant get home tonight
