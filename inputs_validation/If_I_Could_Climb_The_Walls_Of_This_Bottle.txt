If I could climb the walls of this bottle oh darlin Id come home to you  
Another night for me is just beginning soon the wine will wash away all my
shame  
With every drink one more memry will leave me come closing time I wont feel
a thing  
Here I am on my way to the bottom its a shame the things a man will do  
If I could climb the walls of this bottle oh darlin Id come home to you  
  
Its been a long long time and I miss you but this world Im living in wont
let me go  
And its too late to say that Im sorry and why I left you for this God only
knows  
If I could climb the walls of this bottle
