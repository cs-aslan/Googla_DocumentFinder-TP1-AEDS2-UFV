Youre standing in a deep dark hole  
Beneath a sky as black as coal  
Its just the fear of losing control  
You know so well  
Dont miss it when the moment comes  
Be submissive just this once  
Imagine there is something to be done  
Some truth to tell  
  
I would love  
To trouble you in your time of need  
Lose your way  
Its a pleasure when youre in my command  
  
Juggle like a diplomat  
Struggle to hold onto your hat  
Swinging like an acrobat  
But time will tell  
The clock is dripping on the wall  
Listen to the rise and fall  
Close your eyes and hear the call you know so well  
  
Put on your wings  
Youre responsible for everything  
  
Desolate in anger and safe in isolation  
Youre about to be the victim of a holy visitation  
By the rites that Ive been given  
  
Put on your wings  
Youre not responsible for everything  
I would love  
To trouble you in your time of need  
Lose your way  
Its a pleasure when youre in my command  
When youre in my command  
In my command
