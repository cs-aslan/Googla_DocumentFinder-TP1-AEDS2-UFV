Devil DollDevil Doll  
We went steady in the fall  
We broke up in the spring  
Your young lovin blinds  
And you gave me back my ring  
Well I see now what my friends saw then  
That youre just not the one  
To love someone true  
The way I love you  
Oh devil doll  
Now Im not the first one  
And I wont be the last  
Youll make my heart  
Just another heart youve broken in the past  
Dont play a game with another guy  
Dont make me feel so blue  
Im a guy thats true and I love you  
Oh devil doll  
Now Im not the first one  
Dont let me be the last  
Dont make my heart  
Just another heart youve broken in the past  
Dont play a game with another guy  
Dont make me feel so blue  
Im a guy thats true and I love you  
Oh devil doll devil doll
