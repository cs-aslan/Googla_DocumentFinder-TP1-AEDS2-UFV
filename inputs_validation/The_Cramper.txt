Have you ever known a free lancer  
Thinks that hes a camper  
Known around my way as the cramper  
Like PMS always pokin  
  
But he wont go away with a little Motrin  
Now if you ever heard the term cramper and you wonder  
The worms kinda like I guess a modern day Felix Unger  
When ya first meet em ya think hes OK  
  
But then you learn a little bit of the cramper goes a long way  
Hear say here I say through the grapevine  
He squawks and he gawks and he walks a thin line  
Just like a little fuckin fag  
  
He always wants to get high but never has a bag  
Never works says he cant find the right job  
Aint got a dime and when he does hes a tightwad  
Hes the dampest theres no one damp  
  
Huh huh hes the mother fuckin cramper  
Now the crampers red theres no one redder  
He rides ya wrong like a really tight sweater  
Hes sorta like a mouse a pest of a peer  
  
You come home hes at your house drinkin your last beer  
Pokin and strokin he makes you want to belt him  
Always wearin out his mother fuckin welcome  
And then sportys never that cautious  
  
He sips from your forty and he always backwashes  
Talk about a certain subject hell jinx it  
Let him borrow a shirt the stooge always shrinks it  
Hes the dampest theres no one damper  
  
Huh huh hes the mother fuckin cramper
