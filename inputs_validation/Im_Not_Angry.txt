Youre upstairs with the boyfriend while Im left here to listen Angry  
I hear you calling his name I hear the stutter of ignition Angry  
I could hear you whispering as I crept by your door  
So you found some other joker who could please you more  
  
Chorus  
Im not angry Angry  
Im not angry anymore Angry  
Im not angry Angry  
Im not angry anymore Angry  
Ooh I know what youre doin  
I know where youve been  
I know where but I dont care  
Cause theresa no such thing as an original sin  
  
Ive got this camera click click clickin in my head Angry  
I got you talking with your hands got you smiling with your legs Angry  
Spent all my time in a vanity factory  
Wonderin when theyre gonna come and take it all back  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah yeah  
Oh theres no such thing as an original sin  
Oh theresa no such thing as an original sin Angry  
Im not angry Angry  
Im not angry anymore Angry
