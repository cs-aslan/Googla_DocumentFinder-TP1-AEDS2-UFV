Politician drivin down the road  
Flashin that smile that got him the vote  
Heres another country girl  
Hes teachin her about the world in his room  
On the 45th floor  get em all while theyre young  
Campaign money comes rollin in  
Aint nobody askin where its been  
Talk about a smokin gun  
Whatd we pay to get his son out of jail  
Dont inhale  
On the 45th floor  
We all know whats been happenin  
Aint no slappin him down  
Were supposedly invited to the party  
But the elevators never gonna stop  
On the 45th floor  
Doesnt matter if its day or night  
Cause were all gonna pay the price  
And the party rolls on  
Used to be a rumour goin round  
The people tried to run my man outta town  
We thought wed see him ride the rails  
No ones ever gonna nail him down  
All because of the 45th floor  
We all know whats been happenin  
Aint no slappin him down  
Were supposedly invited to the party  
But the elevators never gonna stop  
On the 45th floor  
Oesnt matter if its day or night  
Cause were all gonna pay the price  
And the party rolls on  
None of these fools ever thinks about the pain they cause  
Its all about an image to uphold  
How could anybody be so bold  
Takin all the candy from the hands of a child  
We all know whats been happenin  
Aint no slappin him down  
Were supposedly invited to the party  
But the elevators never gonna stop  
On the 45th floor  
Doesnt matter if its day or night  
Cause were all gonna pay the price  
And the party rolls on  
Doesnt matter if its day or night  
Cause were all gonna pay the price  
And the party rolls on
