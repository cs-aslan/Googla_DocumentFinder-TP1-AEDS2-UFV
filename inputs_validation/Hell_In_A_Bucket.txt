Well I was drinkin last night with a biker  
And I showed him a picture of you  
I said Pal get to know her youll like her  
Seemed like the least I could do  
Cause when hes chargin his chopper  
Up and down your carpeted halls  
You will think I am dressed up quite proper  
Never mind how I stumble and fall  
  
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot  
For taste of your elegant pride  
I may be going to hell in a bucket babe  
But at least Im enjoying the ride at least Ill enjoy the ride  
  
Cause youre a sweet little softcore pretender  
Somehow babe it got as hot as it gets  
With her black leather and gold spike suspenders  
And your chain your black whip and pets  
  
Well we know youre the reincarnation  
Of the infamous Catherine the Great  
And we know how you love the ovation  
And the scene that it seems to create  
  
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot  
For taste of your elegant pride  
I may be going to hell in a bucket babe  
But at least Im enjoying the ride at least Ill enjoy the ride  
  
You analyze me tend to despise me  
You laugh when I stumble and fall  
There may come a say when Ill dance on your grave  
Unable to dance Ill still crawl across it  
Unable to dance Ill still crawl  
Unable to dance Ill still crawl  
Unable to dance Ill crawl  
  
You must really consider the circus  
It just might be your kind of zoo  
I cant think of a place thats more perfect  
For a person as perfect as you  
  
And its not like Im leaving you lonely  
Cause I wouldnt know where to begin  
Well I know you wake up here only  
When the snakes come marching in  
  
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot  
For taste of your elegant pride  
I may be going to hell in a bucket babe  
But at least Im enjoying the ride at least Ill enjoy the ride  
Ride ride ride  
Ride ride ride  
Ride ride ride  
At least Ill enjoy the ride  
At least Ill enjoy the ride  
At least Ill enjoy the ride
