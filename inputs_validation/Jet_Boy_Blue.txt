Jet Boy Blue  
You steal and you think that its right  
Like a thief in the night  
Ah oh yeah  
Ill tell you its true  
You come around with your stories to tell  
I dont hold no interest  
But I let you go  
I know youve fallen under his spell  
Dont let him kill you  
Hell only fill you with lies  
Youre a fool and you know it  
Done your best not to show it  
But its all over  
Youre through  
Jet Boy Blue  
Hell only take you for a ride  
Only cost you your pride  
Jet Boy Blue  
  
Chorus  
Stop stop while youre still ahead  
Youve got a lot to learn  
Youre still so young  
Listen to what your mama said  
  
Try to tell you go to hell  
Youre just a kid  
Dont take no advice you never think twice  
Close the door  
Jump in dont mention what you did  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre a fool and you know it  
Done your best not to show it  
But its all over  
Youre through  
Jet Boy Blue  
Hell only take you for a ride  
Only cost you your pride  
Jet Boy Blue  
  
Chorus  
  
Jet Boy Blue  
You steal and you think that its right  
Like a thief in the night  
  
Woah Jet Jet Jet Jet Boy Blue
