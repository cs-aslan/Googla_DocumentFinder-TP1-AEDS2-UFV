Emmaretta did you get my letter  
I sent it to you oh Emmaretta  
Do you still feel when night is falling  
Something calling oh Emmaretta  
Behind my thoughts oh Emmaretta  
I can get to you to feel better  
I must go now oh Emmaretta  
Full moons rising oh Emmaretta  
Oh its a thousand miles  
Oh and I need you child  
Oh they can drive me wild  
What I feel can make it real  
Help  
Oh its a thousand miles  
Oh and I need you child  
Oh they can drive me wild  
If what I feel can make it real  
Emmaretta did you get my letter  
I sent it to you oh Emmaretta  
Do you still feel when night is falling  
Something calling oh Emmaretta
