Im sitting at home and the phone doesnt even ring  
Im all alone again  
Not a sound in the house save the radio  
FM DJ filling up the emptiness  
Babys on the road again  
Six weeks nationwide opening the show  
  
And Im making it on my own like a rockn roll widow  
Get my news from the Rolling Stone wake by the telephone  
Wonder if hes alone  
Or is my man on a permanent loan to rockn roll  
Rockn roll  
  
Outdoor concert watching him play for me  
I fall in love again  
He says his music is everything  
Helpless caught by the melody  
When he begins to sing  
Go on tell me hes like all the rest  
  
And Im making it on my own like a rockn roll widow  
Get my news from the Rolling Stone wake by the telephone  
Wonder if hes alone  
Or is my man on a permanent loan to rockn roll  
Rockn roll  
  
Watching him run  
Ive got the feeling that hes already lost in the life  
  
So Im making it on my own like a rockn roll widow  
Get my news from the Rolling Stone wake by the telephone  
Wonder if hes alone  
Or is my man on a permanent loan to rockn roll  
To rockn roll
