He walked in with a salty sway  
Lookin like Blackbeard in his day  
A brother in arms just like me  
I was born a son of the sea  
I cant be still I cant be tied  
The only time I feel alive is  
  
When the wind fills my sail  
Riding on a lifelong swell  
Let my heart take me where it wants to go  
Thats the soul of a sailor the soul of a sailor  
  
He slid a stool and a beer to me  
Said you know were both a dying breed  
Heres to love lost and new found friends  
And living out life in the boat were in  
I cant be still I cant be tied  
The only time I feel alive is  
  
When the wind fills my sail  
Riding on a lifelong swell  
Let my heart take me where it wants to go  
Thats the soul of a sailor the soul of a sailor  
  
Let my heart take me where it wants to go  
Thats the soul of a sailor the soul of a sailor
