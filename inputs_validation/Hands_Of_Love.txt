Verse 1  
When the white flag sails covered in streaks of blood  
Therell be an endless sea of us rising up  
And the preacher man and the preachers son  
Will stand arm in arm just like everyone  
  
PreChorus  
Me longing to be free I wont let you fade away  
We shed so many dreams Ill let them fade away  
  
Chorus  
In the hands of love we carry on  
Stronger than we started  
Be ashamed of the trail behind us  
Wicked is the blinded  
Who we are comes to life yeah  
Who we are comes to life  
  
Verse 2  
When the water spills the glass will break  
It drips like tears running up your face  
And the hounds will cry for the dance of war  
But the sons of joy their victory will soar  
  
PreChorus  
Me longing to be free I wont let you fade away  
We shed so many dreams Ill let them fade away  
  
Chorus  
In the hands of love we carry on  
Stronger than we started  
Be ashamed of the trail behind us  
Wicked is the blinded  
Who we are comes to life yeah  
Who we are comes to life  
  
Bridge  
Me longing to be free I wont let you fade away  
  
Chorus  
In the hands of love we carry on  
Stronger that we started  
Be ashamed of the trail behind us  
Wicked is the blinded  
Who we are comes to life yeah  
Who we are comes to life  
  
Outro  
We come alive  
We come alive  
We come alive  
We come alive  
We come to life
