When youre swallowing all your pride  
Do you need somewhere  
A place to hide  
A smile from your face  
Where the light comes shining through  
All its strength  it came from you  
Its lost now all that age before I knew you  
Is it that forever is hard to find  
You made me recognize what Id been leaving far behind  
Is it closing in on you like it was on me  
This time Im saved by the music  
Saved by the song that you bring  
  
When youre following all lifes lies  
And find its meaning  
And truth still hides  
Dont cover your face  
Let the warmth come flowing through  
Welcome dawn new morning dew  
  
This time Im saved by the music  
Saved by the song we can sing  
This time Im saved by the music  
Saved by the song that you bring  
  
When youre swallowing all lifes lies  
This time were saved by the music  
Saved by the song we can sing  
This time were saved by the music  
Saved by the song we can sing  
This time were saved
