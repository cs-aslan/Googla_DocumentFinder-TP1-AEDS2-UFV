I refuse to be amused  
Thats sumthin that aint right  
I declare Im well aware  
I felt the angels vibes  
  
I can hear ya callin  
No Im not stallin  
Im justa doin sumthin else  
When Im with you  
Im really with you  
But right now Im by myself  
And I  
  
Chorus  
  
I can feel this fire  
Such a strange desire  
As strong as life itself  
I I can feel this fire  
Such a strange desire  
And I dont want nothin else  
But ooh I like your lovin  
  
Talk so much Im in a flux  
Ya just cant make up your mind  
Executin dreams aint easy  
Justa wastin precious time  
Talk is cheap your words are weak  
I dont want you wastin mine  
  
I hear ya callin  
No Im not stallin  
Im justa doin sumthin else  
When were together  
sho nuff together  
Right now Im by myself  
And I  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Ad lib to fade
