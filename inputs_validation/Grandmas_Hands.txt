Grandmas hands  
Clapped in church on Sunday morning  
Grandmas hands  
Played a tambourine so well  
Grandmas hands  
Used to issue out a warning  
Shed say Billy dont you run so fast  
Might fall on a piece of glass  
Might be snakes there in that grass  
Grandmas hands  
  
Grandmas hands  
Soothed a local unwed mother  
Grandmas hands  
Used to ache sometimes and swell  
Grandmas hands  
Used to lift her face and tell her  
Baby Grandma understands  
That you really love that man  
Put yourself in Jesus hands  
Grandmas hands  
  
Grandmas hands  
Used to hand me piece of candy  
Grandmas hands  
Picked me up each time I fell  
Grandmas hands  
Boy they really came in handy  
Shed say Matty don you whip that boy  
What you want to spank him for  
He didnt drop no apple core  
But I dont have Grandma anymore  
  
If I get to Heaven Ill look for  
Grandmas hands
