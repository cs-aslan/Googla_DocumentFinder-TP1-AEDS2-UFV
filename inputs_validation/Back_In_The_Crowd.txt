If you dont want these arms to hold you  
If you dont want these lips to kiss you  
If youve found somebody new  
Put me back in the crowd  
Put the sun behind the clouds  
Put me back in the crowd  
  
Repeat x2  
Theres a battle going on  
Between the blue and the grey  
And if you dont want my love  
Dont make me stay  
  
Take back your name  
Take back these wings  
Take my picture from the frame  
And put me back in the crowd  
Put the sun behind the cloud  
Put me back in the crowd  
  
Put me back in the crowd  
Put the sun behind the cloud  
Put me back in the crowd
