Verse 1  
I know that Im running out of time  
I want it all mmm mmm  
And Im wishing theyd stop tryna turn me off  
I want it all mmm mmm  
And Im walking on a wire trying to go higher  
Feels like Im surrounded by clowns and liars  
Even when I give it all away  
I want it all  
  
PreChorus  
We came here to run it run it run it run it  
We came here to run it run it run it run it  
Oh  
  
Chorus  
Just like fire burning up the way  
If I can light the world up for just one day  
Watch this madness colorful charade  
No one can be just like me any way  
Just like magic Ill be flying free  
Ima disappear when they come for me  
I kick that ceiling what you gonna say  
No one can be just like me any way  
Just like fire  
  
Verse 2  
And people like to laugh at you cause they  
Are all the same  
See I would rather we just go our different way  
Than play the game  
And no matter the weather we can do it better  
You and me together forever and ever  
We dont have to worry about a thing  
About a thing  
  
PreChorus  
We came here to run it run it run it run it  
We came here to run it run it run it run it  
Oh  
  
  
Chorus  
Just like fire burning out the way  
If I can light the world up for just one day  
Watch this madness colorful charade  
No one can be just like me any way  
Just like magic Ill be flying free  
Imma disappear when they come for me  
I kick that ceiling what you gonna say  
No one can be just like me any way  
Just like fire fire fire  
Running running running
