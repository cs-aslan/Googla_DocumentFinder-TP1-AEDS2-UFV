Mama stood cryin at the back door  
Papas lacin on his leavin shoes  
Little Joes blowin on the horn outdoors  
Ive seen enough I cant take no more  
And Im leavin  
  
Might go to Philadelphia PA  
Might wind up in Boston I just cant say  
Got my axe in one hand  
Got my Greyhound ticket in the other hand  
And Im leavin  
  
I tell you Im leavin  
Gonna play my blues  
Yes Im leavin  
Got nothing to lose  
Well Im dying to get the hell out of here  
Right away  
  
Mama stood cryin at the back door  
Papas lacin on his leavin shoes  
Little Joes blowin on the horn outdoors  
Ive seen enough I cant take no more  
And Im leavin  
  
I said Im leavin  
Gonna play my guitar  
Im leavin  
Dont care if Im a big star  
Im leavin this old ghetto  
Right away right away
