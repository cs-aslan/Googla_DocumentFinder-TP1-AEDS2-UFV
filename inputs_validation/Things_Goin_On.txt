Well have you ever lived down in the ghetto  
Have you ever felt the cold wind blow  
Well if you dont know what I mean  
Wont you stand up and scream  
Cause theres things goin on that you dont know  
  
Too many lives theyve spent across the ocean  
Too much money been spent upon the moon  
Well until they make it right  
I hope they never sleep at night  
They better make some changes  
And do it soon  
  
Well theyre goin ruin the air we breathe  
Lord have mercy  
Theyre gonna ruin us all by and by  
Im telling all you beware  
I dont think they really care  
I think they just sit up there  
And just get high  
  
Well have you ever lived down in the ghetto  
Have you ever felt the cold wind blow  
Well if you dont know what I mean  
Wont you stand up and scream  
Cause theres things goin on that you dont know  
  
Well if you dont know what I mean  
Wont you stand up and scream  
Cause theres things goin on that you dont know  
  
Thing goin on
