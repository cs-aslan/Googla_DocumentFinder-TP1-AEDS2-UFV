Ill never feel again  
Ill never feel again  
Then I wont have to feel this pain  
Im in if it sounds familiar  
  
Because nothing ever goes the way Ive planned  
If it sounds peculiar  
Then you dont have to try and understand  
Ill never feel again  
  
Ill never feel again  
Then I wont have to feel this pain  
Im in  
Im not a great example of everything  
  
The world expects of us  
I know Im no exception  
Ive questioned everything  
I used to trust a question of necessity or lust  
  
Ill never feel again  
Ill never feel again t  
Hen I wont have to feel this pain  
Im in its as simple as you make it  
  
And as complicated as who you think you are
