Why does the sunset in the west  
And why does my heart keep beating in my chest  
What ever happened to the Duke of Earl  
I got a PBS mind in a MTV world  
Is it ignorance or apathy  
I forgot these lessons taught to me  
Some say life isnt fair  
Hey I dont know I dont care  
  
Ambivalent well yes and no  
Hey where did all the hippies go  
Our conversation sounds like actors lines  
Is it time for your medication or mine  
Is it ignorance or apathy  
I forgot these lessons taught to me  
Some say life isnt fair  
Hey I dont know I dont care  
  
Therapy is extremely expensive  
Poppin bubblie wrap is radically cheap  
You choose which one helps with your problem  
Im gonna get some sleep  
Im gonna get some sleep  
  
Sandy beaches in distant reaches  
And oh those lovely Georgia peaches  
Its never too much and never too late  
To pack your bags and get out of state  
Is it ignorance or apathy  
The worried will all disagree  
Some say life isnt fair  
Hell I dont know and I dont care  
  
If youre looking for a quote from me  
Ill be under the mango tree  
Just cant say how Ill get there  
Hey I dont know and I dont care  
I dont know and I dont care  
I dont know and I dont care  
At his beach house on the moon
