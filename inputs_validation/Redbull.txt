RZA came and got me this what I came to do come on  
Ring the bell so its time to eat  
Brick Dog stash weed inta AMIseats bomb inside the palm  
Doc rock a wife beater with me beatin my wife ass ironed on  
The front my pump built like the Klumps  
To carry it I take the spare out the trunk  
I stay hungry I aint worked for days  
Thats why you see the pump when the curtains raise  
Blast dont panic  
Do I gotta explain how I tame and lock  
The rap game singlehanded Hell nah  
I wont tell you son if I find a wack ID I sell you one  
Doc and Hot Nick Inspectah  
My lectures like Hannibal Lectors  
Wheres the ketchup Dont speak on it shut ya trap  
I see ya whole crew yellow like mustard packs  
Ah woo Doc in my own zone  
You say you got the rap games sewn  
But its sewn wrong  
I ride through ya hood in a Mr Softee truck  
Then pull a mac out a box of snow cones  
Yeah ya little fucks  
Gimme ya fuckin money  
Incomprehensible  
Uhuh check it  
Im hotter than a hundred degrees with my coat on  
Playing with a dynamite stick where did I go wrong  
Somebody pull the fire along when Jonny stomp  
If ya lukewarm leavin ya clothes and boots torn  
Pros and cons megabombs and soons  
By arid actions try MCs to get their roll on  
First issue got issues  
What is hiphop to hot nickels  
Its like Funk Doc to snot tissues word  
Look at my hand and get the third  
Finger out ya ear hole like Fuck what you heard  
Now thats what I call hardcore lets act fool  
Mr FixIt like Handyman I pack tool  
I been shitty Im from the veils of the city  
And just because my outfit match dont make me pretty  
Baggy Dun Gurees dick need room to breathe  
In a room full of crackers I might cut the cheese  
Aint no rules to the game  
If it is we aint playin  
In your business like EPMD So whatcha sayin  
You codesignin that bullshit yo man tryin  
Chaka chaka chata tatat  
Slugs flyin  
Incomprehensible  
Yo ya  
Check the code echoes from magazines to the big screen  
Fo wheel machines like ya wits scream kids fiend  
From the urban to suburban  
Roll upon me thirstin like Hey hey Mister DreamMerchant  
We roll longer than dice in a casino  
Ceelo in the 4 5 or 6 with double 0  
Behind the tinted windows I lie low  
On some hydro tryin to slide from the 50  
But now get wild similar to Ol Dirty  
On third time felon just hit with over 30  
No worries style have em so thirsty  
First degree heats are quittin on me  
Cold turkey no mercy  
I bring the pain of a hundred migraines  
But a thousand shoutin my name thats why I came  
But first bring the cash burst then the outburst  
My surround sound pound ya ear like Jevon Kearse  
I flex muscle outside I find a next hustle  
Trouble with ya here and face the tecmuscle  
Even the best buckle win I take it to the extreme  
It gets ugly but its what a nigga do to get cream  
This life  
Incomprehensible
