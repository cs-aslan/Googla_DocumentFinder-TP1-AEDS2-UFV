You didnt notice me right beside you  
I said you looked like someone that I knew  
A little lie to get you to talk to me awhile  
Youre eyes oh how they melt me  
  
Your smile girl heaven help me  
Your lips kiss and tell me a thing or two  
Oh the happy ending this could be  
Swept away in love and all its glory  
  
One minute hearts are lonely  
The next each others only  
Then darlin I just know wed fall that fast  
So dont you ever think it cant  
  
Love happens just like that  
I could try and act like I dont care  
But bein shy that gets me nowhere  
Though I admit Im a little bit scared to talk to you  
  
A risk yeah maybe  
But its one worth taking  
Cause I see a love in the making here with you  
Oh the happy ending this could be  
  
Swept away in love and all its glory  
One minute hearts are lonely  
The next each others only  
Then darlin I just know wed fall that fast  
  
So dont you ever think it cant  
Love happens just like  
Lightning striking flames igniting  
In an instant souls igniting  
  
One minute hearts are lonely  
Then the next each others only  
Then darlin I just know wed fall that fast  
So dont you ever think it cant  
  
Love happens just like  
Dont you ever think it cant  
Love happens just like that  
It happens just like that  
  
Love happens just like that
