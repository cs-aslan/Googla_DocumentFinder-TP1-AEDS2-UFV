If we still have time we might still get by  
Every time I think about it I want to cry  
With bombs and the devil and the kids keep comin  
No way to breathe easy no time to be young  
  
But I tell myself that I was doin all right  
Theres nothin left to do at night  
But go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy crazy on you oh  
  
My love is the evenin breeze touchin your skin  
The gentle sweet singin of leaves in the wind  
The whisper that calls after you in the night  
And kisses your ear in the early moonlight  
And you dont need to wonder youre doing fine  
My love the pleasures mine  
  
Let me go crazy on ya  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy crazy on you ohhh  
  
Wild mans world is cryin in pain  
What you gonna do when everybodys insane  
So afraid of one whos so afraid of you  
What you gonna do ohh  
  
Ahahahah  
  
Oohh crazy on ya  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy crazy on you  
  
I was a willow last night in my dream  
I bent down over a clear running stream  
Sang you the song that I heard up above  
And you kept me alive with your sweet flowing love  
  
Crazy  
Yeah crazy on ya  
Let me go crazy crazy on you oh  
Crazy on ya  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy crazy on you yeah  
  
Ahahahah  
  
Crazy on ya  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy crazy on you
