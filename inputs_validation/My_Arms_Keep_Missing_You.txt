You know Ive been so lonely every night  
Since you went away  
Would you let me down any night  
Is that the way youre made girl  
  
I keep telling myself its all right  
Even though I cry  
Theres no question why  
How could I be happy when  
  
Chorus   
My arms keep missing you  
Whos been kissing you  
Since you went away  
My arms keep missing you  
I keep wishing youd  
Come back today  
  
You said you wouldnt hurt me anyway  
And I believe in you  
We said we trust each other every day  
Wed never be untrue  
  
But I keep thinking youre telling lies  
Even though I try  
Theres no question why  
How can I be happy when  
  
Chorus   
  
You know Ive been so lonely every night  
Since you went away  
Would you let me down any night  
Is that the way youre made girl  
  
I keep telling myself its all right  
Even though I cry  
Theres no question why  
How could I be happy when  
  
Chorus Repeat 2x
