Chorus x2  
Bring in the noise  
Bring down the house  
We came here to turn the party out  
Say cmon cmon lets raise the roof  
And give em proof that we can get loose yall  
  
We need to get down  
The scene is so so right  
Everybodys in the house tonight  
Loose your mind  
Let your body take control  
Youve got that feeling in your soul  
  
Ive got that feeling baby  
You know it drives me crazy  
And all I want to do is hit the floor  
I want to shout it though  
So make it louder yall  
And turn it up some more  
  
Chorus  
  
Bring in the noise

Just shake it girl  
And enjoy the ride  
Do what you feel inside  
Cause its your world  
All you wanted more  
So baby go and get yours  
  
Ive got that feeling baby  
You know it drives me crazy  
And all I want to do is hit the floor  
I want to shout it yall  
So make it louder yall  
And turn it up some more

And all I want to do is hit the floor
