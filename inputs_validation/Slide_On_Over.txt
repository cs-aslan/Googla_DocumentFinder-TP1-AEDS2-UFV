Mommas got her long dress on  
See how that little girl walks  
Now we got it rollin  
Howre we gonna get it stopped  
Mommas got something  
Daddy needs more than a lot  
Now we got it rolling  
Howre we gonna get it stopped  
Momma put your long dress on  
Id like to take that little girl to town  
Now that we have rolled it  
Howre we gonna hold it down  
Gonna slide on over to that pretty little love that Ive found  
Now weve got it rolling  
Howre we gonna hold it down  
  
Now mommas got her long dress on  
Listen to that little girl talk  
Now we got it rolling  
Howre we gonna get it stopped  
Gonna slide on over to  
That funny little love that Ive got  
Now we got it rolling  
Howre we gonna get it stopped  
Cause my mommas got something  
Daddy needs more than a lot  
Now we got it rolling  
How we gonna get it stopped
