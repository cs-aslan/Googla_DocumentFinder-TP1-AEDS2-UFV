Some say that love isnt fair  
But they dont know you and me  
And when they tell me that love doesnt last alone  
Thats when I look at you  
And its alright just let me lead you  
  
Chorus  
  
Its ok if you close your eyes  
Ill be standing by your side  
Im gonna love you the best that I can  
Your my heart and your my best friend  
And I promise till the endyeah  
Im gonna love you the best that I can  
That I can  
  
Time cannot tear us apart  
Were stronger than yesterday  
And though weve traveled so far  
Youre still close to me  
Love changes everything  
And know that its alright  
Just let me lead you let me lead you  
Yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Its ok if you close your eyes  
Ill be standing by your side  
Im gonna love you the best that I can  
Your my heart and your my best friend  
And I promise till the end yeah  
Im gonna love you the best that I can  
  
Through the peaks and the valleys  
Your not alone  
And when the worlds upside down you know Im there  
And anytime I feel afraid thats when I look at you  
  
With the best that I can  
I will love youwill love you the very best I can  
The best that I can  
With every breath I take  
From this moment till the very end  
Im gonna lovegonna love you the best that I can  
The best that I can  
  
Its ok if you close your eyes  
Ill be standing by your side  
Im gonna love you the best that I can  
Youre my heart and your my best friend  
And I promise till the end yeah  
Im gonna love you the best that I can  
  
Im gonna love you  
Im gonna love you the best that I can
