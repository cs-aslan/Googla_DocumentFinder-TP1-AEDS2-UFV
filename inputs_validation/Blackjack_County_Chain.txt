I was sittin beside the road in Blackjack County  
Not knowing that the sheriff paid a bounty  
For men like me who didnt have a penny to their names  
So he locked my leg to thirtyfive pounds of Blackjack County chain  
  
All we had to eat was bread and water  
Each day we had to build that road a mile and a quarter  
Black sneak whip would cut our backs when some poor fool complained  
But we couldnt fight back wearin 35 pounds of Blackjack County chain  
  
And then one night while the sheriff was a sleepin  
We all gathered round him slowly creepin  
And heaven help me to forget that night in the cold cold rain  
When we beat him death with thirtyfive pounds of Blackjack County chain  
  
Now the whip marks have all healed and I am thankful  
That theres nothing but a scar round my ankle  
Most of all Im glad no man will be a slave again  
To a black sneak whip and thirtyfive pounds of Blackjack County chain  
To a black sneak whip and thirtyfive pounds of Blackjack County chain
