You build it up and tear it down theres no reason to follow you  
You left the song without a sound you left the story I made for you  
Softly angels bow and cry in the stillness of the night  
  
Never is a long time  goodbye  
No answers for the asking  
Its a long time  goodbye  
No mercy for the aching  
Its a long time  oh I see no light on the forsaken  
Never is a long time  goodbye  
Lets spend the night when this dream has come to an end  
  
Sometimes you laugh  
Sometimes you cry and yes  
Ive cried over you  
Youve left me blind in paradise  
Youve left me hungering for the touch of you  
Snow white angels run and hide in the blackness of the night  
  
Never is a long time
