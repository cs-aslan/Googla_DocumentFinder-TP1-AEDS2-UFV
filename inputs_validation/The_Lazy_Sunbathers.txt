A world war  
Was announced  
Days ago  
But they didnt know  
The lazy sunbathers  
The lazy sunbathers  
  
The sun burns through  
To the planets core  
And it isnt enough  
They want more  
  
Nothing  
Appears  
To be  
Between the ears of  
The lazy sunbathers  
Too jaded  
To question stagnation  
The sun burns through  
To the planets core  
And it isnt enough  
They want more  
  
Religions fall  
Children shelled  
Children shelled Thats all  
Very well but would you  
Please keep the noise  
Down low  
Because youre waking  
The lazy sunbathers  
Oh the lazy sunbathers  
The lazy sunbathers
