Shes the kind of girl that you need to touch  
Follow through the fire  
She can take it all always gives so much  
And laughs til she cries  
  
If shes far away I can feel her still  
Soothing my soul  
When shes here with me and Im not myself  
She takes control  
  
Shes got direction shes got devotion  
She got the rhythm such an emotional woman  
Shes got the movement  
Shes got the power  
In comes the sunlight when all the flowers unfold  
I know  
  
Shes got the answer  shes got the answer  
Shes got the answer  
Shes got the answer  
  
I am here for you you are near to me  
A mother or a child  
Generations passing through you  
Awake in the wild  
  
Shes got direction shes got devotion  
She got the rhythm such an emotional woman  
Shes got the movement shes got the power  
In comes the sunlight when all the flowers unfold  
I know  
  
Shes got the answer  shes got the answer  
Shes got the answer  
Shes got the answer  
  
Shes got direction shes got devotion  
She got the rhythm such an emotional woman  
Shes got the movement shes got the power  
In comes the sunlight when all the flowers unfold  
Shes got the answer  shes got the answer  
Shes got the answer  
Shes got the answer
