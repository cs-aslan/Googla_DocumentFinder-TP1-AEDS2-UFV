Sweet little woman cant you see  
That youre the only one for me  
You make me feel good so good inside  
Stay by me woman for the rest of my life  
And as I think of you more every day  
Theres only one thing I can say  
And thats  
  
Girl I think the world about you  
Always thinkin of you  
Girl I think the world about you  
Im always thinkin of you  
  
So many wonders in your world it seems  
Youre the picture of a woman  a little girls dream  
You seem so weak sometimes to be so strong  
You make a man like me finally to belong  
No words can say how much I need you so  
But oh my love I want the world to know  
  
Girl I think the world about you  
Always thinkin of you  
Girl I think the world about you  
Im always thinkin of you  
  
Theres no words to say how much I need you so  
But oh sweet girl I want the world to know  
  
Girl I think the world about you  
Always thinkin of you  
Girl I think the world about you  
Im always thinkin of you
