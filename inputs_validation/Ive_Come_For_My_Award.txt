I took on your free enterprise and your pretty little shops  
Walked in with empty bags and walked out with the lot  
  
So Ive come for my award Ive come for my award  
I thought Id come in person thats the least I can afford  
Let hands be shook  
Champagne poured  
Sentence ignored  
Yes Ive come for my award

A thousand hidden cameras were searching cross the sky
