Onward And Onward And Onward I go  
Where no man before could be bothered to go  
Till the soles of my shoes are shot full of holes  
And its all downhill with a bullet  
This ramblin and rovin has taken its course  
Im grazing with the dinosaurs and the dear old horses  
And the city streets crack and a great hole forces  
Me down with my soapbox my pulpit  
The theatre ceiling is silver star spangled  
And the coins in my pocket go jinglejangle  
  
  
Do you love me  
Do you love me  
Do you love me  
Do you love me  
  
  
Theres a man in the theatre with girlish eyes  
Whos holding my childhood to ransom  
On the screen theres a death  
Theres a rustle of cloth  
And a sickly voice calling me handsome  
Theres a man in the theatre with sly girlish eyes  
On the screen theres an ape a gorilla  
Theres a groan theres a cough theres a rustle of cloth  
And a voice that stinks of death and vanilla  
This is a secret mauled and mangled  
And the coins in my pocket go jinglejangle  
  
  
Do you love me  
Do you love me  
Do you love me  
Do you love me  
  
  
The walls in the ceiling are painted in blood  
The lights go down the red curtains come apart  
The room is full of smoke and dialogue I know by heart  
And the coins in my pocket jinglejangle  
As the great screen crackled and popped  
And the clock of my boyhood was wound down and stopped  
And my handsome little body oddly propped  
And my trousers ride down to my ankles  
Yes onward And upward  
And Im off to find love  
Do you love me If you do Im thankful  
  
  
Do you love me  
Do you love me  
Do you love me  
Do you love me  
  
  
This city is an ogre squatting by the river  
It gives life but it takes it away my youth  
There comes a time when you just cannot deliver  
This is a fact This is a stone cold truth  
Do you love me I love you handsome  
But do you love me Yes I love you you are handsome  
Amongst the cogs and the wires my youth  
Vanilla breath and handsome apes with girlish eyes  
Dreams that roam between truth and untruth  
Memories that become monstrous lies  
So onward And Onward And Onward I go  
Onward And Upward And Im off to find love  
With blueblack bracelets on my wrists and my ankles  
And the coins in my pocket go jinglejangle  
  
  
Do you love me  
Do you love me  
Do you love me  
Do you love me
