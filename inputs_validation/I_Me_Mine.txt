All through the day  
I me mine I me mine I me mine  
All through the night  
I me mine I me mine I me mine  
Now theyre frightened of leaving it  
Evryones weaving it  
Coming on strong all the time  
All through the day I me mine  
  
IImeme mine IImeme mine  
IImeme mine IImeme mine  
  
All I can hear  
I me mine I me mine I me mine  
Even those tears  
I me mine I me mine I me mine  
Noones frightened of playing it  
Evryones saying it  
Flowing more freely than wine  
All through the day I me mine  
  
IImeme mine IImeme mine  
IImeme mine IImeme mine  
  
All I can hear  
I me mine I me mine I me mine  
Even those tears  
I me mine I me mine I me mine  
Noones frightened of playing it  
Evryones saying it  
Flowing more freely than wine  
All through your life I me mine
