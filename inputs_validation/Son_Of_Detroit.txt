Come on yeah  
I like to play Hank Williams Jr records just as loud as they will rock  
Im into Lynyrd Skynyrd RunDMC and that American pimp Kid Rock  
I like Willie Waylon George and Merle and a lot of ZZ Top  
I like country soul rock n roll and I love me some hip hop  
  
Im a redneck rock n roll son of Detroit  
I dont like no new wave techno bands around  
Im a drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
Im a longhaired redneck rock n roll son of Detroit  
  
I got a bougart and west coast chopper that sure make them bitches stare  
Got a dead flamingo wrapped around this cowboy hat I wear  
I like to cuss yell scream fight and rasie all kinds of hell  
And if you ride to live like I live to ride then let me hear that rebel yell  
  
Im a redneck rock n roll son of Detroit  
I dont like no new wave techno bands around  
Im a drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
Im a longhaired redneck rock n roll son of Detroit  
  
One time for your mind yeah  
  
I like my whiskey straight up daiquiris make me ill  
And if someone touches my beaver skins I get mad enough to kill  
I got a rifle rack in my pickup truck Im a four wheelin maniac  
And if you want to race then just name the place and Ill show you where its
at  
  
Im a redneck rock n roll son of Detroit  
I dont like no new wave techno bands around  
Im a drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
  
Im a longhaired redneck rock n roll son of Detroit  
Im a longhaired redneck rock n roll son of Detroit  
Im a longhaired redneck rock n roll son of Detroit  
And this one here goes out to my man  
  
The legendary David Allen Coe  
Hey hey
