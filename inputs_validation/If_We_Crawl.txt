If we crawl at two  
We could crawl at twentytwo  
And grovel at  
The drop of a hat  
  
And once theyve got you down there  
Its so hard to restraighten your back  
It we crawl at two  
We could crawl at one handred and two  
  
And the target brainless dont quite reach  
Covered so kindly in your opening speech  
Is a tiny crab of thought crab of thought  
On a sideways beach  
  
Let lessons not the pupils teach  
Justice not the lesers breach  
And maggots not have fingers  
Wagged at by leech  
  
Well I made sure  
I wrote this song in braille  
So you could touch the words  
The words that sail  
  
From my mouth back to the jail  
You could touch the words that sail  
From the mouth back to the jail  
That is posing as tongue  
  
Curtsies bows thank you sirs  
And the wearing of a business suit  
Lead to complaints of backache  
And end with a Nazi salute  
  
And once theyve got you down there  
Its so hard to restraighten your back  
If we crawl at two  
We could crawl at two two two  
  
And the target brainless dont quite reach  
Covered so kindly in your opening speech  
Is a tiny crab of thought crab of thought  
On a sideways beach  
  
Let lessons not the pupils teach  
Justice not the lesers breach  
And maggots not have fingers  
Wagged at by leech  
  
Well I made sure  
I wrote this song in braille  
So you could touch the words  
The words that sail  
  
From my mouth back to the jail  
You could touch the words that sail  
From the mouth back to the jail That is posing as tongue  
  
If we crawl at two  
We could crawl at twentytwo  
If we crawl at two  
We could crawl at twentytwo
