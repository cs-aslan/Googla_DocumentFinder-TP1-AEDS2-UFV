Somewhere theres speaking  
Its already coming in  
Oh and its rising at the back of your mind  
You never could get it  
Unless you were fed it  
Now youre here and you dont know why  
  
But under skinned knees and the skid marks  
Past the places where you used to learn  
You howl and listen  
Listen and wait for the  
Echoes of angels who wont return  
  
Chorus  
Hes everything you want  
Hes everything you need  
Hes everything inside of you  
That you wish you could be  
He says all the right things  
At exactly the right time  
But he means nothing to you  
And you dont know why  
  
Youre waiting for someone  
To put you together  
Youre waiting for someone to push you away  
Theres always another wound to discover  
Theres always something more you wish hed say  
  
Chorus  
  
But youll just sit tight  
And watch it unwind  
Its only what youre asking for  
And youll be just fine  
With all of your time  
Its only what youre waiting for  
  
Out of the island  
Into the highway  
Past the places where you might have turned  
You never did notice  
But you still hide away  
The anger of angels who wont return  
  
Chorus  
  
I am everything you want  
I am everything you need  
I am everything inside of you  
That you wish you could be  
I say all the right things  
At exactly the right time  
But I mean nothing to you and I dont know why  
And I dont know why  
Why  
I dont know
