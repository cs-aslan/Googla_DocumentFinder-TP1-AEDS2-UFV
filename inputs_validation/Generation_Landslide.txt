Please clean your plate dear  
The Lord above can see you  
Dont you know people are starving in Korea  
  
Alcohol and razor blades and poison and needles  
Kindergarten people they use them they need them  
  
The overindulgent machines were their children  
There wasnt a way down on Earth here to cool them  
Cause they looked just like humans  
At Kresges and Woolworths  
But decadent brains were at work to destroy  
Rats in batallions were ruling the street scene  
Generation landslide  
Closed the gap between em  
  
And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies  
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies  
  
Militant mothers hiding in their basements  
Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets  
  
Molotov milk bottles heaved from pink high chairs  
While Mothers Lib burned birth certificate papers  
Dad gets his allowance from his sonny the dealer  
Whos pubic to the world but involved in high finance  
  
Sisters out till five doing bankers sons hours  
But she owns a Maserati thats a gift from his father  
  
Stopped at full speed at one hundred miles per hour  
  
The Colgate invisible shield finally got em  
  
But I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies  
  
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies
