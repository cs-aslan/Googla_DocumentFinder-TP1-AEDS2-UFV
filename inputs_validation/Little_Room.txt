You and me and  
Me and you  
In my little room  
Theres room enough for us to do  
The things we like to do  
  
Oops I hit my elbow on the doorknob  
Its right there  
Its by the bed next to my head  
But I dont even care  
  
Theres stars up on the wall  
And they all glow in the dark  
And we can hear the children playing  
Outside in the park  
  
Theres bars on the window  
And if there were a fire  
Wed burn up for sure  
But thats just fine by me cause  
We would be together ever more  
  
In this little room  
In the big city were so far  
From the people that we knew in  
My big ol blue car  
  
But if we stick together  
Then I know well be okay  
Cause when it gets too cold outside  
This room is where well stay
