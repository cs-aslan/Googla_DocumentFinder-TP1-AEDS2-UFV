Ive been to Rome Dallas Texas  
Man I thought Id seen it all  
Around the world search in every corner  
Man I thought Id hit the wall  
Theres a sleepy town south of the Border  
If you go there once youll be there twice  
Lots of pretty girls coming by the dozens  
The white sand sure makes a tan look nice  
We can crash on the beach  
You know I want to make love in the sea  
We gotta try a little dance so Cabo Wabo  
Its alright by me  
Come on let me take you down  
I will show you around  
Let me take you down  
Face down in Cabo  
Kissing the ground  
Lands end youd have to see it  
Aint no picture ever say it right  
Walkin the streets doing that ole the Cabo Wabo  
Place comes to life every night  
I want to crash on the beach  
You know I want to make love in the sea  
Its all right there  
We dont have to chase it  
Fits paradise to a T  
Come on let me take you down  
I will show you around  
Let me take you down  
Face down in Cabo  
Kissing the ground  
We drink Mescal right from the bottle  
Salt shaker little lick a lime ohhh  
Throwin down down tryin to reach the bottom  
Where the guave worm well hes mine all mine  
Come on crash on the beach  
You know I want to make love in the sea  
Go try a little dance so Cabo Wabo  
Its alright by me  
Let me take you down  
I will show you around  
Let me take you down  
Face down in Cabo  
Kissing the ground  
Face down  
Down in Cabo  
Take me down  
Down to Cabo  
Face down  
Down in Cabo  
Doin the Cabo Wabo  
Take me down  
Down to Cabo  
Come on get it get it
