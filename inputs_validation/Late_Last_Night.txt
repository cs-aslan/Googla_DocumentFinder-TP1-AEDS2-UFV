I heard you come home late last night  
You moved so quietly  
Key in the door light up the stairs  
But were you thinking of me  
Dont want to lose you dont want to harm you  
I just want to feel all right  
So how can I ask you who you were with last night  
  
I listened to all your promises  
And lived with all those lies  
Pretending that Im the only one  
When Ive seen it in your eyes  
Maybe I need you maybe it aint true  
Maybe its still all right  
So how can I ask you who you were with last night  
How can I ask you who you were with last night  
  
Its down to the feeling you get when youre with someone who really matters  
Its down to the love that you can show someone who really cares  
Its not up to you its not up to me  
Takes two people to agree  
Its down to the feeling you get when youre with someone who really matters  
  
Lately you and I aint talked the way that lovers do  
Should accept the fact that maybe youve found someoe new  
If I could lose you if I could hug you  
Id still like to feel all right  
  
I wouldnt ask you who you were with  
I wouldnt ask you who you were with  
I wouldnt ask you who you were with last night  
I wouldnt ask you who you were with  
I wouldnt ask you who you were with  
I wouldnt ask you who you were with last night  
I wouldnt ask you who you were with last night
