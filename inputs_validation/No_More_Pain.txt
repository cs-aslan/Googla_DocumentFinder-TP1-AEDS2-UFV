She sits by the window with wandering eyes  
She has a song in her heart  
And a golden disguise  
Her body is torn because age doesnt heal  
Shes not letting on  
About the pain that she feels  
But she knows in her soul  
That it wont be too long  
Til Jesus comes back  
To carry her home  
  
Chorus  
Where there will be no more pain  
No more sorrow  
No more waiting  
For illusive tomorrows  
There will be no more pain  
No more dying  
No more striving or strain  
No more pain  
  
My minds eye remembers the trouble Ive seen  
All I have been through  
And how I long to be free  
But I learn by her patience that I need her resolve  
To wait for the opening of eternitys halls  
And I know that in time we will stand side by side  
When Jesus comes back receiving his bride  
  
Chorus 3X  
  
No more pain
