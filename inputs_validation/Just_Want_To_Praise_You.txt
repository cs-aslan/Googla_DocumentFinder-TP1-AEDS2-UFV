Verse  
Theres a man on the corner walking up and down the street  
Hes been homeless for a while but he makes it to church each week  
And hes thankful to wake up and take another breath each day  
You might not think he has a reason but if youll listen close hell say  
  
Chorus  
I just wanna praise You For evry little thing You do  
When my worlds turned upside down  
You turn it around  
Evry trial sent my way is ordering the steps I take  
When the storms of life get rough Ill lift Your name  
I just wanna give You praise  
  
Verse 2  
I get impatient evry once in a while when I cant see  
Your plan The trials come along and it makes it hard to even stand  
But in the middle of the battle I find Your hand to hold on to  
And I realize evrything is possible because of You  
  
Chorus  
  
Tag  
And I wanna thank You For all the little things that Youve done for me  
Youve given me a song strength to carry on Ill forever sing  
  
Chorus 2x
