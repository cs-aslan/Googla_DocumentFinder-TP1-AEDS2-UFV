Broken words into thirds like a syllable  
Bullshit runs cause if it walks then its killable  
Poison tongue on my lung licking everything  
Unsung kick drum kick kick killing me  
  
Well nothing can go wrong  
Yeah so come and get it on  
Audio explosion  
And you drop it like a bomb  
Lying through your teeth  
Smoking TNT  
Talk is cheap  
Burn your bridges easily  
  
Wake up wake up wake up  
Dont blow it  
Theyre gonna eat you alive  
You cant control it  
Wake up wake up wake up  
Dont blow it  
Theyre gonna eat you alive  
Ya know it  
  
Murder on the airwaves  
Cant stop the chaos  
Murder on the airwaves  
A rapid blood loss  
Stab me in the back  
Right in front of me  
Murder on the airwaves  
Cant stop the chaos  
Murder on the airwaves  
A rapid blood loss  
Theres no going back  
When you are dead to me  
  
Suffer ya sucker your shifty eyes selling me  
Dumb motherfucker used to scream the songs that ya scream  
Glass in my eye from my life left shattered  
Bruises and excuses like nothing ever mattered  
  
Well nothing can go wrong  
Yeah so come and get it on  
Light it up like dynamite  
And drop it like a bomb  
Lying and deceit  
Finger on repeat  
Talk is cheap  
Burn your bridges easily  
  
Wake up wake up wake up  
Dont blow it  
Theyre gonna eat you alive  
You cant control it  
Wake up wake up wake up  
Dont blow it  
Theyre gonna eat you alive  
Ya know it  
  
Murder on the airwaves  
Cant stop the chaos  
Murder on the airwaves  
A rapid blood loss  
Stab me in the back  
Right in front of me  
Murder on the airwaves  
Cant stop the chaos  
Murder on the airwaves  
A rapid blood loss  
Theres no going back  
When you are dead to me  
  
Wake up wake up wake up  
Dont blow it  
Theyre gonna eat you alive  
You cant control it  
Wake up wake up wake up  
Dont blow it  
Theyre gonna eat you alive  
Ya know it  
  
Murder on the airwaves  
Cant stop the chaos  
Murder on the airwaves  
A rapid blood loss  
Stab me in the back  
Right in front of me  
Murder on the airwaves  
Cant stop the chaos  
Murder on the airwaves  
A rapid blood loss  
Theres no going back  
When you are dead to me
