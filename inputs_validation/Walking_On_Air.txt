Close your eyes and look at me  
Ill be standing by your side  
In between the deep blue sea  
And the sheltering sky  
If we find no words to say  
To the rhythm of the waves  
Then well both surrender there  
Walking on air  
  
And the worries of the day lie down  
Under cover of the fading clouds  
The secrets of the night  
Come alive in your eyes  
You dont have to hurry  
You dont have to try  
Cause you dont have a care  
Youre walking on air
