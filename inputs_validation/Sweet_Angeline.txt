Sweet Angeline I hope nobody ever hurts you Angeline  
Youre still a child but I can see the woman fighting to bust out  
And take you far away from me sweet Angeline  
Sweet Angeline youre young and free  
Dont ever let nobody get inside your mind  
Until you get too blind to see sweet Angeline  
Angeline dont let nobody tell you that your dad dont love you  
And your mother Angeline sweet Angeline Angeline  
Angeline dont let nobody tell you that your dad dont love you  
And your mother Angeline sweet Angeline  
Angeline
