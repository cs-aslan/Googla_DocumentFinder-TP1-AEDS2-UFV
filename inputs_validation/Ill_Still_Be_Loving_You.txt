Changing my life with your love  
Has been so easy for you  
And Im amazed every day and Ill need you  
Till all the mountains are valleys  
And every ocean is dry my love  
  
Ill be yours until the sun doesnt shine  
Till time stands still  
Until the winds dont blow  
When today is just a memory to me I know  
Ill still be lovin Ill still be lovin you  
Ill still be lovin you  
  
Never before did I know  
How lovin someone could be  
Now I can see you and me for a lifetime  
Until the last moons rising  
Youll see the love in my eyes my love  
  
Ill be yours until the sun doesnt shine  
Till time stands still  
Until the winds dont blow  
When today is just a memory to me I know  
Ill still be lovin Ill still be lovin you  
  
Ill be yours until the sun doesnt shine  
Till time stands still  
Until the winds dont blow  
When today is just a memory to me I know  
Ill still be lovin Ill still be lovin you  
Ill still be lovin you  
  
Ill still be lovin Ill still be lovin  
Ill still be lovin you  
Ill still be lovin Ill still be lovin  
Ill still be lovin you
