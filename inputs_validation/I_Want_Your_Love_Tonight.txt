Oh love is like a flame now  
Upon a candle  
Get it burnin brightly  
And its atoo hot to handle  
Oh baby  
I want your love tonight  
Come on and satisfy me  
Baby dont deny me  
I want your love tonight  
Excuses boy dont hand me  
Just love and understand me  
  
Oh patiently Ive waited  
For your sweet kissin  
Though we steadydated  
You know somethins been amissin oh oh  
I want your love tonight  
I dont want to sit here and talk  
I want your love tonight  
I dont want to go for a walk  
I want your love tonight  
Oh take me up to heaven  
All the way to cloud eleven  
  
I want ayour love tonight  
Oh yeah I do  
Come on and love me baby  
Oh come on and satisfy me  
Baby dont deny me yeah  
I want your love tonight  
Love me love me baby
