Wild flowers felt good beneath my feet  
The wind blew tangles in my hair  
As long as i remember the blue eyed boy lived down the road  
Until then i never noticed he was there  
He was like a storm and keepin me awake  
And no ones gonna stop me there from runnin in the rain  
  
And it was three am and the moon was bright  
And wed sneak out and go for a ride  
And wed made love where the river meets the sky  
Yeah hed say things ive never heard  
And id hang on his every word  
And the perfect teen i gave him my heart  
And i wasnt afraid to fall  
  
Autumn leaves were breakin neath my feet  
The dawnin face had felt a tear  
He said he didnt feel the way he did before  
But somehow we were still there  
But i didnt wanna lose him  
And i knew my heart would break  
And no ones gonna stop me there from chasin the pain  
  
And it was three am and the moon was bright  
And wed sneak out and go for a ride  
And wed made love where the river meets the sky  
Yeah hed say things ive never heard  
And id hang on his every word  
And the perfect teen i gave him my heart  
And i wasnt afraid to fall  
  
I wouldnt change a single thing  
Every touch a drop of rain  
Oohh ohh yeah oh oh yeah  
And it was three am and the moon was bright  
And wed sneak out and go for a ride  
And wed made love where the river meets the sky  
And hed say things ive never heard  
And id hang on his every word  
And the perfect teen i gave him my heart  
And i wasnt afraid to fall  
  
I wasnt afraid to fall oh ohh  
Wasnt afraid to fall ohh oh
