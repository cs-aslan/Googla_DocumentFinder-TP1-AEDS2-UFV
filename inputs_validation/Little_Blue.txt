You cant write a novel from a briefcase  
You can write a poem from a trench  
You can dream a dream from A to be  
But you cant catch a bus from a bench  
  
You dont back a horse called Striding Snail  
You dont name your boat Titanic II  
So why when I see your happy smiling face  
Do I always end up singing Little Blue  
  
Little Blue how do you do  
Your smile looks like heaven  
But your eyes hold a storm about to brew  
Little Blue  
How can a flower so pretty  
Be so laden down with dew  
Little Blue  
  
How can a flower so beautiful  
Be so laden down with dew  
Little Blue  
  
You cant build a brewery on a cemetery  
You can build a pub on a church  
And people fall quicker than buildings do  
You have to decide what comes first  
  
You dont call a plane the Flying Roman  
Cause the Romans always walked and never flew  
So why when I see your happy smiling face  
Do I always end up singing Little Blue  
  
Little Blue how do you do  
Your smile looks like heaven  
But your eyes hold a storm about to brew  
Little Blue  
How can a flower so pretty  
Be so laden down with dew  
Little Blue  
  
Well Bukowski wrote a story from a barstool  
And Keats from the top of a hill  
So Im going to save my special song for you  
From a grave where its quiet and its chill  
  
Cause theres a queue of clouds assembled  
On the horizon of your smile  
When most think that youre holding back  
I know youre holding bile  
  
Little Blue how do you do  
Your smile looks like heaven  
But your eyes hold a storm about to brew  
Little Blue  
How can a flower so pretty  
Be so laden down with dew  
Little Blue  
  
How can a flower so pretty  
Be so laden down with dew  
Little Blue
