I always waste my time just wondering  
What the next man thinks of me  
Ill never do exactly what I want  
And Ill sculpt my life for your acceptance  
  
I always waste my time just wondering  
What the next man thinks of me  
Ill never do exactly what I want  
And Ill sculpt my life for your acceptance  
  
And I feel forgotten  
Feel like rotting  
Do you feel the same  
Do you feel the same  
Adolescence  
Just cant make sense  
Its calling my name  
Its calling my name  
  
Chorus  
I take a look around  
And all the things Ive found  
I call it blind hatred  
If youd stop a while  
And maybe if youd smile  
You would realize that  
Were all the same  
  
Its just like our brain  
When it goes insane  
We feel the same pain  
  
All my life Ive seemed to have this need  
I think at times it even turns to greed  
We all want to join some family  
Well even sacrifice a moral changing  
  
And I feel forgotten  
Feel like rotting  
Do you feel the same  
Do you feel the same  
Adolescence  
Just cant make sense  
Its calling my name  
Its calling my name  
  
Chorus  
  
Its just like our brain  
When it goes insane  
We feel the same pain  
  
Chorus  
  
Its just like our brain  
When it goes insane  
We feel the same pain
