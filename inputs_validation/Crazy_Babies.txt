Crazy  
Babies  
  
Crazy babies never say die  
Born to live on a permanent high  
Flying high above the world below  
Theyd better come down soon or everyone will know just why  
Nobodys gonna change them change them  
Theyve gone over the top  
Nobodys gonna tame them tame them  
Theyre never gonna stop  
  
Walk that walk  
Talk that talk  
Walk that walk  
Talk that talk  
  
Crazy  
Babies  
  
When they were born they were born to be wild  
Some say Im another devils child  
Crazy babies in a world of their own  
I am a crazy babe youd better leave me alone tonight  
  
Nobodys gonna change me change me  
Im gonna do this til I die  
Nobodys gonna tame me tame me  
So you better not try  
  
Walk that walk  
Talk that talk  
Walk that walk  
Talk that talk

Where theyre goin or about their past  
Theyre just the result of our Society  
So frustrated just like you and me thats right

Theyve gone over the top  
Nobodys gonna tame them tame them  
Theyre never gonna stop
