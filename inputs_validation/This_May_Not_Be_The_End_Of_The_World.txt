Please be quiet everyones asleep  
Stellas locked her door and shes requested some peace  
She teaches the English at the American school  
She teaches imaginary numbers and the golden rule  
She says its hard to worry about the future  
When your past is knocking at your door  
Sweet mistakes and information  
Have been her lovers before  
Hello all you losers  
Youve got nothing to fear  
This may not be the end of the world  
But you can see it from here  
She runs the motors and the music  
On the carousel ride  
She catches the children on the horses  
As they fall through the rye  
Its hard to see the future  
When your back is bending over your shoes  
Its hard holding on to nothing  
When youve got nothing to lose  
Hello all you losers  
Youve got nothing to fear  
This may not be the end of the world  
But you can see it from here  
I guess you heard about ol Pee Wee  
We had to tear his playhouse down  
Then they put him in the electric chair  
Well have some fun now  
When you see her give her some compliments on her looks  
Shell be wearing a Mardi Gras dress  
Coming after you with words and books  
Weve given you the best seats in the house  
So dont be late St Peter is at the door  
And he aint no man to wait  
Hello all you losers  
Youve got nothing to fear  
This may not be the end of the world  
But you can see it from here hello all you losers  
Youve got nothing to fear  
This may not be the end of the world  
But you can see it from here
