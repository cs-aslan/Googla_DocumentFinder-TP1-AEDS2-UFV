Am I to face these lonely halls alone  
And when you leave whos gonna walk me home  
Cause when you walk out the door I wont see you no more  
And youre the one I adore so baby  
Chorus  
Dont drop out of my life baby dont be a fool  
Dont drop out baby dont drop out now  
Youre old enough to know youre too young to face the world so cruel  
Dont drop out baby dont drop out now  
Youre not prepared to do anything  
So if you wanna buy me that diamond ring well  
Dont drop out of my life baby dont drop out  
My parents say youre lazy but you can be smart if you try  
And I know youve got a heart cause youve never ever made me cry  
They say youre no good so baby do what you should  
And stay here by my side oh darlin  
Repeat Chorus  
Dont drop out baby dont drop out now  
Dont drop out of my life  
Baby dont drop out  
Dont drop out baby dont drop out now
