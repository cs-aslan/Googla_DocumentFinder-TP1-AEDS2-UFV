Girls you know  
When youre in the mood  
In the mood  
You may meet a man  
Cant do anything good  
nothing good  
But youve got to pity him  
And try to understand  
understand  
That a hero a hero is so hard to find  
When he takes you  
For his love  
for his love  
And he tries to tell you  
That there isnt any other  
dont believe him  
Oh he may kiss you  
And tell you hell miss you  
such a shame  
But dont forget a hero is so hard to find  
When he says hello  
Dont forget theyre all the same  
you know theyre all the same  
You may end up sitting all alone  
And with yourself to blame  
Oh dont you let him  
So when he tells you  
Youve got diamonds in your eyes  
hes just lying  
Dont get carried away  
Cause you know hes selling you lies  
hes just lying  
So when you get the feeling  
The man youve gots no good  
Hes no good  
Well just remember a hero is so hard to find  
Well just remember a hero is so hard to find  
Heroes heroes are hard to find  
Heroes heroes are hard to find  
Heroes heroes are hard to find  
Heroes heroes are hard to find
