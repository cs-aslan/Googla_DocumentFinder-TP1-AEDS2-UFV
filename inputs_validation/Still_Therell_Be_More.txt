Ill bathe my eyes in a river of salt  
Ill grow myself right up to the sky  
Ill sing in the forest tear down the trees  
Ill foul all the fountains and trample the leaves  
Ill blacken your Christmas and piss on your door  
Youll cry out for mercy but still therell be more  
  
Ill put a blight in the orchard  
Ill run wild through the fields  
Ill waylay your daughter and kidnap your wife  
Savage her sexless and burn out her eyes  
Ill blacken your Christmas and piss on your door  
Youll cry out for mercy but still therell be more
