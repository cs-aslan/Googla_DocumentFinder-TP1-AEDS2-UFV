Wanda had a baby in nineteen fifty one  
The father was stranger and a stranger was the son  
Call that child James Lewis call these rooms a home  
Changing all them diapers polish all that chrome  
Seemon baby spend the night with me  
All around the schoolyard playing all the games  
Running laughing back and forth the kid with two first names  
Stranger in the closet lock the diary  
The past is running faster singing harmony  
Seemon baby spend the night with me  
God bless this kitchen said the knickknack shelf  
The dinners almost ready Go and wash yourself  
Jimmys growing up now and Wandas growing old  
The time is growin shorter the nights are long and cold  
Seemon baby spend the night with me  
Sneaking in the closet and through the diary  
Now dont you know all he saw was all there was to see  
The whole town saw Jimmy on the six oclock news  
His brains were on the sidewalk and blood was on his shoes  
Seemon baby spend the night with me  
Seemon baby spend the night with me
