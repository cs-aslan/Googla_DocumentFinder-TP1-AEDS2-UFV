Go on and take her it aint no surprise boy  
I knew that someday it had to come  
Just let me offer a word to the wise boy  
Oh take a good look at what youve won  
Then turn around boy and try to forget her  
Shes gonna hurt you before shes gone  
Cause when shes good lord there aint nothing better  
But when shes wrong she sure can be wrong  
Shell bring you sunshine so good that its frightening  
Oh but soon as the sun shines start lookin for rain  
Youll hear the thunder before you see the lightening  
As soon as its over start lookin for pain  
And you wont be sorry that you ever met her  
But youll be thankful she dont last long  
Cause when shes good lord there aint nothing better  
But when shes wrong she sure can be wrong
