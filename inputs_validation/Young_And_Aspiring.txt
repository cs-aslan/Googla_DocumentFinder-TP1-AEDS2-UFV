So lets not even try youre right lets ball it up and throw it out the window  
Its becoming all so clear in my mind  
Ive thought this through more like once or twice  
I feel that this is my last request to you  
  
Hold your breath  
Bottle it up and save it for the next one  
Its safe to say weve been riding this all night  
None of this will ever change your mind  
Its never saf to rely on borrowed time  
Now were both undone and its time to open up your eyes  
  
Consenquence its our need in times like this  
Feeling free is our modern disease  
Youre a classic disaster with a knack for losing  
Your exterior  
Im so sick  
From staring at the mirror  
  
This all needs a break from you  
And Im used to this  
  
I fear that I am just an end  
So youll play the mistaken and Ill play the victim  
In our screenplay of desire and Im still writing  
The letters Ill never send  
  
Running in circles I cant forget how many times  
Ive played this in my mind  
  
Feeling free feeling free  
This is my panic this is my call to arms
