Sleep well little children  
  
Wherever you are  
  
Tomorrow is Christmas  
  
Beneath every star  
  
Soon the snowflakes will fall  
  
And tomorrow youll see  
  
Every wish one and all  
  
Waiting under the tree  
  
Sleep well little children  
  
Pleasant dreams through the night  
  
Tomorrow is Christmas  
  
All merry and bright  
  
Soon youll hear the bells ring  
  
Time for dreams to come true  
  
As the world wakes you dream  
  
Merry Christmas to you
