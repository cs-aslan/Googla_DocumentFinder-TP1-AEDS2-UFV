Well the dawn is howling and the mainframe shakes  
Feel like Ive been sleeping in a cellar full of snakes  
My wings have been clipped my shoes have been stuck with glue  
Well if youll be my enemy Ill be your enemy too  
  
Now Ive got goons on my landing thieves on my trail  
Nazis on my telephone willing me to fail  
They were all sent by someone obviously well I know it was you  
Well if youll be my enemy Ill be your enemy too  
  
Ive a bucketful of Babylon I got a handful of lead  
Im gonna put them in a gun man point it at your head  
Because you stole all my friends and you gave me the buffalo blues  
Well if youll be my enemy Ill be my enemy too  
  
Now from the slime on your tongue to the nails on your toes  
From the scales on your skin to the stains on your clothes  
Youre gonna have to make me do something that I do not want to do  
But if youll be my enemy Ill be your enemy too  
  
My hands are tied Im nailed to the floor  
Feel like Im knocking on the unknown door  
Theres a gun at my back a blade at my throat  
I keep finding hate mail in the pockets of my coat  
Well Ive been trying to grow I been cooling my heels  
Ive have been working the treadmill Ive been working in the fields  
And I cant get to sleep I cant catch my breath  
I cant stop talking and I look like death  
But I will put right this disgrace I will rearrange you  
If youll be my enemy Ill be your enemy too  
If youll be my enemy Ill be your enemy too  
Be my enemy
