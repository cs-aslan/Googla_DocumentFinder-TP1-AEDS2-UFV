The way you move is like a full on rainstorm  
And Im a house of cards  
Youre the kind of reckless that should send me running  
But I kinda know that I wont get far  
  
And you stood there in front of me just  
Close enough to touch  
Close enough to hope you couldnt see  
What I was thinking of  
  
Drop everything now  
Meet me in the pouring rain  
Kiss me on the sidewalk  
Take away the pain  
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile  
  
Get me with those green eyes baby  
As the lights go down  
Gimme something thatll haunt me whenever youre not around  
Cause I see sparks fly when you smile  
  
My mind forgets to remind me your a bad idea  
You touch me once and its really something  
You find Im even better than you imagined I would be  
Im on my guard for the rest of the world  
But with you I know its no good  
And I could wait patiently  
But I really wish you would  
  
Drop everything now  
Meet me in the pouring rain  
Kiss me on the sidewalk  
Take away the pain  
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile  
  
Get me with those green eyes baby  
As the lights go down  
Gimme something thatll haunt me when youre not around  
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile  
  
I run my fingers through your hair  
And watch the lights go wild  
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me  
Its just wrong enough to make it feel right  
And lead me up the staircase  
Wont you whisper soft and slow  
And Im captivated by you baby  
Like a fireworks show  
  
Drop everything now  
Meet me in the pouring rain  
Kiss me on the sidewalk  
Take away the pain  
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile  
  
Get me with those green eyes baby  
As the lights go down  
Gimme something thatll haunt me when youre not around  
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile  
  
When sparks fly oh baby smile  
When sparks fly
