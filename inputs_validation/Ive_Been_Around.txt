Ive been around  
I used to sing songs that were handmedowns  
Ive been called a hero  
Ive been called a clown  
Ive learned the old ways and the new ways now  
  
Ive been around  
I can drop names that will knock ya down  
Ive rock and rolled and Ive fiddled around  
From Hollywood to the Nashville sound  
  
Ive been around  
Climbed the highest mountain I found  
I went to the top and I fell back down  
And I know what Im talking about  
Cause Ive been around  
  
Ive been in love  
Ive been down on my knees and prayed to God above  
Why does so much pain go with so mich love  
Why is she still the one Im dreaming of   
  
Yeah Ive been around  
And the best two friends Ive ever found  
Are a womans love and a guitar sound  
And I know what Im talking about  
Cause Ive been around  
Yeah Ive been around
