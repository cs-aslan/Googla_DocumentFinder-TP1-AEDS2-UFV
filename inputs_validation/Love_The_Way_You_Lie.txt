Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
I cant tell you what it really is  
I can only tell you what it feels like  
And right now theres a steel knife in my windpipe  
I cant breathe but I still fight while I can fight  
As long as the wrong feels right its like Im in flight  
High off of love drunk from my hate  
Its like Im huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer  
I suffocate and right before Im about to drown  
She resuscitates me she fucking hates me  
And I love it wait  
Where you going Im leaving you  
No you aint come back  
Were running right back here we go again  
Its so insane cause when its going good its going great  
Im Superman with the wind at his back shes Lois Lane  
But when its bad its awful  
I feel so ashamed I snapped whos that dude  
I dont even know his name I laid hands on her  
Ill never stoop so low again I guess I dont know my own strength  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
You ever love somebody so much  
You can barely breathe when youre with them you meet  
And neither one of you even know what hit em  
Got that warm fuzzy feeling yeah them chills used to get em  
Now youre getting fucking sick of looking at em  
You swore youve never hit em never do nothing to hurt em  
Now youre in each others face  
Spewing venom and these words when you spit em  
You push pull each others hair scratch claw bit em  
Throw em down pin em so lost in the moments when youre in em  
Its the rage thats the culprit it controls you both  
So they say its best to go your separate ways  
Guess that they dont know ya cause today that was yesterday  
Yesterday is over its a different day  
Sound like broken records playin over but you promised her  
Next time youll show restraint  
You dont get another chance  
Life is no Nintendo game but you lied again  
Now you get to watch her leave  
Out the window guess thats why they call it window pane  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
Now I know we said things did things  
That we didnt mean and we fall back into the same patterns  
Same routine but your tempers just as bad as mine is  
Youre the same as me but when it comes to love youre just as blinded  
Baby please come back it wasnt you  
Baby it was me maybe our relationship isnt as crazy as it seems  
Maybe thats what happens When a tornado meets a volcano  
All I know is I love you too much to walk away now  
Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk  
Dont you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk  
Told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball  
Next time Im pissed Ill aim my fist at the dry wall  
Next time there will be no next time  
I apologize even though I know its lies  
Im tired of the games I just want her back I know Im a liar  
If she ever tries to fucking leave again  
Im a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie
