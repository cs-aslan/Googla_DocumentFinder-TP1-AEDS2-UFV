I know whats on your mind  
Lets lay it on the line  
All the things were missin  
Look I just came back to town  
Drink that green dragon down  
Its time for me talk and you to listen  
I know my heart I know it well  
Bet your analyst forgot to ask that question  
Were at the start and time will tell  
  
Chorus  
Till the end  
Your name will touch my lips like prayin  
Till the end  
Ill be the keeper of the words your heart is sayin  
Till the end  
You and I will learn a language new and unspoken  
Till the end  
Well be the ones who hold the key to a lock thats open  
  
Girl not so long ago  
A boy that didnt know  
That he was hurtin  
Pushed somebody down  
They fell and hit the gound  
But i never meant for you to be that person  
You know my heart you know me well  
Its never been my style to take advantage  
Were at the start and time will tell
