The wind is blowing down the quiet river  
A shining road that carries you alone  
Baby boy my love will last forever  
If youre to live I must give you up to God  
  
I know our God will guide protect and keep you  
Teach you faith and hold you by the heart  
Though your mothers heart is broken by your leaving  
Her Father knows just who he is and who you are  
  
Chorus  
I wish that life wasnt always ending up this way  
With Heavens love at stake and hell to pay  
But you in Gods loving plan might be the missing part  
You must live  
So I give you to his heart  
  
The wind is blowing down the silent river  
A shining road that leaves me all alone  
A life for yous worth losing you forever  
Some day well stand in Gods fair land forever home  
  
Chorus x 2
