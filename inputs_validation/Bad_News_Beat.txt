Have you heard the news  
I lost my baby to another man  
I got a bulletin of news  
Late breaking story that I dont understand  
Should I call her up late  
Should I ask her how she really feels  
Should I try to make a date  
For a time when we can touch  
And feel  
  
She so on fire  
Shes my desire  
  
Ive got the bad news beat  
And my reception is loud and clear  
Ive got a man in the street  
Telling me what I dont want to hear  
Ive got an eye in the sky  
Taking pictures that I dont want to see  
Shes got a brand new guy  
Looks like shes never coming back  
To me  
  
She so on fire  
Shes my desire  
  
Ive got an eye in the sky  
Ive got a man in the street  
Ive got the bad news beat  
Ive got the bad news beat
