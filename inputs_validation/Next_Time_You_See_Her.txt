Shes got everything a man could ever ask for  
She is lovely brighter than a morning star  
She is so beautiful portrait of a sunset  
She got everything including my old car  
  
Chorus  
Next time you see her tell her that I love her  
Next time you see her tell her that I care  
Next time you see her tell her that I love her  
Next time I see you boy youd better beware  
  
Im just trying to warn you that youre bound to get hurt  
I couldnt be her last love so how could you be her first  
I want to tell you buddy things are bound to get rough  
I know that shes only flirting but I think that Ive had enough  
  
Chorus  
  
And if you see her again I will surely kill you  
And if you see her again I will surely kill you  
  
Chorus  
  
And if you see her again I will surely kill you  
And if you see her again I will surely kill you  
  
Chorus
