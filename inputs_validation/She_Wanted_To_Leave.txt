Three men is all they were  
Three men out at sea  
Three men came aboard my ship and took my true love from me  
I couldnt believe  
She wanted to leave  
She wanted to leave  
  
I loved you so long  
Since you were a child  
Ive cared for your every need  
Ive tried to make you smile  
And all the while  
You wanted to leave  
You wanted to leave  
  
Go gather the guns  
Well blast them at sea  
She begged for me not to shoot  
For my true love is here with me  
Ive never loved thee  
Now I must leave  
Now I must leave  
  
So go fetch a bottle of rum dear friends and fill up my glass to the rim  
For Im not the man I used to be  
Now Im one of them
