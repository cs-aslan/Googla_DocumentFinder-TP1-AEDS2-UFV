Gonna change my way of thinking  
Make myself a different set of rules  
Gonna change my way of thinking  
Make myself a different set of rules  
Gonna put my good foot forward  
And stop being influenced by fools  
  
So much oppression  
Cant keep track of it no more  
So much oppression  
Cant keep track of it no more  
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers  
And old men turning young daughters into whores  
  
Stripes on your shoulders  
Stripes on your back and on your hands  
Stripes on your shoulders  
Stripes on your back and on your hands  
Swords piercing your side  
Blood and water flowing through the land  
  
Well dont know which one is worse  
Doing your own thing or just being cool  
Well dont know which one is worse  
Doing your own thing or just being cool  
You remember only about the brass ring  
You forget all about the golden rule  
  
You can mislead a man  
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes  
You can mislead a man  
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes  
But theres only one authority  
And thats the authority on high  
  
I got a Godfearing woman  
One I can easily afford  
I got a Godfearing woman  
One I can easily afford  
She can do the Georgia crawl  
She can walk in the spirit of the Lord  
  
Jesus said Be ready  
For you know not the hour in which I come  
Jesus said Be ready  
For you know not the hour in which I come  
He said He who is not for Me is against Me  
Just so you know where Hes coming from  
  
Theres a kingdom called Heaven  
A place where there is no pain of birth  
Theres a kingdom called Heaven  
A place where there is no pain of birth  
Well the Lord created it mister  
About the same time He made the earth
