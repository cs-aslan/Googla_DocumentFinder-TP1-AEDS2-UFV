You say everythings alright  
I say nothing can go right yeah  
Oh what a game you can play  
Sad days add to confusion  
Sad ways end in dillusion yeah  
Thats the name of the game  
  
Well I know your love is rough  
And the road you take is tough  
But I just cant get enough  
Chequered love  
  
Touch me do what you want to  
Say no then I just need you  
Babe your gonna drive me insane  
You are man for all seasons  
You are man with no reasons yeah  
Youre the man with no pain  
  
Well I know your love is rough  
And the road you take is tough  
But I just cant get enough  
Chequered love  
  
Oh I cant let go  
Oh I cant let go  
cause I need you so tonight  
  
You say everythings alright
