She was living in a perfect house  
With pictures of smiling faces  
But theres a different story told inside  
Underneath it all  
With the sunglasses and makeup on  
Blaming the stairs at Macys  
They all knew  
No one even asked is a something wrong  
So they wait  
Now shes gone  
  
I dont understand the concept of  
The power of one is stronger  
Why dont people seem to care at all  
As long as its not about them  
I say  
I guess weve underestimated love  
Or why would we hurt each other  
Dont you find that ironical  
When love is all we need  
Oh yeah  
  
He is living down his sunset strip  
Singing the blues for money  
Its easy just to look the other way  
When you have it all  
Hes reaching out to find a helping hand  
But nobody seems to bother  
Hear them say  
Its not my problem so its not my call  
Youre on your own  
Through it all  
  
Chorus  
  
When it all becomes too real  
We have a tendency to be  
Too scared to face it  
Its breaking my heart to see  
When love is all we need  
  
Chorus
