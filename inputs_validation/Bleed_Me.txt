Bleed me Let it out slow suck me dry  
You got to feed me take me down low  
Where those angels fly  
aint nothing that I need no more  
Like a full truckload of pain  
All over like the final score  
With a fist full of open veins you got to bleed me  
To all the people that I loved I hated lied  
To all my enemies that tried  
CH  
Bleed me  
Read me torn out pages in an open book  
Got to please me one more razor now before I cook  
Getting hotter as the seconds pass  
But Im told thats what I need  
Getting colder now its flowing fast  
But Im told thats why I bleed  
To all the people that I loved I hated lied  
To all my enemies that tried  
CH  
BR  
I remember sitting in the open air  
I remember calling out your name  
I remember clearly that I didnt care  
I hadnt changed  
I need to go away  
I need to leave you here  
I need to face my fears
