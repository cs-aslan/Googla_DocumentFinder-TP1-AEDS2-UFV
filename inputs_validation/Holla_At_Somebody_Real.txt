Fabolous  
Yo  
Baby Girl where you at   
  
Lil Mo  
Right here  
Right here

Heres another one  
  
Fabolous  
You need to holla at somebody real such as myself  
Wont nobody do as much as myself  
And its so real ill hop out and get the dutches myself  
For a pretty girl as such as yaself  
cause ima busy man I dont see too much for myself  
And sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself  
But I make the time when I have to  
Learn to take my time and be careful when dealing wit women  
Theres some who be willing and skimming  
And dive in to relationships cause I got a million to swim in  
Theyll throw it to you faster than schilling and clemens  
But feelings aint the only thing that you can catch now  
Some throw lawyers that you hoping they fetch thous  
Others pass diseases that you can catch now  
But in my minutes so lone I think about this crazy world  
And I dont want to live in it alone  
Come on  
  
Chorus Lil Mo  
Ill give you all my love  
And you can always trust  
My loyalty honesty and security and ill never  
Ill never leave no no no  
Can none of these other chicks fuck wit me  
So holla at somebody real cause i  
cause Im so real  
  
Fabolous  
real love Im searching for a real love like j blige in 92  
but I pray I will find you  
And say whether the storm will leave the gray skies behind you  
The fake may try to blind you  
Thats why I stay fly like I do  
And no I can trust everybody that I say hi and bye to  
First I need a girl that may die as my boo  
Then I may try the I dos  
But I refuse to be trick  
Or used by a chick  
Who gets amusement of kicks  
Out of abusing my dick  
When its real Im all in it  
But I dont want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it  
no before it didnt matter who  
Now I look for some with a little attitude  
I could chitter chatter to good looking  
But witty and compatible  
Long hair wit a fatty too  
And thatll do  
  
Chorus  
  
Lil Mo  
No Im not trying to pressure you  
But my loves to incredible  
For to waste  
In front of your face  
Then I give you something you can feel  
To let you know your hollering at somebody real  
  
Fabolous  
I need to holla at somebody real could that be you  
The feelings that I feel could that be true  
Most cats lay where the hood rats be boo  
But Im the kinda cat that strays away  
Thats til somebody real sways my way  
Then I might spend some days always  
On a Asia bay  
Eating food made the Cajun way  
And sippin ga lil saki  
Blowing a lil brocoli  
But this world is full of fluzis  
And bullshit usually  
I pull Im choosy  
And on this joint and at this point  
I know I need to holla at somebody real  
For real
