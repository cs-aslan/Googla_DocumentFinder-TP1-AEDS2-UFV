If you go away on this summer day  
Then you might as well take the sun away  
All the birds that flew in a summer sky  
When our love was new and our hearts were high  
When the day was young and the night was loong  
And the moon stood still for the night birds song  
If you go away If you go away If you go away  
  
But if you stay Ill make you a day  
Like no day has been or will be again  
Well sail on the sun well ride on the rain  
Well talk to the trees and worship the wind  
Then if you goo Ill understand  
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand  
If you go away If you go away If you go away  
  
If you go away as I know you must  
Therell be nothin left in the world to trust  
Just an empty room full of empty space  
Like the empty look I see on your face  
Can I tell you now as you turn to go  
Ill be dying slowly till your next hello  
If you go away If you go away If you go away  
  
But if you stay Ill make you a night  
Like no night has been or will be again  
Ill sail on your smile Ill ride on your touch  
Ill talk to your eyes that II love so much  
But if you go I wont cry  
For the goods gone from goodbye  
If you go away If you go away If you go away
