For some that dont understand our purpose  
And may not understand our praise  
We as the family in Jesus name  
Would like to tell you the reason why we sing  
Family  
  
Someone asked a question  
Why do we sing  
When we lift our hands to Jesus  
What do we really mean  
Someone made we wonder  
When we sing our song  
At times we may be cryin  
And nothings even wrong  
  
Chorus  
I sing because Im happy  
I sing because Im free  
His eyes are the sparrow  
Thats the reason why I sing  
Glory Hallelujah  
Your the reason why I sing  
  
For some that dont understand our purpose  
And may not understand our praise  
We as the family in Jesus name  
Would like to tell you the reason why we sing  
Family  
  
Chorus  
  
Glory Hallelujah  
Your the reason why I sing  
Glory Hallelujah  
Your the reason why I sing  
Glory Hallelujah  
I give the praises to you  
Glory Hallelujah  
Your the reason why I sing  
  
And when the song is over  
Weve all said Amen  
And your heart just keep on singing  
And the song will never end  
And if somebody ask you was it just a show  
Lift your and a be a witness  
And tell the whole the whole world no  
And when we cross that river  
To study war no more  
We will sing our song to Jesus  
The one whom we adore  
  
Chorus  
  
Glory Hallelujah  
Your the reason why I sing  
Glory Hallelujah  
Your the reason why I sing  
Glory Hallelujah  
I give the praises to you  
Glory Hallelujah  
Your the reason why I sing  
  
Your the reason why I sing  
Your the reason why I sing  
Your the reason why I sing  
Your the reason why I sing  
Your the reason why I sing  
  
Oh I love you  
I love your name Jesus  
Glory Hallelujah  
For the rest of my life Jesus  
Youll be the reason why I sing
