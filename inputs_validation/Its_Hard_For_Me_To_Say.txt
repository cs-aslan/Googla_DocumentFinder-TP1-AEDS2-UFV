Didnt know til today  
That you would love for me to say  
All of things I feel  
Though you dont doubt theyre real  
Insecure very shy  
Are the only reasons I have why  
I never say the things that you would love to hear  
All the words I try  
Disappoint me and I cry  
So theyre words I dont always say but  
Its in my love its in my feeling  
Its in the very same heart that loved you from the start  
Its in the heat its in the spirit  
And its got me totally high  
Its just hard for me to say why  
Kinda sad kinda blue  
Because I wanted to tell you  
That you were in my heart  
Though we were far apart  
Didnt know how to say  
All the little things to make you stay  
And not to keep assuming  
You could read my mind  
Youre the one I love  
Though its hard for you to know  
Cause the words I dont always say but  
Its in my love its in my feeling  
Its in the very same heart that loved you from the start  
Its in the heat its in the spirit  
And its got me totally high  
Its just hard for me to say why
