Bastille mausoleum  
Stockyard churchyard  
Your mammys backyard  
  
I dont care when or where  
I just care that youre there  
And that you will  
  
Kiss me a lot kiss me a lot  
Kiss me all over my face  
Kiss me a lot kiss me a lot  
Kiss me all over the place  
Kiss me a lot kiss me a lot  
Kiss me all over and then when youve kissed me  
Kiss me all over again  
  
Bastille mausoleum  
Stockyard churchyard  
Your mammys backyard  
  
I dont care when or where  
I only care that the two of us are there  
And that you and that you will  
  
Kiss me a lot kiss me a lot  
Kiss me all over my face  
Kiss me a lot kiss me a lot  
Kiss me all over the place  
Kiss me a lot kiss me a lot  
Kiss me all over and then when youve kissed me  
Kiss me all over again  
  
Kiss me a lot kiss me a lot  
Kiss me all over my face  
Kiss me a lot kiss me a lot  
All over the place  
Kiss me a lot kiss me a lot  
I dont care where or when but when youve kissed me  
Kiss me all over again
