Oh youve been so long  
In the shadows of the big man  
How long can you take it  
How far can you go  
Dont you know how strong  
In the shadows of the big man  
While he smiles in the sunlight  
You can die in the cold  
  
Spend your life In the shadows of the big man  
Sell your wife and children if it made him smile  
How long can you take it or do you really need it  
Oh standing in the shadows the shadows of the big man  
And youd love all the world to see  
How you break your chains and set yourself free  
And all you got to do is walk away  
Walk away from the shadows of the big man
