I just cant be seen with you  
I admit it anyway  
  
I just got obscene with you  
I dont stand a chance with you  
I never did anyway  
  
I cant even sleep with you  
Id always be awake  
I just cant be seen with you  
Its for your own sake  
  
Youre better off anyway  
Its too dangerous baby  
Its too dangerous  
Its too dangerous  
I just cant be seen with you  
  
They set us up so they can shoot us down  
Put us six feet underground  
Its just too deep for me baby  
  
I just cant be seen with you  
Although it hurts me to say  
Yeah it was just a dream with you  
Yeah because youre married anyway  
  
Oh shit  
  
Babe I dont stand a chance with you  
Oh youre better off this way  
Its hit and run away  
Its just too dangerous baby  
  
I just cant be yes I got to chill this thing with you  
I just cant be  
Its just too dangerous baby  
Baby its just too much for me  
  
I just cant be  
I just cant be seen nowhere around you baby  
I just cant be  
Its too dangerous its just too dangerous baby  
  
Even in the dark  
I just cant be  
Yeah I got to chill with you  
I just cant be
