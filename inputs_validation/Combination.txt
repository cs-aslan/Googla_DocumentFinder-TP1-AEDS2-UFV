The street is cold the dawn is grey  
My heart says no but my head says stay  
My work is finished or so Ive been told  
Cant part the three of us once we got a hold  
  
I forgot the name  
I took a shot on the chin  
Im rearranging my game  
Tell by the shape Im in  
  
In line of fire you know what to say  
They gave us no choices just one shade of grey  
My legs keep movin I dont seem to stray  
But I know each step we take theyre one step away  
  
I found the secret the key to the vault  
We walked in darkness kept hittin the walls  
I took the time to feel for the door  
I found the secret the key to it all  
  
I got the Nouveauree  
And dragged it home to bed  
I traded you for me  
I took it all and said  
  
I find my own fun  
Sometimes for free I got to pay it to come lookin for me  
Walkin on Gucci  
Wearin Yves St Laurent barely stay on cause Im so God damn gaunt
