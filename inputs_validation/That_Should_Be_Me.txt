Everybodys laughing in my mind  
Rumors spreading bout this other guy  
Do you do what you did when you did with me  
Does he love you the way I can  
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me  
Cause baby I didnt  
  
That should be me holding your hand  
That should be me making you laugh  
That should be me this is so sad  
That should be me  
That should be me  
That should be me feeling your kiss  
That should be me buying you gifts  
This is so wrong  
I cant go on  
Till you believe  
That should be me  
That should be me  
  
You said you needed a little time from my mistakes  
Its funny how you used that time to have me replaced  
Did you think that I wouldnt see you out at the movies  
What you doin to me  
Youre taking him where we used to go  
Now if youre trying to break my heart  
Its working cause you know  
  
That should be me holding your hand  
That should be me making you laugh  
That should be me this is so sad  
That should be me  
That should be me  
That should be me feeling your kiss  
That should be me buying you gifts  
This is so wrong I cant go on  
Till you believe  
That should be me  
  
I need to know should I fight for our love  
Or disarm  
Its getting harder to shield  
This pain in my heart oh oh  
  
That should be me holding your hand  
That should be me making you laugh  
That should be me this is so sad  
That should be me  
That should be me  
That should be me feeling your kiss  
That should be me buying you gifts  
This is so wrong  
I cant go on  
Till you believe  
That that should be me  
  
Holding your hand  
That should be me  
The one making you laugh oh baby oh  
That should be me  
  
That should be me  
Giving you flowers  
That should be me  
Talking for hours  
That should be me that should be me  
That should be me  
  
I never shoulda let you go  
Never shoulda let you go oh oh  
That should be me  
Im never gonna let you go ooh  
That should be me  
Never gonna let you go oh oh  
Im never gonna let you go ooh
