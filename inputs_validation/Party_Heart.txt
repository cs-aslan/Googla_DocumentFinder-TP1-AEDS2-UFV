Youve got a party heart a gay time party heart  
Youre only happy when the partys going on  
And it makes me sad because I know that partys have to end  
And when this partys over youll be gone  
  
I love your party heart your playful party heart  
But though you make me laugh you also make me cry  
Cause I know you only think of me as just a party friend  
And when the partys done youll say goodbye  
  
A playtime girl like you plays lots of thrills in life it seems  
But oh what Id ever give to be the playboy of your dreams  
Id tame your party heart your fickle party heart  
And someday thats just what some party boy will do  
  
But I love you so I guess that Ill cry just as much as you  
When someone breaks your party heart in two  
When someone breaks your party heart in two  
When someone breaks your party heart in two
