Ill take one for the money  
Cause Ive already paid

of the shifting plates  
Ill take three for South America  
Its snorting in gaunwana

When they killed Captain America  
  
Okay Im back Ill take the  
Hanging upside down the crucifix  
Alright I lied I wanna follow  
Proud that you cut yourself  
Feeling Feeling hahahahaha  
  
What can I say for the little biddy baby  
Who raised the price throwing things that theres a pig in the bed  
Big brother coming on me like a sledgehammer  
Why stand beside me just play dead  
  
One twenty hear the tick this is where we begin  
Two twenty twenty seven people who actually can  
Overdosed on the experience  
And paid for the delivery  
Feel like crying Jesus fucked you like a prostitute baby  
Sorry Muhamed was a racist prick  
Boy that Gaea was a cunty bitch  
Gianna blowing out the bottle  
Fall I bet you cut yourself I bet you cut yourself  
  
What can I say for the little biddy baby  
Who raised the price throwing things that theres a pig in the bed  
Big brother coming on me like a sledgehammer  
Why stand beside me just play dead  
Dont be caught thoughtless its in your head  
  
And for the day confined to fast and fires  
But this internal blaze it must not be  
Mark me I will  
My hour has always come  
Thy nodded and combined locks with part  
I am thy fathers spirit  
When I to sulferous and tormenting flames  
  
What can I say for the little biddy baby  
Who raised the price throwing things that theres a pig in the bed  
Now I cant recall it almost tips over  
Why stand beside me just play  
  
What can I say for the little biddy baby  
What can I say for the little biddy baby  
What can I say for the little biddy baby  
Why stand beside me just play dead
