Sweet memories flashing very quickly by  
Reminding me giving me a reason why  
I know that my goal is more than a thought  
Ill be there when I teach what Ive been taught  
  
You know weve told you before  
But you didnt hear us then  
So you still question why  
You didnt listen again  
  
Sweet memories I never thought it would be like this  
Reminding me just how close I came to missing  
I know that this is the way for me to go  
Youll be there when you know what I know
