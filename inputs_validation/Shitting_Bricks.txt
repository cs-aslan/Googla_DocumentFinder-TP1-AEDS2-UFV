Ah never thought it could happen to me  
But it did now look at me  
Im alone standing in my cell  
Staring at the wall living in hell  
  
All of my life I never said when  
I did it again and again  
Breaking smashing and stealing  
I never knew when to quit  
  
I turned 18 I shouldve stopped  
Thought Id never get caught  
But I did I got caught  
Now I feel pretty stupid  
Fuck  
  
Im shitting bricks  
Im shitting bricks  
Im shitting bricks  
Im shitting bricks by the dozen  
Im shitting bricks  
Im shitting bricks  
  
Moms rules  
Why cant I do what I want  
Why must I do what my parents want  
  
I gotta live by moms rules  
I gotta live by moms rules  
I gotta live by moms rules  
I gotta live by moms rules  
I gotta live by moms rules yeah
