Lysistrata open up the bedroom door  
What is the matter aint you in love with me no more  
I enlisted in the army today  
One more time before I march away  
  
Make me feel like a big strong man  
You say you dont care about my pride  
You love me too much just to let me die  
And you wont let me come inside  
  
Unless I dont go to war no more  
Lysistrata little boys like to have their fun  
And you know I gotta put on my colors and get my gun  
Every able bodied man that I know  
  
Every patriot is packed to go  
Wont you give me a last goodbye  
Ill be sent off to a distant land  
To spill my blood upon some foreign sand  
  
And I may die by an enemys hand  
And then I wont go to war no more  
Send the boys all back to the farm  
Tell the troops it was a false alarm  
  
Cause if I die I want to be in your arms  
And so I wont go to war no I wont go to war  
Said I wont go to war no more
