Father time Im running late  
Im winding down Im growing tired  
Seconds drift into the night  
The clock just ticks till my time expires  
You were once my friend  
Now I know I cant tie your hands  
The days I saved I couldnt spend  
They fell like sand through the hourglass  
No time to lose no time to choose  
Time taking time its taken mine  
Scenes of my life seem so unkind  
Time chasing time creeps up behind  
I cant run forever and time waits for no one  
Not even me  
An enemy I cant defend  
My final place a deadly end  
Lifes just a speck in space  
Dreams of an eternal resting place  
I cant get any younger  
Time has brutal hunger
