Way up north where the snow flies and the sun dont hardly shine  
If it werent for my true love Id long ago lost my mind  
Id long ago lost my mind  
  
Theres good folks here good folks there most everywhere I go  
But the land of my heart is down where the snow white cotton grows  
Where the snow white cotton grows  
  
When the river runs over from the melting snow well take to the higher
ground  
When the water goes down again well saddle our old paint  
Well be homeward bound  
Me and my love will be homeward bound  
  
Heartstrings hold tighter than the roots of a live oak tree  
Holdin through tornado winds  
Tougher than timber stronger than steel  
Theyll guide me back southward again  
Theyll guide me back southward again  
  
When the river runs over from the melting snow well take to the higher
ground  
And when the water goes down again well saddle our old paint  
Well be homeward bound  
Me and my love will be homeward bound
