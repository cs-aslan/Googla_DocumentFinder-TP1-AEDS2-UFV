I like to reminisce about a time Ive never had  
A book that noone read  
A film that never made me sad  
And you remind of a place Ive never been  
  
And something noone said  
When I was 17  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
  
Youll wake up in it  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
But you probably wont admit it  
  
Remember when we never struggled through  
A bad time we never had  
A love we never fell into  
Please dont remind me to forget  
  
Cause forgiveness is a place  
I aint got used to yet  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
  
Youll wake up in it  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
But you probably wont admit it  
  
All I ever wanted  
Was to radiate your home  
But I guess it doesnt matter  
So come reminisce about a time we didnt have  
  
I hear theres a sequel to that film that never made you sad  
Dont rewrite my history  
Cause you never really know  
How much you didnt mean to me  
  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
Youll wake up in it  
One fine day  
  
In the middle of the night  
But you probably wont admit it
