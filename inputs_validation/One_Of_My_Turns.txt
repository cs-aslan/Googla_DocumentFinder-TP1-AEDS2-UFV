Oh my God What a fabulous room Are all these your guitars  
Im sorry sir I didnt mean to startle you  
This place is bigger than our apartment  
Let me know when youre entering a room  
Yes sir  
Um Can I get a drink of water  
I was wondering about  
You want some huh  
Yes  
Oh wow look at this tub Do you want to take bath  
Ill have to find out from Mrs Bancroft what time she wants to meet us for
her main  
What are watching  
If youll just let me know as soon as you can  Mrs Bancroft Mrs
Bancroft  
Hello  
I dont understand  
Are you feeling okay  
  
Day after day love turns grey  
Like the skin of a dying man  
And night after night we pretend its all right  
But I have grown older and  
You have grown colder and  
Nothing is very much fun any more  
And I can feel one of my turns coming on  
I feel cold as a razor blade  
Tight as a tourniquet  
Dry as a funeral drum  
  
Run to the bedroom  
In the suitcase on the left  
Youll find my favorite axe  
Dont look so frightened  
This is just a passing phase  
One of my bad days  
Would you like to watch TV  
Or get between the sheets  
Or contemplate the silent freeway  
Would you like something to eat  
Would you like to learn to fly  
Wouldya  
Would you like to see me try  
  
Would you like to call the cops  
Do you think its time I stopped  
Why are you running away
