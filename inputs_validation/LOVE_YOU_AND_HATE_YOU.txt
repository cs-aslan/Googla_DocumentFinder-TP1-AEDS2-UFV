I love and hate you  
At the same time  
I need you dont need you  
Is that such a crime  
I wouldnt walk down the road  
To say goodbye  
I couldnt give you up  
To some other guy  
I wouldnt do anything  
That you asked me to  
But you know  
That its true  
I still love you  
I want you to help me  
To make up my mind  
I need you to hear me at least  
Some of the time  
I wouldnt blame you  
If you had to run away  
I couldnt stand to live  
Like this another day  
But I would sell my soul  
To get you back today  
Cause you know  
That its true  
I still love you  
I wouldnt blame you  
If you had to run away  
I couldnt stand to live  
Like this another day  
But I would sell my soul  
To get you back today  
Cause you know  
That its true  
I still love you  
And you know  
That its true  
I still love you  
And you know  
That its true  
I still love you
