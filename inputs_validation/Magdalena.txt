She was only seventeen  
In her prime of life she was lean  
And her only dream was to be on the silver screen  
She hailed from north of baltimore  
Her mama says shed end up a whore  
And she spent up all her dough at the movie show  
Shes all go go go yeah yeah  
She wears her pants on her hips too low  
She learned it all in magazines  
Shes magdalene  
Aint it funny how the sun shines  
She was only seventeen  
She packed her bag and went to the scene  
She said Im gonna take on this town Im gonna be the queen  
She mingled like shed been there before  
She worked it till they hollered for more  
Then she took off all her clothes  
Now everbody knows  
Shes all go go go yeah yeah  
She wears her pants on her hips too low  
She learned it all in magazines  
Shes magdalene  
Aint it funny how the sun shines
