I fell in love with Rinfy the gypsy  
He said when I grew up hed marry me  
Carry me away on his steed  
  
Dont worry my baby  
Dont die my funny little darling  
Im going away for a little while  
And shouldnt be gone for very long   
  
Ooh then I really fell for Geoffrey our gardener  
He said hed marry me too  
Oh and I believed him just like a fool  
  
Dont worry my honey  
Dont die my funny little doll  
Im going away for a little while  
Shouldnt be gone for very long   
Ooh long long long  
  
Playing canasta in ccold rooms  
Playing canasta in cold rooms  
Playing canasta upstairs downstairs  
And in my lovers Ooh  
  
I met a boy who took me upstairs  
Then took me in his arms  
And told me I comforted him uhhuh  
  
Dont worry my dear  
Dont cry you weird little stranger  
Im going away  
You probably wont ever see me again   
  
Oh yes I know Im always falling  
Gazing at hazy goldfish in your swimming eyes  
How could I not lie there with you  
  
Dont worry my darling  
Dont die my silly little baby  
Im going away for a little while  
And shouldnt be gone for very long   
Ooh long long long  
  
Playing canasta in ccold rooms  
Playing canasta in cold rooms  
Playing canasta upstairs downstairs  
And in my lovers Ooh
