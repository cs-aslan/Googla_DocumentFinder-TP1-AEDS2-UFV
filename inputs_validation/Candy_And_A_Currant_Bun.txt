Oh my girl sitting in the sky  
Go buy candy and a currant bun  
I like to see you run  
Lay back  
Dont talk to me  
Please just fuck with me  
Please you know Im feeling frail  
Its true sun shining very bright  
Its you Im gonna love tonight  
Ice cream tastes good in the afternoon  
Ice cream tastes good if you eat it soon  
Dont touch me child  
Please know you drive me wild  
Please you know Im feeling frail  
Dont try another cat  
Dont go where other you must know why  
Very very very frail  
Oh my girl sitting in the sun  
Go buy candy and a currant bun  
I like to see you run  
Like that
