Dolly Parton  
Our love affair is bitter sweet  
Insecure and incomplete  
And Ive often wondered why your leavings been so long delayed  
Its all become so complicated  
Maybe you feel obligated  
And out of simpathy for me you stay  
But I had rather live alone  
Than live with someone who doesnt love me  
And Id rather have you go than stay  
And put me down a thinkin youre above me  
Our love affair is so wound up  
Its best that we unwind  
And if you dont love me leave me  
And dont let it trouble your mind  
Youve waited much too long to leave afraid of how Id take it  
And Im deeply touched by your concern but I think I can make it  
It wont be easy for a while but Ill forget in time  
And if you dont love me leave me and dont let it trouble your mind  
I had rather live alone  
Than live with someone who doesnt love me  
And Id rather have you go than stay  
And put me down athinkin youre above me  
Our love affair is so wound up  
Its best that we unwind  
And if you dont love me leave me  
And dont let it trouble your mind
