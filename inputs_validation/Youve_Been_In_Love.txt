Youve been in love that little bit too long  
Youve been in love and I think that you know  
Youve been in love its time to move on  
Youve been in love and its starting to show  
  
Shes getting to used to your face getting too used to your smile  
Shes saying the same things every morning before you leave her  
  
Youd better run find out whats going through her mind  
Youd better look out cos hes not far behind  
Youve been in love that little bit too long  
Youve been in love and I think that you know  
Youve been in love its time to move on  
Youve been in love and its starting to show  
  
Suddenly shes trying to please you you start to think shes acting strange  
And after all these years she wears makeup in the morning  
Youd better run find out whats going through her mind  
Youd better look out cos hes not far behind  
  
Did you really believe shes doing it all for you  
Oh cant you see theres somebody else  
You never showed it you should have known it  
  
Youve been in love yeah youve been in love  
Youve been in love yeah youve been in love  
  
Going round singing all those love songs songs you havent heard for years  
Youre gonna have to ask her why shes so happy  
Youd better run find out whats going through her mind  
But it may be too late and I know why  
  
Youve been in love that little bit too long  
Youve been in love and I think that you know  
Youve been in love its time to move on  
Youve been in love and its starting to show  
Youve been in love that little bit too long  
Youve been in love I think that you know  
Youve been in love its time to move on  
Youve been in love and its starting to show  
To show show youve been in love oh oh  
  
Ive got blisters on my fingers
