We all have been selected from city and from farm  
They asked us lots of questions they jabbed us in the arm  
We stood there at attention our faces turning red  
The sergeant looked us over and this is what he said  
  
This is the Army Mister Jones  
No private rooms or telephones  
You had your breakfast in bed before  
  
But you wont have it there any more  
This is the Army Mister Green  
We like the barracks nice and clean  
You had a housemaid to clean your floor  
  
But she wont help you out any more  
Do what the buglers command  
Theyre in the Army and not in a band  
This is the Army Mister Brown  
  
You and your baby went to town  
She had you worried but this is war  
And she wont worry you anymore  
  
A bunch of frightened rookies were listning filled with awe  
They listened while a sergeant was laying down the law  
They stood there at attention their faces turning red  
The sergeant looked them over and this is what he said
