Chorus  
My heart is set on You  
Oh my heart is set on You  
No other love will do  
Oh my heart is set on You  
  
Im placing my life safely in Your keeping  
Knowing Your love is here to stay  
Im holding on to You no matter what Im feeling  
Ever always  
  
Chorus  
  
When Im alone I know Your there beside me  
Feeding me on for all days  
Wherever I go I know Your hand will guide me  
Ever always  
  
Nothing else will do Your love is better  
My hearts set on You forever and ever  
Nothing else will do cause Your love is better  
My hearts set on You forever and ever  
  
Chorus
