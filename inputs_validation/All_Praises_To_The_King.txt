What a joy I feel to think about forever  
Im a child of God with blessings from Heaven  
By Your side days always brighter  
The Holy one my Master my Father  
I will dwell in Your courts  
I will sing for You  
Youre my deepest love  
Jesus I love You  
Its a love song I sing  
Its an anthem from my heart  
All praises to the King  
From the depths of my soul  
I adore You my Savior  
All praises to the King  
I am not alone Jesus Youre near me  
Washed me clean with hands full of mercy  
Youre a resting place for all who are weary  
A perfect place and a new beginning

I will sing for You
