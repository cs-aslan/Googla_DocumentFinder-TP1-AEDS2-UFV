Drift off and dream in your paperdoll world  
Play with the presents from the boys and the girls  
You big day is over The cake is all gone  
We sang you to sleep with the birthday song  
  
Chorus  
No youll never be one again  
The twos are tumbling on in  
Daddys little girl is growing up in the world  
Youll never be one again  
  
The toy piano is quiet in the hall as Kermie the frog sits watching it all  
And soon your legs will and make the tricycle go and take you away from us
all  
  
Chorus  
  
Goodnight Baby Goodnight Daddy
