Pretty paper  
Pretty ribbons of blue  
  
Man oh man  
I just love Christmas its just so darn neat  
I kinda wish every day was Christmas  
Except Christmas eve and the Fourth of July  
We wouldnt want to miss out on the fireworks would we  
When I was a kid we used to get the Christmas catalog from Montgomery Wards
in Chicago  
Sometimes wed get it as early as late August  
It was the big book of wishes hopes and desires  
My three brothers and I were allotted twentyfive bucks a piece including
tax  
  
So Id make up a different Christmas list every night  
From the first of September til the twentyforth of December  
Matter of fact let me present you with my Christmas credentials  
When I was three years old at least thats what my mother told me  
I ate an entire ornament I ate a big red one I thought it was an apple  
They kinda freaked out and was gonna take me to the hospital  
But they couldnt stop me from laughing so they just left me alone  
So I guess I still got that Christmas in me all the time you know  
  
One year I got a wooden RolyPoly for Christmas  
You know the things you knock down and they bounce right back up  
They made em out of wood back then thats how old I am  
Nowadays they make em out of plastic  
My mom says They just dont make em like that anymore  
And I says No ma they dont  
  
Then there was the year I came home only eave from the army  
From Germany to marry my high school sweetheart on the day after Christmas  
My little brother Billy who was twelve at the time  
Had just gotten his first job so he was able to afford to buy some Christmas
presents  
For his brothers and his mom and dad out of his own pocket  
Billy had a job selling subscriptions for the Chicago Tribune  
He told me this guy named Rocky would pick him up in a station wagon  
Him and some other boys and hed take em out to some strange neighborhood  
And drop em off and he gave them this whole spiel to give their potential
customers  
Supposedly their little brother had won a free trip to our nations capital
Washington DC  
But he couldnt go on the trip if his older brother wouldnt accompany him  
So if you would please buy a subscription to the Chicago Tribune  
Then my little brother will be happy  
Wow what a shyster Some peoplell do anything to get to the Whitehouse  
  
Then there was the year that my mom and dad gave me my first guitar  
Ah man it was gorgeous I still got the thing  
It was a like aqua blue  
Kinda dark aqua blue with a cream colored heart  
Was a Silvertone from Montgomery Wards  
The model was called Kentucky Blue  
And man when I saw that sitting under the tree I just couldnt wait  
First year so I didnt know how to play it  
Id just stand in front of the mirror with a string  
Around my neck with that guitar and Id try to look like Elvis  
Then my brother Dave taught me a couple of chords  
Now Im here in your living room singing and talking to you  
Its funny how things work out  
  
Soa whynt you go find a stranger and extend your hand to em  
If you see somebody looks like  
They aint doin quite as well as you slip em a buck  
specially if they dont ask for spare change  
Go buy your honey a cuckoo clock or a musical snow shaking water ball  
That when you wind it up it plays  
I want you I need you I love ya with all my heart  
cause after all hell man its Christmas  
  
Away in a manger no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky look down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the 12 hay  
  
Merry Christmas Everybody
