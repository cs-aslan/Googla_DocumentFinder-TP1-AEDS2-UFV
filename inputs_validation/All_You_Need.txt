Headed out for Austin now were half way down the road  
Hollering buddabuddabuddabuddaby  
Steady staring out the window  
It fells good it fells nice it feels like you need it  
And back out on the road is where we like to be seated  
We got halfpint style we got a bboy style  
We got halfpint style we got a bboy style  
We got to put that shit together in a creative style  
We put that shit together in a creative style  
  
Outside on the pavement I wont feel afraid  
theres a little piece of paper saying how we walked that May  
Back out on the highway and this hurts to say  
No ones got fingers I got no one to blame  
  
I cant make you overstand rising up in a hiphop stance  
Societys got to me  
Thats all you need  
  
Headed out to Houston now where halfway out the door  
Hollering buddabuddabuddabuddaby  
Staring out the window  
It fells good it feels nice it feels like you need it  
I know how females like to be treated  
A license for me and the stars up above  
And on the interstate I fell love love love  
And If I never realize then thats how it has to be  
And all DJs out there got to give me money  
  
Back out on the freeway I wont fell sane  
Little yellow headlights look like snails smashed in the rain  
Back out on the highway and this hurts to say  
Blown out speakers I got no one to blame  
  
I cant make you overstand rising up in a hiphop stance  
Societys got to me  
Thats all you need Yea  
  
I can  but I wont see  
Because no one can tell you youve got to be afraid  
We got to go back on the highway live behind the wheel  
I want it real
