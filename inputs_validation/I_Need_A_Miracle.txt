I need a woman bout twice my age  
A lady of nobility gentility and rage  
Splendor in the dark lightning on the draw  
Well go right through the book and break each and every law  
  
I got a feeling and it wont go away oh no  
Just one thing then Ill be OK  
I need a miracle every day  
  
I need a woman bout twice my height  
Statuesque ravendressed a goddess of the night  
Her secret incantations a candle burning blue  
Well consult the spirits maybe theyll know what to do  
  
And its real and it wont go away oh no  
I cant get around and I cant run away  
I need a miracle every day  
  
I need a woman bout twice my weight  
A ton of fun who packs a gun with all her freight  
Find her in a sideshow leave her in la  
Ride her like a surfer running on a tidal wave  
  
And its real believe what I say yeah  
Just one thing I got to say  
I need a miracle every day  
  
It takes dynamite to get me up  
Too much of everything is just enough  
One more thing I just got to say  
I need a miracle every day  
I need a miracle every day  
I need a miracle every day got to be the only way  
I need a miracle
