Rockabye baby if you want to dance  
Grab yourself a body and take a chance  
They say one time around is all you get  
But Im still dancin so you lost your bet  
I got a hardcore mama with a hot hoochie coo  
Make my wheels start spinnin like a formula two  
I got one for the money  
Two for the show  
Three for my honey  
And four to let you know that I  
Let the music do the talking  
Let the music do the talking  
Let the music do the talking  
Let the music do the talking  
Cheesecake maybe if I take another bite  
Im a real fat city Im an aero delight  
Threw out my pipe and my alcoline  
Got a squeaky clean body and a dirty mind  
Im a real fine dancer Ill be cutting rug  
Got my brand new baby shes my brand new drug
