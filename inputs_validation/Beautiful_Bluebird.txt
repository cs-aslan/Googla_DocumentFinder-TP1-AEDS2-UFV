One mornin when I was ridin  
In my old pickup truck  
A beautiful bluebird came flyin down  
My eyes caught the color  
As it lead me down the road  
Dippin and bobbin in the sun  
Ive never seen that blue before  
Cept in one place  
And shes not here with me right now  
So I followed all the way  
To the top of the hill  
Thats where she kept on climbin lord  
Someday I will  
  
Chorus  
Beautiful bluebird  
See how she flies  
Looks like shes always goin home  
If heaven had a window  
Where the sun came shinin through  
Like a beautiful bluebird  
Id come flyin back to you  
  
Well it kind of struck me funny  
Sort of made me smile  
After all these years on this old road  
How God could show me somethin  
Never say a word  
Theres so much that I dont know  
Ive never seen that blue before  
Except in one place  
And shes not here with me right now  
I followed all the way to the top of the hill  
Thats where she kept on climbin lord  
And someday I will  
  
Chorus x2
