Well Im taking some time with my quiet friend  
Well Im takin some time on my own  
Well Im makin some plans for my getaway  
Therell be blue skies shining up above  
When Im cloud hidden  
Cloud hidden  
Whereabouts unknown  
  
Well Ive got to get out of the ratrace now  
Im tired of the ways of mice and men  
And the empires all turning into rust again  
Out of everything nothing remains the same  
Thats why Im cloud hidden  
Cloud hidden  
Whereabouts unknown  
  
Sittin up on the mountaintop in my solitude  
Where the morning fog comes rollin in  
Just might do me some good  
  
Well Im waiting in the clearing with my motor on  
Well its time to get back to the town again  
Where the air is sweet and fresh in the countryside  
Well it wont be long before I get back here again
