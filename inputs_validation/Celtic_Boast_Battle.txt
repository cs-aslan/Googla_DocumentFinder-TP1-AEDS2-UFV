Talking  
  
Yeah  
  
100 Roman soliders lay dead on the beach whod slayed them  
I am the greatest warrior who has ever lived Yeah  
Warriors I bring tidings of great victory surely there is know other  
Warrior in the land who can beat me Huh  
I am the most fearsome warrior to walk the land of the living  
So I think weve got a problem  
I think theres only one way to settle this  
  
Boast battle  
  
So lets clear the air grab a chair  
Ive got flair when I fight a bear  
I rip off its skin for my wife to wear  
I did it for a dare Im your worst nightmare   
Look close check out my facial hair  
  
Relax face facts a fight with you would be an anticlimax  
When you go to war you dont take off your slacks  
Look at me  Im tough I fight in the buff  
I could say more but Ive said enough so  
  
Boast Battle  
  
Have some grace shut your face  
  
Boast Battle  
  
Cause Braedon boy youre well off the pace  
  
Seems to me that youre not even skilled  
I can fill a lake with the blood Ive spilled  
I decorate my house with heads of men Ive killed  
Id stab you right now but Im trying to chill  
  
Yeah you got a brain but youve just got one  
Ive got five on my belt from the battles Ive won  
In a rage on a rampage Ive killed more men then old age so  
  
Boast Battle  
  
And Ive only just begun  
  
Boast Battle  
  
And Im not even done  
  
Youre just killing the enemy thats lazy  
I kill my own people Im that crazy  
I go berserk and my eyes go glazy  
I get so mad I could stab a daisy but I wont cause that would be stupid  
  
All right All right Stop  
Think a while Look at your style man thats vile  
You look like youve been dressed by a reptile  
Youre a steaming pile Im dressed like a king  
I wear a torc round my neck when Im doing my killing  
And on my finger Im wearing a ring  
When I said I fight nude I wasnt counting my bling Yo  
  
Boast Battle  
  
Oh And I paint myself blue  
  
Boast Battle  
  
That is way way cooler than you  
  
So much better than you that you ought to bow  
Ill offer to fight you but you wouldnt know how  
Enough with the talk yeah lets end this now  
I can sum it all up in just one word  
  
Owww Muuum
