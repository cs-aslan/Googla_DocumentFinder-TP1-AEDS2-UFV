Seven on a Monday morning  
And its a sunny day  
Its just too hot to be working  
But youve got to pay your way  
  
So here I am sitting at the bus stop  
Wishing I was somewhere else  
Where I didnt have to work my rocks off  
Wishing I could please myself  
  
Ten hours a day Im grafting  
Under the bosses eye  
Earn just enough to keep going  
Making cars Ill never buy  
  
So here I am sitting  
Five days a week Im giving  
My time is clocking on  
Just two days left for living  
Wondering where my life has gone  
  
So here I am sitting
