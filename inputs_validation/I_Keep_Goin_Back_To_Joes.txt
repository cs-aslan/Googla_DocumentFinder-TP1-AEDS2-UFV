I keep goin back to Joes  
To that table in the corner  
Sippin wine and staring at the door  
Our old waiter knows were through  
Still he sets a place for you  
Everything the way it was before  
I keep goin back to Joes  
But the man who plays piano  
Never plays your favorite melody  
Joe keeps busy at the bar  
Never asks me where you are  
He was there when you walked out on me  
Now I pray youll walk back in  
And youll say what fools weve been  
And well celebrate a happy new beginning  
Chances are youll never show  
But youll know just where to find me  
Every night until its time to close  
Just in case you miss me too  
Ill be there to welcome you  
Thats why I keep going back  
Thats why I keep goin back  
To Joes
