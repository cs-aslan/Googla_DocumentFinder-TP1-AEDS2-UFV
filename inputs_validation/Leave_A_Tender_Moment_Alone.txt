Even though Im in love  
Sometimes I get so afraid  
Ill say something so wrong  
Just to have something to say  
  
I know the moment isnt right  
To tell the girl a comical line  
To keep the conversation light  
I guess Im just frightened out of my mind  
  
But if thats how I feel  
Then its the best feeling Ive even known  
Its undeniably real  
Leave a tender moment alone  
  
Yes I know Im in love  
But just when I ought to relax  
I put my foot in my mouth  
Cause Im just avoiding the facts  
  
If the girl gets too close  
If I need some room to escape  
When the moment arose  
Id tell her its all a mistake  
  
But thats not how I feel  
No thats not the woman Ive known  
Shes undeniably real  
So leave a tender moment alone  
  
But its not only me  
Breaking down when the tension gets high  
Just when Im in a serious mood  
She is suddenly quiet and shy  
  
Leave a tender moment  
Leave it alone  
  
I know the moment isnt right  
To hold my emotions inside  
To change the attitude tonight  
Ive run out of places to hide  
  
And if thats how I feel  
Then its the best feeling Ive even known  
Its undeniably real  
Leave a tender moment alone  
  
You got to leave a tender moment alone  
Leave a tender moment  
Leave it alone  
Youve got to leave a tender moment  
Leave a tender moment alone
