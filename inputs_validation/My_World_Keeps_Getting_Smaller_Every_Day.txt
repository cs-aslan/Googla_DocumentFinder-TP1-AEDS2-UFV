Round and round I go in circles trying to be free  
Since you went away the world is closing in on me  
Every day I face tomorrow knowing youll be there  
I see your face in every little thing we used to share  
The memory of you is everywhere  
  
And my world keeps getting smaller every day  
I run but I cant run away  
Youre with me everywhere I go  
And I find youre in my heart and in my mind  
Theres no place left on earth to stay  
My world gets smaller every day  
  
In the lonely of the morning when Im waking up  
I find you standing at the bottom of my coffee cup  
I see you on the highway when Im driving in the car  
Downtown in the city I just turn and there you are  
I run from you but never get too far  
  
And my world keeps getting smaller every day  
I run but I cant run away  
Youre with me everywhere I go  
And I find youre in my heart and in my mind  
Theres no place left on earth to stay  
My world gets smaller every day  
  
And my world keeps getting smaller every day  
I run but I cant run away  
My world gets smaller every day
