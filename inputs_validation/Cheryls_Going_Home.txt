CherylS going home  
Writer Bob Lind  
  
The thunder cracks against the night the dark explodes with yellow light  
The railroad sign is flashing bright the people stare but I dont care  
My flesh is cold against my bones  
My Cheryls going home  
Come hear me shout against the rain is there a way to stop this train  
I got some reasons to explain  
About the way I was today  
The whistle moans and Im alone  
My Cheryls going home  
Santa Rose Specials down the line  
Im running desperately behind  
Theres only one thing on my mind  
The rain and tears are in my eyes  
The things I have to say wont be known  
My Cheryls going home
