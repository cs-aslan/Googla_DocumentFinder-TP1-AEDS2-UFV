Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum  
You came along and everything started to hum  
Still its a real good bet the best is yet to come  
  
The best is yet to come and babe wont it be fine  
You think youve seen the sun but you aint seen it shine  
  
Wait till the warmups underway  
Wait till our lips have met  
Wait till you see that sunshine day  
You aint seen nothin yet  
  
The best is yet to come and babe wont it be fine  
The best is yet to come come the day youre mine  
  
The best is yet to come  
Come the day youre mine  
Oh come the day youre mine  
Im gonna teach you to fly  
Weve only tasted the wine  
Were gonna drain that cup dry  
  
Wait till your charms are right for the arms to surround  
You think youve flown before but you aint left the ground  
  
Wait till youre locked in my embrace  
Wait till I hold you near  
Wait till you see that sunshine place  
There aint nothin like it here  
  
The best is yet to come and babe wont it be fine  
The best is yet to come come the day youre mine  
Come the day youre mine  
Ive got plans for you baby  
And baby youre gonna fly
