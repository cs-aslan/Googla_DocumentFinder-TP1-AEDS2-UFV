Think of me and miss me as Ill be missing you  
Promise to be true and Ill be true to you  
Dream of me and talk to me though were far apart  
I will hear you dear hear you in my heart  
When youre all alone and youre feelin blue  
Remember that Im here and Ill be lonely too  
And the sun will shine and our love will grow  
Oh time cannot erase a love like ours I know  
So think of me and miss me as Ill be missing you  
Promise to be true and Ill be true to you
