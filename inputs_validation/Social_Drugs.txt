These social drugs  
These social drugs  
These social drugs  
These social drugs  
  
Afraid to address  
The reality before me  
Too proud to confess  
That Im addicted to a lie  
So I seek temporary feeling  
To replace reality  
Though the truth is telling me I have to die  
But Ive been taught to numb it  
Sedate it dont confront it  
I hate it when I found out  
That I cant get what I wanted  
This emotional tantrum  
Has become sort of an anthem playing everytime I need to take a little trip  
  
To hide this condemnation  
Ill find a combination  
Of a manmande stimulation  
To deny my situation  
Now this unreality  
Is distorting what I see  
Reporting back to me  
A sense of false security  
  
So in my imagination  
I must find a recreation  
Desperately in searching ways  
To alter my sensations  
Theres no equilibrium  
Inebriated till Im numb  
Intoxicated till Im dumb  
To avoid confrontation  
  
These social drugs  
Messing with my mind  
These social drugs  
Telling me Im fine  
  
Now this chemical analogy  
Is our emotional reality  
These political  
Traditional  
And ethical stimulants  
And social ettiquettes  
Wont let us be too upset  
With the way things really are  
Youre taught to camouflage regrets  
And those religious structures  
Tell us god want us to suffer  
To suppot a situation  
We all know is obligation  
And if you shun the complication  
Theyll just gun your repuation  
Like mob intimidation  
To enforce participation  
  
See they need to keep us fiends  
To their lies and broken schemes  
And if you find another means  
Youre told youre being too extreme  
And if you wanted to get clean  
Theyll just pull those social strings  
Holding up their social norms  
Deifying noble things  
  
Now were all stuck in tradition  
Unable to state our position  
Too afraid to contradict  
The expectations of the system  
Oh and the harsh reality  
Is theyve made Grace for you and me  
Instead of saving you and me  
Theyre just enslaving you and me  
  
These social drugs  
These social drugs  
These social drugs  
These social drugs  
  
Know what I mean
