Im losing ground  
You know how this world can beat you down  
Im made of clay  
I fear Im the only one who thinks this way  
Im always falling down the same hill  
Bamboo puncturing this skin  
And nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall Im  
Drowning in  
Two feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face  
And if I could just reach you maybe I could leave this place  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
Dont you tell me how I feel  
Dont you tell me how I feel  
Dont you tell me how I feel  
You dont know just how I feel  
I stay inside my bed  
I have lived so many lives all in my head  
Dont tell me that you care  
There really isnt anything is there  
You would know wouldnt you  
You extend your hand to those who suffer  
To those who know what it really feels like  
To those whove had a taste  
Like that means something  
And oh so sick I am  
And maybe I dont have a choice  
And maybe that is all I have  
And maybe this is a cry for help  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
Dont you tell me how I feel  
Dont you tell me how I feel  
Dont you tell me how I feel  
You dont know just how I feel  
I want to know everything  
I want to be everywhere  
I want to fuck everyone in the world  
I want to do something that matters
