Im looking for a better world  
Where theres no more hurt  
Where theres only hope  
For the eagle and the dove  
I can see your face  
Nothing can take your place  
If we sail away on a river of endless love  
Im living in the hands of time  
On the wings of love  
On the edge of night  
Where theres darkness everywhere  
I wont be denied  
Im never going to leave your side  
I will always be  
On the river of endless love  
  
In the silence just before the dawn  
The shadows lose their form  
We rise to greet the morning  
In the calm that comes before the storm  
A troubled and a restless heart is born  
The river of endless love  
  
Im tearing down the walls of hate  
Gonna start again gonna turn it round  
Gonna build it with a prayer  
I can always dream  
And nothing is what it seems  
If you lose your way  
You can always find us there  
  
In the silence just before the dawn  
The shadows lose their form  
We rise to greet the morning  
In the calm that comes before the storm  
A troubled and a restless heart is born  
The river of endless love
