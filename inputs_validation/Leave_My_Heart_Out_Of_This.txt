I know the damage that hes done  
And I know the damage that hell do  
I know when you knock on my door  
Ill always open it to you  
  
There is a time there is a place  
But its not here and nows not safe  
So dont take more than I can give  
And leave my heart out of this  
  
CHORUS  
You leave my heart out of this  
Youre too much to resist  
I dont have the strength to pull away  
No is getting hard for me to say  
Id love to be the way your heartache ends  
But till it does we cant be more than friends  
Im only trying to do whats best  
Its gonna hurt you more unless  
You leave my heart out of this  
  
I know confused is how you feel  
Afraid to make it on your own  
I know the way your hurt to heal  
And I know the empty of alone  
So take my shoulder take my hand  
Take what you need Ill understand  
Just dont take more than I can give  
And leave my heart out of this  
  
repeat CHORUS
