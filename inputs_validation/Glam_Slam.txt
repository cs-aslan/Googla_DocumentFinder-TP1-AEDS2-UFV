This thing we got  its alive  
It seems to transcend the physical  
One touch and Im satisfied  
Must be a dream its so magical  
  
Chorus  
Glam Slam thank you maam  
You really make my day  
Glam Slam thank you maam  
I pray you always stay  
  
I know I hold you to tight  
But I just cant seem to get close enough I want to hold you  
I want to hold you every night  
Im so horny and youre the star  
  
Chorus  
  
Heavy feather flicka nipple  
Baby scam water ripple  
I dont understand  
It means I love you  
Come a butterfly straight on your skin  
You go for me and I come again  
Glam Slam thank you maam  
Sun is risen moon is gone  
Soda fizzin on the lawn  
Come a butterfly straight on your skin  
Glam Slam  
  
Glam Slam thank you maam  
You really make my day  
  
This thing we got  its alive  
It seems to transcend the physical  
One touch and Im satisfied ooh baby  
Must be a dream its so magical  
  
Chorus  
  
Glam Slam  
You will always stay  
You will always stay  
  
Its all right its OK
