Ima pimp  
You can check my stats  
And rollin a Fleetwood  thats how I mack  
I rock all the tracks  
  
So the world knows  
I love all the girls  
Smack all the hoes  
Show love to those who come real with it  
  
Lifes a bitch but I deal with it  
Im in it to win it like Yzerman  
Could drink about 15 Heinikeins  
Im not born again  
  
But if I was Id ask to come back with a little more love  
Well Im puffin a Winston  
Drinkin a fouro  
Kid rock and Ima let you know  
  
Chorus  
Ive been sitting here just wasting time  
Drinking smoking thinking trying to free my mind  
  
Its been a couple of months in this smokey room  
Eaten shrooms drinking Boones writing tunes  
And hoping to get one of these mother fuckin songs to hit  
  
A little bit of love thats all I need  
A little inspiration and a bag of weed  
A seed to plant so my tree can grow  
You know I left my girl cause I need that hooooold up  
  
Wait a minute Im about to flow  
Like a breeze through the trees you can watch me blow  
Puffing a Winston drinking a fouro  
Kid Rock and Im gonna let you know  
  
Chorus  
  
I aint no rough guy  
Aint no tough guy  
Dont get out much and dont dress up fly  
Born in the game thats all I am  
  
Giving all my duckets to Uncle Sam  
Fuck it  
Im free to do what I please little lady  
I was born at night but not last night baby  
  
Ive been around  seen some things  
I slept in dumpsters  got high with kings  
I dont bring much  aint gotta lot to say  
But I got more time than Morris day  
  
Puffing a Winston drinking a fouro  
Kid Rock and Im a let you know  
  
Chorus
