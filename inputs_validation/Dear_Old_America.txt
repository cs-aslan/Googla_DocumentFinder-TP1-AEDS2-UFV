Standing in line on the depot floor  
Taking my time getting through the door  
Daddy said Go and mama just cried  
Sister said Devils on the other side  
Hurricane blowing water gets high  
Cant turn around or Ill drown in lies  
  
When I get back Im gonna own this town  
Shine that medal and wear that crown  
Fall on my knees and kiss the ground  
Dear old America  
  
Run run rabbit save your rabbit skin  
Jump right back in your hole again  
Bullets they cry whispering drone  
Fire in the sky Gods on the phone  
  
When I get home Im gonna shove my doubts  
Dream my dreams and shut my mouth  
Nobody knows what this is all about  
Dear old America  
  
We dont beg and we dont run  
We dont lose we dont overcome  
Purple mountain majesty sliding to a broken sea  
Daddy he swear and mama she cry  
My sweet baby shes bound to die  
  
When I get back Im gonna feel just fine  
One more day Im gonna do my time  
Aint no hammer gonna ring like mine  
  
When I get home Im gonna shove my doubts  
Dream my dreams and shut my mouth  
No one knows what this is all about now  
  
When I get home Im gonna shove my doubts  
Dream my dreams and shut my mouth  
No one knows what this is all about  
  
Dear old America
