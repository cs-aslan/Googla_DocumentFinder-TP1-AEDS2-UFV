You say you love me  
Then you treat me like a stranger  
I dont understand your kind of love  
You say you need me  
And that makes it even stranger  
No I dont understand your kind of love  
  
If you cant be all mine  
Then why am I all yours  
I wonder where a heart draws the line  
I try not to see you  
But youre a great arranger  
No I dont understand your kind of love  
  
Repeat last verse  
  
No I dont understand your kind of love
