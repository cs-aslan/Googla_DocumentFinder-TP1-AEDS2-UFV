Theres a woman and she thinks I can do no wrong  
Shes been waiting for me all night long  
Still she forgives me when I drag it home  
And tells me I belong  
For her this early morning song  
  
Its for Harrywhy and the times that have goone before  
Were still laughin but I I aint that much fun no more  
Still he forgives me in the mornin light  
For keepin him up to long  
For him this early morning song  
  
Its for all you cowboys ridin home alone  
Its for all you lovers Tryin to love a telephone  
Its for the children And the hawk in the mornin haze  
For the people that I I dont see too much these days  
  
Will you forgive me when we meet again  
For stayin away so long  
Ive just been out there in the dawn  
Singin my early mornin song  
  
So please forgive me when we meet again  
For stayin away so long  
Ive just been out there in the dawn  
Singin my early mornin song
