I am over here  
Looking at you  
You are over there  
Watching me too  
Both painting pictures of how well kiss and hug  
  
So what we gon do  
So what you gon do what you gon do  
Tell me why were standing here  
Moments splashing here and there  
You got my mind blown  
And baby Im ready to go  
  
But uh  
If its worth your while  
Say something say something  
If its worth your while  
Say something good to me  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
If its worth your while  
Do something good to me  
  
Lets make it  
Hot as you can stand it  
Something like volcanic  
You and me seems organic  
Just like the stars in the planet  
Yeah we are  
So what you gon do  
So what you gon do what you gon do  
  
Tell me why were still in here  
There is nothing for us to hear  
I could tell with my eyes closed  
Now baby Im ready to go

Everytime I fall through  
Want me to speak on the word or two  
Its the DOdoubleG  
And I do it so lovingly  
Digging the track to the Neptune  
Spending your time in the westgrove  
Now get bug wide  
Shhh dont make a sound  
Ill take you lay you down  
Make your body go round and round  
Do you want to  
Wont say you want I know you do  
Most girls play shy

Dig my span  
Big bad wide
