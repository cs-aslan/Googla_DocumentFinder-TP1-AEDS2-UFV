Well you been cheatin on me big day you know I know its true  
But there aint nobody in the whole wide world could love you like I do  
Dont be no fool dont you be no fool dont be no fool dont you be no

You gonna keep on foolin around now baby you gonna mess up a good thing  
You gonna mess up a good thing  
  
Now I might have been cheated just a little bit baby like all the others do  
Oh but when I get my paycheck mama I bring it on home to you

And thered gonna be but a little while baby before you cut me down

Cause you know everybodys jealous baby we got a thing goin on  
Dont you be no fool  
Good thing good thing good thing good thing
