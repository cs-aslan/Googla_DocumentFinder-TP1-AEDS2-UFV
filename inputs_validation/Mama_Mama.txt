I can feel the magic  
Suddenly its all around  
I can see it clearly  
I can even hear the sound  
  
Its all so new to me  
Im not the same  
If this is love  
Then youre to blame  
  
Mama mama when you look at me  
I see love in your eyes  
Mama mama softly sweet tender love in your eyes  
  
You are all I live for  
Maybe thats enough to say  
And youre the one I wrote this song for  
Everywhere and everyway  
  
Its all so new to me  
Im not the same  
Its words I feel  
But cant explain  
  
Mama mama when you look at me  
I see love in your eyes  
Mama mama softly sweet tender love in your eyes  
  
Mama mama mama mama  
I really love you  
I really need you  
Mama mama mama mama  
I really need you mama  
I really love you mama
