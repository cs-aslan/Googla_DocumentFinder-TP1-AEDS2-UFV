When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed  
  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed  
  
You have your eye on Jimmy  
Long Jimmy Lee  
You have your eye on Jimmy  
And a fine man he  
  
You have your eye on Jimmy  
But youd better let him be  
Because when you go MollyO  
Youll be gone with me  
  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed  
  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed  
  
You have your eye on Johnny  
Thin Johnny Fee  
You have your eye on Johnny  
And a fine man he  
  
You have your eye on Johnny  
But youd better let him be  
Cause when you go MollyO  
Youll be gone with me  
  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed  
  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed  
  
I made a black bow for your pretty head  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
Made a black bow for your bonny head  
  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed  
  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed
