Well just got back  
Been gone too long  
Wasnt my idea didnt pull the trigger  
Oh oh oh I I I Im just so glad  
Im just so glad to be back home yeah  
  
I just got back  
Been a long long time  
Wasnt my idea didnt point the finger  
Oh oh oh I I I Im just so glad  
Im just so glad to go home  
  
You run the risk of falling  
With some solitary Sam  
Ive sailed the seven sins a polyfuture plan  
  
A Paul calypso  
Isnt really what it seems  
This aint committee art  
My god is it a dream  
  
I just got back  
I been asleep too long  
Wasnt my idea what the doctor figured  
Oh oh oh I I I Im just so glad  
Im just so glad Im just so glad Im just so glad  
To be back home  
No no no no no no no no  
Im just so glad  
No no no no no no no no  
Im just so glad
