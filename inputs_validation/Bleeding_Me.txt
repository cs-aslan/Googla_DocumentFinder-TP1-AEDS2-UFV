Im digging my way  
Im digging my way to something  
Im digging my way to something better  
  
Im pushing to stay  
Im pushing to stay with something  
Im pushing to stay with something better  
  
Im sowing the seeds  
Im sowing the seeds Ive taken  
Im sowing the seeds I take for granted  
  
This thorn in my side  
This thorn in my side is from the tree  
This thorn in my side is from the tree Ive planted  
  
It tears me and I bleed  
And I bleed  
  
Caught under wheels roll  
I take the leech Im bleeding me  
Cant stop to save my soul  
I take the leash thats leading me  
Im bleeding me  
I cant take it  
Caught under wheels roll  
The bleeding of me  
Of me  
The bleeding of me  
  
I am the beast that feeds the feast  
I am the blood I am release  
  
Come make me pure  
Bleed me a cure  
Im caught Im caught Im caught under  
  
Caught under wheels roll  
I take that leech Im bleeding me  
Cant stop to save my soul  
I take the leash thats leading me  
Im bleeding me  
I cant take it  
I cant take it  
I cant take it  
The bleeding of me  
  
Im digging my way  
Im digging my way to something  
Im digging my way to something better  
  
Im pushing to stay  
Im pushing to stay with something  
Im pushing to stay with something better  
With something better
