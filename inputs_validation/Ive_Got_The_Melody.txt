Youve got the music in your heart  
I know just how to make it start  
You know the song that makes me sing  
You know the tune so play my strings  
  
cause Ive got the melody deep in my heart  
I could sing it alone but Id rather not  
Youve got the harmony deep in your soul  
If we sing it together our love will hold  
  
It sounds just like a symphony  
Something composed by you and me  
I hear the music that we make  
The sound of love is what it takes  
  
To coax out a melody straight from our hearts  
Let us sing it together dont ever stop  
Lets add the harmony straight from our souls  
cause if we sing together now  
We sing together now  
We sing we sing
