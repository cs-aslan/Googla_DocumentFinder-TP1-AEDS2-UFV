You left your opening open wide  
And you let everyone come inside  
Theres always something youve got to hide  
So you lied and you lied and you lied  
Make sure you grab everything that you need  
Youve got a hole that youve got to feed  
You try to fill it all up with your greed  
But it bleeds and it bleeds and it bleeds  
Got take a little more  
Well scrape you off the floor  
We love you anyhow  
But youre not so pretty now  
A great big superstar  
Is what you think you are  
We love you anyhow  
But youre not so pretty now  
Nobody burns quite as bright  
Well goddamn maybe youre right  
Theres always battles there for you to fight  
And you might you might you just might  
But there is something I gotta say  
There is a price you know you pay  
Try as hard as you can to stay  
Hes just fading and fading and fading the fuck away  
Go take a little more  
Well scrape you off the floor  
We love you anyhow  
But youre not so pretty now  
A great big superstar  
Is what you think you are  
We love you anyhow  
But youre not so pretty now  
Better turn the lights down low  
The cracks begin to show  
We love you anyhow  
But youre not so pretty now  
And soon you will be gone  
And we will all have one  
You never mattered anyhow  
And youre not so pretty now
