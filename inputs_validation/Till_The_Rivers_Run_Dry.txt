You ask how long Ill love you  
Its hard to explain but Ill try  
Tell me how long has the sun been shining  
Above us in the sky  
  
Till the last day of forever  
If I have it my way well stay together  
Till the rivers run dry Ill be loving you  
Till the mountains have crumbled  
Ill always be true  
And if for some reason you say goodbye  
Ask me how long I would cry  
Till all the rivers run dry  
  
This path that were walking  
May be rough and rocky sometimes  
But well believe in one another  
Whatever we find  
  
And when you need a hand to guide you  
I will be there walking beside you  
Till the rivers run dry
