Ive been walking in the same way as I did  
Missing out the cracks in the pavement  
And turning my heel and strutting my feet  
Is there anything I can do for you dear  
Is there anyone I could call  
No and thank you please Madam  
I aint lost just wandering  
  
Round my hometown  
Memories are fresh  
Round my hometown  
Ooh the people Ive met  
Are the wonders of my world  
Are the wonders of my world  
Are the wonders of this world  
Are the wonders of now  
  
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque  
I love to see everybody in short skirts shorts and shades  
I like it in the city when two worlds collide  
You get the people and the government  
Everybody taking different sides  
  
Shows that we aint gonna stand shit  
Shows that we are united  
Shows that we aint gonna take it  
Shows that we aint gonna stand shit  
Shows that we are united  
  
Round my hometown  
Memories are fresh  
Round my hometown  
Ooh the people Ive met yea  
  
Are the wonders of my world  
Are the wonders of my world  
Are the wonders of this world  
Are the wonders of my world  
Of my world yeah  
Of my world  
Of my world yeah
