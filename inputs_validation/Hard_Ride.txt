Living a life without you  
Living a life without you  
Im gonna lie for it living a life of it  
Staying alive without you  
Im living a life for a woman  
Im stringing a line with it now that shes gone with it  
Living a life without you  
Living a life without you  
Hey Joe you know what I mean  
Its never been done before  
A hard ride was never my scene  
But now Im coming back for more  
  
Living a life of it  
Living a life of it  
  
And its a hard ride down a rocky road  
Its a hard hard ride all on your own  
Its a hold on with all youve got  
Oh its a hard  
Oh its a hard ride down a rocky road  
  
Living a life without you  
Living a life without you  
Its running away with me look at the change in me  
Sleeping alone without you  
When I get up in the morning  
Its no good believing what Ive been dreaming  
Living a life without you  
Living a life without you  
All right its over and done  
Shes never coming back to me  
A hard ride is what Ive become  
From now until my dying day  
  
Living a life of it  
Living a life of it  
  
And its a hard ride down a rocky road  
Its a hard hard ride all on your own  
Its a hold on with all you got  
Oh Its a hard  
Oh its a hard ride down a rocky road  
  
Hard ride hard ride hard ride hard ride  
Hard ride hard ride hard ride  
  
I got a hard ride aint nothing new  
With a rocking roll rollin without you  
Its a long time since youve been gone  
And its a hard ride down a rocky road  
  
Oh its a hard ride down a rocky road  
Its a hard hard ride all on your own  
Its a hold on while youve got to  
Its a hard ride  
  
Yeah its a hard hard hard hard hard ride  
Oh its a hard hard hard hard hard ride  
Yeah its a hard hard hard hard hard ride  
Oh its a hard  
Oh its a hard ride down a rocky road  
Its a hard ride  
  
Living a life away living a life away  
Living a life away living a life away
