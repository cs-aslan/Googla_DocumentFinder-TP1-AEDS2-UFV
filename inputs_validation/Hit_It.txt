You tell me you dont like the taste  
Drugs and alcohol are such a waste  
You got better things to do  
Like hang around be straight and screw  
enjoy your day what to say  
Hell of a friend why do they know  
You dont know any compassion  
You dont like the drink  
You tell me Ive ruined my life  
Well I dont care what you think  
Why do you say were mad as hell  
Why do you say were mad as hell  
Ive got my own set of values  
Why dont you go enjoy yourself
