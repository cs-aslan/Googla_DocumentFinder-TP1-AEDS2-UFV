Poor puppy you look so sad I guess you think that no one ever felt so bad
before  
Everybody has the blues everybody has the blues  
Everybody knows the way that you feel today  
  
Everybody gets to sit and cry everybody gets to wonder why  
Everybody gets to watch the sky turn grey  
  
Maybe you lost your job maybe you lost your girl  
Maybe you feel like youre losing your mind thats not the end of the world  
  
Everybody gets to feel some pain everyone got to get to caught out in the
rain  
Everybody got some days that they cant explain  
  
Everybody got the blues everybody has the blues  
Everybody knows the way that you feel today
