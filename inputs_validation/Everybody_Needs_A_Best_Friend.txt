My words are lazy  
My thoughts are hazy  
But this is one thing Im sure of  
Everybody needs a best friend  
Im happy Im yours  
  
You got a double  
Who brings you trouble  
And though youre better without me  
Everybody needs a best friend  
Im happy Im yours  
  
A fool could see decidedly  
That youre a ten and Im a three  
A royal brie is what you need  
So how did you come to be stuck with a bummer like me  
  
Oh you got a Full of dreadful  
And yet lest that someone adores you  
Everybody needs a best friend  
Im happy Im yours  
  
A fool could see decidedly  
That youre a ten and Im a three  
A royal brie is what you need  
So how did you come to be stuck with a bummer like me
