Look at me  
I never thought that I would change  
Is destiny the one to blame  
for bringing me to you  
  
I cant turn back  
These feelings cant be sacrificed  
when were so close to paradise  
Its made for me and you  
  
Nothing else but love  
could ever mean as much to me  
And every time youre next to me  
And how I realise  
that nothing else but love  
could touched my heart the way you do  
I know that I would be a fool if I did not believe  
  
in nothing else but love  
  
I never knew Id a prisoner to a strangers kiss  
but you got something that I cant resist  
And I got to be with you  
  
chorus  
  
This moment will shine on forever  
It will live beyond a shadow of a doubt  
This love was blessed by a southern sky  
Now it can never say die  
  
chorus  
  
in nothing else but love
