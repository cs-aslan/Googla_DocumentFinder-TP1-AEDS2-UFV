I took their smiles and I made them mine  
I I sold my soul just to hide the light  
And now I see what I really am  
A thief a whore and a liar  
I run to you  
Call out your name  
I see you there father away  
  
Im numb to you numb and deaf and blind  
You give me all but the reason why  
I reach but I feel only air at night  
Not you not love just nothing  
I run to you  
Call out your name  
I see you there father away  
  
Try to forget you  
But without you I feel nothing  
Dont leave me here by myself  
I cant breathe  
I run to you  
Call out your name  
I see you there father away  
  
I run to you  
Call out your name  
I see you there father away  
Farther away  
Father away  
Father away  
Father away  
Father away
