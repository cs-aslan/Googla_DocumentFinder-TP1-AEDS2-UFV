Hey maybe Ill dye my hair  
Maybe Ill move somewhere  
Maybe Ill get a car  
Maybe Ill drive so far  
Theyll all lose track  
Me Ill bounce right back  
  
Maybe Ill sleep real late  
Maybe Ill lose some weight  
Maybe Ill clear my junk  
Maybe Ill just get drunk on apple wine  
Me Ill be just  
  
Fine and dandy  
Lord its like a hard candy Christmas  
Im barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I wont let sorrow bring me way down  
  
Ill be fine and dandy  
Lord its like a hard candy Christmas  
Im barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I wont let sorrow get me way down  
  
Hey maybe Ill learn to sew  
Maybe Ill just lie low  
Maybe Ill hit the bars  
Maybe Ill count the stars until dawn  
Me I will go on  
  
Maybe Ill settle down  
Maybe Ill just leave town  
Maybe Ill have some fun  
Maybe Ill meet someone  
And make him mine  
Me Ill be just  
  
Fine and dandy  
Lord its like a hard candy Christmas  
Im barely getting throng tomorrow  
But still I wont let sorrow bring me way down  
  
Ill be fine and dandy  
Lord its like a hard candy Christmas  
Im barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I wont let sorrow bring me way down  
  
Ill be fine and dandy  
Lord its like a hard candy Christmas  
Im barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I wont let sorrow bring me way down  
  
Cause Ill be fine  
Ill be fine  
Oh Ill be fine
