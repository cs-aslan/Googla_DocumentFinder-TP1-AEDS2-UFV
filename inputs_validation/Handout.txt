Whats it going to take to be done  
Whats it going to be right or wrong  
I dont have the strength left to fight  
I dont have to make up my mind  
  
I know youre never wrong  
No matter what it takes  
I know youre not the one  
But we all make mistakes  
Help me out  
  
I dont want your handout  
I dont need your way out  
  
So whats it going to be  
Ive done everything  
Why wont you believe  
Youre the same as me
