Aw whos the queen of the locker room  
Whos the cream of the crop  
Poor Joey took her to the matinee  
Said God she wouldnt stop  
  
Holy muscle of love  
My hearts a muscle  
  
Well I must have come to that crazy age  
Where evrything is hot  
Cause I dont know if the things Im thinking  
Are normal thoughts or not  
  
Holy muscle of love  
Well I got a muscle of love  
Yeah  
Ooh  
  
I read Dads books like I did before  
Now things are crystal clear  
Lock the door in the bathroom now  
I just cant get caught in here  
  
Holy muscle of love  
Well I got a muscle of love  
Holy muscle of love  
I got a muscle of love  
Holy muscle of love  
My hearts a muscle of love  
Holy muscle of love  
Well I got a muscle of love  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Must be a gift from above  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Hallelujah etc
