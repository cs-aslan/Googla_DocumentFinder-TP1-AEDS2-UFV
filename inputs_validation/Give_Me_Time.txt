Back off baby  
Dont lean too hard  
Ill come round when Im ready  
I aint finished my playing round  
Dont want to go steady  
You gotta give me time  
Give me time give me time  
You gotta give me time  
Give me time give me time  
The feeling in me aint the same as yours  
Im still firstclass flying  
Youve gotta wait till I reach the ground  
No need to be lying  
chorus  
to think it over  
Dont try so hard  
Dont spoil your chance  
Dont try so hard  
Dont spoil your chance  
verse 1  
chorus  
To think it over  
Give me time  
Give me time give me time  
You gotta give time  
Give me time give me time  
repeat
