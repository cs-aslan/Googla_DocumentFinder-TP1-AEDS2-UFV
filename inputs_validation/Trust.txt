Lost in a dream  
Nothing is what it seems  
Searching my head  
For the words that you said  
Tears filled my eyes  
As we said our last goodbyes  
This sad scene replays  
Of you walking away  
My body aches from mistakes  
Betrayed by lust  
We lied to each other so much  
That in nothing we trust  
Time and again  
She repeats lets be friends  
I smile and say yes  
Another truth bends  
I must confess  
I try to let go but I know  
Well never end til were dust  
We lied to each other again  
But I wish I could trust  
My body aches of mistakes  
Betrayed by lust  
We lied to each other so much  
That in nothing we trust  
God help me please on my knees  
Betrayed by lust  
We lied to each other so much  
That in nothing we trust  
How could this be happening to me  
Im lying when I say Trust me  
I cant believe this is true  
Trust hurts  
Why does trust equal suffering  
Absolutely nothing we trust
