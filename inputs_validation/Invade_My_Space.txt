This cannot continue  
We must go our separate ways  
Without you I can do better  
But first these words I have to say  
Its not that I dont hear you  
When you scream and curse my name  
Its just that I dont feel you  
Nigga you invade my space  
Yeah blacked out tatted up lets go saddle up  
Im algeballin dumb niggaz cant add it up  
Cock back back em up fuck what you throwin up  
All these rappers comin out aint nobody showin up  
Man where your talent at Show me where your balance at  
You the king of the streets Well I aint heard none of that  
Just like the South say watch what your mouth say  
Frank Sinatra hustle Rat Pack Did it My Way  
I know we dont see eye to eye you aint never lied  
We should part ways fore somebody catch a homicide  
Recognize lost a lotta love when my momma died  
Did a gang of shit Im surprised that Im still alive  
Fishburns yellin wake up open up my eyes  
Dont believe them lies from them guys that you idolize  
Ridicule try to downplay try to minimize  
And criticize when you on your grind so I realized  
This cannot continue  
We must go our separate ways  
Without you Ill do better  
But first these words I have to say  
Its not that I dont hear you  
When you scream and curse my name  
Its just that I dont feel you  
Nigga you invade my space  
Go ahead spit it out thats right get it out  
So I can respond nigga fuck what you talk about  
Drop like a guillotine money over everythin  
Seems to be the theme in the land of the Philistine  
Mentally you still shackled up on some lame shit  
Side by side on the bottom of a slave ship  
Came a long way from the place that I started from  
Ever seen a mans last breath beaten out of him  
Hate manifest from the inside out  
The shit starts in your heart then spill out your mouth  
Im the odd man out watch it all pan out  
I see you tryin to stand up but you dont stand out  
Now that I found that my path is original  
Prepared never scared had to peak at my pinnacle  
Im not like you but you think we identical  
Its pitiful you can never bang with the criminal  
This cannot continue  
We must go our separate ways  
Without you Ill do better  
But first these words I have to say  
Its not that I dont hear you  
When you scream and curse my name  
Its just that I dont feel you  
Nigga you invade my space  
Three wheels lock it up ammo stock it up  
Its not for niggaz cause George Bush comin after us  
Thats why its time to roll get where I gotta go  
All my people fightin for they soul you are not alone  
Never waste my pearls on the swine and the ignorant  
Forever on my grind you despise and belittle it  
Heres a little tidbit X rock that real shit  
Dump like a LAPD cop overkill shit  
Hooked on a brand new high called monopolize  
Put you on track where you just you was out of line  
And I aint got the time to fuck around with the dumb shit  
You know that young shit the Hey nigga where you from shit  
Even though the pistol in my hand Im a businessman  
People grow apart dont expect you to understand  
Lets part ways and then pray for better days  
I realize somebody bout to die so I came to say  
This cannot continue  
We must go our separate ways  
Without you Ill do better  
But first these words I have to say  
Its not that I dont hear you  
When you scream and curse my name  
Its just that I dont feel you  
Nigga you invade my space
