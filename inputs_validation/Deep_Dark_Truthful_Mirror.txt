One day youre going to have to face  
A deep dark truthful mirror  
And its going to tell you things that I still love you too much to say  
The sky was just a purple bruise the ground was iron  
And you fell all around the town until you looked the same  
  
Chorus  
The same eyes the same lips the same lie from  
Your tongue trips  
Deep dark deep dark truthful mirror  
Deep dark deep dark truthful mirror  
  
Now the flagstone streets where the newspaper shouts ring to the boots of
roustabouts  
But youre never in any doubt theres something happening somewhere  
  
You chase down the road til your fingers bleed  
On a fiberglass tumbleweed  
  
You can blow around the town but it all shuts down the same  
  
Chorus  
  
So you bay for the boy in the tigerskin trunks  
They set him up set him up on the stool  
He falls down falls down like a drunk  
And you drink til you drool  
And its his story youll flatter  
Youll stretch him out like a saint  
But the canvas that he splattered will be the  
Picture that you never paint  
  
Chorus  
  
A stripping puppet on a liquid stick gets into it pretty thick  
A butterfly drinks a turtles tears but how do you know he really needs it  
  
As a butterfly feeds on a dead monkeys hand  
Jesus wept he felt abandoned  
Youre spellbound baby theres no doubting that  
Did you ever see a stare like a Persian cat  
  
Chorus
