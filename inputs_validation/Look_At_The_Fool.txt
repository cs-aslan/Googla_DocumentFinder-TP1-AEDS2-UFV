Each and every day every little way  
Ive been a lovin you  
I cant live without lovin at night  
Makes it hard to say its wrong  
When I know its right  
Even though the years wont be kind  
I love you more than I care about myself  
I love ya hate ya for what youre doin to my health  
I love ya hate ya for all the love ya make me feel  
I love ya darlin cause ya know I cant leave  
But when youre gone  
Im little boy lost in the storm with the wolves  
Flames all around I talk to myself and pray to the rain  
That this lonely curse wont drive me insane  
I run into the sea  
But the sea only sighs  
  
Look at the fool that love brings me
