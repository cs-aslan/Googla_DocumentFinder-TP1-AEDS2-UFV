The song of a little bird  
The joy in three little words  
I know its real  
Thats how it feels  
To be loved by you  
The stars from a midnight sky  
The melody from a lullaby  
Theres nothing real  
That I wouldnt steal  
To be loved by you  
  
Chorus  
To be loved by you  
If everybody knows  
Its only cause it shows  
  
A smile to put you on a high  
A kiss that sets your soul alight  
Would it be all right if I spent tonight  
Being loved by you  
  
Chorus  
  
Your love is released  
And you move me with ease  
And you rescue me time after time  
Oh oh you give your all  
And you take it all in your stride  
  
Oh with all the power of a symphony  
Thats how my heart beats when youre holding me  
I cant conceal this is how it feels  
To be loved by you  
Oh yeah to be loved by you  
If everybody knows its only cause it shows  
Because I take your love Everywhere I go  
  
I know what it is I need its clear as a shallow stream  
Its as it seems my only dreams  
To be loved by you
