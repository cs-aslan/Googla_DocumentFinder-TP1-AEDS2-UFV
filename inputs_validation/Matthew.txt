Had an uncle named Matthew  
He was his fathers only boy  
Born just South of Cobly Kansas  
He was his mothers pride and joy  
  
Chorus  
Yes and joy was just the thing that he was raised on  
Love is just the way to live and die  
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield  
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky  
  
And all the stories that he told me  
Back when I was just a lad  
All the memories that he gave me  
All the good times that he had  
  
Growin up a Kansas farmboy  
Life was mostly havin fun  
Ridin on his Daddys shoulders  
Behind a view beneath the sun  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I guess there were some hard times  
And Im told some years were lean  
They had a storm in fortyseven  
A twister came and stripped them clean  
  
He lost the farm and lost his family  
He lost the wheat and lost his home  
But he found a family Bible  
Faith as solid as a stone  
  
Chorus  
  
So he came to live at our house  
And he came to work the land  
He came to ease my Daddys burden  
And he came to be my friend  
  
So I wrote this down for Matthew  
And its for him the song is sung  
Ridin on his Daddys shoulders  
Behind a mule beneath the sun
