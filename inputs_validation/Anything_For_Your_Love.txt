Gods got a plan hes making it clear  
Sweet little love song in your ear  
Like hearts made of diamond love will prevail  
Put a little wind in your sail  
  
Chorus  
Id do anything anything you can dream of  
Id do anything anything for your love  
For your love  
For your love  
  
Listen now baby Ill tell you true  
Just how much that I love you  
I got a sweet feelin I know is real  
This kind of love you cant conceal  
  
Chorus x2
