Im goin to Hollywood theyll see that Im so good  
I wont care how I feel and Ill get to fuck Brooke Shields  
Ill just sit and grin the money will roll right in  
  
I want to be a star Im going to have a car  
And youll have to admit Ill be rich as shit  
Ill just sit and grin the money will roll right in  
  
I would give you some if you only would have treated me nice  
Youll wish that you did youll feel pretty stupid  
Ill just sit and grin the money will roll right in  
  
Its fun to be a star its nice to have a car  
Yeah youll have to admit that Ill be rich as shit  
And Ill just sit and grin the money will roll right in  
  
The money will roll right in
