Intro Kid Ink  
Said I aint even gotta say shit  
You know who Im talking to  
Said I aint even gotta say shit  
  
Verse 1 Chris Brown  
Baby you know that I cry all these tears for you  
No one compares to the smile you make when  
When I hit it taste that kitty  
I aint even gotta say shit  
Ten girls in the back seat nigga Im with it  
She broke my heart I guess shes a superstar now  
When all I really needed was your love  
  
Chorus  
She dont wanna love me no more  
She said I was doing too much  
And now Im all alone with nobody  
I might as well roll up  
Im tired of fighting already been down that road  
And she dont wanna love me no more  
She dont wanna love me no more  
  
Verse 2 Kid Ink  
She dont wanna love me no more  
All her shit parked front at the front door  
How the hell did we get here so damn fast  
Foot to the gas tryin to cover your nose  
Stop sniffing around still aint gonna find nothing  
Acting like Sherlock Holmes or something  
They say love dont cost a thing  
But I can see change girl keep it one hunned  
If you really wanna leave  
If you really wanna go you gotta make it through me  
I aint doing this alone  
Think Im going insane and it usually turns you on but right now  
  
Chorus  
She dont wanna love me no more  
She said I was doing too much  
And now Im all alone with nobody  
I might as well roll up  
Im tired of fighting already been down that road  
And she dont wanna love me no more  
She dont wanna love me no more
