When Im behind the wheel  
Horses of gas and steel  
The highway is my home  
In fiberglass and chrome  
Fantasy car shiny Corvette  
Lets take a ride you cant forget  
Come on pretty lady ride with me  
  
In my car  
Im captain of my destiny  
In my car  
Pretty babe come cruise with me  
  
Come for a drive  
And well arrive  
Feelin alive  
  
Im master of my fate  
When I accelerate  
My new Vette is my throne  
When on the road we roam we roam we roam roam  
Cruisin like were in a dream  
Feelin like were still sixteen  
Being a part of the great American scene  
  
In my car  
Im captain of my destiny  
In my car  
Pretty babe come cruise with me  
  
Come for a drive  
And well arrive  
Feelin alive  
  
Cruise cruise cruise with me baby  
Now move move up in the stratosphere  
Zoom zoom zoom with me darlin now  
Were still cruisin after all these  
Cruisin after all these years  
  
Wind blowing in my hair  
I feel like a millionaire  
Radio is blasting strong  
Were breaking out in song  
Blazing trails both near and far  
Park my car behind a star  
Life is full of possibilities  
  
In my car  
Im captain of my destiny  
In my car  
Oh pretty babe come cruise with me  
  
Come for a drive  
And well arrive  
Feelin alive  
  
In my car  
Im captain of my destiny  
In my car  
Oh pretty babe come cruise with me
