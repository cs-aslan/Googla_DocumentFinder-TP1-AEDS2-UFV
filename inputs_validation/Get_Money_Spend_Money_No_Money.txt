Get money spend money no money lookin like a dummy I really dont give a

I dont accept no disrespect only thing I expect is self check  
Just grin and bare it got an ass whooping that your ass dont wanna inherit  
Most rappers are parrots they say what they told to say to get a neck fool of

Chorus  
  
Niggaz brag about what they got but we dont own a skyscraper now thats

One generation from slums happy for these little crumbyou little bums  
We saw you pull up but nigga shut up Shut up you always talk about a

You always talkin bout some fuckin rims on terrior that kinda shit will

Saw your little bitty house on cribs where you fuck your wife and feed your
