Till I became a wanted man  
I never owned a gun  
But now they hunt me like a mountain cat  
And Im always always always on the run  
  
I killed poor Jed Bryant  
In a bad Laredo fight  
Killed him with my bare hands  
For the girl I loved that night  
Jeds brothers out to get me  
Hes comin with a gang  
Id rather shoot it out by God than let em see me hang  
  
Bullet in my shoulder  
Blood runnin down my vest  
Twenty in the posse  
And theyre never gonna let me rest  
  
Till I became a wanted man  
I never owned a gun  
But now they hunt me like a mountain cat  
And Im always always always on the run  
  
Spangles on her red dress  
Laughter in her voice  
When he tried to put his hands on her  
My heart left me no choice  
But was she really worth it  
I guess Ill never know  
Shell be drinkin someone elses rye when Im six feet below  
  
Bullet in my shoulder  
Blood runnin down my vest  
Twenty in the posse  
And theyre never gonna let me rest  
  
Till I became a wanted man  
I never owned a gun  
But now they hunt me like a mountain cat  
And Im always always always on the run
