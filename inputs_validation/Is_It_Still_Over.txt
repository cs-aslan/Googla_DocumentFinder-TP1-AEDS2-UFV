Being without you has turned out to be so inconvenient  
And wishing I was with you just seems to use up all my time  
Youve been gone so long that its hard to recall  
Just how the dream went  
And all but this broken heart in me I guess is doing fine  
  
Chorus  
Is it still over are we still through  
Since my phone still aint ringing I assume it still aint you  
Ive half a mind to take the time to find somebody new  
But Im not too sure that Im still over you  
  
That lie that I tried to slip by you  
Was told with good intentions  
It was just another way to say I love you  
And protect you from the truth  
Half a pound of cure is surely worth a half an ounce of pure prevention  
And trying to explain while Im insane  
Is the hardest thing Ive ever tried to do  
  
Chorus  
  
If I repeat myself its cause Ive nothing else to do  
And Im not too sure that Im still over you
