When you meet a special person  
And it feels good passing time  
You tell yourself its casual  
But they have something else in mind  
  
You try to make some reason  
A voice calls out from across the room  
She runs away without an answer  
She runs away too soon  
  
Chorus  
Somewhere tonight  
Someones crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someones crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someones crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someones crying  
  
We all belong to someone  
Sometimes theyre so far away  
You write down words in letters  
Not quite sure what they say  
  
You know that she needs you  
And you miss her in your heart  
But a certain feeling lingers  
That keeps us miles apart  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh Lord  
Somewhere tonight  
Someones crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someones crying  
Youd better believe  
Somewhere tonight  
Someones crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someones crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someones crying
