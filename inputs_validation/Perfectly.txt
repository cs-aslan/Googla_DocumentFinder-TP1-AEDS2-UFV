When I say it doesnt matter  
It matters most of all  
Youre not up for conversation  
So Im blinded by it all  
  
The further away you push me  
The closer I feel to you  
  
Every fall  
Every crash  
Everything that was never meant to be  
All the perfect little things I cant release  
All the nights  
Everytime we were just about to leave  
Now makes no sense to me  
But it seems that when we fall  
Thats when we land  
Perfectly  
  
Cant see whats before me  
And I cannot feel the ground  
This place that we exist in  
Is the sweetest thing Ive found  
  
The further away you push me  
The closer I feel to you  
  
Every fall  
Every crash  
Everything that was never meant to be  
All the perfect little things I cant release  
All the nights  
Everytime we were just about to leave  
Now makes no sense to me  
But it seems that when we fall  
Thats when we land  
Perfectly  
  
The further away you push me  
The closer I feel to you  
  
Every fall  
Every crash  
Everything that was never meant to be  
All the perfect little things I cant release  
All the nights  
Everytime we were just about to leave  
Now makes no sense to me  
But it seems that when we fall  
Thats when we land  
Perfectly  
  
Perfectly  
Perfectly
