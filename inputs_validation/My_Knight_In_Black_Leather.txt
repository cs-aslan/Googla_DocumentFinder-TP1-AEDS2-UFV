Time 215 the AM  
Place Ronardos BoomBoomRoom on South Street  
Im a hot blonde and it was a cold night  
This is my story I aint ashamed to tell it  
I was hungry tired and lookin for love  
  
I was just a pilgrim in the hot pursuit of love  
Wandered from disco to disco  
Thats all my life was  
Suddenly you danced up against me  
It felt warm and smooth  
I knew in an instant  
That you were my moment of darkest truth  
  
Oh my knight in black leather  
Hold me tight and love me forever  
Rings on your fingers love in your heart  
Knight in black leather well never part  
  
Only you can shine the light  
On the dark side of my mind  
And your evil sweetness  
Leaves a trail of lovers behind  
When you crush me to your heart  
I feel just like a queen  
Im a willing victim  
Tell me all my life where have you been  
  
Oh my knight in black leather  
Hold me tight and love me forever  
Rings on your fingers love in your heart  
Knight in black leather well never part haaa  
  
Oh my knight in black leather  
Take me down and love me forever  
Walk on through the halls of my soul  
Knight in black leather  
And youve got control  
Oh dont ya know baby  
  
Youre my knight  
Seemon and love me forever  
Rings on your fingers love on demand  
Knight in black leather  
Oh youve got command  
And how I love ya baby  
  
Whoa my knight  
Sweet sweet knight  
You know that I love you I love you love you  
Well never paaaaaaaaaaart  
  
Were the knights in black leather  
And we will chain you down  
And love you forever  
Walk on through the halls of your soul  
Yeah the knights in black leather  
Were in controoool  
  
You know he smells just like a brand new car  
Cause everything he owns is leather  
A leather shirt leather hat  
Leather gloves leather spats  
Leather chaps leather pants  
Leather socks leather cap  
Leather coat leather wrap  
Leather neck leather ring  
Leather thing
