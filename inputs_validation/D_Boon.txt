Do you remember remember D Boon  
Part of what he was is a part of me now and if you think back where would he
be  
Where would I be if time had allowed  
  
This isnt written for any one man its about me  
This isnt written for anyone alive just the songs that he sang  
  
Ive been told that its a waste of time  
Well so what  
Will it be worth mine  
  
And if Managuas bullets dont fly young men still would die for glory  
Or for their countries  
Its just me and Jay  
Playing our guitars along with it all  
  
This isnt written for any one man its about me  
This isnt written for anyone alive just the songs that he sang  
  
And Im not old  
So Ive got nothing but time to waste will it be worth mine
