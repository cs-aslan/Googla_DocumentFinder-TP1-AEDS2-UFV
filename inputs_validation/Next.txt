Sitting in the corner of a room thinkin of you  
Wonderin what youre doing now were apart  
No use cryin tears cant reach you now  
Memories fulfilling dreams  
  
You used to be so good to me  
I cant live without you  
Id like to be in your fantasy baby  
Part of you is me wo  
  
Walking across the clouds hope I see you there  
Be it day or nighttime I dont really care  
Hope you see me too before I meet my end  
Someone stole my life away I cant pretend
