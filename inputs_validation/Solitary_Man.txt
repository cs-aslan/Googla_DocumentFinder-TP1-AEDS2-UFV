Melinda was mine  
Til the time  
That I found her  
Holding Jim  
Loving him  
  
Then Sue came along  
Loved me strong  
Thats what I thought  
Me and Sue  
But that died too  
  
Dont know that I will  
But until I can find me  
A girl wholl stay  
And wont play games behind me  
Ill be what I am  
A solitary man  
Solitary man  
  
Ive had it to here  
Bein where  
Loves a small world  
Parttime thing  
Paper ring  
  
I know its been done  
Having one  
Girl wholl love me  
Right or wrong  
Weak or strong  
  
Dont know that I will  
But until I can find me  
The girl wholl stay  
And wont play games behind me  
Ill be what I am  
A solitary man  
Solitary man
