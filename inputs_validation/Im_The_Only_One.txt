Please baby cant you see  
My minds a burnin hell  
I got razors a rippin and tearin and strippin  
My heart apart as well  
Tonight you told me  
That you ache for something new  
And some other woman is lookin like something  
That might be good for you  
  
Chorus  
Go on and hold her till the screaming is gone  
Go on believe her when she tells you  
Nothings wrong  
But Im the only one  
Wholl walk across the fire for you  
And Im the only one  
Wholl drown in my desire for you  
Its only fear that makes you run  
The demons that youre hiding from  
When all your promises are gone  
  
Im the only one  
Please baby cant you see  
Im trying to explain  
Ive been here before and Im locking the door  
And Im not going back again  
Her eyes and arms and skin wont make  
It go away  
Youll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow  
That holds you down today  
  
Chorus 2x
