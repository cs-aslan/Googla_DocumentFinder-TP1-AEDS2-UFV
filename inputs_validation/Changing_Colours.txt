You look at me with uncertainty  
You look at me with urgency  
You look at me with fear in your eyes  
Like youre about to fall away  
  
Dont be afraid to change your colours now  
Ive known you all summer and you rose above it all  
I see you hesitate to fall now  
But its a pretty good view from down here too  
  
When the wind takes you it takes me too  
And when you change colours Ill change mine too  
Try not to think and I will try too  
And when you let go I will let go too  
  
I knew you when you were green and small  
Like a feather on a wing so long  
You know I will miss you when you are gone  
But dont be afraid if you just cant hang on  
  
Cause when the wind takes you it takes me too  
When you change colours Ill change mine too  
Try not to think and I will try too  
When you let go I will let go too  
  
When the wind takes you it takes me too  
And when you change colours Ill change mine too  
Try not to think and I will try too  
And when you let go I will let go too  
  
The cold air is pushing hard on you  
I know what youre saying I can feel it too  
Youll go through changes and Ill go through them too  
Dont be afraid now no dont be afraid dont be afraid  
  
Cause when the wind takes you it takes me too  
When you change colours Ill change mine too  
Try not to think and I will try too  
When you let go I will let go too
