Something has changed  
But I dont know what it is  
Something has grown inside  
Something has changed  
But I dont know what it is  
Something has changed  
  
Somebody called  
In the middle of the night  
Somebody called my name  
Somebody called  
In the middle of the night  
Something has changed  
  
Something has flown  
Now I dont know anything  
Something has shown its face  
Something has come  
And I want to let it in  
Something is telling me its time to put my weapons  
Down and let it begin  
  
If I would jump  
To the bottom of the well  
What would I find down there  
Water or sand  
At the bottom of the well  
Think I will jump  
  
Something has changed  
But I dont know what it is  
Something has grown inside  
Something has come  
And I want to let it in  
Something is telling me its time to put my weapons  
Down and let it begin  
  
Dont forget to call us  
Wear a sweater  
Will you be home for the holidays  
  
Something has changed
