I saw red stayed at home  
Placed a big pillow over the phone  
In this town where Im from  
Ive learned two is so much better than one  
  
But you left me alone  
You cant put your arms around whats already gone  
Watch you sink like a stone  
You cant put your arms around whats already gone  
  
Well you hurt to the core  
You used to kiss like no one had done before  
And your taste turned me on  
Now you drive me real crazy just by being born  
  
Cause you left left left left me alone left me alone  
And you cant put your arms around whats already gone  
Watch you sink like a stone  
You cant put your arms around whats already gone  
  
Baba bbaba bbaba ba  
Baba bbaba bbaba ba  
  
Took the tram round the bay  
Where everyone tells you to have a nice day  
And my pride almost broke  
When the tears dont fit you you look like a joke  
  
And you left left left left me alone left me alone  
You cant put your arms around whats already gone  
Cryin eyes gettin worn  
You cant put your arms around whats already gone  
  
Hey you left left left left me alone left me alone  
You cant put your arms around whats already gone  
Watch you sink like a stone  
You cant put your arms around whats already gone  
  
Baba bbaba bbaba ba  
Baba bbaba bbaba ba
