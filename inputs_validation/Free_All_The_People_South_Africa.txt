You got to free all the people in South Africa  
You got to make life worth living in Soweto  
You got to free all the people in South Africa  
You got to make life worthwhile  
Give reason to smile  
  
Freedom is a birthright  
Given by Jah to Man  
You can not claim it this you must understand  
Who are you to decide who has to give it up  
Know it in your heart that its wrong  
Theyve had enough  
  
Chorus  
Slavery is brutal it steals your identity  
Wherever its living suffer humanity  
What leads you to believe you can treat people so  
You know it isnt right give up the fight  
Let them go  
  
Chorus  
  
Its not right this hate for Life youre teaching  
No more fight were all in this together  
Youve lost sight youll never find what your  
Soul is seeking  
You you abolish apartheid  
  
Chorus
