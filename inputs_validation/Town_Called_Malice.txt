Better stop dreaming of the quiet life  
Cause its the one well never know  
And quit running for that runaway bus  
Cause those rosy days are few  
And stop apologizing for the things youve never done  
Cause time is short and life is cruel  
But its up to us to change  
This town called malice  
Rows and rows of disused milk floats  
Stand dying in the dairy yard  
And a hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk  
Bottles to their hearts  
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry  
Its enough to make you stop believing when tears come  
Fast and furious  
In a town called malice  
  
Struggle after struggle year after year  
The atmospheres a fine blend of ice  
Im almost stone cold dead  
In a town called malice  
  
A whole streets belief in Sundays roast beef  
Gets dashed against the Coop  
To either cut down on beer or the kids new gear  
Its a big decision in a town called malice  
  
The ghost of a steam train echoes down my track  
Its at the moment bound for nowhere  
Just going round and round  
Playground kids and creaking swings  
Lost laughter in the breeze  
I could go on for hours and I probably will  
But Id sooner put some joy back  
In this town called malice
