okay for anyone whos still listening  
This is a song called I Froze Up  
I did  
What Dont distract me   
Youre the light wiping out my batteries  
Youre the cream in my airportcoffees  
I dont know why I stick with you  
If I had a choice  
Like lambs into the slaughter  
Like cows to the thunderbolt  
Youre the Genie of my lamp  
I could have been anyone  
But one day I froze up  
But one day I froze up  
But one day I froze up  
Like this  
Oh little boy  
Little boy little boy  
Oh little boy  
Little boy little boy  
If you try to strangle the skylark  
Try to cut it up to see how it works  
Stalactites and stalagmites  
Rows of never open doors  
Coz one day I froze up  
Coz one day I froze up  
Coz one day I froze up  
Like this  
Colours wont   
Colours wont   
Colours wont
