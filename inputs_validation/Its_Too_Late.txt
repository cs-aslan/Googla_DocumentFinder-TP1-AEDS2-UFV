Its too late shes gone  
Its too late my babys gone  
Wish I had told her she was my only one  
Its too late shes gone  
  
Its a woman that cries  
So I guess Ive gotta hide my eyes  
Yes I will miss her more than anyone  
Its too late shes gone  
  
Shes gone yes shes gone  
Shes gone my babys gone  
Shes gone yes shes gone  
Where can my baby be  
  
And I wonder does she know  
When she left me it hurt me so  
I need your love babe please dont make me wait  
Tell me its not too late  
  
Chorus  
  
Third Verse
