Just like a young boy  
Running down the road  
Im singing out  
The same old song  
Cant go back  
The way I started from  
The road goes on and on  
Wont you help me help me  
Help me help me  
Help me help me  
Help me help me  
Take my way on home  
Help me make my way on home  
After Berlin  
  
Lights are shining  
In the German sky  
Cosmic walls  
Between the moon and I  
Dont know where I started from  
So wont you take me take me  
Take me take me  
Take me take me  
Take me take me  
Just the way I am  
Ah take me just the way I am  
After Berlin  
  
All day cruising  
Down the corridor  
Seeing things  
I never seen before  
Tomorrow morning in old Berlin  
Where they lock you out  
Or lock you in  
Wont you save me save me  
Save me save me  
Save me save me  
Save me save me  
From the final day  
Save me from the final day  
After Berlin  
  
Just like a young boy  
Running down the road  
Im singing out  
The same old song  
I cant go back  
The way I used to go  
The road goes on and on  
Wont you help me help me  
Help me help me  
Help me help me  
Help me help me  
Find my way back home  
Wont you help me  
Make my way on home  
After Berlin  
  
Help me help me  
Help me help me  
Help me help me  
Help me help me
