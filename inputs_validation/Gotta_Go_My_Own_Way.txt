Gabriella  
I gotta say whats on my mind  
Something about us  
Doesnt seem right these days  
Life keeps getting in the way  
Whenever we try somehow the plan  
Is always rearranged  
  
Its so hard to say  
But Ive gotta do whats best for me  
Youll be ok  
  
Ive got to move on and be who I am  
I just dont belong here  
I hope you understand  
We might find our place in this  
World someday  
But at least for now  
I gotta go my own way  
  
Dont wanna leave it all behind  
But I get my hopes up  
And I watch them fall everytime  
Another colour turns to grey  
And its just too hard to watch it all  
Slowly fade away  
Im leaving today cause Ive  
Gotta do whats best for me  
Youll be ok  
Ive got to move on and be who I am  
I just dont belong here  
I hope you understand  
We might find our place in this  
World someday  
But at least for now  
I gotta go my own way  
  
Troy  
What about us  
What about everything weve been through  
  
Gabriella  
What about trust  
  
Troy  
You know I never wanted to hurt you  
  
Gabriella  
And what about me  
  
Troy  
What am I supposed to do  
  
Gabriella  
I gotta leave but Ill miss you  
  
Troy  
Ill miss you  
  
Gabriella  
So  
Ive got to move on and be who I am  
  
Troy  
Why do you have to go  
  
Gabriella  
I just dont belong here  
I hope you understand  
  
Troy  
Im trying to understand  
  
Gabriella  
We might find our place in this  
World someday  
But at least for now  
  
Troy  
I want you to stay  
  
Gabriella  
I wanna go my own way  
Ive got to move on and be who I am  
  
Troy  
What about us  
  
Gabriella  
I just dont belong here  
I hope you understand  
  
Troy  
Im trying to understand  
  
Gabriella  
We might find our place in this  
World someday  
But at least for now  
I gotta go my own way  
I gotta go my own way  
I gotta go my own way
