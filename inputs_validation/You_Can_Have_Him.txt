maizie  
You can have him  
I dont want him  
Hes not worth fighting for  
Besides theres plenty more where he came from  
I dont want him  
You can have him  
Im giving him the sack  
And he can go right back where he came from  
I could never make him happy  
Hed be better off with you  
Im afraid I never loved him  
All I ever wanted to do was  
  
Run my fingers thru his curly locks  
Mend his underwear and darn his socks  
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes  
Wipe his glasses when he read the news  
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch  
Mornings after when hes had too much  
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near  
Give him babies one for evry year so you see  
I dont want him you can have him  
You can have him I dont want him  
For hes not the man for me  
  
monique  
You can have him  
I dont want him  
Hes not worth fighting for  
Besides theres plenty more where he came from  
I dont want him  
You can have him  
He isnt my concern  
And he can just return where he came from  
I would look a trifle silly  
Taking him away from you  
That was never my intention  
All I ever wanted to do was  
  
Close the window while he soundly slept  
Raid the icebox where the food is kept  
Cook a breakfast that would please him most  
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast  
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray  
After breakfast clear the things away  
Bring the papers and when theyve been read  
Spend the balance of the day in bed so you see  
I dont want him you can have him  
You can have him I dont want him  
For hes not the man for me
