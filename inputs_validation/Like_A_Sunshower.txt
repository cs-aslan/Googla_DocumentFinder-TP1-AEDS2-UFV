Girl tell me whats wrong  
Are those tears in your eyes  
Whats going on between us  
Im ready to listen  
I dont care if it takes all night  
We both said something we didnt mean  
We lost our heads  
Now I cant sleep  
Til you talk to me  
We find the sun through the rain  
Caught in a sunshower  
Well be all right no ones to blame  
After the storm well shine  
So rare you and me disagree  
Loves like a sunshower  
When you meet me babe  
Somewhere halfway yeah  
Its been way too long  
Since we shared whats in our hearts  
Lets say this charade is over  
Ooh we cant take for granted  
How far weve come  
Lets not lose each other  
I know you care cause you stand your ground  
When we talked enough  
I wanna make up  
Wanna make love  
We find the sun through the rain  
Caught in a sunshower  
Well be alright  
No ones to blame  
After the storm well shine  
So rare you and me disagree  
Loves like a sunshower  
Baby babe  
Somewhere well find  
We wont regret  
We wont forget  
Rainbows wait for you and me  
Girl were caught in a sunshower  
When weve talked enough  
Can we make up  
Can we make love ooh  
Yeah
