Now youre heading down to get someone  
Shouldve done what he had to do years ago  
The position is coming through  
All the people that youre standing on  
All the people that youre standing on  
Now youre heading down to be someone  
Someone that youve seen in a magazine  
Your premonition is coming true  
Oh baby youre not so green  
No baby youre not so green  
No baby youre not so  
Sister madly waking up the dead  
Youre systematically stepping on my head  
Now youre heading down to find something  
Something that you buried in your back yard  
The position is coming through  
From all the dirt that youre digging up  
From all the dirt that youre digging up  
Now youre heading down to be somewhere  
Somewhere you imagined in your wildest dream  
The opposition is coming through  
From all the people that youre standing on  
From all the people that youre standing on  
Now you better youd better take a firm hand  
Sister madly waking up the dead  
Youre systematically stepping on my head  
Now youre heading down to get someone  
Someone that you shouldve had years ago  
The position is coming through  
All the people that youre standing on  
All the people that youre standing on  
Youre hard to get a hand on  
Sister madly waking up the dead  
Youre systematically stepping on my head
