Were running with the shadows of the night  
So baby take my hand youll be all right  
Surrender all your dreams to me tonight  
Theyll come true in the end  
  
You said Oh girl its a cold world  
When you keep it all to yourself  
I said You cant hide on the inside  
All the pain youve ever felt  
Ransom my heart but baby dont look back  
Cause we got nobody else  
  
Chorus  
Were running with the shadows of the night  
So baby take my hand itll be all right  
Surrender all your dreams to me tonight  
Theyll come true in the end  
  
You know that sometimes it feels like  
Its all moving way too fast  
Use every alibi and words you deny  
That love aint meant to last  
You can cry tough baby its all right  
You can let me down easy but not tonight  
  
Chorus x2  
  
And now the hands of time are standin still  
Midnight angel wont you say you will  
  
Chorus x3
