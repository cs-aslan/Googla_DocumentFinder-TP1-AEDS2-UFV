You aint nothing but a hound dog crying all the time  
You aint nothing but a hound dog crying all the time  
Well you aint never caught a rabbit and you aint no friend of mine  
  
They said you were high class honey that was just a lie  
Called you all high class that was just a lie  
You aint never caught a rabbit and you aint no friend of mine  
  
They said you were high class honey that was just a lie  
Called you all high class that was just a lie  
You aint never caught a rabbit and you aint no friend of mine  
  
You aint nothing but a hound dog crying all the time  
You aint nothing but a hound dog crying all the time  
Well you aint never caught a rabbit and you aint no friend of mine
