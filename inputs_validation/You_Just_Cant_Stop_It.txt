Whos gonna make you feel just right  
When that musics playin  
You gotta kick out the doors and turn out the light  
When that musics playin  
When the thing cuts loose its outa hand  
You know you just cant stop it  
Cant sit in your chair you got to stand  
You know you just cant stop it  
  
We can make it we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the nights goin hog wild  
We can make it we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the nights goin hog wild  
  
Whole damn place keeps blowin higher yeah  
Guitar man sets the strings on fire  
Hey now its bout time to set things straight  
You know you just cant stop it  
So now its time to advocate  
You know you just cant stop it  
  
We can make it we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the nights goin hog wild  
We can make it we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the nights goin hog wild  
  
Whos gonna make you feel just right  
When that musics playin  
You gotta kick out the doors and turn out the light  
When that musics playin  
When the thing cuts loose its outa hand  
You know you just cant stop it  
Cant sit in your chair you got to stand  
You know you just cant stop it  
  
We can make it we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the nights goin hog wild  
We can make it we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the nights goin hog wild
