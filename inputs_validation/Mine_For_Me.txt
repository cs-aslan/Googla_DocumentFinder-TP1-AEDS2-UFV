In a couple of hours Ill be drivin home to the one I love  
So save your breath sweet painted lady it wont be me  
Over the mountain and under the sea  
Theyll never be another one like mine for me  
  
It was only an hour or so ago that I sang my song  
Persuaded painted ladies that I could say Id been free  
Over the mountain and under the sea  
Theyll never be another one like mine for me  
  
Mine is always mine is grand  
Dont you know that the woman that love me she understands  
And cant you see that its mine for me  
And in a couple of hours Ill be driving home to the one I love  
So save your breath sweet painted lady it wont be me  
Over the mountain and under the sea  
Theyll never be another one like mine for me  
Youre for me  
  
Mine is always mine is grand  
Dont you know that the woman that love me she understands  
And cant you see that its mine for me  
Theyll never be another one like mine for me  
Theyll never be another one like mine for me  
Theyll never be another one like you for me
