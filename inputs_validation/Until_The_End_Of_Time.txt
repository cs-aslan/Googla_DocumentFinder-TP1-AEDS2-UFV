  
  
  
  
Until the end of time  
  
Im longing for you  
  
And if you feel the same  
  
Then show me your love  
  
Ill give you everything that money cant buy  
  
And Ill promise Ill be right by you side  
  
  
I imagine being wrapped up in your  
  
And feeling your heartbeat  
  
And I find myself longing to hold you close  
  
Its how I feel  
  
Cause Ive been through a lot of these years  
  
And I have lost the count of my tears  
  
  
CHORUS  
  
Until the end of time  
  
Im longing for you  
  
And if you feel the same  
  
Then show me your love  
  
Ill give you everything that money cant buycant buy  
  
And Ill promise Ill be right by you sidetil the end of time  
  
  
If only you could tell me whats on your mind  
  
And show how you feel  
  
And I wonder where you are heading this time  
  
And where you belong  
  
Cause I know that if you would be here  
  
Ill do anything cause my love is real  
  
Even though moments are sad  
  
I look into your eyes and  
  
I know this will last  
  
CHORUS x2  
  
Things that money cant buy x3
