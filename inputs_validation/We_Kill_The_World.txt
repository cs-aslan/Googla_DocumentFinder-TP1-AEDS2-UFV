I see mushrooms atomic mushrooms  
I see rockets missiles in the sky  
Day by day more and more  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for  
Poor world poor world  
  
Concretes rising up  
Where yearerday was park  
You heard the robins song  
Heavy tractor runs  
Where air was clean and cool  
Make money bringing fuel  
  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for  
A poor world poor world  
  
Fishes doomed to die  
As people live close by  
And oaktree falls with moon  
Parking lots will come  
With flowerfields were bright  
As junkyard covers sight  
  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for  
Poor world is hurting bad  
Poor world is doomed to die  
  
We kill the world  
Kill the world  
We surely do  
In peace we do  
We kill the world  
Kill the world  
cause we dont know  
What we are doing  
  
We kill it  
One by one  
Dont realize  
  
And nuclear piles stand like monuments  
Of destruction throughout over the country  
  
Promenades must go  
So cars can drive in row  
New factry towers tall  
Farmhouse had to fall  
No flowers in the air  
Pollution everywhere  
  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for  
A poor world poor world  
  
Oceans in despair  
Theres rubbish everywhere  
The seaweed chokes in mud  
Natures had her lot  
With nuclear waste and rot  
And mushrooms bloom as clouds  
  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for  
Poor world is hurting bad  
Poor world is doomed to die  
  
We kill the world  
  
Dont kill the world  
Dont let her down  
Do not destroy basic ground  
Dont kill the world  
Our means of life  
Lend ear to natures cry  
  
Dont kill the world  
Shes all we have  
And surely is worth to save  
Dont let her die  
Fight for her trees  
Pollution robs air to breathe  
  
Dont kill the world  
Help her survive  
And shell reward you with life  
And dont just talk  
Go on and do the one who wins is you  
  
Cherish the world  
A present from god  
On behalf of all creatures  
Made by the lord  
Care for the earth  
Foundation of life  
Slow progress down help her survive
