The words are so familiar  
All the same greats the same mistakes  
It doesnt have to be like this  
If you dont make a friend now  
One might make you  
So learn  
The gentle art of making enemies  
Dont look so surprised  
Happy birthdayFucker  
Blow that candle out  
Were gonnaa kick you  
Dont say youre not because you are  
Dont say youre not because you are  
History tells us that you are  
History tells us that you are  
All you need is just one more excuse  
You put up one hell of a fight  
I want to hear your very best excuse  
Never felt this much alive  
Your day has finally come  
So wear the hat and do the dance  
And let the suit keep wearing you  
This year youll sit and take it  
And you will like it  
Its the gentle art of making enemies  
I deserve a reward  
cause Im the best fuck that you ever had  
And if I tighten up my hole  
You may never see the light again  
Theres always an easy way out  
Theres always an easy way out  
You need something wet in your mouth  
You need something wet in your mouth  
Never felt this much alive
