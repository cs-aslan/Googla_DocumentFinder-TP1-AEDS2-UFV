Ive been casing your joint  
For the best years of my life  
Like the look of your stuff  
Outta sight  
When Im hungry and when Im cold  
When Im having it rough  
Or just getting old  
  
Listen up sweet child of mine  
Have I got news for you  
Nobody leaves this place alive  
Theyll die and join the queue  
  
Better man the barricades  
Im coming in tonight  
Had a line of my dust  
Outta sight  
When I wonder and when I roam  
Ill find a soul I can trust  
Im coming home  
  
Listen up sweet child of mine  
Have I got news for you  
Nobody leaves this place alive  
Theyll die and join the queue sing it  
  
Im gonna break right into heaven  
I cant wait anymore  
  
Heavens gates wont hold me  
Ill saw those suckers down  
Laughing loud at your locks  
When they hit the ground  
Every icon in every town  
Hear this your numbers up  
Im coming round  
  
Listen up sweet child of mine  
Have I got news for you  
Nobody leaves this place alive  
Theyll die and join the queue sing it  
  
Im gonna break right into heaven  
I cant wait anymore  
  
How many times will I have to tell you  
You dont have to wait to die  
You can have it all any time you want it  
Yeah the kingdoms all inside
