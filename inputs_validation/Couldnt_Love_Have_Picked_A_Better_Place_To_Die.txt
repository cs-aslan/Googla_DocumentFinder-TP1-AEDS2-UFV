Of all the people in this world why you and I  
With lovers here and everywhere we dont care enough to try  
Why couldnt all the hurt were feeling now have passed us by  
Couldnt love have picked a better place to die  
  
And of all the hearts in all the world why yours and mine  
Theres so many places love could die we must leave the earth for a time  
Oh but its in our hearts and its in our bed and its even in your eyes  
Couldnt love have picked a better place to die  
  
Somewhere out there theres lovers who want to be free  
Why couldnt love have died with them instead of here with you and me  
Oh but its pitiful how all these tears wont bring it back to life  
Couldnt love have picked a better place to die  
  
Oh but its pitiful how all these tears wont bring it back to life  
  
Oh couldnt love have picked a better place to die
