Its the end of our journey  
What can I do  
Lonely together  
When Im alone with you  
  
Now that weve come so far  
It seems like the end  
We could be lovers  
We could never be friends  
  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
  
We can never talk  
Like others seem to do  
Lonely together  
Making love to you  
  
We dont get nothing  
From the letters we send  
We could be lovers  
We could never be friends  
  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
  
Plus a new relationship  
You know you break my heart  
What I feel for yous too strong  
It has been from the start  
Every time I see your face  
Its tearing me apart  
What is need is love from you  
Oh but I cant  
  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
I dont think we could ever  
I dont think we could ever be friends  
Ah ha
