Out of touch out of reach yeah  
You could try to get closer to me  
Im in luck Im in deep yeah  
Hypnotized Im shakin to my knees  
I gotta know tonight  
If youre alone tonight  
Cant stop this feeling  
Cant stop this fight  
  
Oh I get hysterical hysteria  
Oh can you feel it do you believe it  
Its such a magical mysteria  
When you get that feelin better start believin  
Cause its a miracle oh say you will ooh babe  
Hysteria when youre near  
  
Out of me into you yeah  
You could hide its just a one way street  
Oh I believe Im in you yeah  
Open wide thats right dream me off my feet  
Oh believe in me  
  
I gotta know tonight  
If youre alone tonight  
Cant stop this feeling  
Cant stop this fire  
  
Oh I get hysterical hysteria  
Oh can you feel it do you believe it  
Its such a magical mysteria  
When you get that feelin better start believin  
Cause its a miracle oh say you will  
Ooh babe  
Hysteria when youre near
