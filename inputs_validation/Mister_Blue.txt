Whats the story Mr Blue  
Did she pull the rug from under you  
Did she chop your dreams up two by two  
And kick them out the door  
I could sympathize you son  
But pity words stick to my tongue  
And sorry words have all been sung  
So many times before  
  
Oh Mr Blue you blew your chances long ago  
Oh Mr Blue youre through  
Quit acting like you didnt know  
  
Hang on one more day or two  
Then I promise Ill be laying you  
Odds that shes found someone new  
While you stand around and rust  
She dont need no parttime man  
With no parttime answer understand  
She dont want an hours fall of sand  
For a lifetime full of dust  
  
Oh Mr Blue you blew your chances long ago  
Oh Mr Blue youre through  
Quit acting like you didnt know  
  
Mr Blue you missed the shot  
Didnt turn out quite the way you thought  
It would Ill bet cause you got caught  
Out playing Donald Juan  
Shes got polish shes got class  
And someday when on the street you pass her house  
Youll wonder why the grass  
Looks greener on her lawn  
  
Oh Mr Blue you blew your chances long ago  
Oh Mr Blue youre through  
Quit acting like it isnt so
