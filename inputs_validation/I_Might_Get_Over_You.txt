Well I opened my heart and I let you in  
I promised Id never love again  
And still doin what Id said Id do  
Someday I might get over you  
  
I wear my ring on a chain now still on my hand  
And I deal with your memories the best I can  
Ive even been out on a date or two  
Someday I might get over you  
  
Oh I never thought Id see it  
But I think I see the light now  
I know that what I have to do  
Is get on with my life but I cant take another day  
I cant face another night so I just take another breath  
And let it go  
  
If I could ever feel the way I felt  
Ill take a chance with someone else  
And if my heart takes chances too  
Someday I might get over you  
  
Oh I never thought Id see it  
But I think I see the light now  
I know that what I have to do  
Is get on with my life but I cant take another day  
I cant face another night so I just take another breath  
And let it go  
  
Well I opened my heart and I let you in  
I promised Id never love again  
Right now its still somethin I cant do  
Someday I might get over you  
  
Thought it may not be til my life is through  
Someday I might get over you
