I Ive been wrong before  
But I know for sure  
That I saw you last night  
Out with another guy  
It nearly made me cry  
So Im telling your girl  
Stand by me my love  
And Ill give you anything you want anytime you want  
So stand by me my love  
And Ill give you everything  
And Ill give you everything  
Break  
Stand by me my love  
And Ill give you anything you want anytime you want  
So stand by me my love  
And Ill give you everything  
And Ill give you everything  
I Ive been wrong before  
But I know for sure  
That I saw you last night  
Out with another guy  
It nearly made me cry  
So Im telling your girl  
Cry  
So Im telling you girl  
Cry  
So Im telling you girl  
Cry
