Love is like a hydrant turns off and on  
Like some friendships when your moneys gone  
Love stands in with the loan sharks when your hearts in tongs  
  
It I had some strong wings like an aeroplane  
Had some broad wings like an aeroplane  
I would fly away forever  
Hover to come again  
Oh love oh love oh loveless love  
Has said our hearts are goldiess gold  
From milkless milk and silkless silk  
We are growing used to soulless souls  
  
Such grafting times we never saw  
Thats why we have a pure full law  
In everything we find a flaw  
Even love oh love oh loveless love  
Just to fly away from loveless love
