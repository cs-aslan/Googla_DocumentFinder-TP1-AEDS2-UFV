Sick as the sickest only can be  
Armies of crazy crawling all over me  
Shaky at best is the ground where I stand  
A frozen moment I just dont understand  
Bats in the belfry  
Bats in the belfry  
  
Cmon now let me feel you get on it  
Cmon now let me have it my way  
Cmon now when you cant really stop it  
Open up the window got bats in the belfry  
Bats in the belfry  
Bats in the belfry  
  
Pasted and wasted taller than God  
Burning my churches and blowing my wad  
Quakin beneath me the ground that I own  
A frozen moment that Ill always call home  
Bats in the belfry  
Bats in the belfry  
  
Cmon got bats in the belfry  
Hold on rats on the way  
Cmon got bats in the belfry  
Open up the window  
Bats in the belfry
