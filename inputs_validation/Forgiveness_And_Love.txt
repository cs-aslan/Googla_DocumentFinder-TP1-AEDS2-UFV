Imagining youre far away  
Searching for the words to say  
I feel it when you fall apart  
Our lives are our greatest art  
I dont want to change your mind  
Cause I accept you  
For everything you are and will be  
Stay here with me now  
  
The only thing that our hearts are made of  
Are the acts of forgiveness and love  
The only thing real when push comes to shove  
Are the acts of forgiveness and love  
Cause in the end  
No one loses or wins  
The story begins again and again  
With forgiveness and love  
  
You dont ever have to read my mind  
You can see it when you close your eyes  
Dont believe it when you lose your faith  
Another moment is a moment away  
I cant tell you what the future holds  
Or how to live  
All I know is  
What feels right lights up my life again and again  
  
The only thing that our hearts are made of  
Are the acts of forgiveness and love  
The only thing real when push comes to shove  
Are the acts of forgiveness and love  
Cause in the end  
No one loses or wins  
The story begins again and again  
With forgiveness and love  
  
Lets jump the sun  
Lets find forever  
Where does the time go  
Just live your life  
Youll get another today today today  
Forgiveness and love  
Cause in the end no one loses or wins  
The story begins again and again  
With forgiveness and love  
  
Lets jump the sun  
Lets jump the sun  
Lets jump the sun  
Forgiveness and love
