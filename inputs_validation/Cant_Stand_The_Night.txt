Here I am  
I want you to know that I understand  
What it is youre giving me  
  
Ive got it all brand new  
  
Here we are  
Put up a show of hands  
But Ive got the feeling that  
They dont know what theyre gonna do  
  
We dont live there no more  
Weve got the room on the second floor  
Oh we dont live there no more  
  
Stay with me heartache so I can keep it right  
Another day with the heartache  
You know I cant stand the night  
  
Think about the people in the foreign lands  
Think about the dirty money in my hands  
Think I know the reason why it doesnt work out right  
Think of all the needy with a helping hand  
Think of all the greedy people in our land  
Think they know the reason why it doesnt work out right  
  
I dont live there no more  
Ive got the suite on the penthouse floor  
Oh I dont live there no more  
  
Stay with me heartache so I can keep it right  
Another day with the heartache  
You know I cant stand the night  
Stay with me heartache so I can keep it right  
Another day with the heartache  
You know I cant stand the night  
  
I dont live there no more  
Ive got the suite on the penthouse floor  
Oh I dont live there no more  
  
See my pride  
Been looking for it once or twice  
Lost my pride  
Im really gonna make it right  
  
I dont live there no more  
Ive got no room on the penthouse floor  
Oh I dont live there no more  
  
Stay with me heartache so I can keep it right  
Another day with the heartache  
You know I cant stand the night  
Stay with me heartache so I can keep it right  
Another day with the heartache  
You know I cant stand the night
