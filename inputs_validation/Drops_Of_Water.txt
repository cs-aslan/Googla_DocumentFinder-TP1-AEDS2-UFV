Theres a bird in my tree  
Singin sad autumn melodies  
Theres a old sumer breeze  
And its blowin away  
  
Theres a cloud in my sky  
Theres a boy whos been on my mind  
Theres a tear in my eye  
And I think it might rain  
  
Chorus  
Drops of water drops of water  
Fallin down around fate  
Oh its nothin but the rain in my life  
Drops of water drops of water  
Fallin down around my fate  
Oh its nothin but the rain in my life  
  
Theres a moon up above  
Shinin down on the one I love  
Theres a pain in my heart  
Hes gone away  
  
If a star falls tonight  
Let it fall and with all my might  
I close my eyes make a wish  
That hell come back someday  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh its nothin but the rain in my life  
Drops of water drops of water  
  
Oh its nothin but the rain in my life  
Drops of water drops of water
