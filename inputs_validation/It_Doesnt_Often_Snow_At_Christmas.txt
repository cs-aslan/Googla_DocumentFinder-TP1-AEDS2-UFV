Christmas is not all its cracked up to be  
Families fighting around a plastic tree  
Nothing on the TV that youd want to see  
And its hardly ever snowing  
  
The way its meant to be  
Like in White Christmas year after year  
Bing Crosby Bring Crosby  
Are you listening to me  
  
It doesnt often snow at Christmas  
The way its meant to do  
But Ill still have a glow at Christmas  
Because Ill be with you  
  
The Christmas message was long ago lost  
Now its all about shopping and how much things cost  
Its meant to be goodwill as well as synthetic fun  
And what this is this years festive number one  
  
It doesnt often snow at Christmas  
The way its meant to do  
But Ill still have a glow at Christmas  
Because Ill be with you  
  
Neil Merry Christmas  
Chris And a happy new year
