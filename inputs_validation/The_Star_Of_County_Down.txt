Near Banbridge Town in the County Down  
One morning last July  
A boreen green came a sweet colleen  
And she smiled as she passed me by  
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet  
To the sheen of her nut brown hair  
Such a coaxing elf sure I shook myself  
For to see I was really there  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid Ive seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
As she onward sped sure I scratched my head  
And I looked with a feelin rare  
And I says says I to a passerby  
Whose the maid with the nut brown hair  
He smiled at me and he sayss sayss he  
Thats the gem of Irelands crown  
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of a Bann  
Shes the star of the County Down  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid Ive seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
At the Harvest Fair shell be surely there  
Ill dress in my Sunday clothes  
My shoes shone bright and my hat cocked  
Right for a smile from my nut brown rose  
No pipe Ill smoke no horse Ill yoke  
Till my plough turns rust colored brown  
Till a smiling bride by my own fireside  
Sits the star of the County Down  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid Ive seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid Ive seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down
