Heres another Sunday morning call  
Yer hear yer headabanging on the door  
Slip your shoes on and then out you crawl  
Into a day that couldnt give you more  
But what for  
  
And in your head do you feel  
What youre not supposed to feel  
You take what you want  
But you wont get it for free  
You need more time  
cause your thoughts and words wont last forever more  
But Im not sure if it ever works out right  
But its ok Its all right  
  
When yer lonely and you start to hear  
The little voices in your head at night  
You will only sniff away the tears  
So you can dance until the morning light  
At what price
