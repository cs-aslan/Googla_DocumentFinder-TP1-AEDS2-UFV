Used to be my pleasure  
When Id wake up in the morning  
Just to open my eyes and see you  
Just to find you were lying there  
But mornings now they seem to be an everyday affair  
Im just a picture in the memory of your mind  
  
All I ever wanted  
Every dream that Ive ever cherished  
Was to share in a kind of magic  
That only lovers ever share  
All you ever offered me  
Was the moment then and there  
Im just a picture in your mind  
  
I used to want you oh how badly did I want you  
I could not stand the hunger  
I used to stay awake at night and think of nothing but you  
And when I would awake to find you lying there beside me  
It made me so damn happy  
I couldnt satisfy my craziness for you  
  
Now the spell is broken  
And my dreams theyve all turned to ashes  
But I still have a love for living  
By loving you Ive only just begun  
Love is never easy when its given just by one  
Im just a picture in your mind  
  
I used to want you oh how badly did I want you  
I could not stand the hunger  
I used to lie awake at night and think of nothing but you  
And when I would awake to find you lying there beside me  
It made me so damn happy babe  
I couldnt satisfy my craziness for you  
  
Found a few more answers  
And Im ready for tomorrow  
But I still have to stop and wonder  
If Ive learned anything from what weve done  
Love is never easy when its given just by one  
Im just a picture in your mind  
Picture in your mind
