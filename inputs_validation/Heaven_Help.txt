There comes a time  
To be free of the heart  
I want to be ready  
Ready to start  
  
On a love journey  
Got places to go  
Made up my mind  
And I have got to let you know  
  
Heaven help the heart  
That lets me inside  
Heaven help the one  
Who comes in my life  
  
Heaven help the fool  
That breaks through my door  
Cause I decided right now  
Im ready for love  
  
A funny feelings coming  
Over me  
Now Im inspired and open to being  
In a love place  
  
But its out of my hands  
Im telling you baby that you got to understand  
  
Heaven help the heart  
That lets me inside  
Heaven help the one  
Who comes in my life  
  
Heaven help the fool  
That breaks though my door  
Cause I decided right now  
Im ready for love  
Ready for love  
  
I cant see whats out there for me  
And I know love offers no guarantee  
Ill take a chance and Im  
Telling you something babe  
I got to let you know  
  
Heaven help the heart  
That lets me inside  
Heaven help the one  
Who comes in my life  
  
Heaven help the fool  
That breaks through my door  
Cause I decided right now  
Im ready for love  
  
Ready for love  
Take a chance  
Take the chance on love  
The heart the fool
