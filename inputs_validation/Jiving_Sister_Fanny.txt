Jivin Sister Fanny told her man from  
Philadelphia PA uh huh huh huh  
He tore down the station said she didnt  
Like the way we played uh huh huh huh  
If you got a favorite guy get you babe real no why  
Man from you down inside got it feathered by the while  
Ooh child you got me walkin down the  
Broad highway uh huh huh huh  
Now Jivin Sister Fanny got  
The brain of a dinosaur uh huh huh huh  
Well she hocked my fancy mother  
And she hocked my electric guitar  
Then shes waitin in the store  
Tell her to wait er waitin for glad shes on the waiting good  
By Charles oh watch er you wait good  
Ooh child you got me walkin down the broad highway
