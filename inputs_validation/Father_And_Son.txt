Its not time to make a change just relax and take it easy  
Youre still young thats your fault  
Theres so much you have to know  
Find a girl settle down if you want you can marry  
Look at me I am old but Im happy  
  
I was once like you are now and I know that its not easy  
To be calm when youve found something going on  
But take your time think a lot  
Why think of everything youve got  
For you will still be here tomorrow but your dreams may not  
  
How can I try to explain when I do he turns away again  
Its always been the same the same old story  
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen  
Now theres a way and I know that I have to go away  
I know I have to go  
  
Its not time to make a change just sit down and take it slowly  
Youre still young thats your fault  
Theres so much you have to go through  
Find a girl settle down if you want you can marry  
Look at me I am old but Im happy  
  
All the times that I cried keepin all the things I knew inside  
Its hard but its harder to ignore it  
If they were right Id agree but its them you know not me  
Now theres a way and I know that I have to go away  
I know I have to go
