Im glad to see the scene working so tight  
A positive commitment we made to unite  
But theres still one thing that bothers me the most  
The rest of this world just isnt this close  
End in sight We must fight Crucial times  
Theres a youth crisis  
You better start to care  
Hundreds of kids going nowhere  
So many kids not in the scene  
Lets spread our message  
Tell them what we mean
