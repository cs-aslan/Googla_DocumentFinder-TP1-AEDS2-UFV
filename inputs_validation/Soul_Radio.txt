No one knows the way  
Which way the wind is gonna blow my mind  
Another day has slipped away  
And I have wasted so much time goes by  
  
I feel like Im floating out in space  
I no longer see your face  
And your voice is breaking  
Over my soul radio  
  
You and I we scream we cry  
We just cant seem to see things eye to eye  
Who knows why were here were gone  
I get so lost I cannot see the sky  
  
I feel like Im floating out in space  
I no longer see your face  
And your voice is breaking  
Over my soul radio  
Now youre fading out of view  
Theres no me and theres no you  
Only white noise static  
Over my soul radio  
  
And I feel like Im floating out in space  
I no longer see your face  
And your voice is breaking  
Over my soul radio  
Now youre fading out of view  
Theres no me and theres no you  
Only white noise static  
Over my soul radio
