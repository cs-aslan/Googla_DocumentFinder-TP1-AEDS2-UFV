Am I leaving you tomorrow  
I cant see  
Is this how its going to be  
In the morning must I go  
So lets take a little time  
See whats on your mind  
Is there something I should know  
  
I thought we went through all this yesterday  
You said you were OK  
You just had to take it slow  
Im tired of these little games you play  
Are you here to stay  
Is there something I should know  
  
Chorus  
Is there something I should know  
  
I think everything weve seen  
It was just a dream  
How did we get so low  
To leave it all behind would be obscene  
Wheres your selfesteem  
Is there something I should know  
  
Chorus  
  
We can keep on talking  
You know Ive got all night  
But dont keep telling me  
That everythings all right  
Its not all right  
  
Im leaving you tomorrow  
Cant you see  
This is how its got to be  
In the morning I must go  
So lets take a little time  
See whats on your mind  
Is there something I should know  
  
Chorus
