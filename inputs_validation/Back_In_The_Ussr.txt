Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC  
Didnt get to bed last night  
On the way the paper bag was on my knee  
Man I had a dreadful flight  
Im back in the USSR  
You dont know how lucky you are boy  
Back in the USSR  
  
Been away so long I hardly knew the place  
Gee its good to be back home  
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case  
Honey disconnect the phone  
Im back in the USSR  
You dont know how lucky you are boy  
Back in the USSR  
  
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out  
They leave the West behind  
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout  
That Georgias always on my mind  
  
Im back in the USSR  
You dont know how lucky you are boys  
Back in the USSR  
  
Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south  
Take me to your daddys farm  
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out  
Come and keep your comrade warm  
Im back in the USSR  
You dont know how lucky you are boys  
Back in the USSR
