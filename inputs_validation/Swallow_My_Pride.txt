She looked at me with dignity  
She said theres something you gotta see  
Even though this countrys headed for war  
This nation is prouder than ever before  
  
Yeah that was spirit in the air  
Were more American than anywhere  
And I just smile cause I could tell  
This little girl was going to  
Hell  
  
Now I wouldnt mind  
If you swallowed my pride  
Make me feel alright  
Yeah now deep inside  
Feel alright  
  
Hey all the warmth in her heart  
Couldnt keep my blood from running cold  
Cause I fell for her looks  
Now I want to go for her throne  
I tried to tell her a thousand times  
But little girl didnt understand at all  
  
Now I wouldnt mind  
If you swallow my pride  
Make me feel alright  
Yeah now deep inside  
Feel alright  
  
Alright  
You can swallow my pride  
  
Now I wouldnt mind  
If you swallowed my pride  
Make me feel alright deep inside  
Feel alright  
Pride pride pride  
You can swallow my pride
