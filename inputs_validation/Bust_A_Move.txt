This heres a tale for all the fellas  
Try to do what those ladies tell us  
Get shot down cause youre over zealous  
Play hard to get an females get jealous  
OK smartie go to a party  
Girls are skantilly clad and showin body  
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her  
But youre standin on the wall like you was Poindexter  
New movies showin so youre goin  
Could care less about the five youre blowin  
Theater gets dark just to start the show  
When you spot a fine woman sittin in the front row  
Shes dressed in yellow she says Hello  
Come sit next to me you fine fellow  
You run over there without a second to loose  
And what comes next hey bust a move  
  
If you want it baby youve got it repeat  
Just bust a move  
If you want it baby youve got it repeat  
  
Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry  
In five days from now hes gonna marry  
Hes hopin you can make it there if you can  
Cause in the ceremony youll be the best man  
You say neato check your libido  
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo  
The bride walks down just to start the wedding  
And theres one more girl you wont be getting  
So you start thinkin then you start blinkin  
A bride maid looks and thinks that youre winkin  
She thinks youre kinda cute so she winks back  
And now youre feelin really fine cus the girl is stacked  
Receptions jumpin bass is pumpin  
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin  
Says she wants to dance to a different groove  
Now you know what to do just bust a move  
  
If you want it baby youve got it  
If you want it baby youve got it  
Just bust a move  
If you want it baby youve got it  
If you want it baby youve got it
