Theyre working while Im missing you those healing hands of time  
And soon theyll be dismissing you from this heart of mine  
Theyll lead me safely through the night and Ill follow as though blind  
My future tightly clutched within those healing hands of time  
They let me close my eyes just then those healing hands of time  
And soon theyll let me sleep again those healing hands of time  
So already Ive reached mountain peaks and Ive just begun to climb  
Ill get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time  
Ill get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time
