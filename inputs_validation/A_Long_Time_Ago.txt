I dont look the way the average cowboy singer looks  
Ill admit Ive taken things I never should of took  
You can read a different story in a lot of different books  
But even then you wont really know  
How it was a long time ago  
  
Women have been my trouble since I found out they werent men  
In spite of that I stopped and took a wife now and then  
They built their fences high but they couldnt hold me in  
I was born with a fire down below  
And I learned to fly a long time ago  
  
Dont ask me about the years I spent out in the rain  
About the ones I spent in love or the ones I spent insane  
Dont ask me who I gave my seat to on that plane  
I think you already know  
I told you that a long time ago  
  
Me and ol Willie lordy weve been sold and bought  
I guess you all heard about some kind of system that we fought  
We aint the only outlaws just the only ones they caught  
They tried to run us off but Willies slow  
I quit running a long time ago
