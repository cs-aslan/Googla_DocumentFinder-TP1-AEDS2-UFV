Each time you hurt me you say youre sorry  
I try to understand and say OK  
But there must be an end to understanding  
And the end of mine cant be too far away  
  
I try to understand that youre only human  
And we all make mistakes every day  
But there must be an end to understanding  
And I know that I just cant go on this way  
  
Dont you know that love and understanding go together  
Ask too much of one and both will die  
And there must be an end to understanding  
And I know someday Ill reach the end of mine  
  
Dont you know that love and understanding go together  
Ask too much of one and both will die  
And there must be an end to understanding  
And I know someday Ill reach the end of mine
