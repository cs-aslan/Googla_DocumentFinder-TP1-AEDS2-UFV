Nothin to do in this lonely town  
Your daddy warned me Son you come around  
Says I aint good enough for you  
He dont know what Im goin through  
  
Lets do something  
Sneak out your bedroom window girl  
And well be gone  
Lets do something  
Oh baby lets do something  
Even if its wrong  
  
Go see the preacher cross the couty line  
For 25 dollars he could make you mine  
My hearts on fire cant you feel it burn  
Im past the point of no return  
  
Lets do something  
Sneak out your bedroom window girl  
And well be gone  
Lets do something  
Oh baby lets do something  
Even if its wrong  
  
Ill make your daddy understand  
Oh Lord I know I can make him understand  
Ill face your daddy man to man  
No guts no glory girl Ill take that chance  
  
Lets do something  
Sneak out your bedroom window girl  
And well be gone  
Lets do something  
Oh baby lets do something  
Even if its wrong  
  
Lets do something  
Sneak out your bedroom window girl  
And well be gone  
Lets do something  
Oh baby lets do something  
Even if its wrong
