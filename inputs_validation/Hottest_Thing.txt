Ive been looking at you  
Turning brothers down  
Some got their song  
Well its time for me to holla now  
Your body is calling dont fight it  
Ooh I like it  
  
Youre dancing all alone  
Whats that all about  
Youre so fine  
But its time for me to call you out  
Watch out Ill straight run up on ya  
Girl I want ya  
  
Youre the hottest thing  
In the club tonight  
Having visions of making love tonight  
With you constantly  
To the break dawn  
We can shake the spot  
If you say its on  
  
Dancing so close  
Got me up like whoa  
Were doing the most  
Is living with you possible  
Your body is saying you want to  
And I want you oh baby  
More than you know sugar  
If only for one night  
Ill make you feel  
Like youve been to paradise  
Its all up to you  tell me something baby  
I know one thing  
  
Youre the hottest thing  
In the club tonight  
Having visions of making love tonight  
With you constantly  
To the break dawn  
We can shake the spot  
If you say its on  
  
Youre the hottest thing  
In the club tonight  
Having visions of making love tonight  
With you constantly  
To the break dawn  
We can shake the spot  
If you say its on  
  
Baby tell me  
Whats on your mind  
Do you think that Im being too forward  
Oh baby by coming at you this way  
I cant help myself youre  
  
Youre the hottest thing  
In the club tonight  
Having visions of making love tonight  
With you constantly  
To the break dawn  
We can shake the spot  
If you say its on
