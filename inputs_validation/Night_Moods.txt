CHORUS  
Night moods I love your night moods  
Night moods Youve got the right moods  
When youre lying here beside me  
Ooh you take my breath away  
Baby I feel such love inside me  
Im so glad youre going to stay  
Night moods night moods  
Got a need as deep as a canyon  
Im so glad I found my soul companion  
I love your night moods  
Im in the right mood  
I love your night moods  
Night time is the right time  
Night time is the one time Im loving you  
Loving you  
All day long Im thinking of  
And I just cant wait til the sun goes down  
I cant help it how I love it  
Count the moments til you come round  
Night moods night moods  
Aint no use in talkin about it  
All I know is that I cant live without it  
I love your night moods  
Im in the right mood  
I love your night moods  
Night time is the right time  
Right now is the one time Im close to you  
Close to you  
Got a need as deep as a canyon  
Im so glad I found my soul companion  
Night moods I love your night moods  
Night moods I love it I love it I love it I love it at night  
Night moods I love it I love it I love it I love it at night  
Night moods I love it I love it I love it I love it at night  
Night moods I love it I love it I love it I love it at night
