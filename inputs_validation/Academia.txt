You can be my alphabet  
And I will be your calculator  
And together well work out on the escalator  
  
I will time you as you run up to down  
And you will measure my footsteps as I pleasure this town  
The mean of our heights is divided by the  
Nights  
Which is timed by the daggers in the root of all our fights  
  
The pass of your poem is to sway me in your knowing  
And the beauty of the word is that you dont have to show it  
  
Chorus  
Oh Academia you can pick me up soothe me with your words when I need your
love  
  
I am a dash and you are a dot when will you see that I am all that youve
got  
  
Im a binary code that you cracked long ago but to you Im just a novel that
you wish you never wrote  
  
Im greater than x and lesser than y  
  
So why is it that I still cant catch your eye  
  
Youre a cryptic crossword a song Ive never heard  
While Im sitting here drawing circles Im afraid of being hurt  
  
chorus  
  
Youre a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasion  
Will you listen to my proof or will you add another page on  
It appears to me the graph has come and stolen all the laughs  
It appears to me the pen is over analyzed again  
  
And if I am a number Im infinity plus one  
And if you are five words you are afraid to be the one  
And if you are a number youre infinity plus one  
And if Im four words then I am needing of your love  
  
chorus  
  
Oooh Academia Academia Academia  
Oooh Academia Academia Academia
