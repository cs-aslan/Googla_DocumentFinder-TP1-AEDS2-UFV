How do you describe a feeling  
Ive only ever dreamt of this  
  
Oh  
Djs spinning up my favorite song  
Hurry up and get a groove on  
Light fantastic and it wont be long  
Dont let the moment slip away  
  
Cause you and I could find a pleasure  
No one else has ever known  
Feels like it is now or never dont want to be alone  
  
How does it feel in my arms  
How does it feel in my arms  
Do you want it  
Do you need it  
Can you feel it  
Tell me  
How does it feel in my arms  
  
Got a feeling this is something strong  
All I wanna do is move on  
No more wondering where I belong  
So never go away  
  
Cause you and I are guilty pleasure  
No one else has ever known  
Feels like it is now or never dont want to be alone  
  
How does it feel in my arms How does it feel in my arms  
How does it feel in my arms  
Do you want it  
Do you need it  
Can you feel it  
Tell me  
How does it feel in my arms  
  
Im listening  
How does it feel in my arms How does it feel in my arms  
How does it feel in my arms Yeah yeah  
Do you want it  
Do you need it  
Can you feel it  
Tell me  
How does it feel in my arms
