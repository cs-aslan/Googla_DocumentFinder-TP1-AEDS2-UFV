Everywhere that I go  
I must tell everyone of the Savior I know  
And the things He has done  
Hes the truth and the life  
And theres no other way to the Father but by Him  
Long ago when He knew youd be out on a limb  
He gave His life for you cant you live yours for Him  
Hes the Almighty rock and you wont have a firm foundation  
Unless youre built on Him  
You cant live without Him  
You cant move without Him  
You cant breathe without Him  
You cant think about doing one thing without Him  
You cant do without Him  
Cause theres no you without Him  
Because Hes the only way  
The only way  
Theres no other name  
Than the name of Jesus  
Theres no one  
Than the one who frees us  
Theres no other way  
No other way  
What more can I say  
Hes the only only way  
The only way
