Shows  
  
This has been said so many times that Im not sure if it matters  
We never stood a chance  
And Im not sure if it matters  
If you are the shores I am the waves begging for big moons  
Im mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town  
  
I know this hurts it was meant to  
Your secrets out and the best part is it isnt even a good one  
And its mind over you dont matter  
  
This has been said so many times that Im not sure if it matters  
But it must be said again that all us boys are just screaming  
Into microphones for attention  
Because were just so bored  
I never knew that you would pick it apart oh  
Im falling apart to songs about hips and hearts  
  
I used to obsess over living  
Now I only obsess over you  
Tell me youd like boys like me better  
In the dark lying on top of you  
This has been said so many times that Im not sure if it matters
