I just dont know what to do tonight  
My head is aching as I drink and breathe  
Memory falls like cream in my bones moving on my own  
  
There must be something I can dream tonight  
The air is filled with the moves of you  
All the fire is frozen yet still I have the will ooh ah  
  
Trumpets violins I hear them in the distance  
And my skin emits a ray but I think its sad its much too bad  
That our friends cant be with us today
