Hey baby listen up  
Im not in love with you  
You keep runnin off at the mouth  
And someone else can scratch my back  
And I could care less about your legs  
I just want to see em walk all over me  
  
Im runnin out of patience  
And I aint gonna say it twice  
The world out there is downn dirty honey  
And I just hate to be nice  
  
So dont think about movin any closer baby  
Just forget about it  
You body may be a weapon on legs  
But hey Im not fallin for that  
Dont you get it Im not impressed at all  
I just want to see you crawl all over me  
  
Im runnin out of patience  
And I aint gonna say it twice  
The world out there is downn dirty honey  
And I just hate to be nice  
  
Dont you understand  
Dont you understand  
  
Tell me when your eyes say yes  
How can your lips say no  
A girl like you shouldnt be surprised  
Its just I hate to be nice  
  
Im runnin out of patience  
And I aint gonna say it twice  
The world out there is downn dirty honey  
And I just hate to be nice
