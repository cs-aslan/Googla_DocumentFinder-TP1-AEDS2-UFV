NICKELUS F  
Yo I wake up every morning shower gather my belongings  
Yo I wake up every morning shower gather my belongings  
Head to works I get some breakfast cause still a nigga yawning  
From the night before at the club I was up Im tryna live  
Only twenty two my nig bout to be twenty three ya dig  
  
Yo I wake up every morning shower gather my belongings  
Head to works I get some breakfast cause still a nigga yawning  
From the night before at the club I was up Im tryna live  
Only twenty two my nig bout to be twenty three ya dig  
Time dont wait for none of us thats why I gotta chase my dreams  
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth  
And be half the man my dad was I thank God he was in my life  
I realize how many   
Either I need to make this music work or move from the Earth  
Im preachin fire need a choir bout to take you all to church  
My congregation bombed the nation with this HIP HOP  
We in the race to fame blowin pass the PIT STOPS  
I heard the prize was some chicks and a WRIST WATCH  
And all you gotta do is go to jail or GET SHOT  
Yeah Nick cop but he aint never get popped  
How we gonna get pop fans Give em a quick shot  
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch  
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock  
Its kinda sick huh Ay Jay put it in the heart of Pickering  
And tell them niggas this is NICKS SPOT  
They dont keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked  
Saran wrap anthrax it make ya sick huh  
Im hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh  
  
  
CHORUS  
It aint as easy as it looks we go through some shit  
You cut us a check then we go through some hits  
Then you show us respect then well say you legit  
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM  
  
Im tryna get that cash then watch how tall it grows  
Soon as we get the ass we start callin em hos  
The concept you dont grasp Im guessin you too old  
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM  
  
DRAKE  
Ayo I stay up every evening write that shit that they believe in  
DJs run it they approach me and its praise I be receiving  
From the night befo at the club fake ID my record spins  
Got me dancin right outside since these niggas wont let me in  
Well guess again slip around the back and get it crackin  
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane   
Hundred grand Nickle F that niggas the next to win  
Virgina go rep for him and Memphis represent for me  
To the tenth 10 degree Tennekey T Dot to the country yall  
Orangemen and White Haven an back up north to Montreal  
I aint ashamed my city aint on the map  
 Light that fire realize they aint born to rap  
 Pass the torch and sell they soul   
Maybe they can bring they career back  
But these niggas right here aint tryna hear that  
Cause Im on set make it work break even on 9 to 5s  
Cigarettes and lotto tickets tryna keep that grind alive  
All my uncles they hit the casino when they get they check  
My cousins they paint they  to get respect  
This cant be life dominoes and  dro and twenty stacks  
  
  
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap  
You think its funny till these youngings suck a bunny  
Pull the jack rabbit out and get to screamin where the money at  
  
CHORUS  
It aint as easy as it looks we go through some shit  
You cut us a check then we go through some hits  
Then you show us respect then well say you legit  
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM  
  
Im tryna get that cash then watch how tall it grows  
Soon as we get the ass we start callin em hos  
The concept you dont grasp Im guessin you too old  
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
