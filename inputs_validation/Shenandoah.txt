The Missouri shes a might riverAway you rolling river  
The red mans camp lies on her bordersAway were bound away across the wide  
Missouri a white man loved an Indian maidenAway you rolling river  
With notions sweet his canoe was ladenAway were bound away across the wide  
  
Missouri Shenandoah I love your daughterAway you rolling river  
Ill take her cross the rolling waterAway were bound away across the wide  
Missouri the chief disdained the traders dollarsAway you rolling river  
My daughter never you shall followAway were bound away across the
wideMissouri  
  
At last there came a Yankee skipperAway you rolling river  
He winked his eye and he tipped his flipper  
Away were bound away across the wideMissouriHe sold the chief that fire
water  
Away you rolling river and cross the river he stole his daughter  
  
Away were bound away across the wideMissouriO Shenandoah I long to hear you  
Away you rolling riverAcross the wide and rolling water  
Away were bound away across the wideMissouri
