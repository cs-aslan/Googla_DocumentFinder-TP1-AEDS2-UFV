I cant believe what youre saying about me  
I cant believe its true  
You know you never should doubt me and take this attitude  
You say Theres somethin between us  
That something just aint right  
But every time I ask you to tell me why  
You say Its not the moment  
You say Its not the moment  
You say youre tired of walking on eggshells and falling in between  
That Im two timing you but you know quite well thats just not my scene  
An now my friends are starting to call me  
They say Theres somethin wrong  
Ah but you just continue to stall me  
You say Its not the moment  
You say Its not the moment  
Ya we need to talk this through  
I do depend on you  
So let it out and try to clear the air  
Ive got nothing I should hide  
Im burning up inside  
But you just act like you dont even care  
Oh well I know sometimes it aint easy  
I know youre feeling bad  
But you know its the wrong time to tease me  
It just gets me mad  
Im goin to find out sooner or later  
Just what youre tryin to say  
So when I ask you now for just one more time  
Dont say Its not the moment  
Dont say Its not the moment  
Ya we need to talk this through  
I do depend on you  
So let it out and try to clear the air  
Ive got nothing I should hide  
Im burning up inside  
But you just act like you dont even care  
I told you I would be your friend  
Be there to the very end  
And then you had to let me down  
And go spreading dirty words around
