Id like to be somebody else and not know where Ive been  
Id like to build myself a house out of plasticine  
Shake along with me  
Ive been driving in my car with my friend Mr Soft  
  
Mr Clean and Mr Ben are living in my loft  
Shake along with me  
Im sorry but I just dont know  
I know I said I told you so  
  
But when youre happy and youre feeling fine  
Then youll know its the right time  
Its the right time  
To shake along with me  
  
Mister Sifter sold me songs  
When I was just sixteen  
Now he stops at traffic lights  
But only when theyre green
