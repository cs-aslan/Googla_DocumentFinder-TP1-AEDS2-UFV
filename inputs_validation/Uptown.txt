Yeah uh huh  
  
Uh hardly home but always reppin  
You hardly on and always second  
When Im awake you always restin  
And when they call you the answer you will hardly question  
I Im doin classic shit in all my sessions  
Other niggas situations they are all depressin  
Thats why I never follow yall suggestions  
I just always did my own thing  
Now I run the game you stupid muddasuckas  
I see all this money through my Ohio State buck eyes  
Shit been goin good but good can turn to better  
Cause you the type to lose her and Im about to get her  
  
Chorus  
Its okay  
Its okay  
Its okay  
Its okay  
Its okay  
Its okay  
You can run an tell your friends that  
Im on  
Im on  
Im on  
Im on  
Im on  
Im on  
Best believe I understand  
Its okay  
Its okay  
Its okay  
Its okay  
Its okay  
Its okay  
You can run an tell my city  
Im on  
Im on  
Im on  
Im on  
Im on  
Im on  
You can run an tell my city its on  
  
Yeah wrong way down a one way  
Women dont get saved round me even on a Sunday  
Damn where I get it from these niggas always wonder who  
Then they meet my pop and tell em Drake is just a younger you  
And shawty wanna party so dont let yo girl up out the house  
Or therell be shots on TMZ of me givin her mouthtomouth  
Now shes famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her  
I drive two black cars I named em Malcom X an Martin Luther  
I dont ever play but Im in the game lady  
They just loose to love those are tennis games lady  
Have you countin money goin duffle bag crazy  
Sippin on Pink Floyd an puffin Wayne Brady  
Damn whos line is it anyways  
Im in a daze you been amazed  
Yall seem to be stuck on that beginner stage  
Im on fire yup Ive been a blaze  
I got dough to blow but I wanna blow it right  
You look nice and yo frame makes me wanna bowl a strike  
Well alright guess I might know what Fuck it yes I will  
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin less than real  
Put it to you like  
  
Chorus  
  
Bun B King of the Trill also one of the dopest  
Whether the streets or on the mic Im dope and yes Im focused  
That gangsta recognize me for my locc ness no joke its  
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus  
Or maybe like a python thats the type a shit Im on  
I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this iBomb  
I palm the game like its a Splading ball and take flight  
From the free throw line and slam it down like Im the great Mike  
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this goin be a great night  
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white  
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right  
Stupid animal tricks like David Lettermans Late Night  
This that major moment youve been waitin on for too long  
The best that ever did it an doin it on a new song  
UGK an Young Money too strong  
Bound to be in the green like a crouton  
So what the fuck is you on  
  
Chorus  
  
I am the leather jacket black glasses AllAmerican bad boy  
I own the swagger supermarket an you you just a bag boy  
Cause I got that swag boy the swag you never had boy  
Hate an I will leave ya chest the color of my flag boy  
Soo woo bitch I do this shit Ill erase you like I drew you bitch  
An I keep that toaster you can come an be my strudel bitch  
Im so uptown and motherfucker look at Wayne  
Dont go uptown yeah  
And now Im on this rock shit  
But why they let me in Im a start shootin in a mosh pit ha ha  
Fuck is you talkin bout Weezy in ya mouth now  
Weezy whatchu talkin bout  
Young mula baby  
  
Chorus
