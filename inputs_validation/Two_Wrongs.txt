Im just sittin here playin the guitar  
  
City Highii  
Claudette and Clef  
  
Excuse me if you see me screamin  
But deep in my mind  
Im only dreamin  
Cuz if I wake girl and youre  
Not by my side  
I feel like half of me  
Is no longer alive  
So please shorty  
Before you walk out that door boopy  
Would you listen to my song  
  
If only Id give you one last chance One last chance  
With the devil you can no longer dance  
Youve got to be faithful  
So we can be fruitful  
Build a family and follow Gods destiny  
So just before I run to the block Papi  
I might listen to your song  
  
Ooh before you walk out that door  
Listen  
  
They say two wrongs dont make it right  
Dont make it right  
So if Im wrong I aint tryin to fight  
Im tryin to have some dinner with some candlelight  
Lay up in the bed and make love all night  
So papi I wont leave baby Ill just stay  
But promise me that youll do the same  
Girl Ima love you like I never loved you  
Touch me like you never touched me  
Girl if you give me the chance  
Girl Im gonna show you  
  
Now baby understand  
That I forgive you  
But I aint gonna forget  
That you brought me regret  
  
Baby baby baby baby  
But I have grown  
From a thug to a man  
Built my castle with bricks  
And no longer with sand  
  
And just before I run to the block baby  
I might listen to your song  
  
Ooh before you walk out that door  
Listen  
  
They say two wrongs dont make it right  
Dont make it right  
So if Im wrong I aint tryin to fight  
Im tryin to have some dinner with some candlelight  
Lay up in the bed and make love all night  
So papi I wont leave baby Ill just stay  
But promise me that youll do the same  
Girl Ima love you like I never loved you  
Touch me like you never touched me  
Girl if you give me the chance  
Girl Im gonna show you  
  
Im so used to the pain that I  
Cant see the sunshine no more  
Im so used to the pain that the  
Love sickness feels like the cure  
  
But if only you gave me  
The keys to your soul and let me in  
Im gonna love you over  
Over  
And over over again  
Yea yea yea yea yea yea yea  
  
They say two wrongs dont make it right  
Dont make it right  
So if Im wrong I aint tryin to fight  
Im tryin to have some dinner with some candlelight  
Lay up in the bed and make love all night  
So papi I wont leave baby Ill just stay  
But promise me that youll do the same  
Girl Ima love you like I never loved you  
Touch me like you never touched me  
Girl if you give me the chance  
Girl Im gonna show you  
  
I aint gonna stand on the block no more  
Im gonna come home early girl I promise
