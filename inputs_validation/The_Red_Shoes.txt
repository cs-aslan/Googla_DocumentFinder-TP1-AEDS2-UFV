Oh she move like the Diva do  
I said Id love to dance like you  
She said just take off my red shoes  
Put them on and your dreamll come true  
With no words with no song  
You can dance the dream with your body on  
And this curve is your smile  
And this cross is your heart  
And this line is your path  
  
Oh its gonna be the way you always thought it would be  
But its gonna be no illusion  
Oh its gonna be the way you always dreamt about it  
But its gonna be really happening to ya  
Really happening to ya  
Really happening to ya  
  
Oh the minute I put them on  
I knew I had done something wrong  
All her gifts for the dance had gone  
Its the red shoes they cant stop dancing  
And this curve is your smile  
And this cross is your heart  
And this line is your path  
  
Oh its gonna be the way you always thought it would be  
But its gonna be no illusion  
Oh its gonna be the way you always dreamt about it  
But its gonna be really happening to ya  
  
She gotta dance she gotta dance  
And she cant stop till them shoes come off  
These shoes do a kind of voodoo  
Theyre gonna make her dance till her legs fall off  
  
Feel your hair come tumbling down  
Feel your feet start kissing the ground  
Feel your arms are opening out  
And see your eyes are lifted to God  
With no words with no song  
Im gonna dance the dream  
And make the dream come true  
Im gonna dance the dream  
And make the dream come true  
  
She gotta dance she gotta dance  
And she cant stop till them shoes come off  
These shoes do a kind of voodoo  
Theyre gonna make her dance till her legs fall off  
Call a doctor call a priest  
Theyre gonna whip her up like a helicopter  
  
Really happening to ya  
Really happening to ya  
  
You gotta dance
