If I was Washington  
valleys would I forge for  
If I was a fat man  
fun would I gorge for  
If I was gingus  
gold would I horde for  
Wish I had a dollar a day  
  
If I was a gouger  
gouge would I wish for  
If I was a fisherman  
fish would i fish for  
If I was a french whore  
frenchies Id dish for  
Wish I had a dollar a day  
  
Turkeys are for flyin  
chickens are for eatin  
Im all for fun  
funs forbidden  
forbiddens forgotten  
and forgottens for gettin  
I wish I had a dollar a day  
  
Buzzards are for circling  
circles are for heroes  
Heroes for floatin  
fiddles to Nero  
Fingers for countin  
numbers for zero  
Wish I had a dollar a day  
  
If I was Washington  
valleys would I forge for  
If I was a fat man  
fun would I gorge for  
If I was gingus  
gold would I horde for  
Wish I had a dollar a day  
  
If I was Washington  
Id wear wood teeth  
If I was a policeman  
Id walk me a stone beat  
If I was a singer  
Id stop right now  
I wish I had a dollar a day
