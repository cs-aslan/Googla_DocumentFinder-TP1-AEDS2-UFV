I never meant to hurt you  
But knew I someday would  
Its like I built myself a cabin  
With matches between the wood  
And Ill be damned if I am happy  
And you will pay the price  
Strong becomes the liar  
When he believes his own advice  
  
Bridge  
Ive got this one beat  
Ive got this one beat  
Rain come fall on me  
  
Chorus  
Baby  
From the fallout  
Hear me call out  
I got this one beat  
From the fallout  
Hear me call out  
I got this one beat  
  
Its empty in the open  
Days apart from you  
Ashes trace the skyline  
Of this burnout cabin too  
And Ill be damned if you forget me  
In this fire Ill save your place  
And keep it cool while I think of you  
In the smoke I see your face  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
In the fallout  
The fallout Repeat x3  
In the fallout  
  
Is this how its gonna be  
Bending daylight here with me  
You know the aftermath  
Is hard than it seems  
Is this how its got to be  
In the fallout x2  
The fallout yeah  
Im alone in the fallout yeah  
  
They say the sky is falling  
Are the angels coming too  
Im gonna catch em if they come  
Catch em as they fall  
Climb on top this tower  
Get me closer to the sky  
Ill bring my memories back  
Save em all for you  
  
In the fallout  
The fallout Repeat x3  
  
You can hear me call out  
From that fallout  
You can hear me call  
Save me save me from the enemy  
Come save me save me from these broken things  
  
The fallout
