Funny a woman can come on so wild and free  
Yet insist I dont watch her undress or watch her watch me  
And stand by the bed and shiver as if she were cold  
Just to lie down beside me and touch me as if I were gold  
  
One night of love dont make up for six nights alone  
Id rather have one than none Lord Im flesh and bone  
Though sometimes it seems she aint worth the trouble at all  
She could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all  
  
Right or wrong a woman can own any man  
She can take him inside her and hold his soul in her hand  
Then leave him as weak and weary as a newborn child  
Fighting to get his first breath and open his eyes  
  
One night of love dont make up for six nights alone  
Id rather have one than none Lord Im flesh and bone  
Though sometimes it seems she aint worth the trouble at all  
She could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all
