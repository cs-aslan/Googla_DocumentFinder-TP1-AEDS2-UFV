Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man  
So we spell out the words we dont want him to understand  
Like TOwhy or maybe SyouarePareISE  
The words were hiding from him now tear the heart right out of me  
Our DIVOareseeE becomes final today me and little JOE will be going
away  
I love you both and this will be pure HE double L for me  
I wish that we could stop this DIVOareseeE  
Watch him smile he thinks its Christmas or his fifth birthday  
Cause he thinks seeyouSTODwhy spells fun or play  
I spell out all the hurting words and turn my head when I speak  
But I cant spell away this hurt thats dripping down my cheeks  
Our DIVOareseeE becomes final today  
I wish that we could stop this DIVOareseeE
