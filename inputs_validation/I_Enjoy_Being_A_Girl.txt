Im a girl and by me thats only great  
I am proud that my silhouette is curvy  
That I walk with a sweet and girlish gait  
With my hips kind of swivelly and swervy  
  
I adore being dressed in something frilly  
When my date comes to get me at my place  
Out I go with my Joe or John or Billy  
Like a filly who is ready for the race  
  
When I have a brand new hairdo  
With my eyelashes all in curl  
I float as the clouds on air do  
I enjoy being a girl  
  
When men say Im cute and funny  
And my teeth arent teeth but pearl  
I just lap it up like honey  
I enjoy being a girl  
  
I flip when a fellow sends me flowers  
I drool over dresses made of lace  
I talk on the telephone for hours  
With a pound and a half of cream upon my face  
  
Im strictly a female female  
And my future I hope will be  
In the home of a brave and free male  
Wholl enjoy being a guy having a girl Like Me  
  
When men say Im sweet as candy  
As around in a dance we whirl  
It goes to my head like brandy  
I enjoy being a girl  
  
When someone with eyes that smoulder  
Says he loves evry silken curl  
That falls on my ivry shoulder  
I enjoy being a girl  
  
When I hear the complimentry whistle  
That greets my bikini by the sea  
I turn and I glower and I bristle  
But I happy to know the whistles meant for me  
  
Im strictly a female female  
And my future I hope will be  
In the home of a brave and free male  
Wholl enjoy being a guy having a girl Like Me
