You said Youd never leave  
You said Youd never forsake me  
Time after time I see every little thing You do  
And all You say turns out to be for real  
And all Your promises come true  
Now I have all the things I need to live for You  
A faith thats unshakable  
A heart thats unbreakable  
Your truth that has set me free  
A love thats unchangeable  
A life thats available if I wouldve just believed  
Thats what You gave to me  
With every passing day  
You prove Youve stayed the same  
Its taken some time to see  
That I am the one whos changed  
Now I will never be the same  
Since Youve made me see  
You shower me with  
Every good thing that I can be  
From the moment that I first believed  
I was free and now  
You have given to me every good thing
