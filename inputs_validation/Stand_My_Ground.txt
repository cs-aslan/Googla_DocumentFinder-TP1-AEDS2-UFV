I can see  
When you stay low  
Nothing happens  
Does it feel right  
Late at night  
Things I thought Id put behind me  
Haunt my mind  
  
I just know theres no escape now  
Once it sets its eyes on you  
But I wont run  
Have to stare it in the eyes  
  
Stand my ground  
I wont give in  
No more denying  
Ive gotta face it  
Wont close my eyes and hide the truth inside  
If I dont make it someone else will  
Stand my ground  
  
Its all around  
Getting stronger coming closer into my world  
I can feel that its time for me to face it  
Can I take it  
  
Though this might just be the ending  
Of the life I held so dear  
But I wont run  
Theres no turning back from here  
  
Stand my ground  
I wont give in  
No more denying  
Ive gotta face it  
Wont close my eyes and hide the truth inside  
If I dont make it someone else will  
Stand my ground  
  
All I know for sure is that Im trying  
I will always stand my ground  
  
Stand my ground  
I wont give in I wont give in  
I wont give up I wont give up  
No more denying ah  
Ive gotta face it  
Wont close my eyes and hide the truth inside  
If I dont make it someone else will  
  
Stand my ground  
I wont give in  
No more denying  
Ive gotta face it  
Wont close my eyes and hide the truth inside  
If I dont make it someone else will  
Stand my ground
