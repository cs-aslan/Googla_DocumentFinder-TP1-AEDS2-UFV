Every word youre saying is a lie  
Run away my dear  
But every sign will say your heart is dead  
  
Bury all the memories  
Cover them with dirt  
Wheres the love we once had  
Our destinys unsure  
  
Why cant you see what we had  
Let the fire burn the ice  
Wheres the love we once had  
Is it all a lie  
  
And I still wonder  
Why heaven has died  
The skies are all falling  
Im breathing but why  
In silence I hold on  
To you and I  
  
Closer to insanity  
Buries me alive  
  
Wheres the life we once had  
It cannot be denied  
  
Why cant you see what we had  
Let the fire burn the ice  
Wheres the love we once had  
Is it all a lie  
  
And I still wonder  
Why heaven has died  
The skies are all falling  
Im breathing but why  
In silence I hold on  
To you and I  
  
You run away  
You hide away  
To the other side of the universe  
where youre safe from all that hunts you down  
But the world has gone  
Where you belong  
And it feels too late so youre moving on  
Can you find your way back home  
  
And I still wonder  
Why heaven has died  
The skies are all falling  
Im breathing but why  
In silence I hold on  
To you and I  
  
Every word youre saying is a lie
