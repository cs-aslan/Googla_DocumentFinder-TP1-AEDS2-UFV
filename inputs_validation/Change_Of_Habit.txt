If youre in old habits  
Set in your old ways  
Changes are acomin  
For these are changing days  
  
And if your head is in the sand  
While things are goin on  
What you need what you need  
What you need is a change of habit  
  
Now if youre in the habit  
To let your temper fly  
When you talk with people  
Who dont see eye to eye  
  
And if you dont believe it  
Theres a newer world ahead  
What you need what you need  
What you need is a change of habit  
  
A change of habit a change of outlook  
A change of heart youll be all right  
The halls of darkness  
Have doors that open  
Its never too late  
To see the light  
  
So if youre in the habit  
Of putting people down  
Just because theyre different  
From the wrong side of town  
  
Well dont count on any medals son  
Theyre pinning none on you  
What you need what you need  
What you need is a change of habit
