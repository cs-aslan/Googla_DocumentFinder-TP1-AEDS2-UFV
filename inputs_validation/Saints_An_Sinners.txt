Get ready for Judgment day  
An the final curtain call  
Dont lie when you testify  
Cause the good Lord know youre all  
  
Saints an sinners priests an thieves  
Saints an sinners priests an thieves  
  
When Moses stood on the Red Sea shore  
Laying the Law on the line  
He said dont come knocking  
On the Pearly Gates  
If all you did was have a real good time  
  
Saints an sinners priests an thieves  
Saints an sinners priests an thieves  
  
For what we are about to receive  
May the Lord make us truly thankful  
  
Saints an sinners  
  
I stand guilty of a thousand crimes  
An I suffer temptation still  
Show me a man who wont give it to his woman  
An Ill show you somebody who will  
  
Saints an sinners priests an thieves  
Saints an sinners priests an thieves  
  
For what we are about to receive  
May the Lord make us truly thankful  
  
Saints an sinners  
Saints an sinners priests an thieves  
  
Get ready for Judgment day  
An the final curtain call  
Dont lie when you testify  
cause the Good Lord know youre all
