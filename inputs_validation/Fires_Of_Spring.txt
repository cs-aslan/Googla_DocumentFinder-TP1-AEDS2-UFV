Shes back real late yet she dont seem to care  
She hangs around outside in late night air  
Burning tears upon a smiling face  
And shes caught in the fires of spring  
  
The ice of loneliness youve known so long  
For good or not seems to have been and gone  
Your Phoenix flies you high on crazy wings  
And youre caught in the fires of spring  
  
Youve been before but never been so fast  
Your only hope is that its gonna last  
You know the pain and yet you love its sting  
And youre caught in the fires of spring
