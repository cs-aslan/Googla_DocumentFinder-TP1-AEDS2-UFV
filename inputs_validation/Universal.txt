It doesnt matter if youre black or white  
Or the God that you choose to pray to  
It doesnt matter about the clothes you wear  
Or which creator made you  
We all bleed the same blood  
We all need the same love  
And when we die theres no heaven above  
Its universal its universal  
  
It doesnt matter who you think you are  
Youre living and you know you feel it  
Its not important as to why were here  
You know there is no reason  
  
We all bleed the same blood  
We all need the same love  
And when we die theres no heaven above  
Its universal its universal  
Its universal its universal  
We all bleed the same blood  
We all need the same love  
And when we die theres no heaven above  
Its universal its universal  
Its universal its universal
