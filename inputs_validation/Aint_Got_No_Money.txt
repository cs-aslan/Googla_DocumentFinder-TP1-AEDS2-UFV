Well Im looking for a woman  
About five foot six  
Who aint into glamour  
Shes just into kicks  
Just a sweet fashion lady  
Stepping dynamite  
Whos gonna take me for granted  
In the heat of the night  
Come on baby  
Dont run away  
Look here in my face  
Be it night or day  
I aint got no money  
But I sure got a whole lotta love  
Well Im walking down the street  
And my hearts feeling heavy  
Swaying with the beat  
Cause Im more than just ready  
Shes looking at me  
I can feel it in my bones  
Step right on up  
And Ill be taking you home  
Dont turn away  
Look here in my face  
Be it night or day  
I aint got no money  
But I sure got a whole lot of love  
A whole lot of love  
Well Im looking for a woman  
Whos looking for a man  
Whos looking for a time  
Like she aint ever had  
Just a sweet fashion lady  
Stepping dynamite  
Whos gonna take me for granted  
In the heat of the night  
Come on baby dont run away  
Look here in my face  
Be it night or day  
I aint got no money  
But I sure got a whole lotta love
