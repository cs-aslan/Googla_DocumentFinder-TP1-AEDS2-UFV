Im gonna love you like nobodys loved you  
Come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain deep as a river  
Come rain or come shine  
  
I guess when you met me  
It was just one of those things  
But dont you ever bet me  
Cause Im gonna be true if you let me  
  
Youre gonna love me like nobodys loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
Well be happy together unhappy together  
Now wont that be just fine  
  
The days may be cloudy or sunny  
Were in or out of the money  
But Im with you always  
Im with you rain or shine
