Im the desperate  
And youre the savior  
  
Theres been something else talkin in my ear  
Someone save me  
When I speak  
It begins to decay  
Im not about to bury myself  
Oh God my hands are shaking again  
Calm down  
Now I cant feel the floor  
And my vision takes its toll on me  
  
Im the desperate  
And youre the savior  
  
Oh God its racing through my veins  
Im afraid there must be some kind of mistake  
Oh Im in over my head again  
Reach in and grab a hold of me  
Im so scared that Ive started to slip  
They say that Ill never change  
Ill prove em wrong  
  
Its over  
  
I hear the calling but its passing through  
Clean me up show me how to live  
Tear me down  
Let me start again
