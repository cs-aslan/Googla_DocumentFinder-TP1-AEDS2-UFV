Tank top love handles  
Tube socks Jesus sandals  
Cheap blender ice bucket  
Raw oysters yeah give me one and shuck it  
  
Holds up a frozen orange daiquiri  
And laughs heres to the boys at the factory  
  
No more building transmissions  
Hes going deep sea fishing  
Catch a marlin catch a tan  
Catch a local cover band  
  
Hey you gotta watch that man  
Hell go coastal on ya  
  
Silver hair silver Buick  
Winters coming better move it  
Southbound before they get snowed under  
Call the kids tell em see you next summer  
  
No more freezing their tails off  
Its cataract sunglasses and a round of golf  
Red skin green plaid margarita dog track  
Before you know it Mom and Dad  
Theyll go coastal on ya  
  
Sounds so good got me thinking  
What do yall say after Im done singing  
  
We just take a little getaway  
Cruise it down the A1A  
Florabama to the Keys  
Better keep your eye on me  
  
Ill go coastal on ya  
Ill go coastal on ya  
Yeah Ill go coastal on ya
