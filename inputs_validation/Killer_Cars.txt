Too hard on the brakes again  
What if these brakes just give in  
What if they dont get out of the way  
What if theres someone overtaking  
Im going out for a little drive  
And it could be the last time you see me alive  
There could be an idiot on the road  
The only kick in life is pumping his steel  
  
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk  
Packed with foam and blind drunk  
They wont ever take me alive  
Cause they all drive  
  
Dont die on the motorway  
The moon would freeze the plants would die  
I couldnt cope if you crashed today  
All the things I forgot to say  
Im going out for a little drive  
And it could be the last time you see me alive  
What if the car loses control  
What if theres someone overtaking  
  
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk  
Packed with foam and blind drunk  
They wont ever take me alive  
Cause they all drive killer cars  
  
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk  
Packed with foam and blind drunk  
No they wont ever take me alive  
Cause they all drive killer cars  
They all drive killer cars  
They all drive killer cars
