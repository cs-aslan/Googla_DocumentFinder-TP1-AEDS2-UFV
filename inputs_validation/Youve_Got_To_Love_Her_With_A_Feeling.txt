Now if you wanna love that woman  
You love her with a thrill  
Cause a if you dont a some other man will  
Youve got to love her with a feeling  
Youve got to love her with a feeling  
Love her with a feeling man  
Or dont you love at all  
She shakes all over a when she walks  
She made a blind man see  
She made a dumb man talk  
You know she love me with a feeling  
A love me with a feeling  
Love me with a feeling baby  
Or dont you love at all  
The cops took her in  
How that woman didnt need no bail  
How she wiggled one time for the judge  
And the judge put the cops in jail  
You know you love me with a feeling  
A love me with a feeling  
Love me with a feeling baby  
Or dont you love at all
