Thick skin soft touch  
Heart of gold but its nanananot enough  
Forgiving arms the higher road  
Working hard but its nanananot enough  
You say Im not good enough Im not good enough  
But what you really mean is youre not good enough youre not good enough  
You cant deliver  
So you turn it around  
  
Chorus  
You didnt let me down  
You didnt tear me apart  
You just opened my eyes  
While breaking my heart  
You didnt do it for me  
Im not as dumb as you think you just made me cry  
While claiming that you love me  
You love me you love me  
You said you loved me but that I  
Im not good enough Im not good enough  
  
Stronghold but fun ride  
But roller coasters arent just nanananot enough  
I keep it in you wear me out  
This kind of love is nanananot enough  
Said Im just a sinking ship Im just a sinking ship  
But what that really means is you cant handle this you cant handle this  
You couldnt win so you turn it around  
  
Chorus  
  
Your love feels different its like a blow to the head with your compliments  
Your love hurts deeper  
Its like a brick in the sea and Im drowning with it  
  
Chorus  
  
So understand it means nothing when you say you love me  
When you say you love me  
When you say you love me  
You love me you love me  
  
You didnt let me down  
You didnt tear me apart  
You just opened my eyes  
While breaking my heart  
You didnt do it for me  
Im not as dumb as you think you just made me cry  
While claiming that you love me  
You love me you love me  
You know the truth is that  
Youre not good enough youre not good enough
