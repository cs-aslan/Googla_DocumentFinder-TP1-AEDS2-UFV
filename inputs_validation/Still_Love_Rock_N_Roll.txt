Ian Hunter  
  
Way back in the 50s  you never said a wrong word  
People were clean  people were mean  
Children should be seen but children should be not heard  
You learned to keep your mouth shut  you did what you were told  
But then one day the radio played the sound that wed all been waiting for  
The whole of our lives n  
  
I still love Rock n Roll  I play it every day  
Hummin along singin the song  
Its the only way  I know how to say whats on my mind  
  
I get up in the morning  put the kettle on the stove  
Tommy Steele croons a Guy Mitchell tune  
I never felt more like singin the blues  but if I had to choose  
You know I still love rock n roll  
I still love rock n roll let me hear ya  
  
I never been to Lubbock Texas or Memphis Tennessee  
I never washed dishes in Macon Georgia  
I wasnt half as good and I wasnt half as pretty as you  
But I still got the feelings  embedded in my soul  
A rebel armada  Kettering Granada  
It aint my fault that I never grew up  I got bitten by your bug  
And I still love rock n roll I still love rock n roll I still love rock  
  
I know what youre thinkin  its a little bit strange to you  
I know what youre thinkin  cause Im thinkin the same way too  
But oh those two little four letter words  theyre all you need to know  
Cause when it all comes down to it  I dont like the sound of it  
When you mess around with it  Im still in it for the thrill of it  
I know you tried to kill it but  
  
I still love rock n roll  I play it every day  
Hummin along  singin the songs  
Its the only way I know how to say whats on my mind  
  
I get up every morning  I put the coffee on the stove  
The computers gone  the turntables on  
I cant believe its 2001  God I must be knockin on  
But I still love rock n roll I still love rock n roll
