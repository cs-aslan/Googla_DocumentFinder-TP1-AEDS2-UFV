Ive heard it said my lovers look alike  
Could it be that I was looking for you  
They were cool but something wasnt right  
They had me fooled for a minute and then I saw the truth  
  
None of them got what it takes  
To be a future baby mama  
Gotta bend in the wind but dont break  
To keep your man  
  
Show me one of them and Ill make her mine  
With no more drama  
Future baby mama  
Ive heard it said that I wont treat you right  
U know that aint right babe  
But they aint sure because they dont know nothing about you  
U know what you want baby  
Youre too secure to ever want to fuss and fight  
Thats right  
  
Thats why your man never ever got a reason to doubt you  
Yeah I know you might be fine but Ive seen it all before  
Cinderella was a waste of time and oops shes out the door  
To build a house together the thing that matters more  
  
Is under the floor  
A strong foundation that last forever more  
I want to make you happy baby  
Oh yes  
Happier than happy itself  
Oh yes  
You know what  
  
If youll ever need a hand call me Ill help  
Because I got you anywhere you wanna go uh  
Oh yes  
Paris London Africa San Lucas Mexico you see  
  
I know what you want  
What every good woman wants  
A man so in love with you  
He cant help but to flaunt you  
Deep down I know what you want  
You want your girlfriends to hate you  
Because they cant get your man
