Its dark and eerie  
And its really late  
Come on kids dont hesitate  
Were going down to the underground  
Were going down were going down  
To the underground  
  
The Hades ladies are dressed to kill  
Dagger glares from Richard hell  
Tension heightening heating frightening  
Thunder rolls as fast as lightning  
  
If youve got the urge  
Come on lets submerge  
  
The subterranean is a bottomless pit  
The vinyl vultures are after it  
Molten lava sulfur vapors  
Smolder on to obliterate us  
  
If youve got the urge  
Come on lets submerge
