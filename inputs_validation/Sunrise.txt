You take away the breath I was keeping for sunrise  
You appear and the morning looks drab in my eyes  
And then again Ill turn down love  
Having seen you again  
Once more youll disappear  
My morning put to shame  
  
You take away the breath I was keeping for sunrise  
You appear and the morning looks drab in my eyes  
And then again Ill turn down love  
Having seen you again  
Once more youll disappear  
My morning put to shame  
  
Sometimes I fear that this will go on my life through  
Each day I spend in an echoed vision of you  
And then again Ill turn down love  
Remembering your smile  
My every day is spent  
Thinking of you all the while  
  
The times Ive let myself down  
My heads spinning round  
My eyes see only you  
The chances Ive lost  
Opportunities tossed  
Away and into the blue  
  
You take away the breath I was keeping for sunrise  
You appear and the morning looks drab in my eyes  
And then again Ill turn down love  
Having seen you again  
Then again youll disappear  
My morning put to shame
