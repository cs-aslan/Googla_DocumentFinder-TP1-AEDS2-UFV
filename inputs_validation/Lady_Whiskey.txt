Lady Whiskey such a sad sight stumblin as she walks  
She even hates herself sometimes  
Keep her clear for its Saturday night  
  
Drowns her sorrow eases her pain  
Waits for tomorrow when shell do the same again  
  
Lady Whiskeys got a man her man is just like her  
Tries to fit the key in the door  
When he comes home Saturday night  
  
Drowns his sorrow eases his pain  
Waits for tomorrow when hell do the same again  
  
Lady Whiskeys got a son got a daughter too  
Son dont play but the daughters on the way  
When she comes home Saturday night  
  
Lady Whiskey she gets sick when she goes downtown  
One day drinks gonna put her down  
She wont come home Saturday night
