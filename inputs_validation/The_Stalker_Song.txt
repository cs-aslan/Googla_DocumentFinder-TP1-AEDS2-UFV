Imagine me and you I do  
I think about you day and night  
Its only right to think about the girl I stalk  
Each day and night  
So happy together  
  
I dated you for just a week  
You dumped me and I cried real hard  
And still cant sleep  
So now Ill have to force you to come back to me  
So happy together  
  
I cant see me stalking nobody but you for all your life  
When youre with me baby the skies will be blue  
For all my life  
  
I call you up at 2 am  
I wake you and hang up the phone  
And do it again  
Thats what you get for goin out with other men  
So happy together  
  
I cant see me stalking nobody but you for all your life  
When youre with me baby the skies will be blue  
For all my life  
  
I see you you dont see me  
Im hidden with my telephoto lense up in the tree  
Youre walking and you look around suspiciously  
So happy together  
  
HeysugarI like your eyebrowsno no thats kinda lame  
I got it I got it Hey baby its me againsurprise Thats a good  
one I like that surprise haha  
  
Ive got your cat dont be alarmed  
As long as you come talk to me  
He wont be harmed  
Well go and get a bite to eat  
Ill come unarmed  
So happy togetherforever and everso happy together  
  
Get out of the tree with the cat in the air
