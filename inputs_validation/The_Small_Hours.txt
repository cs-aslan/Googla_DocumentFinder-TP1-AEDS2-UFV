Look out at the darkness and you will see  
Just call my name and Ill be there  
You cannot touch me you would not dare  
I am the chill thats in the air  
  
And I try to get through to you in my own special way  
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day aha  
  
Dark rivers are flowing back into the past  
You are the fish for which I cast  
And what of the future what is to be  
As the rivers flow into the sea  
  
And I try to get through to you in my own special way  
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day  
  
Do not take for granted powers out there  
Dont step into the demons lair  
Time is an illusion rising from time  
Steep is the mountain which we climb  
  
And I try to get through to you in my own special way  
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day
