The other family gets no sleep  
Somewhere down the love got to take and keep  
Think about the future nothing in the past  
God things never last  
  
Come on come on come on  
Take your love  
Get down get down get down  
Down the road  
  
It aint no lie  
Youre hurting  
And you dont know why  
No time to lose  
We get no time to lose  
No time to lose  
No time to lose  
  
Ever had the feeling somethings going wrong  
Hanging round a lover where you dont belong  
Waiting for a reason lookin for a clue  
But you know what you gotta do  
  
Come on come on come on  
Take your love  
Get down get down get down  
Down the road  
  
It aint no lie  
Youre hurting  
And you dont know why  
You got no time to lose  
We get no time to lose  
No time to lose  
No time to lose  
  
Your brothers at the bar  
Three girls in the car  
Your sisters on the telephone  
That aint low  
Your mothers going blue  
Your dad is going gray  
Theres nothing here for you to stay  
  
Come on come on come on  
Take your love  
Get down get down get down  
Get down that road get down you  
  
It aint no lie  
Youre hurting  
And you dont know why  
No time to lose  
No time to lose  
You gonna have to choose  
You go and shake the blues  
You got no time to lose  
You got to choose  
No time to lose
