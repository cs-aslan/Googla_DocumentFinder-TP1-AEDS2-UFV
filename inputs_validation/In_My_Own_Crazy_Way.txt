The mystery of you and me  
Is colored blue on blue  
We wanted more than we could give  
We couldnt see it through  
  
You wont believe these words from me  
But still theyre mine to say  
I will always love you  
In my own crazy way  
I tried to keep my sanity  
  
By being someone else  
Someone that you could hold on to  
I only fooled myself  
I knew the part but in my heart  
The role I couldnt play  
  
But I will always love you  
In my own crazy way  
I know I didnt do the little things  
That could make a womans heart sing forgive me  
And darling if I brought you any pain  
Im trying to explain  
  
In my heart I was always true  
The memories of you and me  
Are written on the wind  
And sometimes girl Id give the world  
To do it all again  
  
And if you need to call me  
I wont be far away  
I will always love you  
In my own crazy way
