Jodie wears a hat although it hasnt rained for six days  
She says a girl needs a gun these days  
Hey on account of all the rattlesnakes  
  
She looks like Eve Marie saint in on the waterfront  
She reads Simone de Beauvoir in her American circumstance  
  
Shes less than sure if her heart has come to stay in San Jose  
And her neverborn child still haunts her  
As she speeds down the freeway  
As she tries her luck with the traffic police  
Out of boredom more than spite  
She never finds no trouble she tries too hard  
Shes obvious despite herself  
  
She looks like Eve Marie Saint in on the waterfront  
She says all she needs is therapy yeah  
All you need is love is all you need  
  
Jodie never sleeps cause there are always needles in the hay  
She says that a girl needs a gun these days  
Hey on account of all the rattlesnakes  
  
She looks like Eve Marie Saint in on the waterfront  
As she reads Simone de Beauvoir in her American circumstance  
Her heart hearts like crazy paving  
Upside down and back to front  
She says ooh its so hard to love  
When love was your great disappointment
