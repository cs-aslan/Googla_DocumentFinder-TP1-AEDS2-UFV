Ive got ten thousand troubles a million woes  
Got grief in my soul nobody knows  
Ive got heartaches I got stingin water fallin out of the sky  
Ive got heartbreaks I got a long lost lover got a reason to die  
I got ten thousand troubles a million woes  
I got grief in my soul nobody knows  
I got sorrow Im in a storm thatll spare no travelin man  
I fear tomorrow got a love that died long before it began  
I got ten thousand troubles a million woes  
Got grief in my soul nobody knows  
I got ten thousand troubles a million woes  
Got grief in my soul nobody knows  
Ive got a cold chain I got rain fallin on my head from above  
Ive got a bad pain I got a gal dont know the meaning of love  
I got ten thousand troubles a million woes  
I got grief in my soul nobody knows  
Ive got heartaches I got stingin water fallin out of the sky  
Ive got heartbreaks I got a long lost lover got a reason to die  
I got ten thousand troubles a million woes  
I got grief in my soul nobody knows
