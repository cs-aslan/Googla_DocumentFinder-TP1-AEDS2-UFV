You stick to me when I wish you gone  
You hammer on my thoughts through dreams  
Your plot is thick with saucy schemes  
And ways to reach my balconies  
But I say Im not turned on by the way you look  
I say Im not turned on by the way you act  
Im not turned on when you tell me that you need me  
But sometimes just sometimes  
You can see the softness in my eyes  
And you know Its just not true  
  
Youre in my blood a Holy Ghost  
I scream but its a hollow plea  
The thoughts I swallow leave me thirsty  
You do a very fine imitation of me  
And I say Im not turned on by the way you laugh  
Im not turned on by the way you smile  
Im not turned on when you tell me that you love me  
But sometimes just sometimes  
You can see the softness in my eyes  
And you know its just not true  
  
And I say Im not turned on by the way you dance  
Im not turned on my the way you laugh  
Im not turned on when you need me  
But sometimes just sometimes  
You can see the softness in my eyes  
And you know its just not true
