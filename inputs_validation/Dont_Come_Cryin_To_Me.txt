Dont come cryin to me when its over  
Dont you come knockin at my door  
Dont come cryin to me I wont be waiting  
Like Ive done a hundred times before  
  
You promised youd love me forever  
Now its all over town youve changed your mind  
Youll call me and say lets get together  
But Im sorry I wont take you back this time  
  
Dont come cryin to me when its over  
Dont you come knockin at my door  
Dont come cryin to me I wont be waiting  
Like Ive done a hundred times before  
  
Like Ive done a hundred times before
