Lets move lets shake  
Lets bleed lets fake  
Lets go for broke  
Lets make mistakes  
Lets see lets win  
Lets pray lets cheat  
Lets have another dance  
Lets watch our feet  
  
Lets die in the arms  
Of the girls we love  
Lets sell our souls  
To the man above  
  
Lets move lets go  
Lets hop lets start  
Lets paint the town  
Lets break a few hearts  
Well run well shout  
Well thrash well cry  
But well never grow old  
And well never die  
  
Lying on a bed  
With apollo in my arms  
Doing everything we should  
And being killed by her charms  
  
Ive got apollo in my heart  
Shes tearing me apart  
She looks like an angel  
Held here in my arms  
Though I close my eyes  
And I turn away  
Im not letting go  
No not at this stage  
Because knowing is only half of it  
No matter what they say  
And seeing her is believing  
From miles and miles away  
Shes closed her eyes  
And shes turned away  
Shes letting go  
And I know shell say  
  
Lets die in the arms  
Of the girls we love  
Lets sell our souls  
To the man above
