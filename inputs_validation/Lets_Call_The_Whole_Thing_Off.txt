Things have come to a pretty pass  
Our romance is growing flat  
For you like this and the other  
While I go for this and that  
  
Goodness knows what the end will be  
Oh I dont know where Im at  
It looks as if we two will never be one  
Something must be done  
  
You say either and I say either  
You say neither and I say neither  
Either either neither neither  
Lets call the whole thing off  
  
You like potato and I like potahto  
You like tomato and I like tomahto  
Potato potahto tomato tomahto  
Lets call the whole thing off  
  
But oh if we call the whole thing off  
Then we must part  
And oh if we ever part then that might break my heart  
  
So if you like pyjamas and I like pyjahmas  
Ill wear pyjamas and give up pyajahmas  
For we know we need each other so we  
Better call the whole thing off  
Lets call the whole thing off  
  
You say laughter and I say larfter  
You say after and I say arfter  
Laughter larfter after arfter  
Lets call the whole thing off  
  
You like vanilla and I like vanella  
You saspiralla and I saspirella  
Vanilla vanella chocolate strawberry  
Lets call the whole thing off  
  
But oh if we call the whole thing of then we must part  
And oh if we ever part then that might break my heart  
  
So if you go for oysters and I go for ersters  
Ill order oysters and cancel the ersters  
For we know we need each other so we  
Better call the calling off off  
Lets call the whole thing off  
  
I say father and you say pater  
I saw mother and you say mater  
Pater mater uncle auntie lets call the whole thing off  
  
I like bananas and you like banahnahs

So if I go for scallops and you go for lobsters  
So all right no contest well order lobseter  
For we know we need each other so we  
Better call the calling off off  
Lets call the whole thing off
