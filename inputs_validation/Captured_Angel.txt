Found your heart  
And lost your lover  
Lick your wounds  
And run for cover  
  
Take your time  
Therell be another  
And dont make the same mistake twice  
Unless you can pay the price  
  
All the years  
You spent in growing  
End up one more  
Line youre towing  
Dont look now  
Your age is showing  
And its much too late  
To turn back  
You better pull in the slack  
  
Captured Angel  
Aching to make your break  
Your freedoms at stake  
You better fly now  
Fly now fly now  
While your wings are still young  
Your cage doors been flung  
Wide Open  
And Im hoping you see  
That theres a place beside me  
If you ever need it  
  
Sold your dreams  
For sweet salvation  
Left with righteous indignation  
Now it seems that you face starvation  
And nourishment doesnt come cheap  
You better go back to sleep  
  
Captured Angel  
Aching to make your break  
Your freedoms at stake  
You better fly now  
Fly now fly now  
While your wings are still young  
Your cage doors been flung  
Wide open  
And Im hoping you see  
That theres a place beside me  
If you ever need it
