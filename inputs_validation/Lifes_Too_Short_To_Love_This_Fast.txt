You say hello I say goodbye  
You go your way and I go mine  
Theres not much time for you and I these days  
We work too hard were gone too much  
And were too tired to even touch  
So just how long can we go on this way  
  
Oh lifes too short to love this fast  
If we dont slow down our hearts wont last  
We cant keep up this pace were on right now  
We burn the candle at both ends  
The circle turns we start again  
Lets make our future better than our past  
Lifes too short to love this fast  
  
Lets take some time lets get away  
Lets pack our bags and leave today  
Girl anyplace would be okay right now  
Just leave your pager here at home  
And I wont carry my cell phone  
We need to find some time alone somehow  
  
Yeah lifes too short to love this fast  
If we dont slow down our hearts wont last  
We cant keep up this pace were on right now  
We burn the candle at both ends  
The circle turns we start again  
Lets make our future better than our past  
Lifes too short to love this fast  
  
Were spinnin our wheels  
Forgetting how love feels  
Lets slow down before its too late  
  
Cause lifes too short to love this fast  
If we dont slow down our hearts wont last  
Lets make our future better than our past  
Lifes too short to love this fast  
  
Love this fast  
Lifes too short
