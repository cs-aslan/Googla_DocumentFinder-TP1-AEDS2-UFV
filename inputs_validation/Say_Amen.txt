Verse 1  
  
This life is a journey we walk by faith  
And there will always be the mountains in our way  
But right here in this moment may our strength be renewed  
As we recall what God has done and how weve seen Him move  
  
Chorus  
  
If theres anybody here whos found Him faithful  
Anybody here who knows Hes able  
Say Amen  
And if theres anybody here whos seen His power  
Anybody here brought through the fire  
Say Amen  
Anybody here found joy in the middle of sorrow  
Just Say AMEN  
  
Verse 2  
  
Sometimes through the darkness its hard to see  
So just be brave and follow where He leads  
Cause greater is the one whos in us than he whos in the world  
So child of God remember the battle is the Lords  
  
Chorus  
  
And if theres anybody here whos found Him faithful  
Anybody here who knows Hes able  
Say Amen  
And if theres anybody here whos seen His power  
Anybody here brought through the fire  
Say Amen  
Anybody here found joy in the middle of sorrow  
Peace in the storm hope for tomorrow  
And seen it time and time again  
Then just Say AMEN  
  
Bridge  
  
Even in the valley of the shadow when you feel alone in the unknown  
Just say Amen Just say Amen  
Even when the storms are raging Stand and know your not forsaken  
Just say Amen Just say Amen  
  
PreChorus  
  
Is there anybody here Tell me is there anybody here  
Come on and Say Amen  
  
Ending  
  
And if theres anybody here whos seen His power  
Anybody here brought through the fire  
Come on and Say Amen  
Anybody here found joy in the middle of sorrow  
Peace in the storm hope for tomorrow  
And seen it time and time again  
Just say Amen Just say Amen
