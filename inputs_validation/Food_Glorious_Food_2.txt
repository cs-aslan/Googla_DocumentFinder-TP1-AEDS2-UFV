Is it worth the waiting for  
if we live till eightyfour  
all we ever get is gruel  
everyday we say a prayer  
will they change the bill of fare  
Still we get the same old gruel  
theres not a crust not a crumb can we find  
can we beg can we borrow or cadge  
but theres nothing to stop us from getting a thrill  
When we all close our eyes and imagine  
  
Food glorious food  
Hot sausage and mustard  
while were in the mood  
cold jelly and custard  
pease pudding and saveloys  
What next is the question  
Rich gentlemen have it boys  
Indigestion  
food glorious food were anxious to try it  
3 banquets a day our faveourite diet  
just picture a great big steak  
Fried roasted or stewed oh food wonderful food  
Marvellous food glorious food  
  
Food Glorious food what is there more handsom  
gulped swallowed or chewed  
Still worth a kings randsom  
what is it we dream about  
What brings on a sigh  
piled peaches and cream about  
Six feet high  
  
Food Glorious food eat right through the menu  
just losen your belt  
2 inches and then you  
work up a new appetite  
In this interlude  
then food once again food fabulous food glorious food  
  
Food Glorious food dont care what it looks like  
burned underdone crude dont care what the cooks like  
just thinkin of growing fat our senses go reeling  
one moment of knowing that  
full up feeling  
  
Food glorious food what wouldnt we give for  
that extra bit more thats all that we live for  
why should we be fated to do nothing but grude  
oh food magical food wonderful food marvellous food fabulous food  
beautiful food glourious fooooooooood
