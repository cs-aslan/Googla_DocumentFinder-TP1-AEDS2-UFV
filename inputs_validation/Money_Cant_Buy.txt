Money cant buy itbaby  
Sex cant buy itbaby  
Drugs cant buy itbaby  
You cant buy itbaby  
I believe that love alone might do these things for you  
I believe in love alone yea yea  
Take the power to set you free  
Kick down the door and throw away the key  
Give up your needs  
Your poisoned seeds  
Find yourself elected to a different kind of creed  
I believe that love alone might do these things for you  
I believe that love alone might do these things for you  
I believe in the power of creation  
I believe in the good vibration  
I believe in love alone yea yea  
Wont somebody tell me what were coming to  
I might take forever till we watch those dreams come true  
All the money in the world wont buy you peace of mind  
You can have it all but you still wont be satisfied  
Money cant buy itbaby  
Sex cant buy itbaby  
Drugs cant buy itbaby  
You cant buy itbaby  
Now  
Hear this  
Pay attention to me  
Cause Im a rich white girl and its plain to see  
I got every kind of thing that the money can buy  
Let me tell you about it  
Let me amplify  
I got DIAMONDS  
You heard about those  
I got so many that I cant close my safe at night in the dark  
Lying awake in a sick dream  
I believe that love alone might do these things for you  
I believe that love alone might do these things for you  
I believe in the power of creation  
I believe in the good vibration  
I believe in love alone yea yea
