Im searching for answers  
Cause something is not right  
I follow the signs  
Im close to the fire  
  
I fear that soon youll reveal  
Your dangerous mind  
  
Chorus  
Its in your eyes whats on your mind  
I fear your smile and the promise inside  
Its in your eyes whats on your mind  
I fear your presence Im frozen inside  
  
Im searching for answers  
Not questioned before  
The curse of awareness  
Theres no peace of mind  
As your true colors show  
A dangerous sign  
  
Its in your eyes whats on your mind  
I see the truth that youve buried inside  
Its in your eyes whats on your mind  
There is no mercy just anger I find  
  
I just have know while I still have time  
Do I have to run or hide away from you  
  
Its in your eyes whats on your mind  
I see the truth that youve buried inside  
Its in your eyes whats on your mind  
There is no mercy just anger I find
