I got a ticket to nowhere  
I got no respect for the law  
I got no use cause its all abuse  
Its the cutting edge of the saw  
  
Aint got no tiime for the future  
Aint got no time for the past  
Im running up a down escalator  
Im going nowhere fast  
  
Im hanging on like a spider  
Blowing in the wind  
This storms gonna tear a hole  
Right through this web Im in  
  
Chorus  
Thunder lightning  
The wind outside is so damn frightening  
But its alright all right  
Stand clear  
Youre living in the hurricane years  
In the hurricane years  
  
Ive been through major destruction  
Ive seen through terrorists eyes  
Sometims I feel no emotion  
Sometims I break down and cry  
I need to walk on a wire  
I need a layer of skin  
I need a preacher breathing fire  
To burn away my sins  
  
And I cant help the victims  
On the side of the road  
And I cant stop the cyclone  
Thats about to explode  
  
Chorus  
  
Turn my eyes to heaven  
Watching all the clouds roll by  
I see the blood moon rising  
I know Im way too young to die  
  
Chorus
