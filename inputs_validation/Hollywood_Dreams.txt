Now Ive always been a dreamer  
Ive had these fantasies run through my mind  
The vivid memories of days we spent together  
They seem so long ago  
Whyd you have to leave me whyd you let me go  
  
Were used to chasing rainbows but theyre not hard to find  
My baby used to love me fame left it all behind  
Now Ive become a prisoner locked up behind four walls  
You say Ive got life easy but Ive got no life at all  
So now Ive made the grade they know who I am  
Ive made it to the top a lonely man  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Cant bring back the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood Dreams  
  
Smile for the cameras is all they ever say  
Transmitting my emotions a thousand miles away  
They chase me through the streets calling out my name  
Im coming home to you this life is driving me insane  
Climbing up those stairs knocking on the door  
She dont recognize me or want me anymore  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Cant bring back the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood Dreams  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood Dreams  
Cant bring back the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood dreams  
Hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Cant bring back the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood dreams  
Hot Lights  
The spot lights cant bring back youre love to me  
Chasing those Hollywood
