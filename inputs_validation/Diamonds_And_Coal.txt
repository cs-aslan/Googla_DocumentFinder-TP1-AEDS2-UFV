If its good to complicate then both of us are doing fine  
Just keep your eyes on your part and leave me alone to mine  
If its good to instigate were a fast horse bet on us  
Im not calling you an animal I think we just fight too much  
Come on in spite of this were doing just fine  
Even diamonds start as coal  
Give us time to shine  
Even diamonds start as coal  
Both aligned in frame of mind but circumstance got us good  
And now youre seeing a side of me I wished no one ever would  
Yeah if its right to pick a fight were fingers in a sugar bowl  
Love isnt perfect even diamonds start out as coal  
Hello in spite of this were doing just fine  
Even diamonds start as coal  
Give us time to shine even diamonds start as coal  
Even diamonds start as coal  
Were incomplete and infantile even diamonds start as coal  
Give it time girl the fire feels divine  
The sweetest things they burn before they shine  
We think way too much  
Look at us losing touch  
A promise is a promise until  
Yeah in spite of this were doing just fine  
Even diamonds start as coal  
Give us time to shine even diamonds starts as coal  
Even diamonds start as coal  
Yeah were incomplete and infantile  
Even diamonds start as coal
