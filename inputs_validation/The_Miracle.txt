Every drop of rain that falls in Sahara Desert says it all  
Its a miracle  
All Gods creations great and small the Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal  
Thats a miracle  
Test tube babies being born mothers fathers dead and gone  
Its a miracle  
Were having a miracle on Earth mother nature does it all for us  
The wonders of this world go on the Hanging Gardens of Babylon  
Captain Cook and Cain and Abel Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel  
Its a miracle its a miracle its a miracle its a miracle  
The one thing were all waiting for is peace on Earth  an end to war  
Its a miracle we need  the miracle  
The miracle were all waiting for today  
If every leaf on every tree could tell a story that would be a miracle  
If every child on every street had clothes to wear and food to eat  
Thats a miracle  
If all Gods people could be free to live in perfect harmony  
Its a miracle were having a miracle on Earth  
Mother nature does it all for us  
the wonders of this world go on  
Open hearts and surgery Sunday mornings with a cup of tea  
Super powers always fighting  
But Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling  
Its a miracle its a miracle its a miracle  
  
The wonders of this world go on  
Well its a miracle its a miracle its a miracle its a miracle  
The one thing the one thing  
Were all waiting for were all waiting for  
Is peace on Earth peace on Earth and an end to war end to war  
Its a miracle we need the miracle the miracle  
Peace on Earth and end to war today
