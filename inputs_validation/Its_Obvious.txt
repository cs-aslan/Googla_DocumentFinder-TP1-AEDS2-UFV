Yyea     
The flow so amazin nigga  
Uh its yo boy   young  
Uh huh I brought Rell wit me  
Timbo on the track  
JBreezy Take it easy I got ya homie  
Lets do the damn thing Rell  
  
  
When girls stop and stare its obvious its the Roc  
Your visions impaired its obvious its the watch  
Park nine for being pasumptious  
It could be that ash it cuts in my ear or some shit  
Oh stop your dumb shit Hov is hot  
It aint just hoes and guns shit I switch top  
Big sneakers cant see wit their optics  
They optical allusions dont confuse dudes wit him  
Uh its obvious stayin used to win  
Used to being in that Jeep deuce deuce like him  
G4 land a teeted barrel whoo  
Fitted sombrero to the side nigga my stride is so ghetto  
Projects strut hop out the plane hop in my truck  
Just in time hop off my thugs  
Its obvious you got hate in you thug  
You want the crown you got to take it in blood  
Nigga what cmon  
  
Wit every step wit every move  
Scared of me in the mood  
All I see is her and me  
Gettin down I said gettin down  
I love her frown I love her smile  
Most of all I love that shes wild  
Watchin her watchin me  
Escapin to her shes talkin to me  
  
  
Girl I can tell by the look in your eyes  
And the way that you back it up  
I can tell that you like it rough rough  oh yes its obvious  
Plus Im a freak and I know its your style  
Cause we get bubble while makin love  
I can tell that you like it rough rough  oh yes its obvious  
  
Its in your walk its in your vibe  
In your claws some in your eyes  
Chasin you you chasin me  
We belong like Adam and Eve  
Youre the Queen Im the King  
Shall no one intervene  
Kinky things thuggish things  
Crazy things anything  
  
Chorus
