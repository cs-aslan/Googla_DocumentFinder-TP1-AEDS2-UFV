JUST ONCE IN MY LIFE  
IF I COULD FIND SOMEONE IF ONCE  
THE FEELING WAS RIGHT  
ID NEVER LET HER GO  
ID ALWAYS BE THERE  
IF I COULD HAVE MY CHANCE TO BE  
THE ONLY ONE  
IT JUST ISNT FAIR  
  
CHORUS  
  
IF I COULD HOLD ON TO LOVE  
ID NEVER LET IT GO  
ID KEEP IT RIGHT NEXT TO MY HEART  
  
IF I COULD HOLD HER TONIGHT  
SHED NEVER LEAVE MY SIDE  
IF I COULD ONLY HOLD ON TO LOVE  
  
IM SEARCHING MY DREAMS  
IM TRYING TO RECOGNIZE THAT FACE  
OH  
WHO CAN IT BE  
SHES CALLING OUT TO ME AND NOW  
IM  
  
RUNNING TO HER  
BUT EVERYTIME I GET THIS CLOSE  
SHE VANISHES  
INTO THE NIGHT  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
IS IT EVER COME TO PASS  
THAT I FIND A LOVE THAT LASTS  
OR IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK  
  
IF I COULD HOLD HER TONIGHT  
SHED NEVER LEAVE MY SIDE  
IF I COULD ONLY HOLD ON TO LOVE  
IF I COULD ONLY HOLD ON TO LOVE
