I just cant pretend no more I keep runnin out of lies  
Lovin you is killin me inside  
Every time I find the words to end it something in your eyes wont let it  
  
Chorus  
Shandi tonight must last us forever  
Forever we say goodnight and go home  
But you know me very well and I know you  
You cant tell me goodnight  
say goodnight  
  
We been holding on so tight were afraid to let it go  
Shake it loose we both could use the ride  
Heres another mess I got myself in and when you touch me you aint helpin  
  
Chorus  
Say goodnight when we should say goodbye say goodbye  
  
Shandi Shandi Tonight must last us forever and ever  
Forever we say goodnight and go home  
Shandi Shandi tonight must last us forever
