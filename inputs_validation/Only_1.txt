I want you I want you  
I want you I want you  
I want you I want you  
  
Let me introduce myself  
Let me introduce myself  
Let me introduce myself  
  
Lookin in your eyes makes me wonder how  
I got so much time with you and theres more around  
I know all the competition thats after you  
So I get to thinking is this too good to be true  
  
That were living  
In a fairytale no malice and no lies  
Baby oh its hard to believe  
All the love you have inside is only mine  
Thats how I know  
  
I cant be your only one  
No I cant be your only one  
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met  
And your love is three times better how could anyone forget  
No I cant  
  
I cant be your only one  
No I cant be your only one  
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met  
And your love is three times better how could anyone forget  
No I cant  
  
As Im layin down with you every night  
It still gets to me that you remain by my side  
I aint saying that Im not deservin of you  
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew when  
  
I wished for living  
In a fairytale no malice and no lies  
So baby oh its hard to believe  
All the love you have inside is only mine  
Thats how I know  
  
I cant be your only one  
No I cant be your only one  
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met  
And your love is three times better how could anyone forget  
No I cant  
  
I cant be your only one  
No I cant be your only one  
Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met  
And your love is three times better how could anyone forget  
No I cant  
  
Only 1  
Be your only 1  
Only 1
