Your old man got mad when I told him we were leaving  
He cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling  
He called you his child said honey get wise to his game  
Hell get you in trouble I know it those bums are all the same  
Theres a greyhound outside in the lane its waiting for us  
So tell him goodbye we gotta go west on that bus  
  
And its all over now  
Dont you worry no more  
Gonna go west to the sea  
The greyhound is swaying  
And the radio is playing  
Some blues for baby and me  
  
And the highway looks like it never did  
Lord it looks so sweet and so free  
And I cant forget that trip to the west  
Singing blues for baby and me  
  
Saw your hands trembling your eyes opened in surprise  
Its ninety in the shade babe and there aint a cloud in the sky  
I called you my child said honey now this is our game  
Theres two of us to play it and Im happy to be home again  
Theres a greyhound outside in the lane its waiting for us  
So tell him goodbye we gotta go west on that bus
