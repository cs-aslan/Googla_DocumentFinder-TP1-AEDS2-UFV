You got that far away look in your eyes  
But are you looking at me or at some other guy  
Whos got you hypnotized  
Got you mesmerized  
Keep you tranquilized with ever kind of lie  
Still he makes you cry  
So baby realize that I  
  
Im gonna break his spell  
Ill put him in his place and get you out of this hell  
Im gonna break his spell  
Take this relationship and send it straight to the well  
Im gonna break his spell  
Baby Im gonna break his spell  
Yes I will  
  
Its been a while since Ive known somethings wrong  
At first you had me thinking everything was gone  
I got a late start  
I let him steal your heart  
I let that fool come in and tear our world apart  
But hes not that smart  
Another love shark and I  
  
Im gonna break his spell  
Ill put him in his place and get you out of this hell  
Im gonna break his spell  
Take this relationship and send it straight to the well  
Im gonna break his spell  
Baby Im gonna break his spell  
Yes I will
