Im not scared but this is happening  
Im not afraid but this is real  
It all comes at once  
From every single direction  
  
This time Im not sleeping at all  
How could this be real  
Ive failed you  
I was lying when I said  
  
I was looking north  
I was too scared to show what I am  
Bear with me this is all I have left  
This night be more than a simple conversation  
  
Its been dancing around in my head  
For quite some time  
Just the though  
Of cleaning up myself  
  
I stare at the wall  
Watching my time float away  
Its all been a blur  
And nothing will change  
I was lying  
This is defeat
