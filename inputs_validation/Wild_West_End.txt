Stepping out to Angelluccis for my coffee beans  
Checking out the movies and the magazines  
Waitress she watches me crossing from the Barocco Bar  
Im getting a pickup for my steel guitar  
I saw you walking out Shaftesbury Avenue  
Excuse me for talking I want to marry you  
This is the seventh heaven street to me  
Dont be so proud  
  
Youre just another angel in the crowd  
And Im walking in he wild west end  
Walking with your wild best friend  
And my conductress on the number nineteen  
She was a honey  
  
Pink toenails and hands all dirty with money  
Greasy hair easy smile  
Made me feel nineteen for a while  
And I went down to Chinatown  
In the backroom its a mans world  
All the money go down  
  
Duck inside the doorway gotta duck to eat  
Right now feels alright now  
You and me we cant beat  
And a gogo dancing girl yes I saw her  
The deejay he say heres Mandy for ya  
I feel alright to see her  
  
But shes paid to do that stuff  
Shes dancing high I move on by  
The close ups can get rough  
When youre walking in the wild west end
