I dont like you  
But I love you  
Seems like Im always thinking of you  
Oh oh oh  
You treat me badly  
I love you madly  
Youve really got a hold on me  
Youve really got a hold on me  
  
I dont want you  
But I need you  
Dont wanna kiss you  
But I need you  
Oh oh oh  
You do me wrong now  
My love is strong now  
Youve really got a hold on me  
Youve really got a hold on me  
  
I love you and all that I want you to do  
Is just hold me hold me hold me hold me  
  
Dont wanna leave you  
dont wanna stay here  
Dont wanna spend another day here  
Oh I just dont fit now  
I just can quit now  
Youve really got a hold on me  
Youve really got a hold on me baby  
  
I love you and all that I want you to do  
Is just hold me hold me hold me hold me
