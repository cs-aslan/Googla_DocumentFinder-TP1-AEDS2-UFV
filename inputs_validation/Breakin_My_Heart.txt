feat Little Brother  
  
Hey baby look here I got this new song I wrote its got that nice slow
groove that everybody dancin to and when I play it it kinda remind me of me
and you I mean theres one more thing I want to talk about Its time for
you to come home everybody got their problems Im dealing with mine I done
gave up them narcotics Im a changed man  
  
Bridge  
She loves me she loves me not  
  
Verse 1 Little Brother  
How many ways can I say Im done fishin  
You wanted the role smash the audition  
Havin a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen  
Still I got a taste for that fast food foreign cars many women  
And some say its the life I was given  
I say it dont matter if I work at McEDs  
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees  
On a new broad you still one to one  
Every once in again I like havin some fun  
No disrespect intended but whats done is done  
Women steppin out for love men do what to come  
Not a playa like Pun but when shorties get the grabbin on me  
The last thought I get is Koobie run  
To them girls wishin on a star thats will stun  
But I gotta tell it like it is hun one  
  
Chorus x2 Lil Brother First Lil Wayne Second  
She say she love me wont leave me wont ever let me go  
But if youre thinkin of leaving you need to let me know  
We better together then further apart so darlin dont go breakin my heart  
  
Verse 2 Lil Brother  
We was high school sweethearts talkin since we was teens  
Every morning and every evening  
Ten years later she eatin that mean cuisine  
Im on the field straight gone of that creatine  
In the nfl which mean Not For Long  
City to city all the groupies they hop along  
Word get back to wifey she like Stop the song  
Im takin the kids to my mommas Im out Im gone  
Momma was like Baby now I hate to see your tears  
But Ive been with your daddy for bout 35 years  
And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating  
But I aint never had to wear no black eye from beatings  
As long as he doing right by you and your kids  
How you gon expect that man not to be who he is  
I aint sayin that its right but we often pay the price  
Cause a womens life is love a mans love is life  
And he gon live it to the fullest and I aint tryna pull you down or sound
like a broken record  
But you should know by now that all niggas is dogs  
Better to have a rich pit then a broke german shepard  
  
Chorus x2  
She say she love me wont leave me wont ever let me go  
But if youre thinkin of leaving you need to let me know  
We better together then further apart so darlin dont go breakin my heart  
  
Verse 3 Lil Wayne  
I say I dont have nothin if I dont have you  
Like Shadai we got the sweetest taboo  
And my game is skin deep like your first tattoo  
I gets all in ya head just like shampoo  
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices  
I dont want a broken heart because I lose the pieces  
Hey girl dont play with my gangsta  
And have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger  
And I know cheaters never get crowned  
So I play fair like roller coasters and clowns  
You gotta hold ya soldier down  
Even when the war is lookin it is right around the corner  
And you dont want to leave me believe me  
Cause I could turn you on like a personal tv  
Its young weezy I know what ya thought  
But Im just here to play my part so dont go breakin my heart  
  
Chorus x2 Lil Wayne First Lil Brother Second  
She say she love me wont leave me wont ever let me go  
But if youre thinkin of leaving you need to let me know  
We better together then further apart so darlin dont go breakin my heart
