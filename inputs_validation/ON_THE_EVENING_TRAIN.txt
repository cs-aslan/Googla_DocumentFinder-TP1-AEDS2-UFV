On the evening train  
Writers hank williams audrey williams  
The babys eyes are red from weeping  
Its little heart is filled with pain  
And Daddy cried theyre taking Mama  
Away from us on the evening train  
I heard the laughter at the depot  
But my tears fell like the rain  
When I saw them place that long white casket  
In the baggage coach of the evening train  
As I turned to walk away from the depot  
It seemed I heard her call my name  
Take care of baby and tell him darling  
That Im going home on the evening train  
I pray that God will give me courage  
To carry on til we meet again  
Its hard to know shes gone forever  
Theyre carrying her home on the evening train
