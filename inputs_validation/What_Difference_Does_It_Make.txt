All men have secrets and here is mine  
So let it be known  
We have been through hell and high tide I can surely rely on you  
And yet you start to recoil heavy words are so lightly thrown  
But still Id leap in front of a flying bullet for you  
  
So what difference does it make  
So what difference does it make  
  
It makes none but you have gone  
And you must be looking very old tonight  
The devil will find work for idle hands to do  
I stole and I lied and why because you asked me to  
But now you make feel so ashamed because Ive only got two hands well  
Im still fond of you  
  
So what difference does it make  
It makes none but you have gone and your prejudice wont keep you warm tonight  
The devil will find work for idle hands to do  
I stole and I lied and why just because you asked me to  
But you know the truth about me you wont see me anymore  
Im still fond of you  
  
So no more apologies no more apologies Im too tired  
Im too sick and tired and Im feeling very sick and ill today  
But Im still fond of you
