Fathers waiting round the corner  
Ticket in his hand  
Wants to help his daughter  
Protect and understand  
Daughters needing some security  
The comfort of a man  
Cant face the pain of losing  
Shes afraid to love again  
Searching for her fathers words  
She remembered  
  
Chorus  
My father he said dont be misled  
My father he said is heart in your hands  
  
Way far far away  
Daughters feelin kinda shaky  
Heartache and trouble everywhere  
There aint no love shes looking  
For someone who cares  
Searching for her fathers words  
She remembered  
  
Chorus  
  
Take the train far cooling down  
Daughters waiting at the station  
Got a ticket in her hand  
Bound for her destination  
Shell try to love again  
Searching for her fathers words  
She remembered  
  
Chorus  
  
Father father father  
  
Chorus  
  
Father father father he said
