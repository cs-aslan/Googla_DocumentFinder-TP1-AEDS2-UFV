It might be late  
But it wont be early  
You got me to the gate  
With time for a coffee  
Its getting late  
Sounds like a departure  
Its getting close  
Sounds to me like a departure  
Until we meet again  
Lets stay engaged  
Until then  
Lets stay engaged  
  
Lies over time  
Float to the surface  
Lies over time  
They equal surface  
Lies over time  
Though the reasons desert us  
Lies over time  
With no apparent purpose  
Until we meet again  
Lets stay engaged  
Until then  
Lets stay engaged  
  
See the dead art  
And you see your reflection  
Fear no art  
And you fear no reflection  
But dont look at me  
Im not the artist in question  
Sounds good to me  
But Im not the artist in question  
Until we meet again  
Lets stay engaged  
Until then  
Lets stay engaged
