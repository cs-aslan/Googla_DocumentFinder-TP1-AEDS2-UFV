It started in Roanoke a little whiles ago  
A friend knew a dance that you ought to know  
They call it flat footin and it sure looks fine  
Right now its flat footin it time  
  
And youll be flat footin it flat gettin it  
You dont know just how good it is until you hear that guitar pickin it pick
it  
  
Just let your arms hang right where they are  
Then youll start flat footin it  to the bar  
Turn yourself loose all the law will allow  
And youre doing that flat footin it now  
  
Youll be flat footin it flat gettin it  
You dont know just how good it is until you hear that drummer pickin it
pick it  
  
It started in Roanoke and came a long way  
Now its a flat footin it USA  
Good for your spirits and good for your health  
You oughta try a little flat footin yourself  
  
And youll be flat footin it flat gettin it  
You dont know just how good it is until you hear that bass fiddle pickin it
pick it  
  
Well all of the students at the University  
Shocked and amazed the existing faculty  
Some dropped Biology and some cut their math  
To enroll in a flat footin it class  
  
Flat footin it flat gettin it  
You dont know just how good it is until you hear that band a pickin it
pick it
