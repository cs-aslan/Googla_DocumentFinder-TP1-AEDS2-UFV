Well Im a going back down  
Maybe one more time  
Deep down home  
October road  
And I might like to see  
That little friend of mine  
That I left behind  
Once upon a time  
Oh promised land  
And me still standing  
Its a test of time  
Its a real good sign  
  
Let the sun run down  
Right behind the hill  
I know how to stand there  
Still till the moon rise up  
Right behind the pine  
Oh Lord  
October road  
  
Let the sun run down  
Right behind the hill  
I know how to stand there  
Still till the moon rise up  
Right behind the pine  
Oh Lord  
October road  
  
Its the big time life  
That I cant abide  
Raise my rent  
Tan my hide  
Sweet call of  
The countryside  
Go down slow open wide  
I did my time  
And it changed my mind  
Im satisfied oh  
I got so low down  
Fed up my God  
I could hardly move  
Wont you come on my brother  
Get on up  
And help me find my groove  
  
Keep me walking  
October road  
Keep me walking  
In the sunshine yeah  
A little friend of mine  
October road  
Keep me walking  
October road  
Keep me walking  
In the sunshine yeah  
A little friend of mine  
October road  
Help me now
