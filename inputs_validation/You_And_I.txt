I lose control because of you babe  
I lose control when you look at me like this  
Theres something in your eyes that is saying tonight  
Im not a child anymore life has opened the door  
To a new exciting life  
  
I lose control when Im close to you babe  
I lose control dont look at me like this  
Theres something in your eyes is this love at first sight  
Like a flower that grows life just wants you to know  
All the secrets of life  
  
Its all written down in your lifelines  
Its written down inside your heart  
  
You and I just have a dream  
To find our love a place where we can hide away  
You and I were just made  
To love each other now forever and a day  
  
I lose control because of you babe  
I lose control dont look at me like this  
Theres something in your eyes that is saying tonight  
Im so curious for more just like never before  
In my innocent life  
  
Its all written down in your lifelines  
Its written down inside your heart  
  
You and I just have a dream  
To find our love a place where we can hide away  
You and I were just made  
To love each other now forever and a day  
  
Time stands still when the days of innocence  
Are falling for the night  
I love you girl I always will  
I swear Im there for you  
Till the day I die  
  
You and I just have a dream  
To find our love a place where we can hide away  
You and I were just made  
To love each other now forever and a day
