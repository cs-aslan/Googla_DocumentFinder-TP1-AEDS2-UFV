I got a friend named Whiskey Sam  
He was my boonierat buddy for a year in Nam  
He said is my country just a little off track  
Took em twentyfive years to welcome me back  
But its better than not comin back at all  
Many a good men I saw fall  
And even now every time I dream  
I hear the men and the monkeys in the jungle scream  
  
Drive on dont mean nothin  
My children love me but they dont understand  
And I got a woman who knows her man  
Drive on dont mean nothin drive on  
  
I remember on night Tex and me  
Rappelled in on a hot LZ  
But we had our 16s on rock and roll  
But with all that fire was scared and cold  
We were crazy we were wild  
And I have seen the tiger smile  
I spit in a bamboo vipers face  
And Id be dead but by Gods grace  
  
Drive on dont mean nothin  
My children love me but they dont understand  
And I got a woman who knows her man  
Drive on dont mean nothin drive on  
  
It was a real slow walk in a real sad rain  
And nobody tried to be John Wayne  
I came home Tex did not  
And I cant talk about the hit he got  
I got a little limp now when I walk  
Got a little tremolo when I talk  
But my letter read from Whiskey Sam  
Youre a walkin talkin miracle from Vietnam  
  
Drive on dont mean nothin  
My children love me but they dont understand  
And I got a woman who knows her man  
Drive on dont mean nothin drive on
