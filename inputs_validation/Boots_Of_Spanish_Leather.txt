Oh Im sailin away my own true love  
Im sailin away in the morning  
Is there something I can send you from across the sea  
From the place that Ill be landing  
  
No theres nothin you can send me my own true love  
Theres nothin I wish to be ownin  
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled  
From across that lonesome ocean  
  
Oh but I just thought you might want something fine  
Made of silver or of golden  
Either from the mountains of Madrid  
Or from the coast of Barcelona  
  
Oh but if I had the stars from the darkest night  
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean  
Id forsake them all for your sweet kiss  
For thats all Im wishin to be ownin  
  
That I might be gone a long time  
And its only that Im askin  
Is there something I can send you to remember me by  
To make your time more easy passin  
  
Oh how can how can you ask me again  
It only brings me sorrow  
The same thing I want from you today  
I would want again tomorrow  
  
I got a letter on a lonesome day  
It was from her ship asailin  
Saying I dont know when Ill be comin back again  
It depends on how Im afeelin  
  
Well if you my love must think thataway  
Im sure your mind is roamin  
Im sure your heart is not with me  
But with the country to where youre goin  
  
So take heed take heed of the western wind  
Take heed of the stormy weather  
And yes theres something you can send back to me  
Spanish boots of Spanish leather
