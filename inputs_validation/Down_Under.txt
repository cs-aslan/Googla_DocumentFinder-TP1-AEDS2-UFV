Traveling in a friedout Kombi  
On a hippie trail head full of zombie  
I met a strange lady she made me nervous  
She took me in and gave me breakfast  
And she said  
  
Do you come from a land down under  
Where women glow and men plunder  
Cant you hear cant you hear the thunder  
You better run you better take cover  
  
Buying bread from a man in Brussels  
He was sixfootfour and full of muscles  
I said Do you speaka my language  
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich  
And he said  
  
I come from a land down under  
Where beer does flow and men chunder  
Cant you hear cant you hear the thunder  
You better run you better take cover  
Yeah  
  
Lyin in a den in Bombay  
With a slack jaw and not much to say  
I said to the man Are you trying to tempt me  
Because I come from the land of plenty  
And he said  
  
Do you come from a land down under oh yeah yeah  
Where women glow and men plunder  
Cant you hear cant you hear the thunder  
You better run you better take cover  
  
Living in a land down under  
Where women glow and men plunder  
Cant you hear cant you hear the thunder  
You better run you better take cover  
  
Living in a land down under  
Where women glow and men plunder  
Cant you hear cant you hear the thunder  
You better run you better take cover  
  
Living in a land down under  
Where women glow and men plunder  
Cant you hear cant you hear the thunder  
You better run you better take cover  
  
Living in a land down under  
Where women glow and men plunder  
Cant you hear cant you hear the thunder  
You better run you better take cover
