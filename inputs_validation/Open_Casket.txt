Approach the image filled with fear  
As the image grows so clear  
Future now takes full control  
The one whose past you now behold  
Touch The flesh it is so cold  
Turn away You now have been told  
Never to return memories will last  
In the future youll think about the past  
Never to forget what you have seen  
  
People come to pay respect  
Taking pictures of the dead  
That is what life comes to be  
Once they lived now theyre deceased  
  
Death is oh so strange  
The past no one can change  
What you cant predict  
Is how long youll exist  
Open casket Open casket  
  
Life will never be the same  
Death can never be explained  
Its their time to go beyond  
Empty feeling when theyre gone  
  
Never to return memories will last  
In the future youll think about the past  
Never to forget what you have seen  
What can not be real you now believe
