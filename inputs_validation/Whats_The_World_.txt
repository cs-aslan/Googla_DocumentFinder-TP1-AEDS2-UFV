Um  this song was written by  erm erm  
What would you sell  
Loose glasses and suit  
Heart and soul  
Wont wear out  
  
Thats not enough  
I wonder whats inside  
Fish fillet knife  
Can cut  
Right through my eye  
  
Im looking for some words  
To call my own  
Wornout phrases  
And a handmedown  
  
Theyll knock me  
Under where I stand  
Sad on his back  
In a corned beef pan  
  
Going under  
You can feel them pulling me down  
To the rust inside  
  
This is the way  
Frankenstar is born  
  
Bits and pieces  
Others have worn  
All held together by a management glue  
Too much glue  
Watch the stars turn blue  
Turn blue  
Turn blue  
Turn blue  
Turn blue  
  
Im going under  
You can feel them pulling me down  
To the halls of rust  
Eeh  
  
I I I I I  
Thank you
