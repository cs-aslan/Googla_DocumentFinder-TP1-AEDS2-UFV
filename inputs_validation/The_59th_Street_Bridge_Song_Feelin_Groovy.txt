Slow down you move too fast  
You got to make the morning last  
Just kicking down the cobble stones  
Looking for fun and feelin groovy  
  
Hello lamppost What cha knowing  
Ive come to watch your flowers growing  
Aint cha got no rhymes for me  
Dootin doodoo Feelin groovy  
  
Got no deeds to do No promises to keep  
Im dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep  
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me  
Life I love you All is groovy
