Father they have written  
On the point of no return  
Soldiers they will come and  
Oh theyre coming to burn  
I said Oh boy we need your hope to live  
Oh boy you have so much to give  
Oh boy dont let it get you down  
  
Who baby who will save the world  its not too late  
Who baby who will save the world  all heroes hesitate  
Im too young to die  
Im too young to die  
  
Father Ive been looking  
Through a rainbow of tears  
Found yourself so lonely  
Oh theyre drowning in my fear  
I said Oh boy Im old enough to know  
Oh boy that it hurts to grow  
Oh boy dont let it get you down
