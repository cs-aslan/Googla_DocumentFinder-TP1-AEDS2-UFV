Take my life and paint it black  
Until Im sleeping  
And my promise I take it back  
So please stop creeping  
I dont call your heart my own  
Where I rest my head Im home  
You are here to please me  
You know my name  
I dont know yours  
Stay until the curfew calls  
And kiss your idol  
Beneath your black hair waterfalls  
You look so bridal  
I dont call your heart my own  
Where I rest my head Im home  
You are here to please me  
You know my name  
I dont know yours  
I dont call your heart my own  
Where I rest my head Im home  
You are here to please me  
You know my name  
I dont know yours  
You know my name  
My scarlet name  
You dont know me
