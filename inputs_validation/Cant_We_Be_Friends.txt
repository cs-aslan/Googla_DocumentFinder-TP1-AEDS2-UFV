Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would  
I cant excuse it on the grounds of youth  
I was no babe in the wild wild wood  
She didnt mean it  
I should have seen it  
But now its too late  
  
I thought Id found the girl of my dreams  
Now it seems  
This is how the story ends  
Shes gonna turn me down and say  
Cant we be friends  
I thought for once it couldnt go wrong  
Not for long  
I can see the way this ends  
Shes gonna turn me down and say  
Cant we be friends  
Why should I care though she gave me the air  
Why should I cry  
Heave a sigh  
And wonder why  
And wonder why  
I thought I found the gal I could trust  
What a bust this is how the story ends  
Shes gonna turn me down and say  
Cant we be just friends
