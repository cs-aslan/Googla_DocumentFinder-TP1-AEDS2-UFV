Check it out so though  
No more not this time not again  
  
You told me everything would get along  
But everything is falling apart  
Now if you understand me dont get me wrong  
cause theres something dark inside my heart  
  
Better get it off my back  
Get it on with the check  
Temptations and vibrations  
Keeps me falling  
What I need yeah  
Thats what I got  
  
Now boy we can keep it loud  
So please dont turn it out  
Whispers sweet get mine  
Laying over the baseline  
  
Whatever it is Im no affraid  
To whoever listen to this  
I dont fear you  
To all your fellas  
Go back to your girlfriends  
Bounce it twist it  
Better dip that thing  
  
Better get it off my back  
Get it on with the check  
Temptations and vibrations  
Keeps me falling  
What I need yeah  
Thats what I got  
  
Better get it off my back  
Get it on with the check  
Temptations and vibrations  
Keeps me falling  
What I need yeah  
Thats what I got  
  
I have my satisfaction  
So I can live my life  
On the right track  
  
Better get it off my back  
Get it on with the check  
Temptations and vibrations  
Keeps me falling  
What I need yeah  
Thats what I got
