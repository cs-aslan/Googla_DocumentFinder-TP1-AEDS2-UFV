It reads like a fairytale and thats what it was  
Young man in his prime young girl from the cross  
The most perfect of strangers and then the night closed in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
  
Now she was a fine one and he was a handsome man  
One look was enough and away they ran  
They spent many happy hours and then the night closed in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
  
Oh whats the use in complaining  
In for a penny in for a pound  
I remember the loving time  
And nothing else really counts  
  
And I recall the promise they made  
With a faith I can but admire  
That shed be the one he adored  
And hed be her hearts desire  
  
It didnt come true in the end they went their separate ways  
He couldnt change what he was she wasnt ready to wait  
They couldnt live in the daylight they let the night close in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
  
They couldnt live in the daylight they let the night close in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
They couldnt live in the daylight they let the night close in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
  
I remember the loving time  
And nothing else really counts
