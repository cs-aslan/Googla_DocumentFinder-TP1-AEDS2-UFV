Look at this stuff isnt it neat  
Wouldnt you think my collections complete  
Wouldnt you think Im the girl  
The girl who has everything  
Look at this trove treasures untold  
How many wonders can one cavern hold  
Lookin around here youd think  
Sure shes got everything  
  
Ive got gadgets and gizmos aplenty  
Ive got whoozits and whatzits galore  
You want thingamabobs  
I got twenty  
But who cares  
No big deal  
I want more  
  
I want to be where the people are  
I want to see  
want to see em dancing  
Walking around on those  
Whaddya call em oh feet  
Flipping your fins you dont get too far  
Legs are required for jumping dancing  
Strolling along down a  
Whats that word again Street  
  
Up where they walk  
Up where they run  
Up where they stay all day in the sun  
Wandering free  
Wish I could be  
Part of that world  
  
What would I give  
If I could live  
Out of these waters  
What would I pay  
To spend a day  
Warm on the sand  
Betcha on land  
They understand  
That they dont reprimand their daughters  
Bright young women  
Sick of swimming  
Ready to stand  
  
And ready to know what the people know  
Ask em my questions  
And get some answers  
Whats a fire and why does it  
Whats the word burn  
  
Whens it my turn  
Wouldnt I love  
Love to explore that shore above  
Out of the sea  
Wish I could be  
Part of that world
