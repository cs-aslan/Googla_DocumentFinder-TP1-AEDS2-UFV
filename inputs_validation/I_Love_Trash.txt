Refrain Oh I love trash  
Anything dirty or dingy or dusty  
Anything ragged or rotten or rusty  
Yes I love trash  
I have here a sneaker thats tattered and worn  
Its all full of holes and the laces are torn  
A gift from my mother the day I was born  
I love it because its trash  
Refrain  
I have here some newspaper thirteen months old  
Ive wrapped some fish inside it its smelly and cold  
But I wouldnt trade it for a big pot o gold  
I love it because its trash  
Refrain  
Ive a clock that wont work and an old telephone  
A broken umbrella a rusty trombone  
And I am delighted to call them my own  
I love them because theyre trash  
Refrain ending with Yes I love I love I love trash
