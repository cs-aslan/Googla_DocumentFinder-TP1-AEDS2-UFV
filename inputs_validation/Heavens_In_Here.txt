Baby I dream between the blade and the tongue  
Of the rose on your cheek the wounded and dumb  
We stumble and fall we stumble and fall  
Skin on skin but theres heaven in  
Heavens in here  
Heavens in here  
Among the twilight and stars  
Like a rocket to Mars  
Heaven in here  
The first and the last are telling it all  
Telling you loud but selling it small  
Im taking a swing at this shadow of mine  
Crucifix hangs and my hearts in my mouth but its here  
Heavens in here  
Heavens in here  
Among the twilight and stars  
Like a rocket to Mars  
Heaven in here  
Heaven in one sigh heaven in two eyes  
Heaven lies between your marbled thighs  
The rustle of your falling gown  
We stumble and fall like tragedy falls  
We stumble and twirl theres heaven in here  
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall  
Flesh on flesh but theres heaven in  
Heavens in here  
Heavens in here  
Heavens in here  
Among the twilight and stars  
Like a rocket to Mars  
Heaven in here  
Youll dance to my tongue  
Well dance on the sun  
Were the twilight and stars  
Theres heaven in here
