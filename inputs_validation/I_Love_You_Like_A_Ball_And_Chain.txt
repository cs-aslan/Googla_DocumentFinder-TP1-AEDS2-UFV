Well the sound of your voice on the telephone  
Make me feel distressed  
Make me all alone  
Why do I feel so incomplete  
When youre not here Im just obsolete  
  
My bed is burnin all through the night  
Youre the only one that can make me feel right  
Try to lay down my sleepin head  
But Im tossin and turnin around instead  
  
Chorus  
I love you like a ball and chain  
Make it alright now  
Love you like a ball and chain  
Feels too good  
  
Im a fool I know but Im stuck on you  
Im a fool I know and its makin me blue  
Theres a river of blood  
Theres a river of tears  
Ive been wasting all these years  
  
Chorus
