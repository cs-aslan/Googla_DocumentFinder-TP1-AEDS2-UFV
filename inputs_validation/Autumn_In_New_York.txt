Autumn in New York  
Why does it seem so exciting inviting  
Autumn in New York  
It spells the thrill of firstknighting  
  
Shimmering clouds  glimmering crowds glittering crowds and shimmering
clouds  
In canyons of steel  
Theyre making me feel  Im home  
  
Its autumn in New York  
That brings a the promise of new love  
Autumn in New York  
Is often mingled with pain  
  
Dreamers with empty hands  
They All sigh for exotic lands  
  
But Its autumn in New York  
Its good to live it again  
  
This autumn in New York  
Transforms the slums into Mayfair  
Autumn in New York  
Youll need no castles in Spain  
  
Lovers that bless the dark  
On benches in Central Park  
  
But Its autumn in New York  
Its good to live it again  
  
 in New York
