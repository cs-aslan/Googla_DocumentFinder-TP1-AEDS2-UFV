So you finally came right out and said it girl  
What took you so long  
It was in your eyes that looks been there for too long  
Im waiting in line  
Would you say if I was wasting my time  
  
Or did I miss again  
I think I missed again oh  
  
I think about it from time to time  
When Im lonely and on my own  
  
I try to forget and yet still rush to the telephone  
Im waiting in line  
Would you say if I was wasting my time  
  
Or did I miss again  
I think I missed again oh  
Or did I miss again  
I think I missed again oh  
  
Well it feels like something you want so bad  
Then you think youve got it but its something you already had  
You can feel it all around you but its something you just cant touch  
And I feel it coming at me  
I can feel it coming at me  
  
Or did I miss again  
I think I missed again oh  
Or did I miss again  
I think I missed again  
  
Im waiting in line but would you say if I was wasting my time  
  
Or did I miss again
