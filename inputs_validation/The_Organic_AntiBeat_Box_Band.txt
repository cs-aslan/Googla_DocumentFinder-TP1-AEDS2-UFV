Oh yeah  
Can you dig it can you dig it  
Welcome friends to my thoughts of when  
The Fax City Four were four young men  
  
Time has come now we jam  
With the uplift mofo party plan  
Were the organic antibeat box band  
One comes from the holy land  
Another was born an Australian  
  
Me Im from Michigan  
But Hollywood is the land of lands  
Its a Hollywood jam  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Hollywood is where we live  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Organic antibeat box band  
  
Life is grand in the land of lands  
The mind does boggle the mind expands  
The anarchy for have manned their craft  
Get on your knees and shake your ass  
  
To the jam that is  
We dont ask we demand  
That you and your clan  
Listen now to this jam  
To the power of the drummers bad  
  
Its a Hollywood jam  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Hollywood is where we live  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Organic antibeat box band  
Theres a party in my town at 1200  
Theres a party thats rockin down to the rock  
  
Ive got nothin against hip hop  
But theres a party in my town  
And no beat box jam that is  
The partys got girls the girls got hot  
The partys got boys and the boys got socks  
Something popped the doors unlocked  
House got up ran around the block  
  
Sit down house  
Take off your blouse  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Hollywood is where we live  
Any good friend of the lollipop kids  
Over the rainbow with the wiz  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
  
Organic antibeat box band  
With the organic antibeat box band  
You just might slam dance that is  
Its a Hollywood jam
