Chorus  2x  
All my niggas stay alive in this dirty game  
Niggas working 9 to 5 in this dirty game  
But all my niggas gone survive in this dirty game  
Because we pack a 45 in this dirty game  
ZRo  
Everyday my mind is set on money making ways  
Even kick in doors I cant be broke in money making days  
I cant get no job in a white mans world thats why I live so raw  
I cant watch my children starve homeboy so watch me break the law  
Chorus  2x  
ZRo  
Ramon noodles tv dinners aint no way to live  
Rather be holding slab while grabbing grain rolling airport load for sive  
In the streets of Houston Texas hustlers living in the cuts  
On a mission chasing paper got no time for gold digging hoes get off my nuts  
Chorus  2x  
ZRo  
Im turning suicidal in my older age this gamell freeze you to death  
And eveyrday I face the coldest stage  
Tell me does every nigga thats thugging got to struggle to bubble  
And so Im ready to laugh successfully you dont want no troule  
Cause Im living more rugged than rougher than the rockiest road  
Im paronoid for life got to keep a glock in the load  
Am I addicited to caine watch that tooting line  
Could it be a nigga thats hard to locate is somebody you could find  
ZRo certified platinum on a million dollar paper chase  
Pulling up next to the police and blowing this weed in they face  
But they try to blow my high when Im on this hyper toiliking weed  
But Im gonna slice skills with hands thatll make you vomet and bleed  
Aunte be worrying about me so Im trying to get her to smile  
But I know she know Im wanted dead or alive  
Got to keep my mind on my money making maneuvers cause my hustle is strong  
A lot of fools get lazy now they hustle is gone  
But Im a hustler for life  
Chorus  2x  
ZRo talking
