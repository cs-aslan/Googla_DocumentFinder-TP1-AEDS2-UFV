Its the time of April snows  
And how it shows  
In Hannahs eyes  
  
Calling shes calling  
Calling each midnight  
Take me to new heights  
Falling Im falling  
  
A secret power  
Sweet with surprises  
Leaves no disguises  
When you feel pure  
  
Until Im yours  
Its the time of April snows  
And how it shows  
In Hannahs eyes  
  
Time and shes all  
A pool of thought  
I sometimes call  
In Hannahs eyes
