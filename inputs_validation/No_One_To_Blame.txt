Im not lookin for a friend  
I dont have such vanity  
I walked alone into the woods  
I dont take no sympathy  
If thats the way its gotta be  
Well theres no more loyalty  
Somebody always tryin to complain  
I dont need no one to blame  
Its a bad bad bad day  
I hope our paths never cross again  
I needed just one break it never came  
I kept my cool  
I aint the same  
I had a lot of drinks and fun  
It just made me sleepy  
Theres not much that I want to say  
I never said I am sorry  
Its a bad bad bad day  
I hope our paths never cross again  
On weekends if it decides to rain  
I watch my friends go down the drain  
Im not looking for a friend  
I dont have such vanity  
I walked alone into the woods  
I dont take no sympathy
