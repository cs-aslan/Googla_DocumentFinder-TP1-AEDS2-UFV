You moved like honey in my dream last night  
Yeah some old fires were burning  
You came near to me and you endeared to me  
But you couldnt quite discern me  
  
Does that scare you Ill let you run away  
But your heart will not oblige you  
Youll remember me like a melody  
Yeah Ill haunt the world inside you  
  
And my big secretgonna win you over  
Slow like honey heavy with mood  
  
Ill let you see me Ill covet your regard  
Ill invade your demeanor  
And youll yield to me like a scent in the breeze  
And youll wonder what it is about me  
  
Its my big secretkeeping you coming  
Slow like honey heavy with mood  
  
Though dreams can be deceiving  
Like faces are to hearts  
They serve for sweet relieving  
When fantasy and reality lie too far apart  
  
So I stretch myself across like a bridge  
And I pull you to the edge  
And stand there waiting  
Trying to attain  
The end to satisfy the story  
Shall I release you  
Must I release you  
As I rise to meet my glory  
  
But my big secret  
Gonna hover over your life  
Gonna keep you reaching  
When Im gone like yesterday  
When Im high like heaven  
When Im strong like music  
Cause Im slow like honey  
And heavy with mood
