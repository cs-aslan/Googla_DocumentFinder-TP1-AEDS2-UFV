Test testing testing  
This hmmm Grace is my name  
And and I was Hm  
It was that phot A fading photograph of  
A patch a patchwork quilt  
And theyve put me on these  
Ramona put me on these interest drugs  
So Im thinking bit too fast like a brain hatch  
And ah they wont let me see anybody  
If I want to sometimes and I ask  
I can hear some pop Popular musics  
And aftershocks Sneeze  
See Ive been watching a television of um In the homelands  
Thats the new homelands and um thats all I can remember  
And now they just want me to be quiet  
And I think something is going to be horrid
