Aint nobody listening aint nobody there  
Somebody is screaming this aint fair  
30 pieces glistening speak up if you dare  
That is what the book said if you care  
  
Sheep and God the fourth independence  
Waiting to be led  
Deep the pain the sting of dependence  
This is what he said  
  
Ill take you all the way  
A lifetime spent in just one day  
Ill take you out the other side  
Its my hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that its cold outside  
Why dont you come for a ride  
  
Think that somethings missing or somethings just not fair  
Somebody is hanging over there  
I was at my own christening I wasnt quite aware  
I didnt have the choice to even dare  
  
I fell asleep at night independence  
Waiting for the word  
In nightmares and deceit of dependence  
This is what I heard  
  
Ill take you anyway  
Hopeless faithless its okay  
Ill take you on the lifetime ride  
Its my hellish pride  
  
Fire  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that its cold outside  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
I got no pride  
  
Ill take you all the way  
Ill take you anyway  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that its cold outside  
Why dont you come for a ride  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that its cold outside  
Why dont you come for a ride  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that its cold outside  
Why dont you come for a ride  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that its cold outside  
Why dont you come for a ride  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun
