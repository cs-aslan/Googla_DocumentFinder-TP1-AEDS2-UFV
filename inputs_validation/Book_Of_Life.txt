Is my name written there on those pages bright and fair  
Is my name written in the book of life  
If you want to be up there then down here you must prepare  
And your name must be in the book of life  
Get down on your knees and pray you from sin must turn away  
Or your name wont be in the book of life  
If youll turn to Jesus now at his feet just humbly bow  
Then your name will be in the book of life  
 piano   
Dont you know that Christ was sent that from sin you could repent  
So your name could be in the book of life  
You will have a great surprise if you fell to recognize  
That your name must be in the book of life  
Get down on your knees and pray you from sin must turn away  
Or your name wont be in the book of life  
Dont delay and dont forget that from sin you could repent  
Then your name will be in the book of life  
Is my name written in the book of life
