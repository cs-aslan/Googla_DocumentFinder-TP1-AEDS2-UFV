Hickory Grove wait for me  
Im just as poor as a man can be  
Hickory Grove wait for me  
Im just as blind as the other men  
That see  
  
Hickory Grove make the sun  
Rise slower I dont have much time  
Hickory Grove watch me run  
Down through the years of my prime  
  
Lady Luck play your hand  
Ive got a life for you to play with  
Hickory Grove you will stand  
Ive got a dream that I can stay with
