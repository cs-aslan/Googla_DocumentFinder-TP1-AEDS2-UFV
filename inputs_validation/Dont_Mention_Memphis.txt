Mister can you take me into Little Rock  
Ill buy the coffee and Ill fill your truck  
Ill listen all night if you want to talk  
Just dont mention Memphis  
We can talk about your family  
Politics music and philosophy  
Any ol subjects alright with me  
Just dont mention Memphis  
  
Chorus  
Or blue eyes and light brown hair  
An angel waving to me from the top of the stairs  
The hardest thing I did was leave her standing there  
So dont mention Memphis  
  
Pass me the thermos and Ill fill your cup  
Well make Texas with a little luck  
And Im hanging with you till the sun comes up  
So dont mention Memphis  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont wanna talk about Memphis  
And the hardest thing I did was leave my baby there  
So dont mention Memphis  
I dont wanna talk about Memphis
