Brother Seems theyre letting him out next year  
Hes behaving himself I hear  
Governor Conway says it will be fine  
Just as long as he can tow the line  
  
Its the same old story  
But it says here Mum youre not to worry  
Cos some you lose and some you lose  
  
At this party he was on his own  
All he did was say hed take her home  
But it seems they didnt go straight there  
cos on the porch she told him  
put your hand here  
  
Yes its that same old story  
They told her mum shes not to worry  
  
Police If what she says is so  
well never let him go  
  
Him Never a word could be heard  
Not even the sound of a bird  
Singing it over again telling a different story  
Never the same as before  
See the summer going out by the door  
Brother And now that youve paid for those lies  
Get another disguise  
  
Its twenty years now since our Kid came free  
Oh I remember August 53  
But it wasnt quite like they said  
With that behind you you cant plan ahead  
Yes its the same old story  
They say youre free but dont worry  
What they saids not so  
Theyll never let you go  
  
Him Never a word could be heard  
Not even the sound of a bird  
Singing it over again telling a different story  
Never the same as before  
See the summer going out by the door  
Brother And now that youve paid for those lies  
Get another disguise
