God give me one shot and Ill break right through  
I am starting to be brand new  
  
Rome is burning you can taste the embers  
I am walking hard on Spanish Stairs  
My Saint was silence rapping on the door  
Grown up defiant wanting so much more  
  
Me brand new say  
Starting over  
Me brand new say  
Starting over  
Me brand new say I say  
  
Give me one shot at my life today  
One shot at my life today  
I dont want to be a stranger  
  
Walk with millions a delicate few  
So sad how loneliness just follows you  
New York City streets and avenues  
Cut the concrete they march through  
  
Me brand new say  
Starting over  
Me brand new say  
Starting over  
Me brand new say I say  
  
Give me one shot at my life today  
One shot at my life today  
I dont want to be a stranger  
  
I dont want to be just a passerby  
Stand in line wrapped around the world  
I dont want to be just a parasite  
Holding on tight  
Holding on tight  
  
I got this feeling and its down in my bones  
I got this feeling and its burning up my soul  
I got to get just one shot baby one more day  
Got to give me one shot today  
I got this feeling just give me one day
