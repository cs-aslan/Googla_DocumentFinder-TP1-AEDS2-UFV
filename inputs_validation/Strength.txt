Turn the TV off  
Turn me on  
Disbelief confidence is gone  
You can take all this from me  
Stands my integrity now  
Im so sick of mother fuckers  
Crooked wars that they wage  
  
Should I sit and count the seconds till were all blown away  
Sex tyrants violence on the news everyday  
Ignorance turned anger into hate  
  
Turn away  
Strength in diversity unity and evolution  
Strength in diversity unity and evolution  
Strength in diversity unity and evolution  
Strength in diversity unity and evolution  
  
Revolution  
Now youre gone and its forever  
Nothing is the same  
Right to wrong well come together  
Time to make a change  
  
Turn the TV off  
Turn me on  
Disbelief confidence is gone  
You can take all this from me  
Stands my integrity now  
And these wars that we wage  
  
Why  
An eye for an eye  
So I lock load engage  
Casualty high supply  
Well be missing all our friends who die to get us by  
Courage facing fear  
Hate increase decline  
  
Chorus  
  
Strength in diversity unity and evolution  
Strength in diversity unity and evolution  
Strength in diversity unity and evolution  
Strength in diversity unity and evolution  
  
Revolution  
Turn the TV off  
Turn me on  
Disbelief confidence is gone  
If you take all of this from me  
Then all of you can come together  
  
Chorus
