When theres no more looking back  
And you feel youve loved in vain  
You try and hide your sorrow  
Now youre alone again  
So you block out your emotion  
Laugh it off and carry on  
Sayin why do i have to feel this way  
Was loving you so wrong  
  
If i could only turn around  
One more time for old times sake  
Id pick up all the pieces  
From the mistakes i made  
Did i give myself completely  
Or did i hang on for too long  
Ah but whats the use of me talking this way  
Now that youre gone  
  
No looking back its over now  
All over now  
I tell myself im glad  
Its over now  
All over now  
Its over now  
  
But if i ever love again  
Oh i wont be played a fool  
Ill put in my performance  
This time ill know the moves  
Its not that im feeling bitter  
Ive no bitterness to show  
And all im really trying to say  
Is that i wish id never let you go
