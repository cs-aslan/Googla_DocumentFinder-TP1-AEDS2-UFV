Bartender Id like a Manhattan please  
  
Stop me if youve heard this one  
But I feel as though weve met before  
Perhaps I am mistaken  
But its just that I remind you of  
Someone you used to care about  
Oh but that was long ago  
Now tell me do you really think Id fall for that old line  
I was not born just yesterday  
Besides I never talk to strangers anyway  
  
Hell I aint a bad guy when you get to know me  
I just thought there aint no harm  
Hey yeah just try minding your own business bud  
Who asked you to annoy me  
With your sad sad repartee  
Besides I never talk to strangers anyway  
  
Your lifes a dime store novel  
This town is full of guys like you  
And youre looking for someone to take the place of her  
You must be reading my mail  
And youre bitter cause he left you  
Thats why youre drinkin in this bar  
Well only suckers fall in love with perfect strangers  
  
It always takes one to know one stranger  
Maybe were just wiser now  
Yeah and been around that block so many times  
That we dont notice  
That were all just perfect strangers  
As long as we ignore  
That we all begin as strangers  
Just before we find  
We really arent strangers anymore  
  
Aw you dont look like such a chump  
Aw hey baby
