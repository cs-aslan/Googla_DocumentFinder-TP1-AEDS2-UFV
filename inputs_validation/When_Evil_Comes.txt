I dont like this  
Anymore than you  
In fact Im scared  
At the top of the stairs in the dark  
Throw away all the dreams you had  
Slow and broke  
And just for you  
You were barely there  
Hey little girl  
Wheres your momma gone  
Has she left you scared  
At the top of the stairs in the dark  
Its too late for come backs  
And Ive been wrong before  
Now I need I need no more  
Except for you makin up the sides  
Its too late for come backs  
And Ive been wrong before  
Now I need I need no more  
Except for you makin up the sides  
Evil is when evil comes  
At the top of the stairs  
At the top of the stairs  
And in the dark  
The world wont listen  
And it gets this scared  
Standing there  
At the top of the stairs in the dark  
Come on baby  
Lets lose this fear  
And lets stand here  
Where its always fair and never dark
