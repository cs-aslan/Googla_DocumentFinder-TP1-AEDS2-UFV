On the outskirts of town theres a little night spot  
Dan dropped in about five oclock  
Took off his jacket said The night is short  
He reached in his pocket and he flashed a quart  
  
He hollered Rave on children Im with you  
Rave on cats he cried  
Its almost dawn the cops are gone  
Lets all get Dixie fried  
  
Well Dan got happy and he started raving  
He pulled out a razor but he wasnt shaving  
And all the cats knew to jump and hop  
Cause he was born and raised in a butcher shop  
  
He hollered Rave on children Im with you  
Rave on cats he cried  
Its almost dawn the cops are gone  
Lets all get Dixie fried  
  
Well the cops heard Dan when he started to shout  
They all ran in to see what it was about  
And I heard him holler as they led him away  
He turned his head and this is what he had to say  
  
He hollered Rave on children Im with you  
Rave on cats he cried  
Its almost dawn the cops are gone  
Lets all get Dixie fried  
  
Now Dan was the bravest man that we ever saw  
He let us all know he wasnt scared of the law  
The black dog barked but the boy didnt flinch  
He said It aint my fault hon that I been pinched  
  
He hollered Rave on children Im with you  
Rave on cats he cried  
Its almost dawn the cops are gone  
Lets all get Dixie fried  
  
Now Dan was the bravest man we ever saw  
He let us all know he wasnt scared of the law  
And I heard him holler as they led him away  
He turned his head and this was what he had to say

Rave on cats he cried  
Its almost dawn the cops are gone  
Lets all get Dixie fried
