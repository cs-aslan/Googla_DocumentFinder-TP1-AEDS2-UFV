Shes just a lover who makes me high  
Is it worth the giving is it worth the try  
You cannot cleave it or put it in the furnace  
You cannot wet it you cannot burn it

The truth of lust woman to man  
So open the door and you will see

Because theres something about you baby  
That makes me want to give it to you  
I swear theres something about you baby  
  
Just promise me whatever we say  
Whatever we do to each other  
For now we take a vow to just  
Keep it in the closet

I really want it I cant deny  
Its just desire I really love it  
Cause if its aching you have to rub it
