Now get the fuck up off me nigga  
  
As I struggle to keep my balance and composure  
Im posed ta propose a toast to players on every coasta  
The lyrical roller coaster mindbender  
Stead of watching these sucker MCs  
Im seeing just how they lying to the general population  
Dont be patient get up and stand up for your life  
Dont you agree or understand we lost some rights at 119  
Come dumb come young come blind unwind confined  
To the situation we facing cause in time tick tick boom  
  
Tick boom tick tickboom  
Tick boom tick tickboom  
Tick boom tick tickboom  
Tick boom tick tickboom  
  
Youre gonna die here  
  
When will we all awake up out this dream  
Come here and smell the Folgers the soldiers are human beings  
Man acting as if he was the supreme being  
Clocking the souls of men out like he was GOD and  
WARrah therell be no tomorrow but sorrow  
And horror will follow the hollow hearts battle for dollars  
Politicians modern day magicians  
Physicians of death more health care for poor health  
Who making us ill they making us kill  
Thats making me spill my guts chill Big lay in the cut  
For what I refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled  
Like I do nothing all day but sit around watch the Cartoon Channel  
I rap about the Presidential election and the scandal  
That followed and we all watched the nation as it swallowed  
And chalked it up basically America you got FUCKED  
The media shucked and jived now we stuck  damn  
  
Cant be heard clearly  
Youre gonna die here  
  
Operation Anaconda ask yourself  
Was it full of bleeps and blunders did they ever find Osama  
And why in the fuck did Daniel Pearl have to pay the price  
For his life and his wife plead twice  
See AlAmin got life and Fred got dead Hampton  
To dampen the dream of all the Panthers  
They got they answer for ransom  
As we read together as we dream together  
Count your blessings whenever you feel that things wont be no better  
But it got to you gave me this microphone so I must rock you  
Your brainwaves airwaves energized and shocked you  
Yall got me well I got yall long as I know yall listenin  
Ima always bring food for thought to the table in the kitchen  
Now eat nigga
