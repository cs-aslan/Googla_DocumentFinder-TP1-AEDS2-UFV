Nothing to say no place to hide  
I cant find a good reason even to lie  
All of our dreams are gone  
I may not be right but Im surely not wrong  
And its gonna be hard  
So very very hard living without you  
Well dont you know that its  
Hard living without you  
Nowhere to go no place to run  
We started out just having fun  
Well I never cared too much  
Not till the going got so very rough  
And its gonna be hard  
So very very hard living without you  
Dont you know that its  
Hard living without you  
Dont you know that its  
Hard living without you  
Well dont you know that its  
Hard living without you  
Baby dont you know that its  
Hard living without you  
Dont you know that its  
Hard living without you  
Well dont you know that its  
Hard living without you  
Baby dont you know that its  
Hard living without you  
Dont you know that its
