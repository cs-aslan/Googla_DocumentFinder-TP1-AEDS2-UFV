Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Living out a memory of a love that died  
  
Its five and Im driving home again  
Its hard to believe that its my last time  
The man on the wireless cries again  
Its over its over  
  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Living out a memory of a love that died  
  
Its late and Im with my love alone  
We drink to forget the coming storm  
We love to the sound of our favourite song  
Over and over  
  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Living out a memory of a love that died  
  
Its time and were in each others arms  
Its time but I dont think we really care  
  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by  
  
Dancing with tears in my eyes
