Jimmy Buffett Will Jennings Michael Utley  
There are oceans of feelings between us  
Currents that take us and sweep us away  
Thats why we seldom have seen us  
In the light of a cold hard day  
  
Lots of new friends with the same old answers  
Open your eyes you might see  
Of our lives were that simple  
Wed live in the past  
If the phone doesnt ring its me  
  
If the phone doesnt ring  
Youll know that its me  
Ill be out in the eye of the storm  
If the phone doesnt ring  
Youll know that Ill be  
Where someone can make me feel warm  
Its too bad we cant turn  
And live in the past  
If the phone doesnt ring its me  
  
Ive had good days and bad days  
And going half mad days  
I try to let go but youre still on my mind  
Ive lost all the old ways  
Im searching for new plays  
Putting it all on the line  
  
Lots of new friends with the same old problems  
Open your eyes you might see  
If our lives were that simple  
Wed live in the past  
If the phone doesnt ring its me  
  
If it takes all the future  
Well live through the past  
If the phone doesnt ring its me
