GZA  
Blunt smoke fifth hundred stroke  
Im going nuts full clip shoot up her fat lips  
And round butt catch Heat when Im In Too Deep  
The answer beeps she take dives on the busiest streets  
Whatever situation or the circumstances  
Outdoor indoor shes taking the chances  
Hotel motel or Holiday Inn  
Overlooking that bible she continued to sin  
Spread wide on the desk paperwork all in a mess  
While the ceiling fan blowing her dress  
Ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping  
Her skirt hid her talent until I raised the curtains  
Showtime at the Apollo shell follow my lead  
Then get on her knees then swallow her pride  
Strapped and ready to ride  
  
  
Chorus  
  
Inspectah Deck  
Yeah thats my down bitch  
Thats my down bitch anything she do for her man  
If its lying on the stand fish frying in the pan  
She a Queen like Liz the third wicked curves  
On her word stay still rocking linens and furs  
While she do it in the sack jazz music in the back  
Flat blew a nigga back act two Im into that  
Damn right she the star of my team  
When we stepped on the strip baby girl we the heart of the scene  
Whether Brooklyn Bronx Manhattan or Queens

She acting all shy but she likes handcuffs

Outro kung fu sample  
Youve learned how to kill  
Every moved youve learned is trained to that end  
Yet we wish to preserve life

Then you can start training with us from the beginning
