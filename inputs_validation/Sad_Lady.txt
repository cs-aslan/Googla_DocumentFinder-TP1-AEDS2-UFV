Oh Sad Lady do you curse your name  
And how many times have you been ashamed  
Crazy Lady letting your emotions show  
Its hard being a woman knowing what you know  
  
Oh Sad Lady were you born in vain  
Nothing to live for and no one to blame  
Aint no use in screaming or pulling on your hair  
Crazy Lady dancing with a chair  
  
1st bridge  
  
Oh oh if you should get to know  
Sad Lady  
Say maybe  
  
Oh Sad Lady wont you dry your eyes  
You go on living wishing you could die  
cause dyings not bad when livings not so good  
Crazy Lady so misunderstood  
  
repeat 1st bridge  
  
2nd bridge  
Tell me what youre thinking  
As you lace up white shoes  
Tell me Sad Lady
