Come join the band  
Come shag the damned  
God I blow them away  
A heart of chrome  
A broken home  
I got plenty to say  
  
Who ya doin  
Dont spoil my day  
A bigger better offer baby  
Is on its way  
You gotta love LA  
  
I feel gigantic  
Gonna burst a vein  
Im stoppin traffic  
Cause they dig the fame  
And Im just the same  
  
Sorry bababy  
Havent seen you lately  
Do you still give it away  
So get my peeps  
To call your peeps  
Cause weve got nothing to say  
  
Dont feed the models  
Dont look at the police  
Dont go to Crenshaw Bouli  
Cause Wally cant get fleeced  
Gotta love LA  
  
I feel gigantic  
Gonna burst a vein  
Im stoppin traffic  
Cause I dig the fame  
  
Im hearing voices voices  
Like a jumbo jet  
Too many choices choices  
Gotta love LA  
CalifornIa  
  
Who ya doin baby  
Dont spoil my day  
Youve been gloating lately baby  
And I dig LA  
Got nothing to say  
  
I feel gigantic  
Gonna burst a vein  
Im stoppin traffic  
Cause I dig the fame  
  
Im hearing voices voices  
Like a jumbo jet  
Too many choices choices  
Gotta love LA  
CalifornIa
