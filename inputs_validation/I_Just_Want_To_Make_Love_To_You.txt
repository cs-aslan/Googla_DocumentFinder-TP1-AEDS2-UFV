I dont want you to be no slave  
I dont want you to work all day  
I dont want you to be true  
I just want to make love to you  
  
I dont want you to wash my clothes  
I dont want you to keep my home  
I dont want your money too  
I just want to make love to you  
Love to you love to you  
  
Well I can see by the way that you switch and walk  
And I can tell by the way that you baby talk  
And I can know by the way that you treat your man  
I wanna love you darlin its a cryin shame  
  
I dont want you to bake my bread  
I dont want you to make my bed  
I dont want you cause Im sad and blue  
I just want to make love to you love to you  
  
Well I can see by the way that you switch and walk  
And I can tell by the way that you baby talk  
And I can know by the way that you treat your man  
I wanna love you darlin its a cryin shame  
  
I dont want you to bake my bread  
I dont want you to make my bed  
I dont want you cause Im sad and blue  
I just want to make love to you love to you  
Love to you love to you
