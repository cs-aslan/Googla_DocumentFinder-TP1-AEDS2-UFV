Its funny you know  
Cause theres an old rock n roller  
Hes got nowhere to go  
Did you ever think of taking him in  
Somebody help him somebody please  
  
Put another record on  
Cause he likes that song  
  
Its funny you know  
Ooh he never done nothing done nobody wrong  
Did he think about changing his name  
But Im gonna tell him its the same old game  
  
Put another record on  
Round and round and round and around  oh  
Ah  see him smile  
  
Well lately Ive seen him  
Walking down the street kinda moving his feet  
Everyone I know looks the other way  
Somebody help him somebody say   
  
Put another record on  
Round and round and round and around  oh  
Ah  see him smile  
  
Its funny you know  
Cause theres an old rock n roller  
Hes got nowhere to go  
Did you ever think of taking him in  
Somebody help him somebody please  
  
Just put another record on
