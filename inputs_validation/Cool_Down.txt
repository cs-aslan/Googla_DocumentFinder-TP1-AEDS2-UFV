Theyve been married  
For seventeen years  
But you can see  
She doesnt trust him at all  
And you can see she doesnt believe that he is not cheating  
You cant blame a poor girl  
Hes been a busy man all his life just like the rest of us  
One day she caught him with another girl  
He said it was his mother  
She caught with another one  
He said it was his sister  
Hes in deep water again  
I dont know what he gonna say today but  
I wont be surprise if he gets out of this one like the other ones  
Cause I know hes the Houdini  
Of cheaters hear him now when he says  
  
Chorus  
Cool down baby everything is under control  
It doesnt matter where I get my appetite  
I will always eat at home Repeat x2  
Oh oh  
  
Theyve been married for seventeen years  
But you can see  
He doesnt trust her at all  
And you can see he doesnt believe  
Shes not cheating  
You cant blame a poor man  
Shes been a busy girl  
All her life just like the rest of us  
One day he caught her with another man  
She said it was her father  
He caught her with another one  
She said it was her brother  
I believe that it is true  
Birds of a feather fly together  
She has learned from master  
I wasnt surprise at all  
When I heard her say hey  
  
Chorus
