What a superlady

Not long ago I was  
A sad and lonely boy  
Did not know how to get better  
  
Then heaven up above  
Sent me a super love  
And now Im happy forever  
  
No one wants to believe  
Ive got a perfect love  
They say Im just talking crazy  
  
But I can prove its true  
If youll allow me to  
Tell you bout my Super Lady  
  
Shes all that I could explore  
Shes more than a dream  
Shes my everything  
  
Shes a Superlady  
She is too much  
Wish I could make her mine  
  
What a superlady

Shes a Superlady  
She is too much  
Wish I could make her mine  
  
What a superlady  
aha alright  
Shes so fine  
  
Whoever thought I would  
Be feeling half this good  
The world for me is new place  
  
Ill drink to happiness  
Because our loves the best  
The wine for me has a new taste  
  
Ill let my lady know  
Ill never let her go  
Forever Im gonna hold on  
  
She said she feels the same  
Dont wanna play no game  
Just wants our love to live on and on  
  
Wish I could fly to the sky  
And write out her name  
  
Climb to the top of the world  
And loudly exclaim  
Shes my everything  
Shes my everything  
  
I love that superlady  
I love that superlady  
I love that superlady

Shes much too much for my heart
