Whatever gets you  
Through the night  
Thats all right with me  
When its time to say goodbye  
I have to make you see  
  
You wont know me  
I wont call you  
I wont be there  
To remind you  
What you told me  
When I showed you  
In the morning  
Let me know youll  
  
Drive back to your old town  
I wanna wake up  
With noone around  
Drive back to your old town  
  
If somebody  
Is haunting your mind  
Look in my eyes  
Let me hide you  
From yourself and  
All your old friends  
Every good thing  
Comes to an end  
  
Drive back  
Drive back  
Drive back  
  
Drive back to your old town  
I wanna wake up with noone around  
Drive back to your old town
