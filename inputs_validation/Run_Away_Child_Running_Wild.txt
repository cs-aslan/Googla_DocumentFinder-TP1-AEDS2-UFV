You played hookie from school and you cant go out to play yeah  
Mama said For the rest of the week in your room you gotta stay yeah  
Now you feel like the whole worlds pickin on you  
But deep down inside you know it aint true  
  
Youre in punishment  
cause your mother wants to raise you in the right way yeah  
But you dont care  
cause you already made up your mind you wanna run away yeah  
Youre on your way Runaway Child Running Wild  
Runaway Child Running Wild  
Better go back home where you belong  
  
Roaming through the city going nowhere fast youre on your own at last  
Hey Its gettin late Where will you sleep  
Youre gettin kinda hungry you forgot to bring something to eat  
Oh lost with no money you start to cry  
But remember you left home wantin to be grown so dry your weeping eyes  
  
Sirens screamin down neon lighted streets  
You want your mama  
Run run run run run run run run  
Are they looking for you  
Youre frightened and confused  
I want my mama  
Run run run run run run run  
but shes much too far away she cant hear a word you say  
  
Youve heard some frightening news on the radio  
about little boys running away from home  
And the parents dont see them no more  
You wanna stop to hitch a ride I know  
But your mama told you never trust a stranger  
And you dont know which way to go  
  
Streets are dark and deserted not a sound nor sign of life  
How you long to hear your mothers voice cause youre lost and alone  
But remember you made the choice Runaway Child Running Wild  
You better go back home where you belong  
Oh Runaway Child Running Wild  
You better go back home where you belong  
Youre lost in this great big city  
Go back home where you belong  
Not a familiar face aint it a pity  
Go back home where you belong  
Runaway Child Running Wild  
You better go home where you belong
