ronny scaife danny hogan  
  
Cool breeze on the river  
Ripples to the shore  
Wash away my troubles  
To the sea forever more  
Wind and willows whisper  
Sadness is the sound  
Tell the tale of my wants  
Happy world thats falling down  
Old man I might be going where youre bound  
  
Chorus  
Old man river  
Ive come to talk again  
Yes I know youre tired  
Cause your journey never ends  
Hes just like you  
Hes moving all the time  
And I think hes moving me out of his mind  
  
I want to travel with you  
In your deep and nimble soul  
Thats the only way to make it  
Peaceful like before  
  
We used to touch at midnight  
But now I feel hes gone  
Even though hes lying next to me I feel alone  
Oh man it looks like Im to travel alone  
  
Repeat chorus x2
