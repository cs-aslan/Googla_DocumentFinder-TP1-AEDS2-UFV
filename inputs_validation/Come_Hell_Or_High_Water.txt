Ive got no worries  
Ive got no regrets  
Who they think theyre kidding  
They aint seen nothing yet  
  
You point my finger try to tell me Im wrong  
That never stopped me from singin my song  
I got the last laugh at the things they do  
Eliminate them at the turn of a screw  
  
I never lived by nobodys rules  
I wont be sinking on that ship of fools  
Cant push me no matter how hard they try  
Stand back its my turn to fly  
  
Chorus  
Come hell hell or high water  
Nothings gonna hold me down  
Come hell hell or high water  
Aint no body messin me around  
  
I see their wicked ways  
and miles of endless lies  
Their jaded lives  
Couldnt erase my smile  
  
But whats this shit that I just heard  
Son of a bitch youre working on my nerves  
Ill watch you choke on your last words  
Its about time you got what you deserved  
  
I never lived by nobodys rules  
I wont be sinking on that ship of fools  
Cant push me no matter how hard they try  
Stand back its my turn to fly  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive got something thats been on my mind  
Come close Ill tell you the problem that I find  
Im sick and tired of the damage youve done  
Dont blame me I aint the one  
Blame yourself for the ghosts in your past  
Kiss my ass  
  
Chorus
