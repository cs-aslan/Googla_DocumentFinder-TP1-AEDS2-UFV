If there is music there  
Ill have to go  
Never been anything in my life that I wanted more  
This is my greatest fear  
That Im loosing you my dear  
Its more than I want to give  
But if there is music there  
  
If there is music there  
Ill have to know  
Never met anyone who could take music out of my soul  
Theres something deep inside  
That I no longer want to hide  
My love you would never share  
If there is music there  
  
Its not my fault  
Ive done no wrong  
Its something that youve always known  
I tried to tell you all along  
It seems that heaven has a plan  
An extraordinary plan  
A reason for my soul  
For my soul  
  
If there music there  
Ill have to go  
Never found anyone who could take music out of my soul  
This is my greatest fear  
That Im loosing you my dear  
Its more than I want to give  
Its more than my heart can bear  
I could be losing you  
If there music there  
  
Spoken  
Im so sorry honey  
Ive always loved you  
I do love you  
But I just have to go
