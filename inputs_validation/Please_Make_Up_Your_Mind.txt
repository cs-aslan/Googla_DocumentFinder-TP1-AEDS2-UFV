When I agree with you baby it makes you mad  
And when I dont it makes you sad  
When I argue back you pack and leave  
And when I dont you pout in grieve  
There just aint nobody knows what I go through  
Will you please make up your mind what you want me to do  
You say get out and Id better stay gone  
Then you have a big policeman drag me back home  
You holler good and loud put him in the calaboose  
Then you cry and ask the judge Wont you please turn him loose  
The good Lord only knows what I go through  
Will you please make up your mind what you want me to do  
My life with you baby has been one hard knock  
Lord my head looks like an old chop block  
And Ill tell you right now honey that aint all  
You done kicked me till I feel like a used football  
There just aint nobody knows what I go through  
Will you please make up your mind what you want me to do  
You knock me down and then you pick me up  
Honey do you have to love so doggone rough  
I wish to my soul youd slow down the pace  
Cause I tell you right now the hides gettin scarce  
There just aint nobody knows what I go through  
Will you please make up your mind what you want me to do  
Why when I married you you were such a meek little thing  
But honey among tigers youd be queen  
If a poor little rabbit had you on his side  
Every hound in the country would crawl off and hide  
There just aint nobody knows what I go through  
Will you please make up your mind  
What in the confounded cat hair you want me to do
