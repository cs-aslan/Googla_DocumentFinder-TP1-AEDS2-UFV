Intro  lil wayne  
Cut the music up  
A lil louder  
Yeah  
  
Chorus  lil wayne  
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart  
Never really had luck couldnt never figure out  
How to love how to love  
You had a lot of moments that didnt last forever  
Now you in the corner tryna put it together  
How to love how to love  
  
Hook  lil wayne  
For a second you were here now you over there  
Its hard not to stare the way you moving your body  
Like you never had a love never had love  
  
Verse 1  lil wayne  
When you was just a youngun your looks were so precious  
But now your grown up so fly its like a blessing  
But you cant have a man look at you for 5 seconds  
Without you being insecure  
You never credit yourself so when you got older  
Its seems like you came back 10 times over  
Now youre sitting here in this damn corner  
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder  
  
Chorus  lil wayne  
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart  
Never really had luck couldnt never figure out  
How to love how to love

Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adios  
Me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber amar como amar  
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado  
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar como amar  
Te acuerdas de esa noche eramos adolescentes queria darte un beso  
Y tu tan inocente me tenias locamente enamorado me tenias locamente
enamorado  
Y ya lo ves lo que fue ya fue te marchaste poco a poco de mi lado y yo sigo
locamente enamorado aqui sigo locamente enamorado  
Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adios me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber
amar como amar  
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado esos ojitos negros que siguen
suplicando como amar  
  
Verse 3  lil wayne  
Ooohh see I just want you to know  
That you deserve the best  
Youre beautiful  
Youre beautiful  
Yeahh  
And I want you to know  
Youre far from the usual  
Far from the usual  
  
Chorus  lil wayne  
How to love  
You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart  
Never really had luck couldnt never figure out  
How to love how to love  
  
Enrique  
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado  
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar como amar  
  
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart  
Never really had luck couldnt never figure out  
How to love how to love  
  
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado  
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar como amar
