Cheatin is a thing that starts when you bring  
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss  
She blames him and he blames her  
Neither one is really quite sure which way it is  
And all of the time in the back of their minds  
They know theyre gonna have to lie about where theyve been  
Cheatin is a thing that takes a little ring  
And breaks into pieces thatll never go together again  
Cheatin is a part of lovin that starts  
When true love isnt what lovers are lookin for  
A stranger here a stranger there  
You turn around and swear that youll never go back for more  
And lyin at night when youre holdin him tight  
Somethin that a cheaters heart is bound to learn  
Cheatin is the thing thats guaranteed to bring  
Two unhappy people to the point of no return  
And the worst of cheatin is the sad little kids  
Hangin in the middle while mummy and daddy they choose  
Cheatin is a game where nobody wins  
And the ones that arent big enough to play are the ones who lose
