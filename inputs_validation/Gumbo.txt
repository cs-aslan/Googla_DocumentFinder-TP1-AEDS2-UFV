Theres a mouse starin out of the window  
His car is trapped in the snow  
Hes planning a family vacation  
But he just cant go  
Around the next corners a red bird  
His feathers are trapped in a sling  
Hes passed by some gunslinging parrot  
Whos jealous he aint got no grin  
  
There aint no time to stash the gumbo  
Or rattle around in a cage  
The sacrificed childs made bubbles  
And spittle is everywhere enraged  
In a hot sand or in a my feet  
Theyre blistered and caked with debris  
Chez rolez is guarding the tote board  
While Angry piddles with glee  
  
Theres a fool writing notes out on sandpaper  
Hes sending them off to himself  
He gets them a couple days later  
Who put them along his top shelf  
If you get tired of shavings  
And carve up a good hunk of wood  
Remembering to check on the sausage  
Hes got cooking somewhere look good
