Lets say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way  
Theres something wrong your love is gone Ive no reason now to stay  
We live and love we meet and part and broken hearts must pay  
Lets say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way  
Your love sweetheart I wont forget youre always on my mind  
Youre all the happiness I knew so thoughtful sweet and kind  
For old time sake Im asking you to think of me some day  
And lets say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way  
 guitar   
I wish you happiness sweetheart in everything you do  
May good luck always come your way and every dream come true  
Ill remember you and the love we knew our love of yesterday  
So lets say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way
