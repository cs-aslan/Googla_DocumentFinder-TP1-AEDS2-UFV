Take what you want the youll get what you need  
Isnt that all that were teaching  
Slowly but surely were planting the seed  
Hey listen theres no use in preaching  
  
All these years youve turned away  
Nothing left to say  
  
Vengeance  
You havent a clue  
Vengeance  
Its inside of you  
  
All of the sinners theyre playing their game  
Only the good people listen  
Over and over its always the same  
Committing the crime and yet no ones to blame  
  
All these years youve turned away  
Nothing left to say  
  
Vengeance  
You havent a clue  
Vengeance  
Its inside of you  
  
Is there a reason were losing the fight  
Stuck in this hell that were living  
Over and over its always the same  
Passing the sentence yet no ones to blame  
  
All these years youve turned away  
Nothing left to say  
  
Vengeance  
You havent a clue  
Vengeance  
Its inside of you
