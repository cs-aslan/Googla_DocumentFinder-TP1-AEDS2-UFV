You will never be no good  
No you will never be no good  
Dyou know what id do if I could  
Chop you up into firewood  
Because you have sinned far too many times  
You have sinned far too many times  
And you will pay for all your crimes  
You will never be no good  
Not not ever no good  
You know its hard to sympathise  
You know its hard to sympathise  
When you never tell nothing but lies  
And its hard to sympathise  
You say youre born in the barrel of a gun  
Some say youre born in the barrel of a gun  
You were your mothers seventh son  
And no excuse could be a good enough one  
And dont you love her madly  
You want to be her daddy  
Well that wont do you no good  
You might just slip into the priesthood  
You will never be no good  
No you will never be no good  
Dyou know what id do if I could  
And then wed all receive a knighthood  
Youll never be no good
