Meet me on the corner of close and soon  
Ill have a song in my head  
And my hands on a tune  
Nothing lasts forever  
So I figure I better  
Take you forever  
For now  
  
Meet me in the lobby of destiny  
Ill have a ribbon on my shoulders  
And a halo over me  
If nothing lasts forever  
I guess I better  
Take you forever  
For now  
  
Under a clock  
By an information desk  
Ill be there will bells on  
By an old oak  
A fountain in the park  
Just dont be long  
  
By the ticket counter for love in spring  
Ill be standin there with cupid  
And he can aim that thing  
Nothing lasts forever  
Its not a question of whether  
Ill take you forever  
For now
