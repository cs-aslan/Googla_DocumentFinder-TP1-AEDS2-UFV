Hold up  
Hold on  
Dont be scared  
Youll never change whats been and gone  
  
May your smile may your smile  
Shine on shine on  
Dont be scared dont be scared  
Your destiny may keep you warm  
  
Cause all of the stars  
Are fading away  
Just try not to worry  
Youll see them some day  
Take what you need  
And be on your way  
And stop crying your heart out  
  
Get up get up  
Come on come on  
Whyre you scared Im not afraid  
Youll never change  
Whats been and gone  
  
Cause all of the stars  
Are fading away  
Just try not to worry  
Youll see them some day  
Take what you need  
And be on your way  
And stop crying your heart out  
  
Cause all of the stars  
Are fading away  
Just try not to worry  
Youll see them some day  
Take what you need  
And be on your way  
And stop crying your heart out  
  
Were all of us stars  
Were fading away  
Just try not to worry  
Youll see us some day  
Just take what you need  
And be on your way  
And stop crying your heart out  
Stop crying your heart out  
Stop crying your heart out  
Stop crying your heart out
