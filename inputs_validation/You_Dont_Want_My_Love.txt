In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings Ill be blue  
Cause you dont want my love  
  
Some other time thats whatcha say when I want you  
Then you laugh at me and make me cry  
Cause you dont want my love  
  
You dont seem to care a thing about me  
Youd rather live without me  
Than to have my arms around you  
When the nights are cold and youre so all alone all alone  
  
Chorus  
In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings Ill be blue  
Cause you dont want my love  
  
Once upon a time you used to smile and wave to me  
And walk with me but now you dont  
Cause you dont want my love  
  
Some other guy is takin up all your time  
Now ya dont have any time for me  
Cause you dont want my love  
  
You dont seem to care a thing about me  
Youd rather live without me  
Than to have my arms around you  
When the nights are cold and youre so all alone all alone  
  
In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings Ill be blue  
Cause you dont want my love  
  
In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings Ill be blue  
Cause you dont want my love  
  
In summertime in summertime when all the leaves are green  
In the summertime Ill be blue all the time  
Cause you dont want my love
