Every other Friday  
Its toys and clothes in backpacks  
Is everybody in okay  
Lets go see dad  
Same time in the same spot  
Corner of the same old parking lot  
Half the hugs and kisses there are always sad  
We trade a couple words and looks  
And kids again  
Every other weekend  
  
Every other weekend  
Very few exceptions  
I pick up the love we made in both my arms  
Its movies on the sofa  
Grilled cheese and cut the crust off  
But thats not the way mom makes it Daddy breaks my heart  
I miss everything we used to have with her again  
Every other weekend  
  
Chorus  
I cant tell her I love her  
I cant tell him I love him  
Cause theres too many questions and ears in the car  
So I dont tell him I miss him  
I dont tell her I need her  
Shes over me thats where we are  
Hes over me thats where we are  
Were as close as we might ever be again  
Every other weekend  
  
Every other Saturday  
First thing in the morning  
I turn the TV on to make the quiet go away  
I know why but I dont know why  
We ever let this happen  
Fallin for forever was a big mistake  
Theres so much not to do and all day not do it in  
Every other weekend  
  
Every other Sunday  
I empty out my backseat  
While my children hug their mother in the parking lot  
We dont touch we dont talk much  
Maybe goodbye to each other  
As she drives away with every piece of heart Ive got  
I reconvince myself we did the right thing  
Every other weekend  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah for fifteen minutes were a family again  
God I wish that he was still with me again  
Every other weekend
