If You God do really exist  
You can hear me begg  
This one little human being here  
Wants to talk with you step forward and ahead  
  
You gave me a life  
Now show me how to live with it  
Because Im all lost in directions  
And I need your help  
  
If You truly are there Beyond the Heaven  
Answer to my prays would you please  
On my knees waiting it so thirsty like  
I havent been drinking in years  
  
If You God do really exist  
You can hear me begg  
This one little human being down here  
Wants to talk with you step forward and ahead  
  
You gave me a life  
Now show me how to live with it  
Because Im all lost in directions  
And I need your help  
  
Lord all my life Ive been owned to you  
Not an single word against yours  
Lord all Ive tried is live under your eyes  
And been a good boy  
  
But you have seen me  
All the time  
So you know that Ive fallen as well  
So forgive me  
  
If You God do really exist  
You can hear me begg  
This one little human being here  
Wants to talk with You step forward and ahead  
I need to talk with You  
I need to talk with You  
Just to talk with You
