Hack jaws and hellions dont you step on my zs  
Im gettin rather ornery bout my natural means  
Ill I want is a small piece of the pie  
A place in the sun to comfort my eyes  
North of la just south of monterey  
To santa rosa  
Im gonna break away  
Blue grass and the sycamores and the sweet eucalyptas in the air  
Mad dogs and wolf hounds running everywhere  
You can go with the flow you can bend in the breeze  
Just step to one side and then play the black keys  
North of la just south of santa jose  
To santa rosa  
Im gonna do what is right to make a better life  
Before its over  
Im gonna break away  
Angels and lucifer dont you step on my ground  
Ive got a good godfearing woman who might just shoot you down  
I love her and she loves me  
Together well raise such a sweet family  
North of la just south of monterey  
To santa rosa  
Im gonna do what I can to get the sea and sand  
Back on my shoulder  
Im gonna sail away
