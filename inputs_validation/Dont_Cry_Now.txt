If youve ever been taken for money  
If youve ever gone down with your pride  
If youve ever stood up for a good friend and lost  
You know that the river is wide  
  
Like a painter who waits for the sunrise  
With a picture in both of his hands  
Its like part of your life is already begun  
With something that you dont understand  
  
But dont cry now  
Oh dont cry now  
Dont cry now  
No dont cry now  
  
When youre lying alone in the night time  
And your loneliness turns into fear  
With the words of your memory failing and falling  
Youre drowning in a river of tears  
  
But dont cry now  
Oh dont cry now  
  
If youve ever thought much about freedom  
You might find yourself caught in some door  
With somebody you love more than Incomprehensible to my ears  
And youve been weeping but you dont know what for  
  
But dont cry now  
Oh dont cry now  
Dont cry now  
Oh dont cry now  
Dont cry now  
Woah dont cry now
