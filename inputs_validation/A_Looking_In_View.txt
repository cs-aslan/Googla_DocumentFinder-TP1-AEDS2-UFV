Hear footsteps creak the floor  
The shadows give away  
Someone outside the door  
Wont let em in  
  
Life damaged kids to crime  
Rundown broke machine  
That steals your peace of mind  
Before you know its gone  
  
Lay  
Down  
Lay  
  
Silence burning  
Hold your tongue  
Keep a separate  
So theyll know  
  
Hiding in the darkness under  
Boiling to the surface  
Dont go far  
  
A looking in view too long on the outside  
Desperate plans make sense in a low life  
A looking in view too long on the outside  
Desperate plans make sense in a low life  
  
These things I hate in you  
Also reflect it seems  
Distortion laced with spikes  
Digs you out of me  
  
Lay  
Down  
Lay  
  
Hiding in the darkness under  
Boiling to the surface  
Crawling on your skin discomfort  
Makes you brake and run stumble fall  
  
A looking in view too long on the outside  
Desperate plans make sense in a low life  
A looking in view too long on the outside  
Desperate plans make sense in a low life  
  
Its why you never tell me whatevers on your mind  
Its why you never tell me whatevers on your mind  
Its why you never tell me whatevers on your mind  
Its why you never tell me whatevers on your mind  
  
A looking in view too long on the outside  
Desperate plans make sense in a low life  
A looking in view too long on the outside  
Desperate plans make sense in a low life  
  
Its why you never tell me whatevers on your mind
