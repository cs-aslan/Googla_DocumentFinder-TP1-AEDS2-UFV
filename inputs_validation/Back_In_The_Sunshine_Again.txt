Here we are  
Back in the sunshine again  
No more worries  
No more pain  
  
Well were leaving behind all our trouble and strife  
Thats the way its gonna be oh the rest of my life  
  
Well here we are here we are back in the sunshine again  
No more worries no more worries no more pain no more pain  
  
Lifes too short to spend it lonely you only throw it away  
Listen to your voice of reason yeah call it a day ay ay ay  
  
Take a ride take a ride out to the land of the free  
Dont hurry take your time take your time  
Come spend it with me ooooh  
Back in the sunshine 2X  
  
Here we are back in the sunshine again  
No more worries no more worries no more worries  
And no more pain  
  
Lifes too short to spend it lonely you only throw it away  
Listen to your voice of reason you call it a day ay ay ay  
  
Here we are back in the sunshine again  
No more worries no more worries and no more pain  
  
Here we are here we are yeah were back in the sunshine again  
No more worries oh no and no more pain  
  
Why why were back in the sunshine again  
No more worry or pain  
Yeah were back in the sunshine again
