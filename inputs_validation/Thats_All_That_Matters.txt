I know Im not your first love  
Theyre just a past memory  
Im the one whos got you now  
And thats all that matters to me  
I know other arms have held you  
But Im not jealous of these  
Mine are the arms that hold you now  
And thats all that matters to me  
I came alive when you came along  
Yes youve brought life back to me  
And I dont care whats in your past  
Youre as far as I can see  
I know other lips have kissed you  
And I know youve been thrilled and pleased  
Mine are the lips that kiss you now  
And thats all that matters to me  
Yes mine are the arms that hold you now  
And thats all that matters to me
