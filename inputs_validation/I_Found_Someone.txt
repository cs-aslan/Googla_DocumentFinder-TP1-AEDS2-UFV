Dont you know so many things they come and go  
Like your words that once rang true  
Like the love I thought I found in you  
And I remember the thunder  
Talkin bout that fire in your eyes  
But you walked away when I needed you most  
Now maybe baby maybe baby  
  
Chorus  
I found someone to take away the heartache  
To take away the loneliness  
Ive been feelin since youve been gone  
Since youve been gone  
  
Dry your eyes I could never bear to see you cry  
Someday your love will shine through  
Show ya the feelins that ya never really knew  
But baby dont ya lose that thunder  
Talkin bout that fire in your eyes  
Youre lookin at me but ya dont believe  
Now maybe baby maybe baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Too long on the borderline  
Wonderin if your love was really mine  
But you left me with open eyes  
Thats when I realized and I realized  
  
Chorus  
And baby I found someone  
To take away the heartache  
To take away the loneliness  
Ive been livin with since youve been gone  
Since youve been gone
