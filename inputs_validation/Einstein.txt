Simple math  
Our love divided by the square root of pride  
Multiply your lifeless time  
Im going out of my mind  
It was heaven when I finally figured it out alone  
  
Chorus  
Didnt get it the first time  
But dont think Ive been so blind  
And I may not be Einstein  
But I Know  
Dumb plus dumb equals you  
Dumb plus dumb equals you  
Dumb plus dumb equals you  
  
Even had the nerves to flirt with her in front of my face  
Heres your keys your bags your clothes and now get out of my place  
You say Im crazy and that were happy  
Is that supposed to comfort me  
  
Chorus  
  
All of your promises flushed  
A thousand apologies just  
Take out the pain and then it leaves us  
With nothing at all no nothing at all  
  
You can stop wasting my time  
Without you Im just fine  
Why did it take me so long to figure out  
Dumb plus dumb equals you equals you  
  
Didnt get it the first time  
Dont think Id be so blind  
Yeah I may not be Einstein  
But I know  
  
Dumb plus dumb equals you equals you  
  
Simple math  
Our love divided by the square root of pride  
Multiply your lifeless time  
Im going out of my mind  
And I may not be Einstein  
  
But I know dumb plus dumb equals you equals you
