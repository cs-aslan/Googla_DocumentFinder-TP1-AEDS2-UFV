You dont have to look at me  
You dont have to smile at me  
You just have to love me till the sun shines  
You dont have to cook for me  
You dont have to laugh with me  
You just have to love me till the sun shines  
  
Take my money I dont mind  
You can be such a helpless kind   
You just have to love me till the sun shines  
  
You dont have to sleep with me  
Or rest your head upon my knee  
You just have to love me till the sun shines  
Baby you can wear my clothes  
Play my records stay at my home  
Long as you just love me till the sun shines  
  
You can take it I dont mind  
Please dont be such a helpless kind  
You just have to love me till the sun shines  
  
Baby baby I dont know what Im doing  
Everything I do it turns to ruin  
  
Baby you can kiss my friends  
Baby theres nothing that Ill end   
Long as you just love me till the sun shines  
You dont have to walk the streets  
When theres someone waiting here  
Come on baby love me till the sun shines  
  
Come on baby I dont mind  
Two lonely people the helpless kind   
Come on baby love me till the sun shines  
  
You dont have to look at me  
You dont have to smile at me  
You just have to love me till the sun shines  
You dont have to cook for me  
You dont have to laugh with me  
You just have to love me till the sun shines  
  
Take my money I dont mind  
You can be such a helpless kind  
You just have to love me till the sun shines
