Didnt anyone ever tell you  
Didnt anyone ever say  
Did you capture a vision of glory  
As she held out her hand today  
Its reaching to the broken heart  
Right down to where you stand  
Didnt anyone ever tell you  
This is your land  
Didnt anyone ever tell you  
It doesnt matter the last will be first  
For the sad and the meek and the righteous  
And all those who will hunger and thirst  
So let the poor in spirit know  
These dreams are not of sand  
Didnt anyone ever tell you  
This is your land  
Youll be given the robes of princes  
Youll be flying on golden wings  
You will live in pavilions of splendor  
Be surrounded by beautiful things  
So hold on to these promises  
And keep them in your hand  
Didnt anyone ever tell you  
This is your land
