If youre gonna break my heart  
Go ahead on  
Guess you think youre kinda smart  
Go ahead on  
Well youve got another girl  
And youre having fun  
Got her head in a whirl  
See what youve done  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
I said go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
  
You never call me on the phone  
Make me so sad  
Sittin all alone  
Feelin bad  
Tired of being your fool  
Cause you told me lies  
I cant take no more  
Of no alibi  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
  
For a little while  
We had a good thing goin  
Everything was peaches and cream  
But the devil in you started showin  
Do you understand now  
What I mean  
  
You put me down  
Every night  
If you want to be a clown  
Thats all right  
When its all too late  
Then youll see  
Shes done the same to you  
Like you did it to me  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
  
You put me down  
Every night  
If you want to be a clown  
Thats all right  
When its all too late  
Baby youll see  
Shes done the same to you  
Like you did it to me  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
  
Git git git  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
Youd better pack your bag  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on  
Bye bye bye  
Go ahead on  
Go ahead on
