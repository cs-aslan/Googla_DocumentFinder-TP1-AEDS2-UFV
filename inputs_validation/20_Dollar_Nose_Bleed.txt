Verse 1  
Have you ever wanted to disappear  
And join a monastery  
Go out and preach on Manic Street  
Who will I be when I wake up next to a stranger  
On a passenger plane  
Passenger plane  
  
Oh  
  
Permanent jet lag  
Please take me back please take be back  
Please take be back  
Oh oh  
Im a stray dog sick  
Please let me in please let me in  
The mad keys tripping  
Singing vows before we exchange smoke rings  
  
Chorus  
Give me a pen  
Call me Mr Benzedrine  
But dont let the doctor in  
I wanna blow off steam and  
Call me Mr Benzedrine Mr Benzedrine  
But dont let the doctor dont let the doctor in  
  
Verse 2  
It feels like fourteen karats but no clarity  
When I look at the man who would be king  
The man who would be king goes to the  
Desert to sing war his dad rehearsed  
Came back with flags on coffins and said  
We won oh we won  
  
Permanent jet lag  
Please take me back Please take me back  
Please take me back  
Oh oh  
Im a stray dog sick  
Please let me in Please let me in  
The mad keys tripping  
Singing vows before we exchange smoke rings  
  
Chorus  
Give me a pen  
Call me Mr Benzedrine  
But dont let the doctor in  
I wanna blow off steam and  
Call me Mr Benzedrine Mr Benzedrine  
But dont let the doctor dont let the doctor in

Chorus  
Call me Mr Benzedrine  
But dont let the doctor in  
I wanna blow off steam and

Have you ever wanted to disappear  
  
Its not me its you  
Actually its the taxidermy of you and me  
Untie the balloons from around my neck and ground me  
Im just a racehorse on the track  
Send me back to the glue factory  
Always thought Id float away  
And never come back  
But Ive got enough miles on my card  
To fly the boys home on my own  
But you know me I like being all alone  
And keeping you all alone  
And the charts are boring  
And the kids are snoring  
And the eagles in a sling  
You say youre not listening  
And I said Im wishing  
And I said I said
