How kind of you to think of me  
When I was out of sorts  
It really meant a lot to be  
In someone elses thoughts  
Someone elses mind  
Someone else as kind as you  
  
The thoughtfulness you showed has made  
A difference in my life  
I wont forget how unafraid  
You were that long dark night  
  
I thought that all was lost  
I thought Id never find  
A someone quite as kind as you  
  
I thought my faith had gone  
I thought there couldnt be  
A someone who was there for me  
  
How kind of you to stick by me  
During the final bout  
And listened to the referee  
As I was counted out  
  
I thought my time was up  
I thought Id never find  
A someone quite as kind as you  
  
I thought my faith had gone  
I thought there couldnt be  
A someone who was there for me  
  
How kind of you to think of me  
How kind of you
