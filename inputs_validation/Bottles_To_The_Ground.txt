You know it when its over  
Door are closing feel the sober staring at you  
You know you better take one more good look  
  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
Smashing of the glass what a super sonic sound  
You gotta pull the plug when its time to die  
Whoa whoa whoa bottles to the ground  
  
Theres a suitcase on the side walk  
Theres some records in a milk crate  
Shell be staying  
Youll be throwing whiskey over one lip  
  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
Smashing of the glass a perfect imperfect sound  
You gotta pay the piper when the rats are gone  
Whoa whoa whoa bottles to the ground  
  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
One more round then its bottles to the ground  
One more round then its bottles to the ground
