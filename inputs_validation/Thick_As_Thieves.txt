Times were so tough but not as tough as they are now  
We were so close and nothing came between us and the world  
No personal situations  
Thick as thieves us wed stick together for all time  
And we meant it but it turns out just for a while  
We stole the friendship that bound us together  
  
We stole from the schools and their libraries  
We stole from the drugs that sent us to sleep  
We stole from the drink that made us sick  
We stole anything that we couldnt keep  
And it was enough we didnt have to spoil anything  
And always be as thick as thieves

We stole everything that we could see  
But it wasnt enough and now weve gone and spoiled everything  
Now were no longer as thick as thieves

Then like a perfect stranger you walked away walked away  
Walked away walked away  
  
Thick as thieves us wed stick together for all time  
And we meant it but it turns out just for awhile  
We stole the friendship that bound us together  
  
We stole the burning sun in the open sky  
We stole the twinkling stars in the black night  
We stole the green belt fields that made us believe  
We stole everything that we could see  
  
But something came along that changes our minds  
I dont know what and I dont know why  
But we seemed to grow up in a flash of time  
While we watched our ideals helplessly unwind  
  
No were no longer as thick as thieves no  
Were not as thick as
