Kid Rock Everything I do gonna be funny  
  
New Player on the field so yield and get back  
To the wall  
Cause Im playin ya all  
Like a game  
  
KID is the name  
Some complain  
And they got a little fame  
And its a shame  
  
For what its worth  
Im down with earth  
Pourin it on like Ms Butterworth  
Rich and thick  
  
Kinda quick not slow  
The rhymes I fit into flow  
All in a row from the intro  
To the end so ho  
  
Put down the microphone and go  
Step a side as I make room to bloom  
Any opposing goo gets placed in a tomb  
As soon as I grip the mic to get loose  
  
Dont dispute cause ya got no juice  
Meanwhile I kick a rhyme from the pile  
Huh As I Cramp your style stylestyle  
  
Cramp your style Cramp your stylecramp your style  
  
Get down on your knees and pray when I break you  
Down with a sound  
Comin down with a pound  
Or a bang  
  
If you cant hang with the slang  
That I exploit  
Comin straight from Detroit  
Rough without a doubt or a question  
  
Kid Rock here in the flesh  
And addressin and defining certain issues  
To diss you he diss meaheo  
So wipe the tears from your eyes  
  
You cant hide so dont be surprised  
When I dismiss you from your throne  
And send you home  
As a Kid Rock clone  
  
Cause I can hold my own  
Like ya hold a milkbone  
Simple as this with a grip that wont quit  
So when I hit the skit  
  
Thats it  
So dont come in face with the base  
And remember your just an imitation  
Dont get buckwhile  
  
In fact dont smile  
Cause Ill pull your file  
As I Cramp your style stylestyle  
  
Cramp your style cramp your stylecramp your style  
Ill claim the boundries of my domain  
DetroitDetroit  
Fresh Im from the Midwest  
  
From MoTownFrom MoTown  
  
Im like steel or concrete yo cause Im the hardest  
Down with a label known to be the largest  
Not bein modest dont even think of tryin to hang  
Cause yo Kid Rock rolls like a Stop O  
  
I roll thick  
I roll heavy  
DNice justs keeps the pace steady  
So get ready to feel the pain  
  
Im Kid Rock drivin girls insane  
So listen rappers and get to the program  
Breakin ya down is the Kid rock slogan  
And any rapper who thinks about dissin  
  
You know what Ill say  
I got a great big dick  
So anyone who cant adjust  
Gets rust  
  
And then bites the dust  
Be ready to walk a mile  
Cause Ill smack that coolAid smile  
As I Cramp your style stylestyle  
Cramp your style cramp your stylecramp your style
