Whats wrong with you  
Cans you live by the way you preach  
You Change everytime you see someone  
And forget about the things you need  
But I know from just being around  
Its easy to go down hill  
Starting from today  
Ill seek only my lords way  
So Ill be happy free and unafraid from today  
  
Well I know that just being around  
Its easy to go down hill  
Starting from to day  
Ill seek only my lords way  
So Ill be happy free and unafraid from today
