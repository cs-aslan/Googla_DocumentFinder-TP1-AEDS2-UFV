Looking out on the morning rain  
  
I used to feel so uninspired  
  
And when I knew I had to face another day  
  
Lord it made me feel made me feel so tired  
  
Before the day I met you life was so unkind  
  
But youre the key to my peace of mind  
  
  
  
cause you make me feel  
  
You make feel  
  
You make me feel like  
  
A natural woman  
  
  
  
Oh baby what youve done to me  
  
Ooh you make me feel so good inside  
  
And I just dont want to be close to you  
  
You make me feel so aliive  
  
  
  
You make feel  
  
You make me feel like  
  
A natural woman
