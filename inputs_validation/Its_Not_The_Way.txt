We used to south of paradise  
That was okay until you put your heart on ice  
Walked out the door but you couldnt say goodbye  
Hide away and left me lonely  
When I asked you why  
You wouldnt be precise  
Now its my turn start taking my advice  
  
Its not the way that you love me  
Its not the way that you care  
  
Running down long back alleys  
Pouting like a spoiled child  
Youve been acting so crazy driving me wild  
Your heart is like an elevator  
You tell me thats just human nature  
Ive done all I can I cant seem to change you  
  
Its not the way that you love me  
Its not the way that you care  
  
Oh no its not the way  
Oh no its not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no its not the way  
  
Your love is like a nasty habit  
I finally got control but I just cant take it  
I tried to be cool but I just cant make it  
Your heart is like an elevator  
You tell me that its just human nature  
Ive done all I can but just cant change you  
  
Oh no its not the way  
Oh no its not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no its not the way  
Oh no its not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no its not the way  
  
Love is tough love is tender  
Love will make your heart surrender  
Love is sweet love is kind  
Love will always blow your mind  
  
Its not the way that you love me  
Its not the way that you care  
  
Oh no its not the way  
Oh no its not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no its not the way  
Oh no its not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no its not the way  
Oh no its not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no its not the way  
Oh no its not the way  
Listen mister to what I say
