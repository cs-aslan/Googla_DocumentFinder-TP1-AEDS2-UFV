If I dont love you this way  
If I dont love you this way  
  
If I dont love you this way  
Why do I say what I say yeah  
If I dont need you this much  
Why do I ache for your touch yeah  
  
With you it seems I can reach the stars  
With reckless hopes and dreams  
But you it seems still dont believe  
How valuable you are Im really loving you  
Not pretending to  
  
If I dont love you this strong  
Why do I beg to belong yeah  
How can you doubt that I care  
When Im with you everywhere yeah  
  
With you I find I can close my eyes  
To the world surrounding me  
And you create the sweetest things  
That I could ever be Im really loving you  
Not pretending to  
  
If I dont love you this way  
Why do I say what I say yeah  
If I dont need you this much  
Why do I ache for your touch yeah  
  
You just have to smile  
To make my life worth while  
Doesnt that explain  
That Im playin no games  
  
If I dont love you this way  
Why do I say what I say yeah  
If I dont need you this much  
Why do I ache for your touch yeah
