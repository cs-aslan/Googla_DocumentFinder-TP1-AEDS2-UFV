I hit the road wide open at seventeen  
Mama cried herself to sleep  
Lost a dad Id never seen  
Took all my childhood friends  
Guitar and a dream  
Some say I got it bad  
I say Ive got the cream  
  
No no no  
I roll into town and Im spinnin my wheels to black  
Go go go  
I hit the stage and you make me feel like Im back  
  
Im back  
Back home again  
Im back  
Back home again  
Im back  
Back home  
  
I worked from nine to five at twentytwo  
Felt good to stay alive  
Good times were far and few  
  
Trustin my hopes and dreams  
With someone who said they knew  
Just how to make ends meet  
They havent got a clue  
  
No no no  
I rolled into town and Im spinnin my wheels to black  
Go go go  
I hit the stage and you make me feel like Im back  
  
Im back  
Back home again  
Im back  
Back home again  
Im back  
Back home again  
Im back  
Back home  
Take me back  
  
Im back  
Im back  
Back home again  
Im back  
Back home again  
Im back  
Back home again  
Im back  
Back home
