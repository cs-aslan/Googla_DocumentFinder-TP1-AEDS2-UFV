Theres a good theres a bad  
Some are gay some are sad  
Theres a right theres a wrong  
Those who fit dont belong  
Well Im the bad  
And Ive got to admit  
That Im sad  
Im a little misfit  
Im in the wrong  
And thats the truth of it  
I dont belong  
Im a little misfit  
Theres the sun theres the rain  
Those in love those in pain  
Some succeed while others fail  
Some will ease someone tells  
Well Im in the rain  
And Ive got to admit  
That I gonna pay  
Im a little misfit  
Though Ive failed  
Thats the truth of it  
See me tell  
Im a little misfit  
Lifes so hard when youre far from everything  
Lifes so cold when you know you have no friends  
Well Ive lost  
And Ive got to admit  
That Ive paid the cost  
Im a little misfit  
I still grow  
And thats the truth of it  
Ill always fall  
Im a little misfit  
Well Im bad  
And Ive got to admit  
That Im sad  
Im a little misfit  
Well Im bad  
And thats the truth of it  
That makes me sad  
Im a little misfit  
Well Im lost  
And Ive got to admit  
That Ive paid the cost  
Im a little misfit  
Im so poor
