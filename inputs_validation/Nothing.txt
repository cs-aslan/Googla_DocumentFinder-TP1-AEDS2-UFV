Chorus  
Man them young niggas killing bout nothing  
Show up at the spot with the choppers like nothin  
Full fifty shots clear the block like nothin  
If you made it from the bottom to the top like nothing  
You dont owe a nigga nothing  
Nothing nothing nothing  
Nothing nothing nothing nothing  
You dont owe a nigga nothing  
Nothing nothing nothing  
Nothing nothing nothing nothing  
You dont owe a nigga  
  
Put your cups in the air Id like to make a toast  
In case it goes down yeah you know I got my toast  
And when you really from the streets thats when they hate you most  
And when you really got it then thats when they hate you close  
Knew him back in the day when we was gettin money  
Now every time I see the nigga he be actin funny  
Dont you niggas see it Im a little pressed for time  
Wanna talk about the past told em press rewind  
And I aint feelin what you sayin ho you out of place  
I have you feeling what Im sprayin yeah its on my waist  
Im trying to chill smoke a couple with my lady friend  
So they can meet me at the telly in the latest Benz  
  
Chorus  
  
Nigga you see me getting mine you better get yours  
Are you the one doing the serving or you gettin served  
Or you the one doing the jackin or you gettin jacked  
Or you the one thats goin hard or you fallin back  
And I dont believe in falling back bitch Im goin hard  
They wanna see me fucked up man I swear to God  
They praying that I fail Im praying that I rise  
I guess the hating didnt work so now they tellin lies  
Oh he aint did this and he aint did that  
Boy keep it real wit ya self you know he lived that  
You aint real you dont give em what they asking for  
Such a real nigga what the fuck you askin fo  
  
Chorus  
  
And you dont even know a nigga what you hating for  
And I aint going nowhere so what you waiting for  
Beat the street this rap shit cake and ice cream  
Fuck the selling words bitch I sold ice cream  
From the bottom to the top thats a nice dream  
How you make it out young I had a nice scheme  
And I dont owe a nigga shit better get it right  
Just know a nigga stayed down each and every night  
Hands on yeah I broke down my own things  
Hands on yeah I counted up my own chains  
Fifties over here twenties over there  
You know the rest nigga fives and singles everywhere
