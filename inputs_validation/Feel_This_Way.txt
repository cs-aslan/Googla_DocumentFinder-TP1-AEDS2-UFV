Im up and Im alright  
Push on with all my might  
Got to find a way to get away today  
  
Because I am the man  
What  
I am the man  
What  
Whos the man  
Try to front like you want to try and understand  
But you dont know man  
Through the times that we shared  
I know that you care  
And I know you  
  
And Ill go where you want to go cause I feel this way  
And I care what you got to say cause I feel this way  
So I stepped up and I said I just dont understand  
He said just come and check it out man  
  
Im up and I feel fine  
I wont drop till I get mine  
I got to find a way to get away today  
  
Because I am the man  
What  
I am the man  
What  
Whos the man  
Try to front like you want to try to understand  
But you dont know man  
Through the times that we shared  
You know that I care  
Cause I know you  
  
Here we go  
Hip hop nation vibe affiliation  
All that I need is mind emancipation  
Got to find a way to get away  
Got to find something to make me want to stay  
Cause all that I see is jaded  
Now I cant even see straight cause Im faded  
Stressed cause of strain and you know that Im leaving today  
And I care what you say but I feel this way
