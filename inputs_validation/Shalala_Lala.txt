Theres a boy in my mind and he knows Im thinkin of him  
All my way to the day and the night the stars shine above me  
Hes been gone for some time but I know I truly love him  
And Im singing a song hoping hell be back when he hears it  
  
Chorus  
My heart goes shalala lala shalala in the morning  
Oh oh oh shalala lala shalala in the sunshine  
Shalala lala shalala lala in the evening  
Shalala lala shalala lala just for you  
  
If your loves gone away just like mine you feel like crying  
Sing along maybe once maybe twice lets try it together  
Some sweet day no one knows hell return and youll be happy  
Shout it sweet in a song listen to your heart it is singin  
  
Chorus  
My heart goes shalala lala shalala in the morning  
Oh oh oh shalala lala shalala in the sunshine  
Shalala lala shalala lala in the evening  
Shalala lala shalala lala just for you  
  
If your loves gone away just like mine you feel like crying  
Sing along maybe once maybe twice lets try it together  
Some sweet day no one knows hell return and youll be happy  
Shout it sweet in a song listen to your heart it is singin  
  
Chorus  
My heart goes shalala lala shalala in the morning  
Oh oh oh shalala lala shalala in the sunshine  
Shalala lala shalala lala in the evening  
Shalala lala shalala lala just for you
