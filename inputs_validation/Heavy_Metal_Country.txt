Two connected tongues  
Flesh beginnings  
But still you couldnt taste  
Cyanide in the open skies below us  
Below us  
A two way street  
  
And oh weve eaten all the dough  
Its our chance to polist Spankys boots  
Finally see we cannot  we loath it  
But in consolation gives us cash   
  
Chorus  
Come with high regard from heavy metal country  
They write you superlove and seal it with the kick  
And now the creators skull is cracked  
Out come the underground with artificial love  
Theyre singing loud so very proud  
To show the mess they made  
At Zoo Arcade  
When something central took away their guns  
  
Sometimes Im programmed better than the other ones  
Sometimes Im programmed to shoot the shot around the world  
Sometimes Im programmed  
  
Chorus
