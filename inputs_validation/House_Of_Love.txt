She was full of lies and boredom  
It came as no surprise that she would cheat  
Her nails were long and sharp  
But she didnt play the harp  
She wasnt an angel I told her  
But she wasnt able to understand my words  
Rich pickings in reverse  
I wasnt Shakespeare  
Its simple  
Did she expect me  
To kiss her feet  
  
A very acidic tongue  
Waggled in her head  
Life was lots of fun  
At times I had to smile  
In front of everyone  
We seemed the best of friends  
Life had just begun  
When on the roof a tile began to slip  
The house of love caved in and that was it  
  
She was full of tears by nature  
It came to me so clear that she would creep  
Her eyes were stale and spun  
Like marbles in the sun  
She wasnt a princess I told her  
And so I witnessed the slaying of my life  
That lasted half the night  
  
I wasnt Jesus  
Believe me  
Our love was seedless  
And incomplete
