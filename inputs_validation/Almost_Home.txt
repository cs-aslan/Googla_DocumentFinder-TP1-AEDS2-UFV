He was sitting in the corner  
At a table all alone  
A candle burnin in the darkness  
His glass of wine was almost gone  
And something about him felt familiar  
And it made me stop and stare  
The way he held his hands before him  
Looked like he was lost in prayer  
Hey son what are you lookin at  
Why do your eyes look so sad  
Theres somethin in the way he sat there  
It made me think about my dad  
Im lookin for the answer  
Just like everyone  
I know that theres no ending  
To the love between a father and the son  
Hey son why dont you pull up one of those empty chairs  
Bring it over here by my side  
Buy me a glass of wine  
This looks like a real good place to hide  
You know Ive always been a fisherman  
Fishin for souls along the way  
You kind of remind me of my only son  
And I lost him 33 years ago today  
Im lookin for the answer  
Just like everyone  
I know that theres no ending  
To the love between a father and the son  
Theres somethin I must give you  
The compass that my father made  
Itll point you in the right direction  
In case you ever lose your way  
You know Ive got somethin here in my pocket  
This is little silver cross  
I think my son would want you to have it  
When you think all the hope is lost  
Were lookin for the answer  
Just like everyone  
We know that theres no ending  
To the love between a father and the son  
I left him sitting at his table  
But I didnt feel alone  
For a moment I could see the light  
Oh we were almost home  
For a moment I could see the light  
Oh we were almost home
