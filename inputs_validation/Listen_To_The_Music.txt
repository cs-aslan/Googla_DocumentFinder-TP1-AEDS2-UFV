Dont you feel it growing day by day  
People getting ready for the news  
Some are happy some are sad  
Woah gotta let the music play  
  
What the people need is a way to make them smile  
Aint so hard to do if you know how  
Gotta get a message get it on through  
Oh now momma dont you ask me why  
  
Repeat x3  
Oh oh oh listen to the music  
  
All the time  
  
Well I Know You know better everything I say  
Meet me in the country for a day  
Well be happy and well dance  
Oh were gonna dance our blues away  
  
And if Im feeling good to you and youre feeling good to me  
There aint nothing we cant do or say  
Feeling good feeling fine  
Oh baby let the music play  
  
Repeat x3  
Oh oh oh listen to the music  
  
All the time  
  
Like a lazy flowing river  
Surrounding castles in the sky  
And the crowd is growing bigger  
Listening for the happy sounds  
And I got to let them fly  
  
Repeat x3  
Oh oh oh listen to the music  
  
All the time
