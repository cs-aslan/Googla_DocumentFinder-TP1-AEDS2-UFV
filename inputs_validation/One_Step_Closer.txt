Baby theres a chance you ought to take  
Chance of a mistake you gotta make  
Maybe Im mistaken too  
To take my chance with you  
I need you like a shadow needs a light  
Ill follow you like morning follows night  
When nothins left ahead of you  
Ill be right behind you  
Shadows disappear at night  
We both know its a shame if you should lose one  
Why is it so hard to find  
Tell me that youre right there too  
  
One step baby  
Two steps maybe  
One step closer  
Ill be next to you  
  
Baby its a secret I cant keep  
Trouble comes and suddenly youre weak  
I dont believe you got the strength  
To fight this kind of love  
I know its risky now and then  
What with all the what ifs and the whens  
Who is there to say were wrong  
To tell us it cant be  
Come on baby please dont go  
Im heart of stone and you know why is it so hard to do  
Tell me that youre right there too baby  
Baby cant you see were runnin late  
Cant you see we aint got time to wait  
Might be that youre scared of me  
Of something you might feel  
Hold on to me baby hold on tight  
I can take us through the night all right  
Maybe I will stay here too  
Take my chance with you  
  
Shadows disappear at night  
We both know its a shame if you should lose one  
Why is it so hard to find  
Tell me that youre right there too  
  
One step baby  
Two steps maybe  
One step closer
