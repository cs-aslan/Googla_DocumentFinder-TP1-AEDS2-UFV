Call call my name  
Call it call my name  
  
I heard your voice this morning calling out my name  
It had been so long since I heard it that it didnt sound quite the same no  
But it let me know that my name had never really been spoken before  
Before the day I carried you through the bridal path door  
  
And ever since that day I havent wanted anyone but you  
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth  
  
Chorus  
I just cant stop writing songs about you  
I love you so much  
I just cant wait to get my arms around you  
And feel your touch  
If I dont see you real soon baby girl  
I might go insane  
I know its only been about 3 hours  
But I love it when you call my name  
  
I heard a voice on the news saying people want to stop the war  
If they had a love as sweet as you theyd forget what they were fighting for  
Whats the matter with the world today  
The land of the free Somebody lied  
They can bug my phone and people round my home  
Theyll only see you and me making love inside  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive never seen the moon look so lovely as the night I saw it with you  
It let me know Id never seen the moon before  
So many speak of the moon as though it had no flaws  
But to compare it to a beauty like yours would give one pause  
Nothing about you is false thats why your love is real  
God forbid if you belonged to another Id have to steal you  
Id have to take you from your man  
I might be tempted to break the law round here  
Because your beauty it gives one pause  
It slows me down  
  
Chorus
