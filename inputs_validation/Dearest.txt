I hear you calling me dearest too  
My dearest  
Im nearest than Ive ever been before  
To have you calling me dearest once more  
  
My dearest this picture  
My own memory  
Wishing this picture be reality  
  
Where do I go from here  
The lord took you away  
And if you could see me today  
I will remember you  
I will remember you  
  
My dearest sincerest  
Theres no one but you and  
Here in my heart  
Youre my dearest too  
  
Where do I go from here  
The lord took you away  
And if you could see me today  
I will remember you  
I will remember you  
  
My dearest sincerest  
Theres no one but you and  
Here in my heart  
Youre my dearest too
