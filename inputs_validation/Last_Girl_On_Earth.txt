Baby has a broken heart  
She cant belong to only one  
Until another girl is found  
  
I dont pay for anything  
My cigarettes or diamond rings  
My feet dont even touch the ground  
  
Chariots of gold  
I ride with JayZ Jared Leto  
Im a super power now they call me the tornado  
Ive got roses in my hair I belly dance and do the tango  
Sometimes I get lonely everybody told me no  
  
No one lives forever  
But thats no reason to give up  
Dont you wanna fall in love  
No such thing as heaven  
And Im the last girl on Earth  
So baby lets get it on  
  
Cleopatra used to rule  
But she got nothing on me now  
Cause Im the last girl on Earth  
  
I turn the television on  
They only play my favorite song  
Sometimes the life is great on Earth  
  
Chariots of gold  
I sit sipping cherry cola  
Caesar say hed fall in love with me if I was older  
I hold all the Mexico and I got my own roller coaster  
Sometimes I get lonely millions cant hold me now  
  
No one lives forever  
But thats no reason to give up  
Dont you wanna fall in love  
No such thing as heaven  
And Im the last girl on Earth  
So baby lets get it on  
  
I stay up late at night tryin not to think about it  
Pretend Im happy willing all the word without love  
I get so tired being on this place somehow  
Sometimes I get lonely but millions are lonely now  
  
No one lives forever  
But thats no reason to give up  
Dont you wanna fall in love  
No such thing as heaven  
And Im the last girl on Earth  
So baby lets get it on  
  
No such thing as heaven  
And Im the last girl on Earth  
So baby lets get it on
