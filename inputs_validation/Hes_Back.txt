Youre with your baby  
And youre parked alone  
On a summer night  
Youre deep in love  
But youre deeper in the woods  
You think youre doin alright  
  
You heard a voice  
Did you see that face  
Or was it just a dream  
It cant be real  
That only happens babe  
On the movie screen  
  
If you see him comin  
Get away if you can  
Hes a dangerous man  
Throws a dangerous party man  
  
Hes back  
The man behind the mask  
And hes out of control  
Hes back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
Hes going out tonight  
Going to make his rounds to get his fill  
Standing staight and tall  
Hes a ton of fun  
And hes dressed to kill  
  
You know you read he was gone  
It surely is him  
But hes back on the prowl  
Again and again and again  
  
Dont you know  
Hes back  
The man behind the mask  
And hes out of control  
Hes back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
You know you read he was gone  
It surely is him  
But hes back on the prowl  
Again and again and again  
  
Hes back  
The man behind the mask  
And hes out of control  
Hes back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
Hes back  
The man behind the mask  
And hes out of control  
Hes back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
Hes back  
The man behind the mask  
And hes out of control  
Hes back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
Hes back
