Theres no escape from the ones who harassin  
The reason for the illin is the reason for askin  
Now I try to school em on the killin and blastin  
But season after season they recycle assassins now  
  
Hes too advanced for his own good  
He didnt get a second chance to see the glock pointed at his hood  
Makin his way through the rain hes caught in the game  
He felt the pain of a slug to the back of the brain  
Nothins changed in a city flask  
Where niggas lurk in black shirts pants and low hats forever  
Until the job is done and no ones left  
My man Jeff told me with his very last breath  
To watch moms  
But they got her with the car bomb  
Pop tried to save her second blast got his arm  
Niggas play for keeps like casino  
Babys has got fathers just got back from doin Chino  
With nothin to lose loose screws in the attic  
The only skill a nigga knows is how to strip an automatic  
And stash the barrel stab a nigga something terrible  
Death resume 20 kill in incredible time  
No guilt and shame  
On the mind stuck a nigga for lookin didnt know he was blind  
So I find  
Mankind is a serious threat  
To another others kind when theres something to get  
In a vet gonna fast jet to the spot to see what they got  
Nobody saw shit cause its not  
Cool to brake the rule of the code of the streets  
Niggas frightened by the visions of the blood on the sheets  
And its deep how blood drys as a mother crys  
Open eyes gettin landed on by flys  
Theres no disgues for the ones who harassin  
The reason for the illin is the reason for askin now  
  
Theres no escape from the ones who harassin  
The reason for the illin is the reason for askin  
Now I try to school em on the killin and blastin  
But season after season they recycle assassins now  
  
I came from a family of one girl and three boys  
Fuck playin with toys our fun was on the block  
Watchin all the cats negotate the neighborhood stock  
My job was to come runnin whenever cops was comin  
My older brother I figure was the ring leader  
Whenever these cats move they all bring heaters  
All black and nickel plated cmon  
Soon became fasinated bitches cars and kicks  
And look at how fast they made it  
My younger brother gave less than a fuck he was content  
With GI Joe and Tonka trucks  
But I want butts livin first class delux  
15 years old soldier ready to serve these clucks  
My older brother was touched  
Its a game where you dont play gotta have cane  
Crack house for my birthday  
The next day my brother shot in cold blood by the police  
In a rage he lived but he payed the price  
Caught with keys 25 to life  
Takin in by the crew time to standed on my own two cmon nigga  
But as I marinated thinkin about the hood  
I really cant remember my body doin good  
For long big decisions somebody got to make em  
Undercover recognize the face now cant shake a  
Phone tap what and now Im in the belly of the beast  
Use to sittin in leather sheets now Im sittin awaitin release  
Visitors day my younger brother came down  
Put the toys down excited about the first round  
He bust I was crushed to finally see  
The solution to the problem could of started with me  
Its on now  
  
Theres no escape from the ones who harassin  
The reason for the illin is the reason for askin  
Now I try to school em on the killin and blastin  
But season after season they recycle assassins now
