The sun that is rising is glistening down on the hill  
The pool of confusion is silently still  
The thoughts of another keep runnin through my mind  
As I search for the answer its never easy to find  
  
The prophet stood on the hill and firmly he gripped his sword  
As the angels of wisdom were singing a heavenly chord  
So I look back and wonder if I should be asking for more  
As a traveller in limbo whos washed up onto the wrong shore  
  
In the morning when I wake up  
And the story starts to break up  
Then its plain to see  
Whats wrong with me  
So the curtains they are drawn back  
And my mind is simply torn back  
To reality you see to me Im just a misty dreamer  
  
I slipped by the waterslide  
And I thought I heard my true love screamin  
So I opened my eyes and shook my head  
And I realized I was only dreamin  
  
So close your eyes and drift away  
Tomorrow seems like yesterday for you  
  
Your conscience guided by a light  
Your memory wont be here tonight  
The sorrow that eyes are showing  
Doesnt hide your spirit flowing  
  
So close your eyes and drift away  
Tomorrow seems like yesterday for you  
  
Drift away  
Tomorrow seems like yesterday for you
