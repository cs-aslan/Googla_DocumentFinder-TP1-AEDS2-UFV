I was running late again picking up a few things  
And there you were on isle 13  
I felt that old rush when you saw me you blushed  
Like you did when you were sweet sixteen  
They said you looked lost on the dance floor  
With a lonely look in your eyes  
Dont know why I didnt show to this day I still dont know  
For once I wish I hadnt thought twice  
Then your folks split up and you moved to Colorado  
And I headed out to Tennessee  
Heard you got married and you moved back home  
Here we are again you and me  
  
Its no surprise the light in your little girls eyes  
Shines like the ring on your hand  
Annie I owe you a dance  
  
Dont the years fly by in the blink of an eye  
Yeah loves Ive had a few  
Ive been a million places and Ive seen a million faces  
But I couldnt stop thinking bout you  
Remember how wed talk for hours keeping each others secrets  
Made a promise Id take you to homecoming  
But Annie I didnt keep it  
Almost called you up when I played it bolder  
But I thought Id just let it be  
Heard you found yourself a real good man  
Do you ever think of you and me  
  
Its no surprise the light in your little girls eyes  
Shines like the ring on your hand  
Annie I owe you a dance  
  
So put your groceries in the basket Im so sorry now Im asking  
Like I should have twenty years ago  
And I know its all over Im just looking for some closure  
And theres a song on the radio  
You give me your hand and we start to dance  
The cashier gives us a smile  
As you turn and walk away I hear your little girl say  
Momma who was that guy  
I shouldnt be surprised look forgiveness in your eyes  
Gave me a second chance  
Annie thanks for the dance
