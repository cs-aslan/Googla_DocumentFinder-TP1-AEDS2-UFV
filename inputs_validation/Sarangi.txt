Suffocate your love  
In a barrel full of doubt  
Suffocate your love  
North east and south  
  
Here I stand  
In front of your imagination  
Here I stand  
  
Hesitate its normal  
You cant erase mistakes  
Hesitate its normal  
I cant keep awake  
  
Here I stand  
In front of your imagination  
Here I stand  
  
Come closer  
Its you I want to embrace  
Come closer  
Its you I want to debase  
  
Here I stand  
In front of your imagination  
Here I stand
