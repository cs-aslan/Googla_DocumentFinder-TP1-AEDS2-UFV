Lady  
Lady Im your knight in shining armor and I love you  
You have made me what I am and I am yours  
My love theres so many ways I want to say I love you  
Let me hold you in my arms forever more  
You have gone and made me such a fool  
Im so lost in your love  
And oh we belong together  
Wont you believe in my song  
Lady for so many years I thought Id never find you  
You have come into my life and made me whole  
Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning  
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear  
In my eyes I see no one else but you  
Theres no other love like our love  
And yes oh yes Ill always want you near me  
Ive waited for you so long  
Lady your loves the only love I need  
And beside me is where I want you to be  
Cause my love theres something I want you to know  
Youre the love of my life youre my lady
