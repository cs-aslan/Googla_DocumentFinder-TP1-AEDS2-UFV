Lets get down  
Lets get down  
  
You claim youve been waiting  
With no game  
Just anticipating  
How it would be  
If you and I were in the sack  
But to me  
You look like you wouldnt know how to act  
  
I need someone to hold me  
All night long  
It must be you my darling  
Am I wrong  
It aint a damn thing baby  
Show me what you can bring  
Cause some try to swing but they still cant hang  
  
You and me lets get down  
Even though you claim that youve been around  
I betcha cant hang  
I betcha cant hang  
  
You and me lets get down  
Even though you claim that youve been around  
I betcha cant hang  
I betcha cant hang  
  
You claim you can do this this and that  
Aint no shame in my game  
If its wack I gotta tell you that  
So you betta be  
Up on your down stroke  
You gotta know how to keep this boat afloat  
Cause in my mind think your gonna slip baby  
  
I need someone to hold me  
All night long  
It must be you my darling  
Am I wrong  
It aint a damn thing baby  
Show me what you can bring  
Cause some try to swing  
But they still cant hang  
  
You and me lets get down  
Even though you claim that youve been around  
I betcha cant hang  
I betcha cant hang  
  
You and me lets get down  
Even though you claim that youve been around  
I betcha cant hang  
I betcha cant hang  
  
You talk alot of this  
And you talk alot of that  
Is it all fact  
Brotha man are you Phat  
Cause if its on the real  
I come with mad sex appeal  
Flip light delicous  
You know the deal  
Hey thats me  
I be the chic  
The one with the physique  
I freak you in the sheets  
I take a nigga deep down under  
I make him wonder  
How to make the lighting come before the thunder  
Thats the pleasure I bring  
I make a nigga get up and sing  
Tinga linga ling ling  
I got the pow  
Da boogie and the bang bang  
You cant hang dont talk da game  
  
You and me lets get down  
Even though you claim that youve been around  
I betcha cant hang  
I betcha cant hang  
  
You and me lets get down  
Even though you claim that youve been around  
I betcha cant hang  
I betcha cant hang
