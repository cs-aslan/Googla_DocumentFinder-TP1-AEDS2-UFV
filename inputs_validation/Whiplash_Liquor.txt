Suburban white alcoholic trash  
We aint glam and we aint trash  
Were victims of a society  
That fucks with me about sobriety  
  
They say dont drink this and dont drink that  
Cause it does a little more than just make you fat  
Its a serious disease that you learn about in school  
And if your dads an alcoholic youll be one too  
  
Mom and dad dont have a clue  
The onefiftyone is now eighty proof  
And all the times I borrowed the car  
Not as a ride but as a shitface bar  
  
Fuck yeah I got the venom in my veins  
God damn This shit is drivin me insane  
Boo ya I aint ever gonna be the same  
Whiplash liquor sure is quicker  
Makes you sicker its the best  
  
Weekend comes and my parents are gone  
Its time to party once I mow the lawn  
Havin fun aint that a fact  
Its rock n roll in the culdesac  
  
Invite everyone and your neighbors too  
Its gonna be a whacked out rock n roll zoo  
But dont be blabbin it around my mother  
But invite everyone and your skate rat brother  
  
Fuck yeah I got the venom in my veins  
God damn This shit is drivin me insane  
Boo ya I aint ever gonna be the same  
Whiplash liquor sure is quicker  
Makes you sicker its the best
