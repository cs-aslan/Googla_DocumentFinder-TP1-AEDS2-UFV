Youve made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelins in the middle of December  
Strangers meet and they willingly surrender  
Oh What a Christmas to remember  
Almost went to Aspen but something told me no  
I considered Mammoth but there wasnt enough snow  
And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go  
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes  
  
And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way  
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet  
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood  
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and  
  
Youve made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelins in the middle of December  
Change the radio and Ill turn the lights down dimmer  
Oh What a Christmas to remember  
  
Strangers when we met lovers as we leave  
Christmas to remember too good to believe  
Dont know how or when but I know well meet again  
Well come blowin back to somewhere like some wild restless winters wind  
  
And youve made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelins in the middle of December  
Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender  
Oh What a Christmas to remember  
  
We loved and laughed and played and joked  
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks  
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes  
Then to the lodge for dinner  
But now its time for us to go  
As our hearts melt like chimney snow  
Theres just one thing I want to know  
Can we do this next winter  
Oh What a Christmas to remember  
  
Youve made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelins in the middle of December  
Though the fire is hot well just have to let it simmer  
Oh What a Christmas to remember  
  
Youve made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelins in the middle of December  
Though its cold outside well just stroke the burning embers  
Oh What a Christmas to remember
