Beautiful girls all over the world  
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted  
They got nothin on you baby  
Nothin on you baby  
  
They might say hi and I might say hey  
But you shouldnt worry about what they say  
Cause they got nothin on you baby  
Nothin on you baby  
  
No no no nothin on you babe  
No no nothin on you  
I know you feel where Im coming from  
Regardless of the things in my past that Ive done  
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun  
On the carousel so around I spun spun  
With no directions just tryna get some some  
Tryna chase skirts living in the summer sun sun  
An so I lost more than I had ever won  
And honestly I ended up with none  
  
Theres so much nonsense  
Its on my conscience  
Im thinking baby I should get it out  
And I dont wanna sound redundant  
But I was wondering if there was something that you wanna know  
That you wanna know  
But never mind that we should let it go we should let it go  
Cause we dont wanna be a tv episode tv episode  
And all the bad thoughts just let them go go go go

Hands down there will never be another one  
I been around and I never seen another one  
Because your style I aint really got nothin on  
And you wow when you got nothin on  
Baby you the whole package plus you pay your taxes  
And you keep it real while them other stay plastic  
Youre my Wonder Women call me Mr Fantastic  
Stop now think about it  
  
Ive been to London Ive been to Paris  
Even way out there in Tokyo  
Back home down in Georgia to New Orleans  
But you always steal the show steal the show  
And just like that girl you got a fro got a fro  
Like a Nintendo 64 64  
If you never knew well now you know know know know
