Well Im on the brink of something horrible  
Just what it is Im not to sure  
But I cant take it anymore round 1 fight  
  
I cant explain the feeling that I feel  
Im not even sure that theyre for real  
Doesnt work to end in sour tales  
Go to sleep so I can wake up  
Wondering why things are this way  
What the fuck did I just say  
To make you hate me any way  
  
Im on the brink I lost my self control  
I didnt think that this would happen to me anymore  
Just want to be a babe for once  
  
I cant explain the feelings that I feel  
Im not even sure if theyre for real  
Doesnt work to end in sour tales  
Go to sleep so I can wake up  
Wondering why things are this way  
What the fuck did I say  
To make you hate me any way  
You Lose
