Words nothing but words  
For me to show  
How much my love for you unfolds  
Through trouble and fears  
This love feels so real  
And I need you to know  
  
Even though were far apart  
Youre right beside me in my heart  
  
Chorus  
Dont you know my love is here  
Dont you know my love is real  
You should know by now  
This much is true  
My love is here for you  
  
Time nothing but time  
To make up your mind  
Ill give you all that you need  
I want you to know  
Ill never let go  
Til you come back to me  
  
Even though youre far away  
Im right beside you day by day  
  
Chorus  
Dont you know my love is here  
Dont you know my love is real  
You should know by now  
This much is true  
My love is here for you  
  
Even though were far apart  
Youre right beside me in my heart  
  
Dont you know my love is here  
Dont you know my love is real for you  
You should know by now  
This much is true  
My love is here for you
