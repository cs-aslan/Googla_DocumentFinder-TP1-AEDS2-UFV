When I saw you this morning baby  
Tell me why did you walk away  
When I saw you this morning baby  
Tell me why did you walk away  
Cant believe that you dont want me  
I thought our love was here to stay  
  
Buzz me buzz me buzz me baby  
Ill be waiting for your call  
Buzz me buzz me buzz me baby  
Ill be waiting for your call  
If you forgot the number  
Come on over  
You wont have to call at all  
  
I never lied to no one  
I aint gonna lie to you  
When I say Im yours forever  
Every word I say is true  
Buzz me baby  
Ill be waiting for your call  
If you forgot the number  
Come on over  
You wont have to call at all  
  
Buzz me buzz me buzz me baby  
You mean so awfully much to me  
Buzz me buzz me buzz me baby  
Im like a ship thats lost at sea  
But when I get my arms around you  
I aint gonna let go till 1953
