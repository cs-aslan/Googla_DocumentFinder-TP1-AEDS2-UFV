Im politically incorrect  
and damn proud of it  
I love my country  
but Im scared to death of its government  
Ya believe what you read  
cause its all that they give ya  
Cause all of history is written by winners  
Im engaged in a frenzy  
of mass selfdestruction  
I feed upon your famine to fuel my corruption  
Im wholeselling hatred  
and international incest  
To carnivorous hyenas in a global theft fest  
Ive mastered the arts of death  
and foreign nations genocide  
And those who turn on me  
commit national suicide  
  
Im the queen of the global dream  
And I rule a declining nation  
I sit and watch all the violent screams  
From the throne of your desperation  
I killed them all and stole their land  
Enslaved the blacks and slaughtered the red man  
In God we trusted and I gave birth  
To would be kings to rule the earth  
  
I have more pigs than I have tits to feed  
I embrace the worlds phoney leaders  
And hold the sucklings to my breast  
And Id fool you all as Id feed ya  
Ill prop you up then strike you down  
And lick your blood up from your ground  
Humptyfuckindumpty  
My empires falling down  
  
The hour is late the clock of destiny is ticking out America has become a
schizophrenic personality For years most of these people have been dominated
politically exploited economically segregated and humiliated by some foreign
power America has trampled over the dream The price that the United States
must pay is the price of its own destruction  
  
Breakdown Goodbye America  
So long the musics died  
Freedoms last heros wasted  
I made you Ill break you  
Breakdown Goodbye America  
Its all gone kiss it goodbye  
There on bloody bended knees where  
my nation died
