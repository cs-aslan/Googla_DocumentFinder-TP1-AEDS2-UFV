Do you believe in magic in a young girls heart  
How the music can free her whenever it starts  
And its magic if the music is groovy  
It makes you feel happy like an oldtime movie  
Ill tell you about the magic and itll free her soul  
But Its like trying to tell a stranger bout rock and roll  
  
If you believe in magic dont bother to choose  
If its jug band music or rhythm and blues  
Just go and listen itll start with a smile  
It wont wipe off your face no matter how hard you try  
Your feet start tapping and you cant seem to find  
How you got there so just blow your mind  
  
If you believe in magic come along with me  
And well dance until morning till theres just you and me  
And maybe if the music is right  
Ill meet you tomorrow sort of late at night  
And well go dancing baby then youll see  
How the magics in the music and the musics in me  
  
Yeah do you believe in magic yeah  
Believe in the magic of a young girls soul  
Believe in the magic of a rock and roll  
Believe in the magic that can set you free  
Aaahhh Im talkin bout the magic  
  
Do you believe in magic yeah  
Do you believe like I believe  
Now do you believe like I believe in magic  
Do you believe like I believe  
Do you believe like I believe
