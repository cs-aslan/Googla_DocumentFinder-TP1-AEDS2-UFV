Ive been away from home  
Was outta sight  
No other change has come  
Who let the boredom in  
  
We got our rockin rights  
Well overcome  
The mirror never lies  
Well show em how its done  
  
We always dress in black  
To be unkind  
We always dress in black  
With you in mind  
  
Its the way of life we live you know where we are coming from  
Its the way of life we live in and were not wrong  
cause its the way of life we live you know where we are coming from  
Its the way of life we live in we are the strong  
  
We never will deceive  
Take no doubletalk  
And all the fat cats bull  
Dont like the way we walk  
  
They spit behind our backs  
Unwelcomed class  
But its way down deep  
They want to be like us  
  
We always dress in black  
Its the way of life we live  
Time is ticking by  
For you life is such a lie  
You clipped your wings to fly  
You could have had it all but  
  
Work nine to five  
Finish fiftyfive  
Only born to die  
You ever been alive  
  
We always dress in black  
Its the way of life we live
