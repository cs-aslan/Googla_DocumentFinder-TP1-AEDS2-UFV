Day after day  
They send my friends away  
To mansions cold and grey  
To the far side of town  
Where the thin men stalk the streets  
While the sane stay underground  
  
Day after day  
They tell me I can go  
They tell me I can blow  
To the far side of town  
Where its pointless to be high  
Cause its such a long way down  
  
So I tell them that  
I can fly I will scream I will break my arm  
I will do me harm  
Here I stand foot in hand talking to my wall  
Im not quite right at allam I  
  
Dont set me free Im as heavy as can be  
Just my librium and me  
And my EST makes three  
  
Cause Id rather stay here  
With all the madmen  
Than perish with the sad men roaming free  
And Id rather play here  
With all the madmen  
For Im quite content theyre all as sane  
As me  
  
Where can the horizon lie  
When a nation hides  
Its organic minds  
In a cellardark and grim  
They must be very dim  
  
Day after day  
They take some brain away  
Then turn my face around  
To the far side of town  
And tell me that its real  
Then ask me how I feel  
  
Here I stand foot in hand talking to my wall  
Im not quite right at all  
  
Dont set me free Im as helpless as can be  
My libidos split on me  
Gimme some good ole lobotomy  
  
Cause Id rather stay here  
With all the madmen  
Than perish with the sad men  
Roaming free  
And Id rather play here  
With all the madmen  
For Im quite content  
Theyre all as sane as me
