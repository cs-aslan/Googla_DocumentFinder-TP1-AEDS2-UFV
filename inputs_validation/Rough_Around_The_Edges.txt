I knew a man a long long time  
But I never knew him at all  
Small in stature big at heart  
Oh he always stood tall  
  
From the time that he was born  
He had a style all his own  
In my mind he could do no wrong  
Misunderstood all along  
  
He worked hard all his life  
To get what he has today  
We would all be better off if we could  
Hear those words that he had to say  
  
Chorus  
He was a little rough around the edges  
And through it all we all knew he was  
A little rough around the edges  
Simple in mind but always had a kind eye for you  
Oh for you for you  
  
He took me by the hand  
And said son whats your plan  
I wont stop you or stand in your way  
Someday youll be a man  
  
I looked at him with hungry eyes  
That only youth can know  
With all his wisdom and all his years  
He said Ill teach you all that you need to know  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont stop now keep moving  
Dont worry about where youre going Ill hear you  
Youll feel me Im there no matter where you go  
  
Chorus  
  
He was a little rough around the edges  
He was a little rough around the edges  
Simple in mind oh oh  
Simple in mind oh oh
