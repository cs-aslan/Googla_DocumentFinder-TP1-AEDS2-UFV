Ratha eat piranha from Benny Hana  
Smokin marijuana in my sauna

We like to roam  
Through yo motherfuckin home like a comb  
And find the money thats gone  
And well take you shake you  
Break you take two  
Play you on wit the chrome  
Nigga shoot  
Execute they try to electrocute  
I got too much loot  
Ya say Im on yo hit list  
You niggas miss  
Tryin to turn my motherfuckin cheese into Swiss  
Rappers make bucks and I can hear it  
Hard to fear it  
cause I know you grew up on my lyrics  
Its the boss player  
Never lost hair over assholes  
Blast holes in you motherfuckin tadpoles  
Like a bullfrog  
Nigga Im a bull hog  
Guppies get worked like puppies by the bulldog  
Where millions never gave a fuck about Sicilians  
Or killers on TV can see  
We got the real ones  
So check yo motherfuckin CDRom  
And your World Wide Web dot com  
Its the Don Mega  
  
Make yo hustle official  
And them niggas thats wit you  
Gotta push the issue  
On the fools that dis you  
Whether pump or pistol
