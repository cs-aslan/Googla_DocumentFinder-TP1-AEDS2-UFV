When we were together  
Those were the happiest time in all my life  
Now were separated I dont know what I will do  
Cause I cant ever love another  
No matter how hard I try  
Cause I know Its impossible  
Where ever you may be  
I hope youll hear my song  
Then maybe youll realise  
My love that you were wrong  
  
Cause I cant ever love another  
No matter how hard I try  
Cause I know Its impossible  
  
The sunset outside my window  
Has lost all its glow  
The rose in the garden  
Doesnt bloom any more
