Dont I need a savior  
Just to bail me out  
Ill hold my breath  
Until the water lets me out  
And I say  
Alimony never can pay  
Hey hey hey  
Im on the breadline  
Your on the answer phone  
Youre off the hook  
And Im left all alone  
Its a shame  
Passion isnt always to blame  
Hey hey hey  
Oh I dont need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
Oh I dont need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
Dont say dont say dont say  
Its a crime  
Just give me sweet revenge  
Im undercover  
My love has overgrown  
Retaliation is emotion  
I have shown  
And I say  
All the money never can pay  
Hey hey hey  
Im on the level  
Youre on the second floor  
Im counting seconds  
As my hand goes for the door  
Its a shame  
Pleasure isnt always the same  
Hey hey hey  
Oh I dont need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
Oh I dont need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
Dont say dont say dont say  
Its a crime  
Just give me sweet revenge  
I need revenge for love revenge for love  
Revenge for love revenge for love  
Dont I need a savior  
Just to bail me out  
Ill hold my breath  
Until the water lets me out  
And I say  
Alimony never can pay  
Hey hey hey  
Oh I dont need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
Oh I dont need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
Dont say dont say dont say  
Its a crime  
Just give me sweet revenge  
Oh I needed I needed I needed  
Revenge for love  
Sweet revenge for love  
Oh I dont need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
Dont say dont say dont say  
Its a crime  
Just give me sweet revenge
