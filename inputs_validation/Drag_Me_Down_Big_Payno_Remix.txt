Verse 1 Lunchmoney Lewis  
Down  
Ever since you came around  
Everybody wanna drag us down  
Is it cause we look too happy  
Ill never forget when you looked at me  
And told me it was all mine  
I remember that like yesterday  
It was a summer night on the west side  
That was last summer we had the best times yeah  
We crossed paths like an intersection  
Now we both headed in one direction  
  
Chorus Liam and All  
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights they cant blind me  
With your love nobody can drag me down  
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights they cant blind me  
With your love nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down  
  
Verse 2 Harry  
Ive got fire for a heart Im not scared of the dark  
Youve never seen it look so easy  
I got a river for a soul and baby youre a boat  
Baby youre my only reason  
  
Verse 3 Louis  
If I didnt have you there would be nothing left  
The shell of a man who could never be his best  
If I didnt have you Id never see the sun  
You taught me how to be someone yeah  
  
Chorus All  
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights they cant blind me

Nobody can drag me down  
Nobody nobody  
Nobody nobody

She a work of art like Van Gogh

Yall lame niggas cant drag me down  
  
Chorus All  
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights they cant blind me

Nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down
