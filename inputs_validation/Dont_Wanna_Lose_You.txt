Dont wanna lose you right now  
Dont wanna lose you  
Dont wanna lose you right now  
Dont wanna lose you  
  
You know I cant see straight  
And Im feelin dizzy  
  
I cant feel my face  
Against the hard wood floor  
  
Im gonna tell you right now  
I guess our very last day  
Im afraid for my life  
Cause I would lose you  
  
Dont wanna lose you right now  
Dont wanna lose you  
Dont wanna lose you right now  
Dont wanna lose you  
  
I had dreams last night  
While you still were sleeping  
I can see my faith  
Runnin out the backdoor  
Im going to tell you right now  
Like its the very last day  
  
And Im afraid for my life  
Cause I will lose you  
  
Dont wanna lose you right now  
Dont wanna lose you  
Dont wanna lose you right now  
Dont wanna lose you  
  
Im gonna tell you right now  
I guess our very last day  
Im afraid for my life  
Cause I would lose you  
  
Dont wanna lose you right now  
Dont wanna lose you  
Dont wanna lose you right now  
Dont wanna lose you
