She bought a bottle of cider  
From the shop on the corner  
They didnt stop her  
Thought she was older  
  
She took a bus ride  
To a name and a number  
A house full of music  
And a hatful of wonder  
  
And some of the people  
That she thought that she knew  
Were never like this  
When she saw them at school  
Shes never been anywhere like this before  
Everybodys so out of control  
  
She was in a back room  
Full of strange aromas  
And noises and candles  
That was where he found her  
  
He took her to a garden  
Full of rain and silence  
And she could smell the soil and the trees  
And see the succulent light from the little fires in his eyes  
Pulling shapes out of the night  
She was enchanted  
  
Then its twelve oclock  
And the last bus is gone  
Theyre gonna go crazy  
When they hear what shes done  
And higher is lower  
And less is like more  
Shes never felt anything like this before  
  
And then it was yesterday  
He said Oh by the way  
Welcome to your first party
