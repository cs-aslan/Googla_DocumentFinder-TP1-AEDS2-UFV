Im alone now  
Staring at the cieling  
uh uh  
Im kina bored now  
I cant sleep  
I cant sleep uh uh  
  
And you only can make my life complete  
uh uh Ah i  
And when you come you slip into a dream  
uh uh Ah i  
  
When its late at night and youre fast asleep  
I let my fingers do the walking  
I press record I become a fiend  
While no one else is watching  
I let my fingers do the walking  
  
sth mmm  
  
Im starving sth  
For some attention  
Im begging pleading bleeding  
For a suggestion  
uh uh uh  
  
I bite my tongue because I wanna scream  
uh uh Ah i  
Im almost there then you turn and look at me  
uh uh Ah ie  
  
When its late at night and youre fast asleep  
I let my fingers do the walking  
I press record I become a fiend  
  
While no one else is watching  
I let my fingers do the walking  
  
Rewind and you will see  
You will see  
While in the morning im happy  
Im happy  
Right there on the tv screen  
On the tv  
Me vengo me vengo  
  
Im restless  
You need some caffeine  
ah ha ha ha  
Im wasted  
If you could only see  
Only see  
  
Cuz I need more than you are gonna give  
uh uh Ah i  
  
When its late at night and youre fast a sleep  
I let my fingers do the walking  
ahhhhhh  
I press record I become a fiend  
While no one else is watching  
no no no no  
  
When its late at night and youre fast asleep  
I let my fingers do the walking  
My fingers do the walking  
I press record I become a fiend  
While no one else is watching  
No one else is watching  
I let my fingers do the walking
