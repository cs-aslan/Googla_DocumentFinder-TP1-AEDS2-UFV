Kiss me from head to toe  
Ooh baby I love you so I know  
My sweet love aint gon stop

Lollilollipoppop boppin down the blockblock  
Ive been lovin you since junior high ma you got  
Everything I need everything I want  
Youre the type of dime a real player want to flaunt  
Lovin them lips and the shape of them hips  
When I see you in that whack brothers whip I FLIP  
I hate your boyfriend that cat is corny  
I kick it to you and I dare that clown to run up on me  
When nights are stormy I be thinkin about your pretty smile gritty style  
But duke got you locked down like Rikers Isle  
I want to break your man off I cant control it Im a hater  
Especially when your perfume lingers inside the elevator  
Youre the one the only one  
That I would beg to give me some  
Playerisms for life eternal flossin proceed with caution  
Baby toss him divorce him let the boss in  
  
Chorus  
  
So ballistic mystic twisted  
In my dreams I kissed it never missed it I frisked it  
Searched it worked it lollipopped it and jerked it  
You followed swallowed scratch my back baby burped it  
Red Passion high fashion  
Nobody got to know Im smashin Im sayin shorty  
Rock Miss Thang playin childish games  
Standin on the corner knowin damn well I want to blaze  
Sweet get to it anywhere you like  
On the rooftop at midnight  
The project stairs Ill be there  
Runnin my fingers through your hair  
Anyway the untouchable magnetic  
Kissable lovable huggable energetic call a medic  
Your manll regret it when I hit it Im athletic  
Energize your thighs youll recognize the size  
Its epidemic  
  
Chorus  
  
When whyall alone in the Brooklyn brownstone  
Starin at the high ceiling what a feeling  
Clothes peeling finally youre double dealing  
Im walkin hes wheeling its unreal when  
You got the dime of your fantasies  
My lollipop ecstasys on top of me  
Just like I thought its a small world after all  
I dont care if your neighbors hear us down the hall  
Make em jealous what they gon tell us  
If you dont tell your girls baby I wont tell the fellas  
If you dont plea I orchestrated icebergisms  
Visions of my lollipops thick risen for my wisdom  
Plop plop fizzdom what I give them  
Make yea baby right there my new anthem  
I love you baby take it deep deep deep  
Deep deep deep now go to sleep  
  
Chorus
