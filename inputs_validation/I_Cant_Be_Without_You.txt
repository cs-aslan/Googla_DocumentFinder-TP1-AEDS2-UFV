Sometimes I dont feel alive  
Why do I keep running from the truth  
I can see it in my eyes  
Wheres the happiness that I once knew  
  
Im so tired of this place  
I wanna hear your voice  
I wanna see your face  
I cant escape the way I feel about you  
  
I dont wanna know another day without you  
Wont you call my name  
Cause I cant be without you  
  
I keep my head to the sky  
Waiting for the day that youll come through  
I am free within my mind  
Cause I know that it is coming soon  
  
Im so tired of this place  
I wanna hear your voice  
I wanna see your face  
I cant escape the way I feel about you  
  
I dont wanna know another day without you  
Wont you call my name  
Cause I cant be without you  
  
I dont wanna know another day without you  
Wont you call my name  
Cause I cant be without you  
  
Im so tired of this place  
I wanna hear your voice  
I wanna see your face  
I cant escape the way I feel about you  
  
I dont wanna know another day without you  
Wont you call my name  
Cause I cant be without you  
  
I dont wanna know another day without you  
Wont you call my name  
Cause I cant be without you  
  
I dont wanna know  
I dont wanna know  
I dont wanna know another day with you ah
