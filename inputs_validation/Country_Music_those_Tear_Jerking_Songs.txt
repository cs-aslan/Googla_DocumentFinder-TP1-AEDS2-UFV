Oh show me a home with a back breakin lawn  
And a wife that nudge night and day  
And Ill show you a man with a drink in his hand  
Who stands over the jukebox and plays  
  
Country music those tear jerking songs  
About life the way it really is  
Hes not happy at home so hell play them old songs  
And dance with someone thats not his  
  
When the man of the house has trouble with his spouse  
And she locks him out of the bedroom  
Hell just stroll down the street and some darlings hell meet  
To have a drink and play them old tune  
  
Country music those tear jerking songs  
About life the way it really is  
Hes not happy at home so hell play them old songs  
And dance with someone thats not his  
  
So take my advice and go out tonight  
To your favorite honky tonk bar  
Play some Haggard and Tubb or Jones  
Or Acuff or yours truly H W J are  
Or anyone else just as long as its  
  
Country music those tear jerking songs  
About life the way it really is  
Have a good time tonight and hope  
That your wife dont ever find out what you did
