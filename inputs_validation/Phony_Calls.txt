Mom and dad are goin out for the evening  
And youre stuck inside the house all alone  
Thats when you decided it might be fun to harass someone  
Dial a random number up on your telephone  
You ask if their refrigerator is running  
Then you tell em they should go out and catch it  
Buddy if they ever figured out where you were callin em from  
Theyd come and bust your head right in with a ratchet  
Listen to me  
Dont go makin phony calls  
Please stick to the sevendigit numbers youre used to  
I know that you think its funny drivin folks up the wall  
But its really gettin old fast  
Little Melvin has a natural obsession  
Askin for Prince Albert in a can  
He gets a kick each time he makes a collect call  
To some guy he doesnt know who lives in Japan  
Hes callin strangers up at three in the morning  
Gives em pizza pie delivery at four  
He wont be laughin when theyre tracin his line  
One day the phone police will be there at his door  
Yo hear me  
Dont go makin phony calls  
Only dial the sevendigit numbers youre used to  
Swear someday Im gonna yank that phone cord right out from the wall  
How long is this phase gonna last  
Come on Moes bar whatll ya eat beat or drink  
Uh yeah hello is Mike there  
Last name Rotch  
Hold on Ill check  
Mike Rotch Mike Rotch  
Hey has anybody seen Mike Rotch lately  
Listen to me you little puke  
One of these days Im going to catch you  
And Im going to carve my name on your back with an ice pick  
Dont go makin phony calls  
Please stick to the sevendigit numbers youre used to  
You went through the New York City phone book and prank called em all  
Hope that you grow out of this fast  
Dont go makin phony calls  
Please stick to the sevendigit numbers youre used to  
Betcha think its funny when youre drivin folks right up the wall  
But youre just a pain in the aaa
