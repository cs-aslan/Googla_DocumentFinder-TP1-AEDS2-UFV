you dont know what you want to be  
you dont know what you want to do  
never going to amount to much of anything  
so whats the difference if you win or lose  
well thats something  
well isnt that something  
youve done nothing wrong and its never your fault  
youve done nothing  
  
dont care where your friends have gone  
because you never really needed them anyway  
never going to be exactly who you are  
because you try too hard to be just like them  
well thats something  
well isnt that something  
youve done nothing wrong and its never your fault  
youve done nothing  
  
youve got brains in your head  
feet in your shoes  
you can steer yourself  
any way you choose  
youre on your own  
and you know what you know  
and its up to you to decide where youll go  
well thats something  
well isnt that something  
youve done nothing wrong and its never your fault  
youve done nothing
