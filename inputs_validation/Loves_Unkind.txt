Well I seem him every morning in the schoolyard  
When the school bell rings  
And when he passes in the hallway  
Well he doesnt seem to notice me  
  
Hes got a crush on my best friend  
But she dont care cause she loves someone else  
Im standing on the outside no the inside where I wanna be  
  
Loves unkind loves unkind  
Loves unkind loves unkind  
Cause hes not mine  
  
Just the other day I was praying that hed give me a chance  
Hoping he would choose me for his partner  
For the high school dance  
I was standing outside the class  
  
But it wasnt me but my best friend he asked  
I went running back inside tearyeyed  
And left the two of them behind  
  
Loves unkind loves unkind  
Loves unkind loves unkind  
cause hes not mine  
  
Oh how I love him but I cant even let him know  
cause he loves my best friend  
But she dont care she loves someone else  
And I asked my mama and she said loves unkind  
  
Loves so unkind  
She said just keep it alive  
Cause you may find loves unkind  
  
Loves unkind loves unkind  
Loves unkind loves unkind  
  
Oh Why did I have to love him so  
Why did I have to love him so
