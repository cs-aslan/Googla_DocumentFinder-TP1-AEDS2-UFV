Im gonna catch the first train home  
I dont know what I come here for  
Yeah first train home  
I dont know what I come here for  
Cause for nine long years I couldnt even walk out of my door  
Heres what I say  
  
Break  
  
Im gonna catch the first train home  
I dont know what I come here for  
The first train the first train home  
I dont know what I come here for  
Cause for nine long years I couldnt even walk out of my door
