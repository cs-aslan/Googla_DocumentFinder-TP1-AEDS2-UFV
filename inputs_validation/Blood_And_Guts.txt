Sherman Tanks and Tommy Guns  
Telegrams and Hot Cross Buns  
See the Gerries on the run  
Battleships well here I come  
Commando raid in bed tonight  
Under the covers with torch light  
chorus  
Ratatat tat Ratatat tat  
Out of the trench into combat  
Covered in bruises covered in cuts  
Turning the page for more blood and guts  
  
Kamicaze crashes plane  
Shits himself but all in vain  
Fix the mine under the tray  
And get away in time again  
The capItan is on the bridge  
Pulls the pin from his sandwich  
  
Ratatat tat Ratatat tat  
Out of the trench into combat  
Covered in bruises covered in cuts  
Turning the page for more blood and guts  
  
Prison camps and sorry sarge  
Biting harder than his bark  
Got a bullet in his arm  
Pulled it out and took em on  
Commando raid in bed tonight  
Under the cover with torch light  
  
Ratatat tat Ratatat tat  
Out of the trench into combat  
Covered in bruises covered in cuts  
Turning the page for more blood and guts  
More blood and guts  
More blood and guts  
More blood and guts
