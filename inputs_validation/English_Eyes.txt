What youre sayin it never really crossed my mind  
I hear playin and everybodys keepin time  
Im recallin that girl I met in London town  
She was strange young and tender and narrowed all my choices down  
  
Chorus  
We ran away into the night hypnotized  
You carved your name right next to mine English Eyes  
  
I was tryin to read her lips and knew the time was drawing near  
I forgot what she said but I remember how she whispered in my ear  
I can hear laughter coming from the places we once knew  
There were stories from a stranger out of nowhere but they seemed so true  
  
Chorus  
English eyes  
English eyes  
  
Where are you  
When I call out your name  
English eyes  
  
Red sky warning girl you really put a spell on me  
Never told me bout the daddy you refused to please  
You took the bishop when the king was standing right in front of you  
Theres nothing in it if I cant have a girl with eyes like you  
  
Chorus x2  
  
English Eyes yeah  
English Eyes  
English Eyes
