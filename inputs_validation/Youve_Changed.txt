Stealing hearts was your pastime  
I saw girls falling hook line  
You stole kisses and threw them aside  
Hits and misses your loveside  
  
Youve changed for the better  
Youve changed for the better  
  
Making waves was your hobby  
And I asked you to hold me  
And I knew it  
You do it in front of the world  
And Ill end up different from the other girls  
  
Youve changed for the better  
Youve changed for the better
