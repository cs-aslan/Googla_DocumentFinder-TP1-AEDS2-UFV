The green rolling hills of West Virginia  
Are the nearest thing to heaven that I know  
Though the times are sad and drear  
And I cannot linger here  
Theyll keep me and never let me go  
  
My daddy said dont ever be a miner  
For a miners grave is all youll ever own  
Cause the hard times are everywhere  
I cant find a dime to spare  
These are the worst times Ive ever known  
  
So Ill move away into some crowded city  
In some northern factory town youll find me there  
Though Ill leave the past behind  
Ill never change my mind  
These troubled times are more than I could bear  
  
But someday Ill go back to West Virginia  
To the green rolling hills I love so well  
Yes someday Ill go home  
And I know Ill right the wrong  
These troubled times will follow me no more  
  
Yes someday Ill go home  
And I know Ill right the wrong  
These troubled times will follow me no more
