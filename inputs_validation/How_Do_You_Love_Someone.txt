Chorus  
How do you love someone  
Who really cares  
How do you love someone  
Whos always there  
When you feel like going further  
Will end up hurting each other  
So how do you love someone  
Whos a friend so dear  
  
Feeling so alone  
Calling you please be at home  
Baby where you go  
I wish that I knew but I dont  
And there are feelings of love  
That I feel inside for you  
I want to tell you tonight  
But what if you dont feel the way I do  
And I know what love can do  
When the arrow points at you  
But Im so afraid to trust  
  
Chorus  
  
The clock strikes nine  
Im hoping youll be on time  
So hard to cross that line  
That holds us to the right time  
Cause everything feels wrong  
And I cant go on like this  
Ive got to tell you tonight  
I want you to tell me more what this feeling is  
Cause I know what love can do  
When the arrow points at you  
Even though Im afraid to love  
  
Chorus  
  
I know you love me  
Now my feelings just wont take on someone new  
Look at my eyes and say the words  
That make me wonder what to do  
And I still believe that the angels are watching us  
Oh I believe that you and me will be a plus  
For ever and ever  
  
Chorus until fade
