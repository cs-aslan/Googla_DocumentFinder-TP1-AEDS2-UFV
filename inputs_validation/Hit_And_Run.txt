Deadly skid marks stain the street  
The blood is all that you can see  
Young body on cold concrete  
But you dont want to take the heat no  
Was it due to that last drink  
Scared and confused and you cant think  
  
Help me Christ what should I do  
If God exists he dont like you  
  
Blood level reads too high  
Carelessness will get you life  
Well pray to God for what youve done  
Misery has now begun  
Call 911 as you leave  
Its a DOA at the crime scene  
No one can change what you did  
You killed somebodys kid  
  
Look what have you done what have you done  
On that cold night it was a hit and run  
Look what have you done what have you done  
On that cold night it was a hit and run  
  
Manslaughter is what you did  
That hit and run accident  
A tragic and to that life  
Drive away wash up and hide  
I hope youve got an alibi  
Youd best make up a great lie  
The angry parents want the truth  
Justice is after you  
  
Look what have you done what have you done  
On that cold night it was a hit and run  
Look what have you done what have you done  
On that cold night it was a hit and run  
  
License plate lies next to the dead  
It fell off before away you sped  
The clues add up tire tracks are red  
Matching indents on his fucking head  
  
Tracks on his head  
Away you fled  
And now hes dead  
Gone
