If someone stood up in a crowd  
And raised his voice up way out loud  
And waved his arm  
And shook his leg  
Youd notice him  
  
If someone in a movie show  
Yelled fire in the second row  
This whole place is a powder keg   
Youd notice him  
  
And even without clucking like a hen  
Everyone gets noticed now and then  
Unless of course that personage should  
Be  
Invisible inconsequential me  
  
Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know Im there  
  
I tell ya  
Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know Im there   
  
Suppose you was a little cat  
Residin in a persons flat  
Who fed you fish and scratched your  
Ears  
Youd notice him  
  
Suppoose you was a woman wed  
And sleepin in a double bed beside one man for seven years  
Youd notice him  
  
A human beings made of more than air  
With all that bulk youre bound to see  
Him there  
  
Unless that human bein next to you  
Is unimpressive undistinguished  
You know who   
  
Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know Im there  
I tell ya  
Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should I bend my name  
Mister cellophane  
cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know Im there  
Never even know Im there
