I see youre dressed to kill  
I know I cant wait until  
Hallelujah here she comes  
  
I see youre dressed in black  
I guess Im not coming back  
Hallelujah here she comes  
  
Born and raised  
On the wrong side of town  
You get so high  
That you cant come down  
Yeah  
  
I see the road is rough  
You know Im not giving up  
Hallelujah here she comes  
  
I know where the lady goes  
I know she got a ring on her toes  
Hallelujah here she comes  
  
Born and raised  
On the wrong side of town  
You get so high  
That you cant come down  
  
Im going higher higher higher  
Higher higher higher  
Higher higher higher  
Higher higher higher  
Im gonna be there  
When that lights gonna shine  
Im gonna be there  
When her heart kindles next to mine  
Im gonna be  
Here she comes  
Yeah here she comes  
  
I see youre dressed to kill  
I know I cant wait until  
Hallelujah here she comes  
  
I see youre dressed in black  
I guess Im not coming back  
Hallelujah here she comes  
  
Born and raised  
In the wrong side of town  
You get so high  
You cant come down  
  
Im gonna be there  
Higher higher higher  
Gonna get higher higher higher  
Gonna get higher higher higher  
Higher higher higher  
  
Im gonna be there  
When that lights gonna shine  
Im gonna be there  
When that lights gonna shine  
  
Hallelujah here she comes  
Here she comes
