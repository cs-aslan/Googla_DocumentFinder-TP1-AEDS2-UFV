I once was lost but You found me and now Im free  
I need Your power to come and change me  
Your Spirit lives in me  
I wanna dance for all to see  
What compares to Your redeeming Love  
What can separate me from Your Love  
I need You in my life  
Im never letting go  
Of all the things Youve said  
Im holding on cause You promised me that  
Youd never leave  
Youre always by my side  
Youll never let me go  
So Im holding on cause I know that I need You
