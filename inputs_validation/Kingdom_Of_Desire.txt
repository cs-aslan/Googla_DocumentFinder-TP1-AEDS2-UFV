You used to be on fire now you chill me to the bone  
We used to fly like angels now were sinking like a stone  
You say youre trying to help me but that aint the way it feels  
I think youre trying to kill me with those stiletto heels  
  
Paint the town black babe and let that pendulum swing  
I been stabbed in the back babe  
And if you dont love me Ill never feel a thing  
  
And oh one thing I know theres only one place left for me to go  
  
Chorus  
  
Going back to the kingdom of desire going down to the valley of the gun  
Im gonna stand too close to the fire Im gonna fly too close to the sun  
  
They say the king of love sleeps on a velvet bed  
My sheets feel like sandpaper and my pillow feels like lead  
But as sure as Atlantis sank into the sea  
Im sinking like a stone babe thats how its got to be  
  
Paint the town black babe and let that pendulum swing  
I been stabbed in the back babe  
And if you dont love me Ill never feel a thing  
  
And oh if I dont have you theres only one thing left for me to do  
  
When you dig up Gods little acre you lose all peace of mind  
You stare into the distance looking for a sign  
But that sign it never comes babe your wishes wont come true  
You keep praying for the rain while the sun beats down on you  
  
And oh one thing I know theres only one place left for me to go  
  
Im gonna fly too close to the sun yeah  
Im gonna fly too close to the sun
