I know youre standing there  
Trying to say the words  
You took so long to prepare  
But I laugh pretending I dont see  
Cause I dont want to hear  
What you got to say to me  
  
Cant it wait until tomorrow  
Before you bring me the showers  
Cant it wait until tomorrow  
Give me twentyfour more hours  
  
Ive seen it coming for quite sometime now  
Dont you know Ive tried to stop it  
In every way I know how  
And I know its hard for you  
As it is for me  
So listen to my heart  
Begging desperately  
  
Cant it wait until tomorrow  
Before you bring me the showers  
Oh wait until tomorrow  
Give me twentyfour more hours  
  
Baby please give me twentyfour more hours  
Cant it wait until tomorrow  
Before you bring me the showers  
Cant it wait until tomorrow  
Give me twentyfour more hours  
  
Cant it wait until tomorrow  
Before you bring me the showers  
Oh wait until tomorrow  
Give me twentyfour more hours
