Words and music by robert sterling  
A rushing river sweeps around us  
Just as dark and cold as night it surrounds us  
But we pass through the water to a safer shore  
Were sheltered from the raging rivers roar  
chorus  
Though the night is long  
And the rivers strong  
Still God is with us  
We can stem the tide  
Reach the other side  
For God is with us  
The river deepens night grows darker  
And the struggle seems to be getting harder  
Today has troubles yesterday has never known  
But we dont have to face them on our own  
repeat chorus  
And when we face the rivers roll  
He holds our hand and wont let go
