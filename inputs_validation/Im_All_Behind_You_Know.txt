Leavin me behind is all behind you now  
Its plain to see that youre for good over me  
Youve gotta whole new life ahead of you  
You did what you lived to do  
And Im all behind you now  
  
And Ill be behind you always  
Should you every be a yesterday  
Though it tears me up  
To know deep down  
Im all behind you know  
  
Youre comin back  
My way will come my way again  
Ill never be what I was with you and me  
And I dont know who or where your goin to  
But you did what you lived to do  
And Im all behind you now  
  
And Ill be behind you always  
Should you every be a yesterday  
Though it tears me up  
To know deep down  
Im all behind you know  
  
Yeah it tears me up to know deep down  
Im all behind you know
