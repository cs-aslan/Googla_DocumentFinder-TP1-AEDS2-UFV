Now that we have come this far  
Dont be frightened by the night  
Just let me be your guardian angel  
You will be my guiding light  
  
Weve been on this road so long  
And sometimes not know where we are  
Thats when Id be your lost horizon  
You would be my Shangri La  
  
Praise slips out so easily  
It may not sound sincere  
But it only seems to come to me  
Whenever you are near  
  
So thank you for the joy ou bring  
Thank you for your love each night  
Ill always be your guardian angel  
Always be my guiding light  
  
When the sun is far too strong  
When the wind is cold as ice  
Thats when Ill be your lifes oasis  
You will be my paradise  
  
So thank you for the joy you bring  
Thank you for your love each night  
Ill always be your guardian angel  
Always be my guiding light  
  
Yes Ill always be your guardian angel  
As long as youll be my guiding light
