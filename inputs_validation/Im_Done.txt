We are the pain  
We are the shame  
Weve gone insane  
Inside where no ones around  
  
I am to blame for everything  
I like this game that you all  
make me play  
  
Im done being there for others  
They have their pain and so do I  
Dont need to feel it all over  
I try to hold on and you bring me down  
  
We are estranged  
We are deranged  
I cant explain  
How you all break me apart  
  
I am to blame for everything  
I like this game that you all  
make me play  
  
Im done being there for others  
They have their pain and so do I  
Dont need to feel it all over  
I try to hold on and you bring me down  
  
We wait we hate  
We try to get away  
Mistake my pain  
It has been lead astray  
Im Looking around I drop to the ground  
Why does it have to end this way  
  
Feeling numb so long  
Oh God its just everything  
Its everything  
Now I pray for all of them to go away  
  
Im done being there for others  
They have their pain and so do I  
Dont need to feel it all over  
I try to hold on and you bring me down
