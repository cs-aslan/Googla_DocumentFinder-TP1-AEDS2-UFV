People dying from lonely days  
Were walking and trying to take our souls away  
Were just spending out our time angels in America slapping on a dime  
Slide here for me  
Get these chains away and Im never quite free  
She walks like she is on a line  
Angels in America trying to get things done  
All on a bad day  
All on a run way  
She says Im ok  
Bright lights shine in midnight  
Hes dying for his children looking for his life  
She wonders why shes got to die  
Angels in America trying to hard to fly  
This time well make it on or own  
The forces are teeming and the guns are coming low  
All on a bad day all on a bad day
