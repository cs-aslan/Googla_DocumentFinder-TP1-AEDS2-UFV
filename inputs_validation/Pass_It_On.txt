A brand new meaning  
For whats goin on today  
I felt it comin  
Thought Id pass it on your way  
In case your heads in the mighty fog  
Theres a thought a show in the dark I say  
  
Pass it on sure thing pass it on  
Pass it on sure thing pass it on  
  
Pass it on a sure thing baby  
  
Good things coming  
If you care to wait your turn  
Hearts desire  
With enough here left to burn  
Because the loves all around you see  
If youre lovin you will receive I say  
  
Pass it on sure thing pass it on  
Pass it on sure thing pass it on  
  
A sure thing baby  
Make it feel good tonight  
Make it feel real good  
Baby baby baby baby  
Well well well well  
  
Just imagine havin to know it all  
No more guessin  
cause your left hands in the thought  
Consult me when you need a friend  
Pass it on and youre feelin lost well  
  
Pass it on sure thing pass it on  
Pass it on sure thing pass it on  
Pass it on sure thing pass it on  
Pass it on sure thing pass it on  
Pass it on sure thing pass it on
