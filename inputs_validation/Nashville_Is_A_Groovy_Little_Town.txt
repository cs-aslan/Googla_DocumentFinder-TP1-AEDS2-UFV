My plane set down in nashville at a quarter after 2  
A little while and Id be on my way back home to you  
While I was waitin for my flight got out and looked around  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
I met some entertainers and they had an extra girl  
I told them I was just a tourist out to see the world  
From one place to another yes we really made the rounds  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
Next day they all took me in just like they did before  
I guess Im trying to tell you I wont be home anymore  
Now this may sound poetic but Im happy as a clown  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
Remember how I used to sit and drink and play guitar  
And Id get up and sing for all those folks at jodys bar  
Well I found out it aint too bad the way I pick and sound  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
You know that nest egg that we buried in the bank awhile  
Take it out and spend it darlin dress yourself in style  
You have always been a swinger and now I wont be around  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
Ive got myself a little shack out on ol hickory lake  
And now and then I get a gig and buy myself a steak  
Whyknow they published one of my old songs theyre showing it around  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
You remember all those tranquilizers that I used to take  
Well Im not on those anymore Im on old hickory lake  
So when you start cryin heres the best oneliner I have found  
What else you got yes nashville is a groovy little town
