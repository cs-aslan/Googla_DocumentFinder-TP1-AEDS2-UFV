Cooper went out late last night  
I heard the slam from her door  
Foggy ways november daze  
All the white wolves were smiling  
Cooper went out walkin the clouds  
She left everything in a mess  
Shut your mouth when you talk to me  
Her words were always so small  
  
And theres a sound from the telephone  
When can I say shes coming home  
Leave me the number youre dialing from  
And may I ask whos calling  
May I ask whos calling  
  
Cooper went out 3 oclock sharp  
I heard the bells from the church  
Someone said they saw a car  
Picking her up by the stations  
Cooper went out and thats all there is  
Im just no one from next door  
Everything will be alright  
When all the flowers have cried  
  
Then theres a voice on the telephone  
When can I say shes coming home  
Leave me the number youre dialing from  
And may I ask whos callin whos calling  
May I ask whos calling whos calling  
May I ask whos calling
