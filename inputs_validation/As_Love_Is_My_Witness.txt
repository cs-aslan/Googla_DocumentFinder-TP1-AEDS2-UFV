Mark  
Once in a lifetime  
You look in someones eyes  
And it feels like the world stops turning at once  
Thats what it felt like for me  
I knew knew right away this day would be  
Standing together believing forever  
Is there in our reach  
Chorus Mark  
cause love is my witness  
I swear  
Ill be with you till the end  
Nothing in tear this love apart  
Ill put my hand upon my heart  
This is the promise Ill make to you  
Whatever comes well see it through  
Nothing can break it  
This feelings too strong  
cause love is my witness

When our dreams for tomorrow  
Seem so far away  
But that brought us closer  yeah  
It brought us together  
So that wed know the real thing  
Thats why I can yeah  yeehyeah
