Gently breathing lit by the morning sun  
Through the night itd been raining venom  
I want to be kind not a bullet in the right place  
Or just of two minds more important than importance  
  
I want to help you lift enormous things  
A pinch a sting I dont feel a thing  
As the earth revolved around the sun  
  
All those shadows waiting round the last lights  
To the dream of being here comes the night  
All of the tiptoeing past all our mostfeared buildings  
I only say this now because I didnt when it was happening  
  
I want to help you lift enormous things  
A pinch a sting I dont feel a thing  
But as the earth revolves around the sun  
  
I can see it all at once  
And oh what a glittering chance  
In my head the game goes quiet  
And I can see it all at once  
Them yelling Yer not the goods  
A kid before the rapids  
But in my head the game is quiet  
And oh what a glittering chance  
Oh what a glittering chance  
Oh what a glittering chance  
  
At transformation  
At transformation  
  
Thats my dream of being  
Thats my dream of being  
Thats my dream of being  
Thats my dream of being
