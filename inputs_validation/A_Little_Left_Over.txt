I work my fingers to the bone  
But you wont hear me cry and moan  
A workin man dont need no welfare line  
  
Well Ill never be a millionaire  
And frankly I dont even care  
Cause all I need to have a real good time  
  
Chorus  
Is a little left over  
On Saturday night  
If my bills are paid my plans are made  
And everythings alright  
Put on my ropers and them wranglers fittin tight  
Got a little left over  
And its Saturday night  
  
I dont drink but I love to dance  
With those sweet young things in their cowboy hats  
These country girls will be the death of me  
If thats the way I gotta go  
Lord I hope I die real slow  
Till I do Ill tell you all I need  
  
Chorus
