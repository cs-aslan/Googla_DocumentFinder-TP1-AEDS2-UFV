What planet are you from girl  
And are there others like you there  
And could you do that magic trick again  
Poppin up from nowhere  
Though my planets full of warfare  
You make it feel like a dream  
Man I hope they never find you  
  
I think you are a lost queen  
Let me serve you serve you  
Hot sex and gold shiny things  
I think you are a lost queen  
Let me serve you serve you  
Remind you that you are a lost queen  
I think you are a lost queen  
  
I dont have a problem with multitaskin  
Takin care of you is my number one passion  
Put it before my eyes you know Ima smash it  
Only if you want it want it  
You dont have to ever think about askin  
I can read your mind girl of course I have it  
Can I start you up Its automatic  
Get your motor runnin runnin vroomvroom  
Im never too busy to tell you that youre pretty  
Aint gotta ask me to  
Surprise you in the city when your day is goin shitty  
Aint gotta ask me to  
  
What planet are you from girl

I dont need momma and daddy  
Honey and sugar man I bet theyre so classy  
Half of me is good the other half nasty  
Cant help it if I want it want it  
Sure I meet your friends on my best behavior  
Talk about relationships I used to be a player  
And like Geico the time I saved em  
And get their motors runnin runnin vroomvroom  
Lift your head when youre down so you dont drop your crown  
Aint gotta ask me to  
And right before we finish Ill ask you did you get it  
Aint gotta ask me to
