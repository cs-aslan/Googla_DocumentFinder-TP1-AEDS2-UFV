Just two lovers in a seedy cafe  
Someones leaving the waiter says Hey wont you wait  
Running nowhere she hides in her room  
What he told her had to get out and soon  
  
Its just a bad affair youve had  
No need to cry dont take it bad  
Youll soon be glad when youre far apart  
  
Youll never be so wrong not for a long time  
Youll never be so wrong not for a long time  
Cause Im never gonna find that feeling again  
Im never gonna find that feeling again  
  
Now shes breaking but what can she do  
Somewhere out there a car disappears out of view  
Fumbles somewhere for stale cigarettes  
Looks for numbers the ones she could dial but forgets  
  
No point in you just looking down  
No way that you can turn it around  
Youve go to realise youre free  
  
Youll never be so wrong not for a long time  
Youll never be so wrong not for a long time  
Cause Im never gonna find that feeling again  
Im never gonna find that feeling again  
  
No point in you just looking down  
No way that you can turn it around  
Youve go to realise youre free  
  
Youll never be so wrong not for a long time  
Youll never be so wrong not for a long time  
Cause Im never gonna find that feeling again  
Im never gonna find that feeling again
