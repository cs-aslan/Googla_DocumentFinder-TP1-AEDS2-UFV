One two three more honey dont get mad and walk out the door  
Five six seven eight we better start loving before its too late  
Nine ten hi come on in  
Lets kiss and make up and start over again  
  
Now weve all said and done things that we didnt mean  
We get a little mad and we make a big scene  
Oh yes I know its kinda hard to go back  
Be like Perry Mason though and get all the facts  
  
One two three four honey dont get mad and walk out like before  
Five six seven eight we better make love girl before its too late  
Nine ten can I come in  
Lets kiss and make up and start all over again  
  
Since Adam and Eve men and women have disagreed  
Love me or leave me ah that is the key  
We got to control our temper to win  
Why you son of a Whoops count slowly to ten  
  
Sing one two three more honey dont get mad and walk out the door  
Five six seven eight we better start loving before its too late  
Nine ten hi come on in  
Lets kiss and make up and start over again  
  
One more  
One two three more honey dont get mad and walk out the door  
Five six seven eight we better start loving before its too late  
Nine ten hi come on in  
Weve kissed and made up and are happy again
