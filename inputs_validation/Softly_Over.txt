Its over theres nothing more to say  
Silent comes the night time end another summers day  
I can just remember or is this the dream that never goes away  
  
Chorus  
Understand me Im calling  
Understand me can you hear me call  
  
Night time surely its a lie  
Noone ever told me I just let the chance go by  
Wishing there was time enough you tell me theres no time but I can try  
  
Chorus  
  
Speak now without the summer light  
All the words I should have spoken when you held me tight  
Still Ill keep in calling till the morning ends another lonely night  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill be waiting for you hoping that someday youll hear me calling  
But theres never any answer just the echo of the call
