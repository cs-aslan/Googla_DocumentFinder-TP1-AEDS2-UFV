berts blues  
Ive been looking for a good guy  
For a long long time  
Been looking for a good guy  
One to ease my mind  
As well as my time  
Ive been singing in the evening  
Flying through the night  
But I hurt my good guy  
I hope he makes out right  
Flying through the night  
Ive been picking up the sunshine  
Been drinking down the rain  
Ive been picking up the sunshine  
It makes me wonder when  
Ill see him again  
You know time could bring a change man  
It aint for me to say  
Youll soon be out of range man  
This could only be the way  
Its meant to be  
Fairy castle stark and black in the moonlight  
The jingle jangle jester rides his stallion  
Seagulls fly across my mind forever  
Sadly goes the wind on its way to hades  
Would I should I could I be a stranger   
I shall walk right by and sigh goodbye  
Ive been looking for a good guy  
For a long long time  
Been looking for a good guy  
One to blow my mind  
As well as my time  
Ive been looking you know Ive been looking  
You better believe Ive been looking  
Ive been picking up the sunshine  
Ive been drinking down the rain  
Ive been thinking of the sunshine  
Ive been looking for a good guy  
One to ease my mind  
As well as my time  
Blow my mind  
As well as my time  
Blow my mind
