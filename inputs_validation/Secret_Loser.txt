Trapped in a lonely body Im  
Losin control  
Cant show my emotions and Im  
Losing my soul  
Could it be that Im obsessed  
With feeding my disease  
I couldnt make it know that  
Hidden things that no one  
Sees  
  
Yeah loser Im a secret loser  
Loser Im a secret loser  
  
Fighting a losing battle  
Pretending to win  
Repenting to holy unknowns  
Pretending to sin  
All i do is hide the wounds  
Where blood just  
Wont congeal  
Couldnt ever take my soul  
Cause isnt there to steal  
  
Yeah loser Im a secret loser  
Loser Im a secret loser  
  
Though Im the loser there is  
No winner  
Theres nothing left to win  
The hidden reasons now in  
Deletion  
Are lost in sin  
So heed my warning the time is  
Dawning  
Ill tell you heres the twist  
The truth is lying  
Below the surface i dont exist  
  
Loser Im a secret loser  
Loser Im a secret loser  
  
Seeing is not believing it dont  
Mean a thing  
Although it appears to be that  
The loser is king  
I can understand that what  
You see you think is real  
But underneath the surface is  
A wound that cannot heal  
  
Yeah loser Im a secret loser  
Loser Im a secret loser  
Loser Im a secret loser  
Loser Im a secret loser  
Loser Im a secret loser
