What kind of spell is this  
That youve cast on me with your kiss  
Its like Ive lost all control of my senses  
Its just not like me to give in so easily  
And drop my guard and leave my heart defenseless  
Oh but Im feelin good here beneath the pines of the Georgia woods  
  
Chorus  
And what a surprise here by your side  
Its more than a full moonshine and its driving me crazy  
I waited so long for something this strong  
And now I gotta be fallin cause Im already callin you baby  
  
Theres nobody here to see  
These sparks between you and me  
Wed better be careful my love or these woods will be burning  
Or maybe we just give in throwing caution to the wind  
Its funny how we aint got any say in the matter  
  
Chorus  
  
Uh huh  
Oh take me downtown  
Uh huh  
My sweet angel  
  
Yeah I waited so long somethin is strong  
And I know Im falling cause Im already callin you  
Oh  
  
What a surprise hear by your side  
Its more than a full moonshine and its driving me crazy  
Oh waited so long for something this strong  
And we know Im fallin cause Im already callin you  
Oh callin you baby  
Yeah uh huh
