You wake me up  
In the middle of the night  
And burn the cover down  
Youre on the phone in the air  
  
Like a record try to spin me around  
Oh wont you move away  
Oh honey get away  
The joy of a toy  
  
Is it all that you came for  
The joy of a toy  
Got the look of a lie  
The joy of a toy  
  
Put the hurt into action  
The joy of a toy  
You can kiss this love goodbye  
How can you win  
  
When you dont know a thing  
What love is all about  
Dont want to fight  
So get out of my sight  
  
I wont surrender now  
Its independence day  
Oh honey get away  
The joy of a toy  
  
Hello goodbye
