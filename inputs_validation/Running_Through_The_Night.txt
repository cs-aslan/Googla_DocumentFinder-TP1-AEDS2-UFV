Ive been runnin through the night  
Tryin to reach and hold you tight  
Ive been wonderin just why you stayed away  
But when I reached your home  
I found out that you had gone  
I found out someone had taken you away  
Ever since the day I cared all my dream weve shared  
And my love for you grown stronger every day  
And now youve said goodbye all I do is cry  
Ive been wonderin just why you went away  
  
Ever since the day I cared all my dream weve shared  
And my love for you grown stronger every day  
And now youve said goodbye all I do is cry  
Ive been wonderin just why you went away  
Wont you come on back to my side  
Please oh please dont hurt my pride  
Tryin to get along without you aint so good  
And if you play along I will say that I was wrong  
Cause my love for you grows stronger like it should  
Cause my love for you grows stronger like it should
