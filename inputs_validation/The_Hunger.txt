We become  
Erupt in violence  
Destroy the silence  
Our time has come  
Go  
  
We are the outcasted ancient descendents  
The ones whove been calling and  
Would you still die for the dead yet still living  
Starved of a time thats now come whoaoh  
  
We are the children  
The hungry children  
  
We become  
Erupt in violence  
Seduce the silence  
Our time has come  
Go  
  
We are the kindred Hells ancient descendent slaves  
Begging the night not to go  
Would you still die for the dead yet still living  
Starved of a life thats now gone whoaoh  
  
We are the children  
The hungry children  
  
We become  
Blood quench the hunger  
You want it you need it  
Blood quench the hunger  
You want it you need it  
Blood quench the hunger  
You want it you need it  
  
Oh whoa
