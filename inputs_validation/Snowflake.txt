I was born in a cloud  
Now I am falling  
I want you to catch me  
Look up and youll see me  
  
You know you can hear me  
The world is so loud Keep falling Ill find you  
Were over a forest  
Theres millions of snowflakes  
  
Were dancing  
The world is so loud Keep falling and Ill find you  
I am ice and dust I am sky  
I can see horses wading through snowdrifts  
  
My broken hearts my fabulous dances  
My fleeting song fleeting  
The world is so loud Keep falling Ill find you  
My broken hearts my fabulous dance  
  
My fleeting song  
My twist and shout  
I am ice and dust and light I am sky and here  
I can hear people  
  
I think you are near me now  
The world is so loud Keep falling Ill find you  
Were over a forest  
Its midnight at Christmas  
  
The world is so loud Keep falling Ill find you  
I think I can see you  
Theres your long white neck  
The world is so loud Keep falling Ill find you  
  
Now I am falling  
Look up and youll see me  
The world is so loud Keep falling Ill find you  
In a moment or two  
  
Ill be with you  
The world is so loud Keep falling Ill find you  
Be ready to catch me  
The world is so loud Keep falling Ill find you
