In the middle of late last night I was sittin on a curb  
I didnt know what about but I was feeling quite disturbed  
A street sweeper came whistlin by  
He was bouncin every step  
It seemed strange how good he felt  
So I asked him while he swept  
  
He said Its my job to be cleaning up this mess  
And thats enough reason to go for me  
Its my job to be better than the rest  
And that makes the day for me  
  
Got an uncle who owns a bank hes a self made millionaire  
He never had anyone to love never had no one to care  
He always to seemed kind of sad to me  
So I asked him why that was  
And he told me its because in my contract theres a clause  
That says Its my job to worried half to death  
And thats the thing people respect in me  
Its a job but without it Id be less  
Than what I expect from me  
  
Ive been lazy most all of my life  
Writing songs and sleeping late  
Any manual labor Ive done purely by mistake  
If street sweepers can smile then  
Ive got no right to feel upset  
But sometimes I still forget  
Till the lights go on and the stage is set  
And the song hits home and you feel that sweat  
  
Its my job to be different than the rest  
and thats enough reason to go for me  
Its my job to be better than the best  
and thats a tough break for me  
Its my job to be cleaning up this mess  
and thats enough reason to go for me  
  
Its my job to be better than the best  
and that makes the day for me
