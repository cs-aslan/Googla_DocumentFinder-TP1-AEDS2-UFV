I took my girl to go bowling  
Downtown at the red door  
After an argument I started  
Cause I thought she didnt like me anymore  
I cant help it sometimes I feel pitiful  
And of course shes so young and beautiful  
  
I bought us two glasses of coke  
Thats her favorite  
And I wanted to make up for earlier  
But I dropped her glass and it broke  
So I just gave my glass to her  
  
She laughed and so did I in our lane  
And then she went to the vending machine  
To buy a candy cane  
But right next to that was a boy I knew  
With a spring in his hand  
Playing a country pinball machine  
Called Stand By Your Man  
I saw him talk to her  
But I stayed in my lane  
And played my game steady  
And was thinking of a day  
When Id be too old to throw a ball this heavy  
  
But I guess Im young now  
So its easier to knock em all down  
Then I looked and saw her say to him  
Youre really hittin that ball around  
And so hes lookin at her the way I did  
When I first met her  
I could see in his face  
White flowers  
And cups of coffee  
And love letters  
  
I was sorry to interrupt their game  
But I went and did it anyway  
I dropped my red bowling ball  
Through the glass of his machine  
I said Are you quick enough to hit  
This ball Mr Clean  
I was scared to lose her  
So I couldnt help bein mean  
  
And that ended both of our games  
I said I was sorry  
But my girl left with him just the same  
I thought how much I hate  
When love makes me act this way  
I was bent over a broken pinball machine  
In a blowling alley and I threw it all away  
  
Well its it all just a big game
