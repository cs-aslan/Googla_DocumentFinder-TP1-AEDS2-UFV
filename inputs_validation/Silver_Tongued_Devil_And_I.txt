I took myself down to the TallyHo Tavern to buy me a bottle of beer  
I sat me down by a tender young maiden whose eyes were as dark as her hair  
And as I was searchin from bottle to bottle for somethin unfoolish to say  
That silver tongued devil just slipped from the shadows and smilingly stole
her away  
I said hey little girl dont you know hes the devil hes everything that I
aint  
Hidin intentions of evil under the smile of a saint  
All hes good for is gettin in trouble and shifting his share of the blame  
And some people swear hes my double and some even say were the same  
But the silver tongued devils got nothing to lose Ill only live till I die  
We take our own chances and pay our own dues the silver tongued devil and I  
Like all the fair maidens whove laid down beside him  
She knew in her heart that hed lied  
But nothing that I could have said couldve saved her  
No matter how hard that she tried  
Cause shell offer her soul to the darkness and danger  
Of something that shes never known  
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger wholl love her and leave her
alone  
And you know hes the devil
