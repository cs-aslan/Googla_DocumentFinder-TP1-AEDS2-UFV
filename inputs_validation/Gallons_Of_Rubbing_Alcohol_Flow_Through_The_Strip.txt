It hurts when you have to press that dull little thing  
That youre only supposed to use once and then discard  
Where do you put it In the garbage can my honest friend  
My shyness pet her flow  
  
Shes only been five months late  
Even though we havent had sex for a week  
  
A meal a day a meal I say  
And my hearts made my  
  
Somebody else already used the word aurora borealis  
She was tied up in chains and Sam had helped her in the freezer  
  
Shes only five weeks late  
And I havent had a date forever  
Evereverforever  
  
Wish I had moremore opportunity  
More chances to remember some things  
So I couldnt have so much pressure on my  
On myon my umah on myumumhead  
  
Wed have so much more diversity  
And so much more input so much more creative flow  
If we had someone in school a GIT  
  
GITgeeksintown  
HaCome on Dave think of one  
Girls In Trouble  
It should be GIC geeks with Charvels  
No GWC  
  
Fuck man this is a waste of time  
One more solo Yeahhh Yeaaaahh  
  
Youre personally responsible for  
The entire stripto be washed away  
Cleansedas if gallons of um rubbing alcohol  
Flowed through the strip and were set on fire  
  
It didnt just singe the hair it made it straight  
  
And then Perry Ellis came along with his broom  
And hissilk  
And hehe erected a beautiful city  
A city of stars
