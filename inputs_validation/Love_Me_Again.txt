What are we saying  
For what are we praying  
Using the words we both wanna hear  
  
What are we doing  
The whole thing is proving  
Were feeling the same way we always did  
  
So here we go once again  
Its just like back when  
I clearly remember the way we were then  
So come back and love me again  
  
I was the one who adored you  
And I waited all this time for you  
But you cant tell love what to do  
Its so hard but its true  
You used to love me completely  
And Id really love you to need me  
So darling tell me you can find the way  
Find a way to love me again  
  
Ive heard the stories of hearts that get broken  
But if we take it slowly it wont have to be  
One step at a time heart too fast and it allll fall apart  
I know were survivors but Ill speak for me  
  
Even as strong as I am  
I dont think I can  
Lost outside the world  
I dont know just where I stand  
So hurry back girl and love the boy again  
  
I was the one who adored you  
And Id wait a million years for you  
But you cant tell love where to go  
This is one thing that we know  
You used to love me completely  
And Id really love you to need me  
So darling tell me you can find the way  
Find a way to love me again  
  
Find any way that you can love me again  
Just think it over and then love me again
