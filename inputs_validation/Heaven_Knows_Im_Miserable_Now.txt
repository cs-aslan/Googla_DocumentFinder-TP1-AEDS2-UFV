I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour  
But heaven knows Im miserable now  
  
I was looking for a job and then I found a job  
And heaven knows Im miserable now  
  
In my life  
Why do I give valuable time  
To people who dont care if I live or die  
  
Two lovers entwined pass me by  
And heaven knows Im miserable now  
  
I was looking for a job and then I found a job  
And heaven knows Im miserable now  
  
In my life  
Oh why do I give valuable time  
To people who dont care if I live or die  
  
What she asked of me at the end of the day  
Caligula would have blushed  
  
Youve been in the house too long she said  
And I naturally fled  
  
In my life  
Why do I smile  
At people who Id much rather kick in the eye  
  
I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour  
But heaven knows Im miserable now  
  
Youve been in the house too long she said  
And I naturally fled  
  
In my life  
Why do I give valuable time  
To people who dont care if I live or die
