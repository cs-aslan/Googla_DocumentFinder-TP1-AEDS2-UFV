Like wild fire  
Comes roaring  
Mad whirlwind  
Burning the road  
  
Black thunder  
White lightning  
Speed demons cry  
The Hell Patrol  
  
Night riders  
Death dealers  
Storm bringers  
Tear up the ground  
  
Fist flying  
Eyes blazing  
Theyre glory bound  
The Hell Patrol  
  
Brutalize you  
Neutralize you  
Gonna go for your throat as you choke  
Then theyll vaporize you  
  
Terrorize you  
Pulverize you  
Gonna cut to the bone as you groan  
And theyll paratamize you  
  
Crome Monsters  
Steel Warriors  
Soul Stealers  
Ripping out hearts  
Theyre Devil Dogs  
The Hell Patrol
