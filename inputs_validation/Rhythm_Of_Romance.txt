Coke machines on the ho chi minh trail  
Russian spies shopping at bloomingdales  
Killer bees swarming up the rio grande  
Hey baby whered you get that tan  
Rome burns as we dance cheek to cheek  
Titanics sinking but oooh do we look chic  
New york citys got the hong kong flu  
And I cant take my eyes off you  
Mx gi joe  
Rsvp ufo  
Abcia  
I still want to know who shot jfk  
Lets dance  
To the rhythm of romance  
Lets swing  
neath the stars above  
Cmon lets dance  
To the rhythm of romance  
Lets kiss  
Lets fall in love  
Johnny woke up from his american dream  
Rich man poor man and a desert in between  
Crystal chandeliers hangin by a thread  
Were in the pink baby just two trillon in the red  
And I hear gabriel blowing his saxophone  
Through a great big hole in the ozone  
Who cares it the sun dont rise  
When I look in to your ultraviolet eyes  
Thats life this is war  
I took it on faith cant take it anymore  
Old young yin and yang  
Well all go together in the next big bang  
Boom shug a lug a lug a boom  
Lets dance  
To the rhythm of romance  
Lets swing  
neath the stars above  
Cmon lets dance  
To the rhythm of romance  
Lets kiss  
Lets fall in love
