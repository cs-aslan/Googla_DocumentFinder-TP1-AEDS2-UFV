Have you heard about the hollow man  
Too frightened so he turned and ran from the vision that he cherished so  
Couldnt see it so he let it go  
Everybody has a secret sin  
But everybody needs a chance to win  
Anyone could see Im a man thats sad and broken by the things Ive done  
But now Im sorry that I said goodbye  
And Im sorry cause its me thats crying  
I never finished what I started to but Im just so sorry that Im hurting
you  
  
But its too late for us to just be friends  
And too late for anything but the end  
And too many dreams fell through our hands  
And its just too late to understand  
  
Now Ill never make a new beginning  
And Ill never stop the pain from winning  
Nothing matters to me anymore now  
Ive lost the things I was fighting for  
And now Im sorry that the dreams are gone  
And Im sorry cause Im not the  
One who comes running when you need me so  
Cause Im the fool thats let you go  
  
But its too late for us to just be friends  
And too late for anything but the end  
And too many dreams fell through our hands  
And its just too late to understand  
  
All the tears of pain are falling down oh oh oh oh  
All the tears of pain are falling down and you know  
  
But its too late for us to just be friends  
And too late for anything but the end  
And too many dreams fell through our hands  
And its just too late to understand  
  
But its too late for us to just be friends  
And too late for anything but the end  
And too many dreams fell through our hands  
And its just too late to understand  
  
But its too late Too late Its too late
