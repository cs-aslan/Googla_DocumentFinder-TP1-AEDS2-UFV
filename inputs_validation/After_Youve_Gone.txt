After youve gone and left me cryin  
After youve gone theres no denyin  
Youll feel blue youll feel sad  
Youll miss the dearest pal youve ever had  
  
Therell come a time now dont forget it  
Therell come a time when youll regret it  
Someday when you grow lonely  
Your heart will break like mine and youll want me only  
After youve gone after youve gone away  
  
After youve gone and left me cryin  
After youve gone theres no denyin  
Youre gonna feel blue and youre gonna feel sad  
Youre gonna feel bad  
And youll miss and youll miss  
And youll miss the bestest pal you ever had  
  
Therell come a time now dont forget it  
Therell come a time when youll regret it  
But baby think what youre doin  
Im gonna haunt you so Im gonna taunt you so  
Its gonna drive you to ruin  
After youve gone after youve gone away
