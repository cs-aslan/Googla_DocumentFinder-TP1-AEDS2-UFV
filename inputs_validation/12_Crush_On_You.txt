Standing in a queue of a school canteen  
Guys on the corner they were laughin at me  
But I dont mind if they see it all  
You know I gotta come clean  
I gotta come clean  
I got a crush on you  
  
My mind dont need it but my body do  
A little bit of loving and attention for you  
Although were only strangers  
They dont need to know  
I gotta cum clean I gotta cum clean  
Ooh I got a crush on you  
  
I want to get serious right away  
Onetwo I got a crush on you  
What you doin today or any other day  
Onetwo I got a crush on you  
Just one look and I go insane  
Onetwo I got a crush on you  
  
Your daddy never comes to get you  
Cause lives so far away  
But his Italian chauffeur shows up every day  
But Ill get you in the corner Ill get you all  
alone  
I gotta cum clean I gotta come clean  
  
I got a crush on you  
  
Onetwo I got a crush on you  
Onetwo I got a crush on you  
Onetwo I got a crush on you  
I said onetwo  
I got a crush on you  
  
Why should I get a crush on yet
