Somewhere in a burst of glory  
Sound becomes a song  
Im bound to tell a story  
Thats where I belong  
  
When I see you smiling  
When I hear you singing  
Lavender and roses  
Every ending a beginning  
The way you turn  
And catch me with your eye  
Ay ay ay  
Thats where I belong  
  
When I see you smiling  
When I hear you singing  
Lavender and roses  
Every ending a beginning  
Thats the way it is  
I dont know why  
Ay ay ay  
But thats where I belong  
  
A spiny little island man  
Plays a jingling banjo  
Hes walking down a dirt road  
Carrying his radio  
To a river where the water meets the sky  
Ay ay ay  
Thats where I belong
