Someones gone out fishing  
Someones high and dry  
Someones on a mission to the lonely Lorelei  
Some folks got a vision of a castle in the sky  
And Im left stranded wondering why  
  
You and me together  
Nothing feels so good  
Even if I get a medal from my local neighborhood  
I wont need a castle theyve got castles in Versailles  
And Im still stranded wondering why  
  
Make it a beautiful night for me  
Its a beautiful night for love  
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold  
Make it a beautiful night for me  
Its a beautiful night for love  
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold  
  
Some boats on the ocean  
Were here in this room  
Seems to me the perfect way to spend an afternoon  
We can look for castles pretty castles in the sky  
No more wondering wondering why  
  
Things can go wrong things can go right  
Things can go bump in the dead of the night  
So let me be there let me be there  
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night  
  
Make it a beautiful night for me  
Its a beautiful night for love  
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold  
Make it a beautiful night for me  
Such a beautiful night for love  
Such a wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold  
  
Yeah its a beautiful night  
Yeah its a beautiful night  
  
Yeah beautiful night beautiful night  
Yeah its such a beautiful night beautiful beautiful night  
  
Beautiful night beautiful night beautiful night  
Beautiful night beautiful night beautiful night  
Beautiful night beautiful night beautiful night  
Beautiful night beautiful night beautiful night  
Beautiful night beautiful night beautiful night  
Beautiful night beautiful night beautiful night  
Beautiful night beautiful night beautiful night
