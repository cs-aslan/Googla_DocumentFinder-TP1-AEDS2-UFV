High flying adored  
So young the instant queen  
A rich beautiful thing of all the talents  
A cross between a fantasy of the bedroom and a saint  
You were just a backstreet girl  
Hustling and fighting scratching and biting  
  
High flying adored  
Did you believe in your wildest moments  
All this would be yours  
That youd become the lady of them all  
  
Were there stars in your eyes  
When you crawled in at night  
From the bars from the sidewalks  
From the gutter theatrical  
Dont look down its a long long way to fall  
  
High flying adored  
What happens now where do you go from here  
For someone on top of the world  
The view is not exactly clear  
A shame you did it all at twentysix  
There are no mysteries now  
Nothing can thrill you no one fulfill you  
  
High flying adored  
I hope you come to terms with boredom  
So famous so easily so soon  
Its not the wisest thing to be  
  
You wont care if they love you  
Its been done before  
Youll despair if they hate you  
Youll be drained of all energy  
All the young whove made it would agree  
  
High flying adored  
Thats good to hear but unimportant  
My storys quite usual  
Local girl makes good weds famous man  
I was stuck in the right place at the perfect time  
Filled a gap I was lucky  
But one thing Ill say for me  
No one else can fill it like I can
