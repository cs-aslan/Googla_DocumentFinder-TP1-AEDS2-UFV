Verse  
Got nowhere to go and how am I to get there  
But Im goin there with you  
Tonight were runnin on luck  
If were gonna use it all theres only one thing left to do  
  
Chorus  
Gonna take a deep breath hold it in  
Twirl you around till my head spins  
Kiss that lipstick till its left thin  
Till its gone till its gone  
Break every rule we eva learned  
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn  
Light up the night and let it burn till its gone  
Till its gone till its gone

But its sure worth drinkin to so baby heres to you  
I dont wanna waste a drop  
  
Chorus  
Gonna take a deep breath hold it in  
Twirl you around till my head spins  
Kiss that lipstick till its left thin  
Till its gone till its gone  
Break every rule we eva learned  
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn  
Light up the night and let it burn till its gone  
Till its gone till its gone  
  
Instrumental break  
  
Bridge  
One life one chance  
One ticket to the big dance  
You and me still holdin on  
Ride it down to the last song  
  
Chorus  
Gonna take a deep breath hold it in  
Twirl you around till my head spins  
Kiss that lipstick till its left thin

Kick back and watch the big wheels turn  
Light up the night and let it burn till its gone  
Till its gone till its gone

Till its gone then its gone it is gone
