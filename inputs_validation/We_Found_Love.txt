Yellow diamonds in the light  
And were standing side by side  
As your shadow crosses mine  
What it takes to come alive  
  
Its the way Im feeling I just cant deny  
But Ive gotta let it go  
  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
  
Shine a light through an open door  
Love and life I will divide  
Turn away cause I need you more  
Feel the heartbeat in my mind  
  
Its the way Im feeling I just cant deny  
But Ive gotta let it go  
  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
  
Yellow diamonds in the light  
And were standing side by side  
As your shadow crosses mine  
  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place
