You turned down the love that I tried to give you  
Tore out my heart and my will to live  
I wont deny I still feel the same  
If I had it all to do over Id do it all over again  
Im a fool to feel you the way I do  
Cause only a fool would keep on loving you  
So Ill take the hurt and Ill take the pain  
If I had it all to do over Id do it all over again  
I cant erase these memories of you  
I cant forget the sweet kiss that I knew  
Oh where is my pride where is my shame  
If I had it all to do over Id do it all over again  
If I had it all to do over Id do it all over again
