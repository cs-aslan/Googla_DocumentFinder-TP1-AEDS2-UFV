You were out thereand I thought that you werefor the askingIve never been
unfairbut I was looking for a lovethat would be everlasting  
Three years of takinganything that I could finda one night stand  you
understandwasnt what I had in mindbelieve me that I lost controlI wanted you
and that wasall that really matteredoh I lost controlI couldnt tell this
whole worldhad shatteredlover I could seewas what you whipped on meand I lost
my control  
Now he was your manhe had his faultsbut you done your best to stick by himbut
then one daybam bam he shot you downwithout anyone around whowould try him  
Three years of takinganything that he could finda one night stand he didnt
understandit wasnt what you had in mindand I believe youlost controlyou ran
to me and it feltlike a whole new feelingyou lost controlyou had an open
woundand I was so good at healingbut all you could seewas the good side of

No considerationwe couldnt help ourselves insideit was a sorry situationand
he came to me one nightand he criedhe said you cut me worse  owthan any
woman ever hurt a manI said my man Im real sorrybut that was not my planand
