I want to help you  
But I dont know how  
I want to soothe you  
But I cant speak out  
I have many fears  
About rejection  
I have many memories of pain  
I have always been a bit too shy  
So Ill turn and look the other way  
  
Chorus  
Other way  
Other way  
I will turn and look the other way  
  
I want to hold you  
But I am afraid  
I want to touch you  
But Im not that way  
I have many doubts about my motives  
I have many fears about my breed  
I have always hurt the women I love  
So Ill turn and look the other way  
  
Chorus  
  
I have many doubts about my motives  
I have many fears about my breed  
I have always hurt the women I love  
So Ill turn and look the other way  
  
Other way  
Other way  
I will turn and look the other way  
Other way  
Other way  
I will turn and look the other way  
Other way  
Other way  
I will turn and look the other way  
Other way  
Other way  
Other way  
Other way wayyyy
