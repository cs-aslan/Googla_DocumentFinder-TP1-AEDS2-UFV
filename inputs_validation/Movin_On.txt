At the music heist  
I met the gourmet man  
With aluminum lungs  
Sucks all we can  
  
Seek the whole world go flip  
In a stunt bug style  
With a cellulite pile  
But he can smile  
  
This is the music  
And were movin on movin on  
  
Were sticky eyes and sticky bones  
You get no time on your own  
You get a dose and get a ghost  
You get it coast to coast  
Dye your hair black  
Get Satan tattooed on your back  
Pierce yourself with a coke can  
Put yourself in fake tan now youre in a band  
  
Cause this is the music  
And were movin on movin on  
Hey this is the music  
And were movin on movin on  
No matter how low theres always further to go  
Were movin on movin on  
  
Were movin on it wont be long  
Were movin on it wont be long
