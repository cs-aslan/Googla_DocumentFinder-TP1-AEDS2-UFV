Baby doll you wonderful baby doll  
Lets go home and tell my mother  
That I found a baby brother  
  
I am taking you off the shelf  
And showing you off myself  
  
Cant you see it now  
Youre taking me walkin  
Holding my hand  
Oh honey theres no use talkin  
Youre a wonderful baby doll  
  
I am taking you off the shelf  
And showing you off myself

Youre taking me walkin  
Holding my hand  
Oh honey theres no use talkin  
Youre a wonderful baby doll  
  
A wonderful baby doll
