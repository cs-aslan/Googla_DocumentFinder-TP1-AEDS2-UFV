O my soul  
Do you not know  
Have you not heard  
Its been told form the beginning  
The Lord your God is on your side  
  
O my soul dont be afraid  
Hope in the Lord  
By His righteousness and power  
He will strengthen  
He will guide  
  
Chorus  
And I will soar  
On wings like eagles  
Held by the hand of God  
I will run and not grow tired  
When on His name I call  
  
For the Lord is never weary  
His ways are beyond my thoughts  
I will trust in Him  
With all my heart  
Repeat verses and Chorus  
  
And I will rest upon His promise  
Patiently Ill wait  
Repeat Chorus 2 times  
  
I will trust in Him  
With all my heart  
  
And I will rest upon His promise  
Patiently Ill wait
