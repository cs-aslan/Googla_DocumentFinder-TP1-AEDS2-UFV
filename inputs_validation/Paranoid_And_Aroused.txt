Help me I am breaking  
And my heart is barely beating  
And the demons they are creeping around  
  
Take me I am sinking  
And my clothes are barely breathing  
As the angels put me into the ground  
  
And everybodys peeking  
No one makes a sound  
The shadows are deceiving  
Paranoid and aroused  
  
Slam me I am shaking  
And my guts are really aching  
And the demons theyre laughing out loud  
  
Spare me I am fading  
And my will is dissipating  
As the angels put me into the ground  
  
And everybodys peeking  
No one makes a sound  
The shadows are deceiving  
Paranoid and aroused  
  
My mind is debating  
These creatures Im making  
This medicines sedating  
The power embracing  
The fall Im facing  
My feelings Im hating  
Reality is failing  
This is degrading245  
  
And everybodys peeking  
No one makes a sound  
The shadows are deceiving  
Paranoid and aroused  
  
Im facing my felling  
Im hatting reality is failing  
This is degrading
