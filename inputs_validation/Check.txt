Coming hard core looking like a gangster bitch  
Trying to front like you aint rolling filthy rich  
Laguna Hills you were born and raised  
But youre claiming South Central is where you spent your days  
Coming out hard talking crazy shit  
Knowing in your mind that you really dont fit  
Standing up straight with a gangster lean  
Talking gangster slang about what you seen  
  
Take a chance kid  
Take a chance  
Take a chance kid  
Dont fall down hard again  
Take a chance kid  
Take a chance  
Take a chance kid  
Dont fall down hard again  
  
You better think twice before you come at me  
Right through your dome I can clearly see  
Hey little dog you gonna bark all day  
Cause toe to toe in the ring is where I play  
So you better step back and check yourself  
Stop fronting and just be yourself  
Cause no one cares what set your claiming  
Till someone grabs their gun and starts their aiming at you  
  
Take a chance kid  
Take a chance  
Take a chance kid  
Dont fall down hard again  
Take a chance kid  
Take a chance  
Take a chance kid  
Dont fall down hard again  
  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya got no clout  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya got no clout  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya got no clout  
  
Take a chance kid  
Take a chance  
Take a chance kid  
Dont fall down hard again  
Take a chance kid  
Take a chance  
Take a chance kid  
Dont fall down hard again  
  
Third verse  
Cause it aint about how hard you are  
Try using your brain and you will go far  
Be true to the color that you were born with  
Not the color that youre adorned with  
So keep it real and always be true and be yourself in all that you do  
Stand up tall and get some respect  
And always remember keep yourself in check  
  
Take a chance kid  
Take a chance  
Take a chance kid  
Dont fall down hard again  
Take a chance kid  
Take a chance  
Take a chance kid  
Dont fall down hard again  
  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya got no clout  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya got no clout  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya got no clout  
  
Take a chance kid  
Take a chance  
Take a chance kid  
Dont fall down hard again  
Take a chance kid  
Take a chance  
Take a chance kid  
Dont fall down hard again
