Theres so much I dont know  
Theres so much I dont know  
I dont understand why the summers so hot  
I dont understand why an apple core rots  
And I have no idea when Ill see a rainbow  
But theres one thing I do know  
  
Chorus  
I know that God aint no stained glass window  
And I believe there is a Holy Ghost  
I know that God aint no stained glass window  
Cause He never keeps His window closed  
  
Theres so much I dont see  
Theres so much I dont see  
I dont see how hair can turn silvergrey  
I dont see why my prayers cant get answered right away  
I dont see why some folks keep a load in their mind  
With a sharp axe to grind  
  
And I dont understand why the truth takes a twist  
I dont understand why there is loneliness  
I dont know why they claim some men have no soul  
But theres one thing I do know  
  
Chorus  
  
No He never keeps His window closed
