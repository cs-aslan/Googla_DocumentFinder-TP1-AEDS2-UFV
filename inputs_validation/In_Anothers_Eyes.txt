In anothers eyes  
Im someone who  
Loves her enough  
To walk away from you  
Id never cheat  
And I would never lie  
In anothers eyes  
In anothers eyes  
I can do no wrong  
And he believes in me  
And his faith is strong  
Id never fall  
Or even compromise  
In anothers eyes  
In anothers eyes  
Im afraid that I cant see  
This picture perfect portrait  
That they paint of me  
They dont realize  
And I pray they never do  
Cause every time I look  
Im seein you  
In anothers eyes  
In anothers eyes  
Starin back at me  
I see a sinkin soul  
Tryin desperately  
To turn the tide  
Before it dies  
In anothers eyes  
And what they dont see  
Is killing me  
Its blessing and a curse  
That love is blind  
Cause in anothers eyes  
Im afraid that I cant see  
This picture perfect portrait  
That they paint of me  
And they dont realize  
And I pray to God they never do  
Cause every time I look  
Im seein you  
In anothers eyes
