Times not sleeping and time wont lose  
You cant win cause time cant lose  
So stop so stop what youre doin  
Start on something new  
Dont no dont dont be hypnotized  
Dont start thinkin with your eyes  
  
I dont know Why you mean that much to me  
You dont know What it feels like lovin you  
We all know A change is good for you  
Thats all right Gotta do what you gotta do  
Anyway  
  
All I want is a place in your heart to fall into  
All I need is someone to love  
And tonight its you tonight its you
