Yeah hey wassup girl  
Hey yeah uh  
  
Uh angel eyes long hair  
I see you cryin whats wrong there  
He did what He fucked who  
We know the story whats new  
See I could probably rush you  
Tell you that he should have loved you  
Take advantage fuck you  
Tell you Ill do all the shit he wouldnt do  
But the truth is we all the same  
On different teams but its all a game  
The objective tryna score  
You got a wife you find a whore  
You fuck her fast she find her drawers  
Pull up her pants you find the door  
You drive her home she mop you off  
You bust again and drop her off  
Then repeat like an episode  
Why we cheat Ill never know  
Is it cause we rap Heavens no  
Lotta niggas rap though never blow  
A heterosexual girl you fine from head to toe  
Could it be cause my father let me know  
That he cheated and somehow I never told  
I never told  
  
Hey you wanna be a man  
Yeah I wanna be a man  
A man dont run tellin mama everything he see  
I aint gonna tell  
Alright then man Youre a man now  
Okay  
  
OK thats what it is I see the game  
The hoes come the seasons change  
The hoes go we rearrange  
Fuck up her life shell never be the same  
The old Gs that beat the game  
Forever young Peter Pan  
Thirty five still playin child support still payin  
Jugglin bill payin  
Been runnin round field dayin  
Wine and dine meal payin  
With hopes that shell land  
The bed and get wet then give head then  
You bet man the same girl who said we just met man  
Game colder than the fuckin dead man  
One night stands no best man  
No bridesmaids or reverends  
Cause Wolverines depressin dont wanna be your ex man  
Cause cupid aims and throw the darts  
There go the sparks and broken hearts  
Who wanna build Noahs Ark  
Just to have that shit torn apart  
  
You know what I need to talk to you  
About what  
I dont think this is working out for us  
Why  
I mean I need some space I mean no I just wanna find myself thats all  
What the fuck
