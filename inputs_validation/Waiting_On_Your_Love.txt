How long is it sposed to take  
Which song got the answer straight  
I thought I sang em all  
What face am I gonna make  
Which leg to I have to break  
To know I took the fall  
  
Its like Im standing on the edge of madness  
Save me from crossing that line  
Sure that Ill never come back  
  
Chorus   
With the dawn life goes on  
How long can I keep waiting on your love  
Hold my breath give me strength  
How long can I keep holding on  
How long can I keep waiting on your love  
  
True love is a funny thing  
Too much for a diamond ring  
To guarantee applause  
Too late when you have to guess  
Which jokes taken as tenderness  
Penny for your thoughts  
  
Just like Im hanging off the edge of madness  
Stop me from falling so far  
How can you let me let go  
  
Chorus   
  
I keep every moment frozen in time  
And if theyre all I get Ill be cold the rest of my life  
  
Chorus
