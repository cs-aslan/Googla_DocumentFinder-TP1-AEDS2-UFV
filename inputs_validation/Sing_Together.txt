If I go before I say to everyone in my ballet  
Let me take this chance to thank you for the dance  
If I run out of songs to sing to take your mind off everything  
Just smile sit a while with the Sun on your face  
and remember the place we met  
Take a breath and soon I bet youll see  
Without you I would never be me  
You are the leaves of my family tree  
  
Sing together  
If you knew me from the very start  
Or we met last week at the grocery mart  
Just sing together  
Its the least that I can do  
My final gift to you  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
When Im past the pearly gate I will find some real estate  
Where we can settle down and watch the world go round  
Well send down all the love we got and let them know we got a spot  
For them to be and its all free  
  
The sun on your face and remember the place we met  
Take a breath and soon I bet youll see  
Without you I would never be me  
You are the leaves of my family tree  
  
Sing together  
If you knew me from the very start  
Or not at all youre still a part just  
Sing together  
Its the least that I can do  
My final gift to you  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
