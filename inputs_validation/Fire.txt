Born with the fire in my blood  
Cant live without it  
Something that gold can never buy  
It doesnt matter who you are  
Or what your thinking  
If you believe in what you try  
  
Feel the fire  
Your burning desire  
  
Fire Im burning up with fire  
Fire feel it burning higher  
  
If you are rich or if you are poor  
There is no difference  
Its still in what youre fighting for  
If you are strong you will survive  
Youll feel the fire  
Burning on forever more  
  
Feel the fire  
Your burning desire  
  
Fire Im burning up with desire  
You never play with fire  
  
Fire Im burning up with desire  
You never play with fire
