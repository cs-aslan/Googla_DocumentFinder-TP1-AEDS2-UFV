In the daring night when all the  
Stars are shining bright  
Squeeze me dont leave me  
In the daring night  
Galactic swirl in the firmament tonight  
Oh with the Lord of the Dance  
With the Lord of the Dance  
In the daring night  
  
I see Orion and The Hunters  
Standing by the light of the moon  
In the daring night  
In the daring night  
And the heart and the soul  
As we look up in awe and wonder at the heavens  
Oh and we go with the Lord of the Dance  
With the Lord of the Dance the Lord of the Dance  
In the daring night  
  
In the daring night when all the stars are shining bright  
Oh baby squeeze me dont leave me in the daring night  
In the firmament we move we move and we live  
And we have our being  
Squeeze me dont leave me leave me in the daring night  
  
In the firmament we move and galactic swirl  
And we live and we breathe and have our being  
Baby in the daring light  
Darling squeeze me squeeze me  
Dont ever leave me in the daring night  
When all the stars are shining bright  
And dont let go and dont let go  
Dont let go dont let go in the daring night  
And we move and we move and we move and we move  
Baby dont let go in the daring night  
  
In the daring night when all the stars are  
Shining bright  
Baby squeeze me dont leave me in the daring night  
Capture it all oh with the Lord of the Dance  
Oh with the Lord of the Dance in the daring night  
With the Lord of the Dance in the daring night  
With the lord of the dance and the great Goddess  
Of the eternal wisdom  
Standing by the light of the moon in the daring night  
  
And the bodies move and we sweat  
And have our being  
Dont leave me in the daring night  
In the daring night when all the stars are  
Shining bright  
Squeeze me dont leave me  
Baby in the daring night  
Squeeze me dont leave me  
Baby in the daring night
