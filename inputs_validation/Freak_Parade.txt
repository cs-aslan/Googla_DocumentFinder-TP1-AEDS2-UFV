I never was bothered by bad dreams  
They never made me afraid  
But then I never did dream Id wake up  
And find me in the freak parade  
  
I guess I had to find out the hard way  
I shouldnt have been so proud  
Cause here Im the main attraction  
Of every giggle in the crowd  
  
So I gotta  
Take my place in the freak parade  
See my face in the freak parade  
In a world full of freaks  
You can creep you can crawl  
But the worlds biggest freak  
Is the one with no balls  
  
You know you shouldnt poke fun at strangers  
Or pity their case at all  
Cause there are lots of friends and lovers  
That take it kind of personal  
  
You might appreciate our position  
Dont laugh at our freaky ways  
You might find yourself tomorrow  
Marching in the freak parade  
  
You better  
Take your place in the freak parade  
See your face in the freak parade  
Get of the sidewalk
