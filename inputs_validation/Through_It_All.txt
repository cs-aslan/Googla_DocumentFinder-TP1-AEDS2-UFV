Ive had many tears and sorrows  
Ive had questions for tomorrow  
Thereve been times I didnt know right from wrong  
But in every situation  
God gave blessed consolation  
That my trials only come to make me strong  
Ive been a lot of places  
And Ive seen so many faces  
But thereve been times Ive felt so all alone  
But in that lonely hour  
In that precious lonely hour  
Jesus let me know I was His own  
Through it all through it all  
Ive learned to trust in Jesus  
Ive learned to trust in God  
Through it all through it all  
Ive learned to depend upon His Word  
So I thank God for the mountains  
And I thank Him for the valleys  
I thank Him for the storms Hes brought me through  
Cause if I never had a problem  
I wouldnt know that He could solve them  
I wouldnt know what faith in His Word could do  
Through it all through it all  
Ive learned to trust in Jesus  
Ive learned to trust in God  
Through it all through it all  
Ive learned to depend upon His Word  
Yes Ive learned to depend upon His Word  
Ive learned to depend upon His Word
