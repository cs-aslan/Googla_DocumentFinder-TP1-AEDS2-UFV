One night half a dozen tourists met together in Trafalgar Square  
A fourth nights tour on the continent was planned  
And each had his portmento in his hand  
Down the Rhine they ment to have a picnic to Joan siad I must decline  
The boys are being advised by me  
Stay away from Germany  
Whats the good of going down the Rhine  
  
Chorus  
Lets all go down the strand  
Lets all go down the strand  
Ill be leader You can march behind  
Come with me and see what you can find  
Lets all go down the strand  
Oh what a happy land  
Thats the place for fun and noise  
All amoung the girls and boys  
So lets all go down the strand  
  
One day 5 and 20 convicts  
Satted by their 20 little cells  
The bell then sounded dingadingadong  
To exercise the prisoners came along  
Buggler Ben exclaimed to Jacks The Warden  
To me sir Its very strange  
The men are tired of going round  
Round and round the same old ground  
I purpose we make a little change  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Gray crowds gathered round to welcome  
Shackleton returning from the poll  
The Lord Mayor welcomed all the galant crew  
And said my lads Ive got a treat for you  
Come with me The mansion house awaits you  
A banquet shall be supplied  
But a towering grumbling mood  
Said we dont want any food  
Then he turned to Shackleton and sighed  
  
Repeat chorus x2
