Verse 1  
Take my sins and wash them away  
Teach me how to pray  
Ive been stranded here in the dark  
Take these walls away  
Ive been swimming in the ocean  
Til Im almost drowned  
Give me something I can believe in  
Teach me how to pray  
  
PreChorus  
And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey  
Yeah we can get high and we can get stoned  
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid  
Forever be lost with no way home  
  
Chorus  
Yeah we can run and we can hide  
But we wont find the answers  
If you go down then youll get help along the way  
But if you wanna save your soul then we should travel up together  
And make the devil pray  
  
Break 1  
Oh dont save us x3  
Devils here to fool ya  
Oh dont save us x3  
Devils here to fool ya  
Ooh save us x3  
Devils here to fool ya  
Ooh save us x3  
Devils here to fool ya  
  
Verse 2  
Mother Mary cant you help me  
Cause Im gone astray  
Oh the angels that were around me  
Have aflown away  
The ground beneath my feets getting warmer  
Lucifer is near  
Holding on but Im getting weaker  
Watch me disappear  
  
PreChorus  
And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey  
Yeah we can get high and we can get stoned  
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid  
Forever be lost with no way home  
  
Chorus  
Yeah we can run and we can hide  
But we wont find the answers  
If you go down then youll get help along the way  
But if you wanna save your soul then we should travel up together  
And make the devil pray  
  
Break 2 x3  
Ooh ooh sing hallelujah  
Ooh save my soul  
Oohooh the devils here to fool ya  
Until my storys told
