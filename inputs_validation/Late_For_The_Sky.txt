The words had all been spoken  
And somehow the feeling still wasnt right  
And still we continued on through the night  
Tracing our steps from the beginning  
Until they vanished into the air  
Trying to understand how our lives has led us there  
  
Looking hard into your eyes  
There was nobody Id ever known  
Such an empty surprise to feel so alone  
  
Now for me some words come easy  
But I know that they dont mean that much  
Compared with the things that are said when lovers touch  
You never knew what I loved in you  
I dont know what you loved in me  
Maybe the picture of somebody you were hoping I might be  
  
Awake again I cant pretend and I know Im alone  
And close to the end of the feeling weve known  
  
How long have I been sleeping  
How long have I been drifting alone through the night  
How long have I been dreaming I could make it right  
If I closed my eyes and tried with all my might  
To be the one you need  
  
Awake again I cant pretend and I know Im alone  
And close to the end of the feeling weve known  
  
How long have I been sleeping  
How long have I been drifting alone through the night  
How long have I been running for that morning flight  
Through the whispered promises and the changing light  
Of the bed where we both lie  
Late for the sky
