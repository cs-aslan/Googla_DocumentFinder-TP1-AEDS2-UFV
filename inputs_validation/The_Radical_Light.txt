He was a poor boy having a hard time  
A shoulder chipped and a head for crime  
He was destined to be broken  
She found a diamond in a coal mine  
What she saw in him was a crooked line  
She just wanted him to straighten  
  
She said truth lies underneath the radical light  
Show you what you need what youre looking for  
One night underneath the radical light  
She said once you see the truth youll be wanting more  
  
She doesnt know why shes got the desire  
To lead this boy out of the burning fire  
Call it love or call it mercy  
See one night she was dreamin  
She saw a man who looked just like him  
He said When you find me baby set me free  
  
We can shine standin in the radical light  
Take a chance and find your vision  
We can feel fine walkin in the radical light  
It all comes down to radical decisions  
  
I feel your sorrow  
I know youre afraid to let it go  
Theres always tomorrow  
Come into the light you dont have to be alone anymore  
  
Chorus 2X  
Show me real truth real love  
Wake me hold me tonight  
Under the radical light  
Show me the real truth real life  
Under the radical light  
  
Someday we will be one  
Under the radical light
