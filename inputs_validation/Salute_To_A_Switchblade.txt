Me and Yates an army buddy omine were doin three years in Germany at the
time  
We came upon these Frauleins in the bar  
Yates said darf isch zee begleiten they said ya  
And darf isch zee begleiten means can we sit with you all  
  
Oh we must have drunk ten quarts of German beer  
My conscience and my sinuses were clear  
I asked that Fraulein if she was a spy she said nein but do bis ain bissel
high  
A condition not uncommon to the American soldier  
  
Well later on I went to be excused when I returned I was a bit confused  
Yates and his Fraulein had hit the air another guy was sittin in my chair  
A young soldier whom we shall get to know better  
I said excuse me Mister thats my seat Id like to have it back sir if you
please  
  
That girls a nurse and Ive been awful sick the man looked up at me and said
moxnix  
Which means that he was not overly concerned with my health  
Next thing I knew he had a switchblade knife  
Lord I didnt know that Fraulein was his wife  
  
I took off through that Gasthaus like a fool behind me I heard the crashing
stools  
As the police would say he was in hot pursuit  
Well the waitress yelled theres MPs on the way  
Thats one more reason I didnt want to stay  
  
As I went out the window somethin went switch  
And I giggled all the way home knowin he missed  
At the time it seemed like a laughing matter  
But next morning my coat was lyin there on the bunk  
  
And when I saw that coat it made me jump  
That man had cut my coat right down the back  
A little bit more and theyd been playin me taps  
And knowin the sad nature of that song I would decline it  
  
Well later on I heard that guy got stabbed  
They sent him home and didnt that make me glad  
On love and marriage I want to say one thing oh lady if youre married wear
that ring  
  
And the army has a new policy if you cant move it paint it  
If it has a switchblade knife salute it  
Not necessarily an incident one would want to write Mother about  
Germany being full of good soldiers good people
