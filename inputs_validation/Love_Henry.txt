Get down get down Love Henry she cried  
And stay all night with me  
I have gold chains and the finest I have  
Ill apply them all to thee   
  
I cant get down and I shant get down  
Or stay all night with thee  
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville  
I love far better than thee   
  
He laid his head on a pillow of down  
Kisses she gave him three  
With a penny knife that she held in her hand  
She murdered mortal he  
  
Get well get well Love Henry  she cried  
Get well get well said she  
Oh dont you see my own hearts blood  
Come flowin down so free   
  
She took him by his long yellow hair  
And also by his feet  
She plunged him into well water where  
It runs both cold and deep  
  
Lie there lie there Love Henry she cried  
Til the flesh rots off your bones  
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville  
Will mourn for your return   
  
Hush up hush up my parrot she cried  
Dont tell no news on me  
Or these costly beads around my neck  
Ill apply them all to thee  
  
Fly down fly down pretty parrot she cried  
And light on my right knee  
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold  
And hung on a willow tree   
  
I wont fly down I cant fly down  
And light on your right knee  
A girl who would murder her own true love  
Would kill a little bird like me
