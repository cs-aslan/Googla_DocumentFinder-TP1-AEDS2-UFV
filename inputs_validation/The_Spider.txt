Theres a spider on the drain and hes feeling pain  
And he doesnt want to die any more than you or I  
Hes struggling to live but he doesnt have much time  
Any more than you or I you or I  
  
Weve got to die weve got to live  
We got to take what we can get  
We sell ourselves for petty change  
And when we die we rearrange  
Its time to take it back again  
Its time to take it back again  
I want you to love me like I love you  
  
Theres nothing more for me to say  
I spoke my piece Ill go on my way  
And fare thee well whereer you go  
You might need help but I wont know  
Cuz Im up in here in my own cell  
It could be heaven it could be hell  
Well never know just who we are  
Cuz when we die we become a star  
And stars cant talk because they have  
No mouth to speak about their past  
They simply shine up in the sky  
And give their light to you and I  
And where would we be without their light  
Wed call out names and then start a fight  
But then again thats what we do  
I hate me and I hate you too  
Cuz Im in pain just like the spider  
In the drain I am a fighter  
But I cant win Ive got to lose  
Give me strength to see me through  
And ease the pain that I must feel  
As my bones break and I taste the steel  
As I go downthe drain  
Im insane
