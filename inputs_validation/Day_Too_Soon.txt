Pick me up in your arms  
Carry me away from harm  
Youre never gonna put me down  
I know youre just one good man  
Youll tire before we see land  
Youre never gonna put me down  
  
Oh Ive been running all my life  
I ran away I ran away from good  
Yeah Ive been waiting all my life  
Youre not a day youre not day too soon  
  
Honey I will stitch you  
Darling I will fit you in my heart  
Honey I will meet you  
Darling I will keep you in my heart  
  
Youll risk all this for just a kiss  
I promise I will not resist  
Promise you wont hold me down  
And when we reach a good place  
Lets be sure to leave no trace  
Promise they wont track us down  
  
Now Ive been running all my life  
I ran away I ran away from good  
Yeah Ive been waiting all my life  
Youre not a day youre not a day too soon  
  
Honey I will stitch you  
Darling i will fit you in my heart  
Honey I will meet you  
Darling I will keep you in my heart  
  
Ive been running all my life  
I ran away I ran away from good  
Yeah Ive been waiting all my life  
Youre not a day youre not a day too soon  
  
Oh honey I will stitch you  
Darling I will fit you in my heart  
Honey I will meet you  
Darling I will keep you in my heart
