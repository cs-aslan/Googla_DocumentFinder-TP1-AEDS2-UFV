I Just Want to feel you up with such dread  
Let you suck it out let you suck it out  
Till Im dry and dead  
Now Ive got love flowin in my nightmare girls  
Caffeine Cold Caffeine Cold and I cant see shit  
  
Dont breathe life in to the monster then  
Complain when he destroys it all again  
Dont breathe life into the monster then  
Complain when he destroys it all again  
  
Now I smell like cigarettes  
Cause I love to breathe your smoke  
I smell like alcohol  
Cause I drink to believe in more  
  
I have 3 drinks  
Before I even start to count  
I think Im gonna move  
Way down south  
  
Dont breathe life into the monster then  
Complain when he destroys it all again  
Dont breathe life into the monster then  
Complain when he destroys it all again  
  
Im not a monster  
Just really fucked up  
Im tired  
Ill see you in hell  
Are you judging me  
Dont laugh at me  
Dont laugh at me  
No seriously dont laugh at me  
Its not funny  
Im not joking  
Its not funny  
Im not laughing
