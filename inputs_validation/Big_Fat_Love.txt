It started out when she was small  
She was premature  
She wasnt nothing at all  
Two pounds six ounces  
A little pumpkin seed  
But she got more love  
Than you ever gonna need  
  
Chorus  
She got big fat love  
She got big fat love  
  
She dont eat enough  
To keep her alive  
When she bends over  
Shes a quarter to five  
Skinny little thing  
But she aint afraid  
To dance the Watusi  
On a razor blade  
  
Chorus  
  
Tiny little hands  
Tiny little nose  
Tiny little footsteps  
Wherever she goes  
Little bit dont leave  
No bath rub ring  
You pull the plug  
Shes down the drain  
  
Chorus  
  
She got big fat love  
  
Bigger than me  
Bigger than you  
Bigger than the hippo  
Down at the zoo  
Thin is in  
Stout is out  
Big fat love  
Is what Im talking about  
  
Chorus x2
