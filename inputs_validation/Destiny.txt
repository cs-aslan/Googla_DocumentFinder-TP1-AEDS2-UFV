Sometimes I think Ive lost my mind  
I thought I left my past behind  
I live my life and all I know is  
Follow your dream and dont let go  
  
No one can live for me  
No one can see the things I see  
I walk this road  
No one can tell me how to be  
Its my destiny  
  
There is no right there is no wrong  
There is no place where I belong  
  
Ive done my time  
Ive held it strong and  
My life is all about this song  
  
No one can live for me  
No one can see the things I see  
I walk this road  
No one can tell me how to be  
Its my destiny  
  
If I threw them all away would it change  
No  
I would live my life again rearranged  
Theres a magic in my heart  
That I feel  
Dont you know that god is love  
And its real  
  
No one can live for me  
No one can see the things I see  
I walk this road  
No one can tell me how to be  
Its my destiny  
  
My destiny  
My destiny  
My destiny  
Its my destiny
