I heard the battle raging on the other side of the wall  
Buried my head in a pillow and tried to ignore it all  
Every night when I hear you I dream of breaking down your door  
An avenging knight in shining armor to rescue you from it all  
From the family business  
  
When I see you in the supermarket  
With sunglasses in the shade  
Averting your eyes from the staring questions  
How were those bruises made  
Its family business  
  
Children clutching to your legs  
Theyve got so much they want to say  
But daddys sitting home drunk again  
So they bite their lips and pray  
  
And daddy dont like no strangers prying  
And noses in his private affairs  
And if anyone asks from the social  
Well you fell down the stairs  
Its family business  
  
So Ill become an accessory  
And I dont have an alibi  
To the victim lying on my doorstep  
The only way I could justify  
Its family business  
  
Cause every day its getting harder  
Try to see to go away  
To all the people that surround you  
You have to sit down and explain  
  
To be the writing on the wall inside  
To be the pledge you call your own  
And if you run into the day  
You sure you know youll find a home  
You sure you know youll find a home  
  
The traffic lights shine upon  
And the broken home  
Everyone could be so far away  
And the white lines lead the way  
  
The writing on the wall  
Theyre carving out the martyrs  
  
Couldve been the same this way  
Couldve been the same this way  
Tell them Im the same today  
We could have been much younger  
It could have been much longer  
  
Until the real time too far  
You run away today  
Tomorrow you take away the time  
You took away a mind  
  
Something to the light she said  
Everyones burning  
We could have been much younger
