Now that its time  
Now that the hour hand has landed at the end  
Now that its real  
Now that the dreams have given all they had to lend  
I want to know  
Do I stay or do I go  
And maybe try another time  
And do I really have a hand in my forgetting  
  
Now that Ive tried  
Now that Ive finally found that this is not the way  
Now that I turn  
Now that I feel its time to spend the night away  
I want to know  
Do I stay or do I go  
And maybe finally split the rind  
And do I really understand the undernetting  
  
Yes and the morning has me looking in your eyes and seeing mine  
Warning me to read the signs carefully  
  
Now that its love  
Now that the candles falling smaller in my mind  
Now that its here  
Now that Im almost not so very far behind  
I want to know  
Do I stay or do I go  
And maybe fall another side  
And do I really have a sound that I can ride on  
  
Now that I can  
Now that its easy ever easy all around  
Now that Im near  
Now that Im falling to the sunlights and to song  
I want to know  
Do I stay or do I go  
And do I have to do just one  
And can I choose again if I should lose the reason  
  
Yes and the morning has me looking in your eyes and seeing mine  
Warning me to read the signs oh carefully  
  
Now that I smile  
Now that Im laughing even deeper in the side  
Now that I see  
Now that I finally found the one thing I denied  
I want to know  
Do I stay or do I go  
And it is finally I decide  
That Ill be leaving in the fairest of the seasons
