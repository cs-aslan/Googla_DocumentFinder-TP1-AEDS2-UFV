Because of curiosity  
All the Vandals had to see  
The golden throne  
Of Ancient Rome  
And brought the city to its knees  
  
Because of curiosity  
  
Because of curiosity  
Im just riddled with anxiety  
Im the lowest level  
As a matter of fact  
I often dwell for days on this  
  
But when I see your smiling face  
Im so disgraced  
And if youre holding out on me  
I get curious  
As curious as I can be  
  
Curious  
Because of curiosity  
  
Curiosity killed the cat  
But satisfaction brought it back  
In terms of this cat  
As a matter of fact  
Ill meet you at the old mouse hole  
Ill meet you at the old mouse hole  
  
When I see your smiling face  
Im so disgraced  
If youre holding out on me  
I get curious  
As curious as I can be  
Curious as I can be  
Curious as I can be  
  
Yeah curiosity
