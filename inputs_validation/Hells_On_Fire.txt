Drove through the valley on my way to the sea  
I was lookin for the answer to whats botherin me  
Sat there all day and I stared at the blue  
Theres no denyin I was thinkin of you  
Hells on fire heavens freezin  
And I love you baby without good reason  
I walked to the corner watch the world go by  
Hands in my pockets and my head in the sky  
What does it matter now that everything is fine  
When I cant eat sleep or even walk a straight line  
Hells on fire heavens freezin  
And I love you baby without good reason  
Hells on fire heavens freezin  
And I love you baby without good reason  
But its hard you make it hard ah  
When I first met you I was barely alive  
Had no direction baby you had the drive  
We headed out on the wild open road  
Till we broke down from the weight of the load  
Hells on fire heavens freezin  
And I love you baby without good reason  
Hells on fire heavens freezin  
And I love you baby without good reason  
I drove through the valley on my way to the sea  
And I was lookin for the answer to whats botherin me  
Sat there all day and I stared at the blue wow  
Theres no denyin I was thinkin of you but  
Hells on fire heavens freezin  
And I love you baby without good reason  
Hells on fire heavens freezin  
And I love you baby without good reason
