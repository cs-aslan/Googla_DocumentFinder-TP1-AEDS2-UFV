Youre spinning out of control again  
Your life feels like a sinking ship  
Youre wondering how it came to this  
  
Is it too late  
Is it too far  
For Him to reach you  
And come to where you are  
  
Step out on the edge  
Dont be afraid of it  
And when you feel the rain  
Call His name  
Hell find you in the hurricane  
  
Youre in the wreckage underneath  
Your hope is buried somewhere deep  
Youre wondering how long it will keep  
  
Its never too late  
Never too far  
For you to reach out  
And take a hold of love  
  
Step out on the edge  
Dont be afraid of it  
And when you feel the rain  
Call His name  
Hell find you in the hurricane  
  
Dont back down from the fight  
Hell shelter you tonight  
Just hold on for the change  
Call His name  
Hell find you in the hurricane  
  
Theres a place theres a place you can run  
When you fall and its all come undone  
Youll be safe in the raging storm  
So just let go  
Cause you are held in His arms  
  
Step out on the edge  
Dont be afraid of it  
And when you feel the rain  
Call His name  
Hell find you in the hurricane  
  
Oh oh  
  
And when you feel the rain  
Call His name  
Hell find you in a hurricane
