Push it out girl arch your back  
Them 17s is fittin like bubblewrap  
uh plus they low on your hips  
You there let me grab  
That thing you do keep me brick  
50 told you bout the Magic Stick  
cmon lean on me  
Im in love with this scenery  
Poke it out  
Pon de river pon de bank baby stroke it out  
Sweat for your man  
Both hands on your hips for your man  
Me and the boys is your biggest fans  
Every time we see you we be like damn  
Work it girl  
Move somethin hurt me girl oh  
  
Chorus x2  
cmon cmon move somethin  
cmon cmon move somethin  
cmon cmon move somethin  
cmon cmon prove somethin  
  
Such a pimply aura  
Way way hotter than I was beforea  
She want to sit courtside next to a baller  
Where the papers longer and cats are taller  
  
Woo Im off on my own  
Do the math mami Ls on the throne  
Now take it to the floor  
Do a split if you really hardcore  
  
Man listen here  
Im hot today aint concerned with last year  
I see your lil shorty ride shotgun  
But I done left stoplights with a hot one  
  
Made her hop out and move somethin  
Jump in my joint and prove somethin  
Hehe I laugh at yall  
Dont worry about the check already cashed it yall  
  
Chorus  
  
uh pull it to the side  
Shake it for daddy its time to ride  
Make it sweat til it slide  
Do your thing like its justified  
  
Tease me a little  
Its my turn to take it to the middle  
Let me palm that thing  
You got the bomb I disarm that thing  
  
Turn it around girl I want that thing  
You had to know the way you flaunt that thing  
Your bodys jumpin  
Aint no frontin when you provin somethin  
  
Made eye contact with me  
Now bring that thing back to me  
You do your thing so naturally  
I think Im in love actually  
  
Chorus x 2
