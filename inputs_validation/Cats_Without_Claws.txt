Its a windy night  
Of first and main  
Of any city  
Of a hundred names  
Spirits fly high and the sparks fly low  
  
And the cats are all creeping out the back door slow  
And the cats are out gonna harmonize  
Theyre headed for cool street on the main line  
And here comes that joe serpentine  
The life of a cat can leave you far behind  
  
Theyre just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
  
Its hard to be yourself  
When everyone else is around  
Theres always someone out there  
Trying to pull you down  
  
Youre sitting on the fence crying out to the moon  
The day goes by too fast and the night comes too soon  
You bet your life and you sell your soul  
Give it all up for beggars gold  
And the hidden city has its own laws  
Produces a species cats without claws  
  
Theyre just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
Oh theyre just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
  
Oh here they come again  
Singing songs in a melody  
Do do do do do  
  
Oh oh its tough life tough life tough life  
And the streets are full of pain  
Specially when its calling out your name  
Its hard on the one who doesnt sacrifice  
The things the world has to offer nice  
Come inside spend some time stay alive  
Itll take your heart and itll steal your mind  
  
Oh theyre just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
Oh theyre just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
Oh oh oh oh
