If there were no dreams  
And there were no dreamers  
And how could I dream you up  
Youre still a mystery to me  
  
The way that we love  
The life that were leading  
I dont want to give you up  
Whatever Ill have to do Ill do  
  
Put a mountain there and Ill tear it down  
If its much too high then Ill go around  
I wont stop for anyone or anything  
And Id love you even if there were no dreams  
  
If there were no dreams  
How could we be lovers  
And how could I need you so  
The reasons clear to even me  
  
I know that its right  
You dont need to wonder  
If youre up against that wall  
Im gonna be up against it too  
  
If a mountains there we can tear it down  
If its much too high well just go around  
We wont stop for anyone or anything  
Wed be lovers even if there were no dreams  
  
Yes we would  
Lovers even if there were no dreams
