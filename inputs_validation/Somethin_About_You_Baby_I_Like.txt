With Rita Coolidge  
  
I see you every day  
Walking down the avenue  
Id like to get to know you  
But all I do is smile at you  
  
Oh baby  
When it comes to talking  
My tongue gets so tight  
This sidewalk love affair  
Has got me high as a kite  
  
Yeah yeah theres something  
Bout you baby I like  
  
Well Im a slow walker  
But girl Id race a mile for you  
Just to get there in time  
For my peekaboo rendezvous  
  
Well maybe its the way you  
Wear youre blue jeans so tight  
I cant put my finger on  
What youre doing right  
  
Yeah yeah theres something  
Bout you baby I like  
  
Yeah yeah theres something  
Bout you baby I like  
  
Well Im standing on a corner  
Smiling by a telephone  
Id just love to check you over  
Get to know you like  
A fine tooth comb  
  
Oh now when I go home  
I turn out the light  
And you come strolling through  
My dreams every night  
  
Yeah yeah theres something  
Bout you baby I like  
  
Yeah yeah theres something  
Bout you baby I like  
  
Yeah yeah theres something  
Bout you baby I like
