I need you  
Simple words  
But words which had never been heard  
By the soul  
Stoned to death  
But still living  
And so he froze where he stood  
And he looked to the ground  
And he cried  
He cried  
  
Ride our minds  
If you must  
But theres always a line you dont cross  
Time is short  
Dont be cruel  
Oh you dont know the power  
In what youre saying  
Oh  
And so he froze where he stood  
And he looked to the ground  
And he cried  
He cried  
  
People where  
I come from  
They survive without feelings or blood  
I never could  
Was stoned to death  
But Im still living  
So he froze where he stood  
And he looked to the ground  
And he cried  
He cried  
  
So he froze  
And he looked and he looked  
To the ground  
And he cried  
He cried
