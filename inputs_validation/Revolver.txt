His spit is worth more than her work  
Pass the purse to the pugilists  
Hes a prizefighter  
And he bought rings and he owns kin  
And now hes swingin  
And now hes the champion  
Hey revolver dont mothers make good fathers  
Revolver  
Hey revolver dont mothers make good fathers  
Revolver  
  
A spotless domain  
Hides festering hopes shes certain theres more  
Pictures of fields without fences  
A spotless domain  
Hides festering hopes shes certain theres more  
Pictures of fields without fences  
Her body numbs as he approaches the door  
As he approaches the door  
As he approaches the door  
As he approaches the door  
As he approaches  
Hey revolver dont mothers make good fathers  
Revolver  
Hey revolver dont mothers make good fathers  
Revolver  
Hey revolver dont mothers make good fathers  
Revolver  
Hey revolver dont mothers make good fathers  
Revolver

Hey revolver dont mothers make good fathers  
Revolver  
Hey revolver dont mothers make good fathers
