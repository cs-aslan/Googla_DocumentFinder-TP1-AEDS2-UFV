You dont know how bad its been  
Since you been gone  
Let me tell you how bad its been  
Since you been gone  
People speak but I dont hear  
Things all around seem to be unclear  
I dont know  
What will become of the love you turned off  
What will become of the need you turned off  
  
Loneliness is just a word  
Thats very cold  
People stare but they dont see  
All of the hurt thats inside me  
I dont know
