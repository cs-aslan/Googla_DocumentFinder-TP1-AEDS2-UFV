If all you wants a good time baby  
Theres a party down the street  
If youre trying to fight an old flame  
Well I cant take the heat  
If youre looking for a game to play  
Well I wish you luck  
Cause all I have to offer you is love  
  
If you only want a keeper darling  
I dont hold the key  
If youre searching for a savior better  
Get down on your knees  
If youre looking for the answers well  
Hell I dont know that much  
Cause all I have to offer you is love  
  
Oh darling theres a whole lot of things  
Ive found that I just cant be no I cant  
But if youre looking for a real love baby  
Ive got all that youll ever need  
It might be more than youre after  
Or not nearly enough  
But all I have to offer you is love  
  
Oh darling theres a whole lot of things
