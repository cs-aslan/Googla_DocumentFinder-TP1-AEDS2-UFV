Doug the jitterbug  
Just a silly lug  
Young and wild with lots of style  
Thats Doug the jitterbug  
  
Just a crazy mug  
Drinks liquor by the jug  
Hes alive with lots of jive  
Doug the jitterbug  
  
They threw him out of school  
Cause all he learned was Tiger Rag  
He never knew the golden rule  
But boy how he can shag  
  
Doug the jitterbug  
Cuts a wicked rug  
It aint no shame hes not to blame  
Hes Doug the jitterbug  
  
He studied to be a lawyer  
But he never got a case  
Every time theyd look for that cat in court  
Hed be doing the pantywaist  
  
Lets talk about Doug the jitterbug  
Cuts a wicked rug  
It aint no shame hes not to blame  
Hes Doug the jitterbug
