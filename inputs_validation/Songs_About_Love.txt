Well theyll tease you and theyll please you  
Make you better when youre feeling bad  
All hope is gone  singing  
Songs about love  
  
Theyll upset you and theyll get you  
Slay your fantasy till you almost believe  
Youre the only one  singing  
songs about love  
  
So dont believe theyre writing all those songs for you  
Oh no cos you know theyre only lies youre listening to  
Those songs about love  
  
Its all over now and nothings right  
Youre left crying every night  
it aint fair oh no no  
it aint fair singing all about love  
  
Theyll deceive you now theyll leave you  
Leave you so confused dont you know youve been used  
Now cant you see  singing  
All about love  
  
So dont believe theyre writing all those songs for you  
Oh no cos you know theyre only lies youre listening to  
Those songs about love  
  
Its all over now and nothings right  
Youre left crying every night  
it aint fair oh no no  
it aint fair so what youre gonna do about it  
Dont you see its just not right  
To keep your feelings out of sight  
feeling bad oh no no  
feeling bad singing songs about love  
  
And if wed never meet again  
what would you do with your life  
Do you think we could be friends  
or would it hurt you hurt you  
Dont you see they got to you and me  
With all their songs about love  
  
Well you know now better go now  
Gonna mend your heart its a brand new start  
Dont be afraid  singing  
Songs about love  
  
So dont believe theyre writing all those songs for you  
Oh no cos you know theyre only lies youre listening to  
Those songs about love  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Oh no no no no  
  
Dont you see its just not right  
To leave your feelings out of sight  
Oh no no  
Singing songs about love
