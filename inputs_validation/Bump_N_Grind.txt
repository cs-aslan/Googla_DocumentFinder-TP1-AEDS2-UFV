My mind is tellin me no but my body my bodys tellin me yes  
I baby dont want to hurt nobody  
But there is something that I must confess chill  
  
Chorus repeat 4x  
I dont see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind  
I dont see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind  
  
See I know just what you want and I know just what you need girl  
So baby bring your body to me bring your body here  
Im not fooling around with you baby  
My love is true with you with you is where I want to be girl see  
I need someone someone like me to satisfy your every needs  
  
Chorus 4x  
You say hes not treating you right  
Then lady spend the night now  
Ill love you like you need to be love girl why dont you try some of me  
No need to look no more because Ive opened up in my door  
Youll never feel another love you see  
I need someone someone like me girl to make love to you baby constantly
