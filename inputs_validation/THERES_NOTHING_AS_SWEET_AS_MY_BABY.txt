I like candy I like cake I like jam but goodness sake  
Theres nothin as sweet as my baby  
  
Golden hair and big blue eyes she could win a beauty prize  
Theres nothin as sweet as my baby  
  
If I ever lose her Ill lay me down and die  
If sugar seems sweet then you ought to meet  
My honey coated sweetie pie  
  
I like candy I like cake I like jam but goodness sake  
Theres nothin as sweet as my baby  
  
I like candy I like cake I like jam but goodness sake  
Theres nothin as sweet as my baby  
  
I feel like a honey bee when shes buzzing round with me  
Theres nothin as sweet as my baby  
  
Got pounds of candy kisses but I cant spare an ounce  
Shes sweeter than wine and brother shes mine  
And thats the only thing that counts  
  
I like candy I like cake I like jam but goodness sakes  
Theres nothin as sweet as my baby
