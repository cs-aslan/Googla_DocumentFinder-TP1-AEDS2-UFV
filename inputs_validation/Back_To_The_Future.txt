Every days a new beginning  
Thats what I stand for  
Since our possibilities  
In a world out of control  
  
Youre looking for a miracle  
To spray the air feel the rain  
Since youre out of control  
Married to pain  
  
Which way forever  
Which way will I go  
Which way forever  
Theres no heroes  
  
Take me back take me out  
Back to the future  
Back to the future  
Change your thinking  
Change your mind  
Back to the future  
  
Close your eyes and pretend  
That youre a bird in the sky  
Turn your face to the wind  
I know you can learn to fly  
  
Which way forever  
Which way will I go  
Which way forever  
Theres no heroes  
  
Take me back take me out  
Back to the future  
Back to the future  
Change your thinking  
Change your mind  
Back to the future  
Back to the future  
  
Take me back take me out  
Back to the future  
Back to the future  
Change your thinking  
Change your mind  
Back to the future  
Back to the future  
  
Believe you can be  
Believe that you can  
You can make a stay  
We can change the world  
I know we can  
  
You gotta take me back take me out  
Back to the future  
Back to the future  
Change your thinking  
Change your mind  
Back to the future  
Back to the future  
  
Take me back take me out  
Back to the future  
Back to the future  
Change your thinking  
Change your mind  
Back to the future  
Back to the future
