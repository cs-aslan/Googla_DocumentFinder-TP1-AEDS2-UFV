Standin on thin ice  
Walkin on a fine line  
Never seem to buy enough for you  
If youre lookin for a way out  
Then youre headed for the right place  
Givin up is something I cant do  
  
Ooh you got sharp claws  
Always got your back up  
Venom in your eyes and blood so blue  
Hangin on a black tie  
Sippin on a half shell  
Holdin all the cards and a joker too  
  
You should have told me sooner  
I would have let you go  
Now youre driving me crazy  
  
Chorus  
I cant stand it any longer  
When you pay the price for freedom  
It aint wrong girl  
I cant stand it any longer  
  
Dancin on hot coals  
Playin with a live wire  
Sneakin out the back door youre so cool  
If you really want to move on  
Then theres nothing left to say  
Heres a ticket for the bus stop  
Im no fool  
  
You should have told me sooner  
I would have let you go  
Now youre driving me crazy  
  
Chorus
