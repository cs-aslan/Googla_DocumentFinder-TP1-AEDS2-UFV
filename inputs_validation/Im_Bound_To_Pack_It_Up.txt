Ive thought about it for a while  
And Ive thought about the many miles  
But I think its time that Ive gone away  
The feelings that you have for me  
Have gone away its plain to see  
And it looks to me that your pulling away  
  
Im gonna pick it up  
Im gonna pick it up today  
Im bound pack it up  
Im bound pack it up and go away  
  
Ive found it hard to say to you  
That this is what I have to do  
But there is no way that Im gonna stay  
There are so many things you need to know  
And I want to tell you before I go  
But its hard to think of just what to say  
  
Im gonna pick it up  
Im gonna pick it up today  
Im bound pack it up  
Im bound pack it up and go away  
  
Im sorry to leave you all alone  
Youre sitting silent by the phone  
But wed always known there would come a day  
The bus is warm and softly lit  
And a hundred people ride in it  
I guess Im just another runaway  
  
Im gonna pick it up  
Im gonna pick it up today  
Im bound pack it up  
Im bound pack it up and go away
