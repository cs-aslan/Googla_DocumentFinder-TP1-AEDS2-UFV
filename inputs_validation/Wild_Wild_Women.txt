Lookin out for something special  
Something crazy to call my own  
Worked all week  
Now that its over  
Yes Im ready to bring it on  
Driving to me  
Itll be easy  
After all thats what its for  
If the fires too hot  
Get out of the kitchen  
Or do it do it do it on the floor  
  
So get out now  
Before its too late  
Dont bring me down  
Dont you wait too long  
  
Wild wild women  
Make the world go round  
Wild wild women  
Wild wild girls  
  
Kick your heels  
Set in motion  
After all they never stop  
Feels so good  
Must be illegal  
Thats no reason to call the cops  
She goes crazy  
In the corner  
Like some forward flash  
No problems  
No headaches  
No troubles  
Thats the best  
  
So come on now  
Before its too late  
Dont bring me down  
Dont you wait too long  
  
Wild wild women  
Never slow me down  
Wild wild women  
Wild wild girls  
  
So get out now  
Before its too late  
Dont bring me down  
Dont you wait too long  
  
Wild wild women  
Got a hold on me  
Wild wild women  
Wild wild girls  
Wild wild women  
Make the world go round  
Wild wild women  
Wild wild girls  
Will wild women  
Never slow me down  
Wild wild women  
Will wild girls
