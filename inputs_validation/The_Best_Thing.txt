Never want to fly  
Never want to leave  
Never want to say what you mean to me  
Never want to run  
Frightened to believe  
Youre the best thing about me  
  
Sometimes I feel like this is only chemistry  
Stuck in a maze searching for a way to  
Shut down turn around feel the ground beneath me  
Youre so close where do you end  
Where do I begin  
Always pushing and pulling  
Sometimes vanity takes vacation time on me  
Im in a daze stumbling bewildered  
North of gravity head up in the stratosphere  
You and I roller coaster riding love  
Youre the center of adrenalin  
And Im beginning to understand  
  
Never want to fly  
Never want to leave  
Never want to say what you mean to me  
Never want to run  
Frightened to believe  
Youre the best thing about me  
  
Walk on broken glass make my way through fire  
These are things I would do for love  
Farewell peace of mind kiss goodbye to reason  
Up is down the impossible occurs each day  
This intoxication thrills me  
I only pray it doesnt kill me  
  
Never want to fly  
Never want to leave  
Never want to say what you mean to me  
Never want to run  
Frightened to believe  
Youre the best thing about me  
  
Youre the center of adrenalin  
And Im beginning to understand  
You could be the best thing about me  
  
Never want to fly  
Never want to leave  
Never want to say what you mean to me  
Never want to run  
Frightened to believe  
Youre the best thing about me  
What if youre the best thing about me
