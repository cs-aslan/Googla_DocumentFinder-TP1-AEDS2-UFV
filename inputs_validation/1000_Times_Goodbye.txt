The tides of change pulled us apart  
I feel a familiar pain  
It seems like years since weve loved  
Or even liked and thats a lonely way to be  
  
Drifting alone in a sea of agony  
Your face I cant recognize  
Dont make this hard on us  
I will miss you if you just go away  
  
I did no right you did no wrong  
Nothing left but wasted days  
I regret you leaving  
But I will never take you back  
  
You know what Its over  
I just dont feel the same way as I used to  
Weve been together forever but its over  
  
Goodbye 1000 times goodbye  
The thought never crossed my mind  
That this would be my last goodbye  
Let me put pennies on your eyes  
And kiss your lips one last goodbye  
My love 1000 times goodbye  
  
It seems nothing good is free  
A good thing cost much more than the price  
You were good but not that good  
Dont kid yourself now its time to beak up  
  
Drifting alone in a sea of agony  
Your face I cant recognize  
Dont make this hard on us  
I will miss you if you just go away  
  
I did no right you did no wrong  
Nothing left but wasted days  
I regret you leaving  
But Ill never take you back  
  
Dont call me anymore  
Its just not  
I dont feel the same way about you  
Its not as good as it used to be  
  
Goodbye 1000 times goodbye  
The thought never crossed my mind  
That this would be my last goodbye  
Let me put pennies on your eyes  
And kiss your lips one last goodbye  
My love 1000 times goodbye  
  
Ill always love you but just not like that  
Like what  
I want to be honest with you I met someone else  
You did what  
And I really I really love him like I used to love you  
Remember the time that I told you that  
I was going out of town for business  
Well I went to see him  
You know what You suck  
  
Goodbye 1000 times  
Youll always have a special place  
In my heart you know that  
Its just I cant be with you anymore its over  
Goodbye 1000 times  
Things may not work out with him  
Goodbye 1000 times  
And if they dont  
Goodbye 1000 times  
Then Ill certainly call you  
Goodbye 1000 times  
You mean a lot to me  
I still really want to be friends with you  
I love you like youre my brother
