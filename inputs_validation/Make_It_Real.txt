You can always trust your inner feelings  
Cause they always tell the truth  
Where did it get you then your analyzing  
Just do what feels right for you  
  
If you take life as a crazy gamble  
Throw your dice take your chance  
You will see it from the different angle  
And you too can join the dance  
  
Make it real not fantasy  
Fantasy  
Make it real not fantasy  
Fantasy oh yeah  
  
Did you ever have a secret yearning  
Dont you know it could come true  
Nows the time to set wheels turning  
To open up your life for you  
  
As you know theres always good and evil  
Make your choice dont be blind  
Open up your mind and dont be trivial  
Theres a whole new world to find  
  
Make it real not fantasy  
Fantasy  
Make it real not fantasy  
Fantasy oh yeah  
  
Did you ever have a secret yearning  
Dont you know it could come true  
Nows the time to set wheels turning  
To open up your life for you  
  
If you take life as a crazy gamble  
Throw your dice take your chance  
You will see if from a different angle  
And you too will join the dance  
  
Make it real not fantasy  
Fantasy  
Make it real not fantasy  
Fantasy  
  
Make it real not fantasy  
Fantasy  
Make it real not fantasy
