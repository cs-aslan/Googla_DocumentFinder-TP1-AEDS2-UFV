To let you in and put a move on me  
Put a move on me  
Never once asked for love  
Always took it for what its worth A memory

Where the talk is cheap  
And the price is sweet  
Im not that girl

And you dont wanna see the other side of me  
So Imma hit ya off and Imma set you free  
Before you fall too deep  
Dont fall too deep

Even if he wants to stay
