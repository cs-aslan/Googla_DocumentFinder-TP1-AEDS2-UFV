You couldnt have took it any harder  
You couldnt have put it anymore sweet  
But every bone of yours for picking  
Is every bone they picked of meat  
Now youre loaded lonely and on her mind  
Now youre loaded bloated but its only til next time  
When every cut on the wall becomes a curse  
Cut yourself real deep before they get in first  
Take each good word like a crucifx  
You gave up the dte for a mouth of dirt  
Now youre loaded lonely and on her mind  
Now youre loaded bloated but its only til next time  
You scare me blind  
Cant help but take each day as another call  
To arms in the hero victims cause  
And every bone you left out for picking  
Is gonna stick in the throat of everyone that you never called  
Its only loaded on her mind  
Its only loaded but its only til next time  
You scare me blind
