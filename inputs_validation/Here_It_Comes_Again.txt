Pounding it starts again  
Hurting oh where do I began  
Screaming they dance around my head  
Hoping they maybe end up dead  
  
Feeling it ramble what can I say  
Really fucked up again I feel that I can fight  
I cant fucking given in I feel that I can fight  
Cant I ever win Ill keep it on my mind  
Here it comes again  
  
Silent it goes away  
Patient oh so really should I stay  
Trying so hard to get ahead  
Failure is often where Im lead  
  
Feeling it ramble what can I say  
Really fucked up again I feel that I can fight  
I cant fucking given in I feel that I can fight  
Cant I ever win Ill keep it on my mind  
Here it comes again  
  
Oh I must hold on  
Oh I wont be gone  
Oh I wont stop now  
Oh I dont know how  
  
Why I cant hold on  
Why I cant be gone  
Why I cant stop now  
Why Im dont know how  
  
Here we go again again  
Here we go again again  
Here we go again again  
Here we go again again  
Here we go again again  
Here we go again again  
Here we go again again  
  
Feeling it ramble what can I say  
Really fucked up again I feel that I can fight  
I cant fucking given in I feel that I can fight  
Cant I ever win Ill keep it on my mind  
Here it comes again
