Softly love is standing here with its demands  
Tell me what you want from me you want from me  
Slowly I think Im letting go of all my plans  
Tell me where were goin to were goin to  
  
Why why am I afraid to give into this  
Why am I afraid  
  
Chorus  
This doesnt have to be love  
But its all I can feel its all that I fear  
This doesnt have to be anything at all  
So hard to fall from this high above  
But do we have to call it love  
  
I hold back from everything I really want to say  
Should I let my guards down my guards down my guards down  
I dont I dont make commitments that could break  
Maybe its just too late its just too late  
  
I Im so afraid to give into this  
Im so afraid Oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Need a little time to think things through Baby  
Do I really want to give myself give all myself to you now  
I cant believe its happening so fast  
Cause I dont want to bring back what I left in the past No  
  
Chorus  
  
So hard to fall in love  
This doesnt have to be love  
Love love is all I feel your love is what I fear  
Love me love me  
So hard to fall  
So very hard to fall
