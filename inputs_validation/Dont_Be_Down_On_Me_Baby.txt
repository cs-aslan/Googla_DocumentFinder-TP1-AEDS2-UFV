I dont know why theres an open flame  
Burnin in the game its me you blame  
I cant deny it was a crime  
If you would let me try maybe youd change your mind  
  
Dont be down on me baby  
Down on me girl  
I get lost sometimes  
In my crazy world  
  
Those little things you say I do  
Well they might be true  
Tell me what good does it do  
When things go wrong Im the first you blame  
I try another way still someones gotta pay  
  
Dont be down on me baby  
Down on me girl  
I get lost sometimes  
In my crazy world  
  
Dont be down on me baby  
Cause I love you  
Cause I need you
