Some people say Im a no count  
Others say Im no good  
But Im just a natral born travellin man  
Doin what I think should oh yeah  
Doin what I think should  
Chorus  
When I was a little baby my mama said hey son  
Travel where you will and grow to be a man  
But sing what must be sung poor boy Sing what must be sung  
And I dont give a damn about a greenback dollar  
I spend it fast as I can  
For a wailing song and a good guitar  
The only things that I understand poor boy  
The only things that I understand  
Chorus  
Now that Im a grown man  
Ive travelled here and there  
I found that a jug of brandy and a song  
Are the only ones who care poor boy  
The only ones who care  
Chorus
