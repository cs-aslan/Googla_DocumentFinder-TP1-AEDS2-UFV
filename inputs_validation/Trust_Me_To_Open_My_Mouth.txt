Trust me to open my mouth now everybody knows  
Trust me now Ive let you down Im a big mouth I suppose  
This was our secret our meetings were so discreet  
I promised to keep it from the ears out on the street  
This was our secret we were having an affair  
I couldnt keep it now the secrets everywhere  
  
One cup runneth over loosening a jaw  
Trust me to open my mouth its not a secret anymore  
We had a secret what a terrible thing to do  
I couldnt have seen it I was so in love so in love with you  
  
I need a gobstopper to keep my trap shut  
Got to keep my nose clean  
Whys it me that gets the bad luck
