I see the early glow I hear you say hello  
I watch the shadows fall I dont see you at all  
Its a lie I dont believe its so its a lie  
  
I see the autumn rain falling on my window pane  
I hear you say goodbye I see a tear in your eye  
  
Its a lie I dont believe its so its a lie  
Our love couldnt go wrong  
How could I know I was only dreaming  
And now now that youre gone  
I will go on really believing  
I take the fall  
  
I see you slip away into another day  
Theres noone else around  
I watch the sun go down  
  
Its a lie I dont believe its so its a lie  
Our love couldnt go wrong  
How could I know I was only dreaming  
And now now that youre gone  
I will go on really believing  
I take the fall  
  
I take the fall  
I see you in a dream you turn and start to go  
I call to you once more guess that Im takin the fall  
  
Its a lie I dont believe its so its a lie  
Our love couldnt go wrong  
How could I know I was only dreaming  
And now now that youre gone  
I will go on really believing  
I take the fall  
  
Our love couldnt go wrong how could I know I was only dreaming  
And now now that youre gone I will go on really believing  
I take the fall
