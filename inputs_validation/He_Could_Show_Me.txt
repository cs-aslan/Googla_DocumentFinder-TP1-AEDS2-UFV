He could show me things Ive never dreamed of  
Things Ive never thought of before  
He could show me what Ive missed baby  
Somewhere there is something more  
Ive never been there I might get lost at sea  
I think hes been there and he could show me  
Could he tell me why the days were empty  
Days I wasted waiting for tomorrow  
Some other time some other place  
Some other world some other face  
He could show me he could show me
