I can feel your goodbye comin  
Like a storm up from the south  
The rainll splatter at the back door  
The windll whistle round the house  
So its you and Howie Johnston  
Somebody told me at the store  
I guess Id better get used  
To the idea of you  
Not around anymore  
  
Chorus  
And so Im doin my best to prepare for the worst  
And Id better get use to the hunger and thirst  
I gotta find me a potion  
To take for the pain  
And all youve got to lose  
Is my last name  
  
I know hes cute and hes got money  
I aint no handsome fancy Dan  
In a way its sad and kinda funny  
Youll be ok and Ill be damned  
So I best be gettin ready  
For the bitter nights alone  
Sleepin on the couch  
Wake up starting out  
Livin life on my own  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah all youve got to lose is my last name
