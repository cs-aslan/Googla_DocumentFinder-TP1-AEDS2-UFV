I dont want to go and party  
I dont want to shoot the pier  
I dont want to take the doggie for a walk  
I dont want to look at naked chicks and drink beer  
I dont want to do a bong load and go and wrench on the car  
I dont want to hose the dog shit down  
Cause I aint even gonna get out of bed  
  
I aint gettin  
I aint gettin out of bed today  
I aint gettin  
I aint gettin out of bed today  
  
Keep on skankin Ronnie  
Skank the night away  
But the time is coming  
For us all to pay  
  
I dont want to watch no porno  
And I dont want to play guitar  
I dont want to spank the monkey  
I dont want to go down to the corner bar  
And I aint even got to listen  
To all the stupid shit you got to say  
I dont want to do a god damn thing  
I dont want to  
Want to leave my bed today  
I dont want  
Want to leave my bed today  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
  
Keep on skankin Ronnie  
Skank the night away  
But the time is coming  
For us all to pay  
  
I dont want to eat burritos  
Or read about OJ  
No I dont want to get a head rush  
Cause I aint even gettin out of bed today  
I aint got to leave my bed  
  
I aint gettin  
I aint gettin out of bed today  
I aint gettin  
I aint gettin out of bed today  
No no no no no no  
  
Keep on skankin Ronnie  
Skank the night away  
But the time is coming  
For us all to pay
