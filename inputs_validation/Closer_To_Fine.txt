Im trying to tell you something about my life  
Maybe give me insight between black and white  
The best thing youve ever done for me  
Is to help me take my life less seriously its only life after all  
Well darkness has a hunger thats insatiable  
And lightness has a call thats hard to hear  
I wrap my fear around me like a blanket  
I sailed my ship of safety till I sank it Im crawling on your shore  
  
I went to the doctor I went to the mountains  
I looked to the children I drank from the fountain  
Theres more than one answer to these questions  
Pointing me in crooked line  
The less I seek my source for some definitive  
The closer I am to fine  
  
I went to see the doctor of philosophy  
With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee  
He never did marry or see a Bgrade movie  
He graded my performance he said he could see through me  
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind got my paper  
And I was free  
  
I went to the doctor I went to the mountains  
I looked to the children I drank from the fountain  
Theres more than one answer to these questions  
Pointing me in crooked line  
The less I seek my source for some definitive  
The closer I am to fine  
  
I stopped by the bar at 3 A M  
To seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend  
I woke up with a headache like my head against a board  
Twice as cloudy as Id been the night before  
I went in seeking clarity  
  
I went to the doctor I went to the mountains  
I looked to the children I drank from the fountain  
Theres more than one answer to these questions  
Pointing me in crooked line  
The less I seek my source for some definitive  
The closer I am to fine

We go to the bible we go through the workout  
We read up on revival and we stand up for the lookout  
Theres more than one answer to these questions  
Pointing me in a crooked line  
The less I seek my source for some definitive  
The closer I am to fine  
The closer I am to fine  
The closer I am to fine
