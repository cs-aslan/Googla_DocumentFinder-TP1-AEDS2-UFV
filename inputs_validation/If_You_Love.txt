Chorus  
If you love  
You know youre gonna feel the hurt  
See the flowers  
Growin from the muddy earth  
You never see the sun  
Youre never gonna feel the rain  
With your life under glass  
In the middle lane  
Youll never feel the joy  
Never feel the pain  
Chorus  
Try to build a house on top of the highest tree  
Its dangerous and a bit risky  
But what about the view  
See the clouds and the mountains too  
Chorus  
Get your hands dirty  
Get a little insane  
Come out and play with me  
Barefoot in the rain  
If you love  
You know youre gonna feel the hurt  
feel the joy feel the pain  
See the flowers  
Growin from the muddy earth  
you see the sun and then you see the rain  
You never see the sun  
Youre never gonna feel the rain  
With your life under glass  
In the middle lane  
Youll never feel the joy  
Never feel the pain  
If you love  
You know youre gonna feel the hurt  
feel the joy feel the pain  
See the flowers  
Growin from the muddy earth  
you see the sun and then you see the rain  
If you love  
You know youre gonna feel the hurt  
Growin from the muddy earth  
feel the joy feel the pain  
Never feel the pain  
you see the sun and then you see the rain
