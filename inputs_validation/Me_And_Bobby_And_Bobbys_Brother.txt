Well there was me and Bobby and Bobbys brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where Ive got all my memories those were my happiest days  
  
I remember all the games we used to play  
I really do  
And I went to see them almost everyday  
I wanted to  
Though we quarreled at times and had a few fights  
We were the best of friends  
We found a place in the sun  
A heaven of fun  
  
Well there was me and Bobby and Bobbys brother  
Wildest kids you could see  
We could play together climbing the apple tree  
Yes there was me and Bobby and Bobbys brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where Ive got all my memories those were my happiest days  
  
They would take me out for football games and such  
They liked to play  
And I guess I didnt like it very much  
But anyway  
I was happy and proud to be with the boys  
Being a little girl  
I found a place in the sun  
A heaven of fun
