I cant fight this feeling any longer  
Yet Im still afraid to let it flow  
What started out as friendship has grown stronger  
I only wish I had the strength to let it show  
  
I tell myself that I cant hold out forever  
I say there is no reason for my fear  
Cause I feel so secure when were together  
You give my life direction you make everything so clear  
  
Even as I wander Im keeping you in sight  
Youre a candle in the window on a cold dark winters night  
And Im getting closer than I ever thought I might  
  
And I cant fight this feeling anymore  
Ive forgotten what I started fighting for  
Its time to bring this ship into the shore  
And throw away the oars forever  
Cause I cant fight this feeling anymore  
Ive forgotten what I started fightin for  
And if I have to crawl upon the floor  
Come crashing through the door  
Baby I cant fight this feeling anymore  
  
My life has been such a whirl wind since I saw you  
Ive been running around in circles in my mind  
And it always seems that Im following you girl  
Cause you take me to the places that I thought Id never find  
  
Even as I wander Im keeping you in sight  
Youre a candle in the window on a cold dark winters night  
And Im getting closer than I ever though I might  
  
And I cant fight this feeling anymore  
Ive forgotten what I started fighting for  
Its time to bring this ship into the shore  
And through away the oars forever  
Cause I cant fight this feeling anymore  
Ive forgotten what I started fightin for  
And if I have to crawl upon the floor  
Come crashing through your door  
Baby I cant fight this feeling anymore  
  
Oohhhh
