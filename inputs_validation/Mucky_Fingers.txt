I know you think you deserve an explanation on the meanings of life  
But what you think that you heard slipped away out the back of your mind  
Youll get your mucky fingers burned  
You get your truth from the lies you were learned  
And all your plastic believers will leave us and they wont return  
  
And when you look in that mirror  
And youre tying up your buttons and bows  
And as you face your disease you can squeeze into the Emporers Clothes  
You found your god in a paper bag you get your history from the Union Jack  
And all your brothers and sisters are gone and they wont come back  
  
Im fed up with life in the City  
All the phoneys have blown my mind  
When Im gone you look like youd miss me  
So come along with me  but dont ask why  
Cause its all mine  
Its all mine  
Its all mine  
Its all mine

Cause its all mine  
Its all mine  
Its all mine  
Its all mine
