Stop the noise  
Stop the noise man  
  
Burns like hell  
Melt in your mouth  
Twist and turn you  
Into something else  
  
Pinch yourself  
Taste so sweet  
Twist and turn you  
Into something cheap  
  
And all you want to do now  
Yeah Yeah  
And all you want to do now  
  
Stop the noise  
You gotta stop the noise man  
Only in America  
Stop the noise  
What you see can not be yours  
You gotta stop the noise man  
Only in America  
  
Breathing hurts  
Swallowing words  
It cant  
It cant get much worse  
  
Bleed you dry  
Against your will  
Think youre running  
But youre standing still  
  
Its all you want to do now  
Yeah Yeah  
Its all you want to do now  
  
Stop the noise  
You gotta stop the noise man  
Only in America  
Stop the noise  
What you see can not be yours  
You gotta stop the noise man  
Only if you  
Make it go away
