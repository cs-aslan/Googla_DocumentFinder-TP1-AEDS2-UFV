Damn I Miss You  
Its still gone ride its still gone ride  
Uh uh uh uh cmon uh uh yeah ride uh  
  
Damn I miss you  
Ooh I feel better than before  
We shouldve never separated  
Paused or hesitated  
You rocked me to sleep  
Its like my body levitated  
Looking in the mirror  
But the heat makes it less clearer  
Its all fogged up face me baby  
Put your fingers in my mouth let me taste the gravy  
Reunited feel good real good squeeze me  
I tell you that I Love You  
But you wouldnt believe me  
  
Chorus Mashonda  
Ghetto loving when Im with you  
Anything you want I will do  
Ghetto loving when Im with you  
Anything you want I will do  
  
Mashonda  
Hello  
Baby  
There is something that I want to say to you  
Youve been on my mind now  
For a while and I just dont know what to do  
Ive been thinking of holding you holding you  
Showing you what Im all about  
And I promise that I will do  
Everything you want without a doubt  
  
Chorus  
  
Mashonda  
I know  
That weve  
Had our share of ups and downs but thats in the past  
If you promise to hold me down  
Then our love will have a second chance to last  
Ive been thinking of holding you  
Showing you what Im all about  
And I promise And I promise that I will do  
Everything you want without a doubt  
  
Chorus  
  
LL Cool J  
Forget the past  
We like Bonnie and Clyde from now on  
Back to back through the ups and downs  
Right or wrongs lay down  
Let me kiss you all down your back  
Then Ill go further down swirl my tongue around  
I apologize too  
For not recognizing the pain inside of you  
I never lie to you again  
Last time had stress on my mind  
Had a hard time believing  
That my girl could be genuine  
Its different now we ghetto lovers fo real  
I grab the wheel you hold the steel  
Teach me how to touch you where you like it the most  
From now on til we give up the ghost  
Reunited Baby  
  
Chorus
