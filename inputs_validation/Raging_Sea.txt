Sometimes the journey makes you weary  
Feels like a long and winding road  
Sometimes this life can lose its meaning  
But you might be surprised to find some hope  
Maybe youre wondering where love is  
You may fell its far away from here  
Maybe youre wondering where I am  
You might be surprised to find Im near  
  
Chorus  
And when your life is tossed and turning  
And you are on the raging sea  
Ill come and pull you from the water  
Then you will know that you are free  
  
So if youre stumbling through the valley  
Or if youre tempted to give up the fight  
Reach out your hand and I will lead you  
I will be your strong arm in the night  
  
Chorus
