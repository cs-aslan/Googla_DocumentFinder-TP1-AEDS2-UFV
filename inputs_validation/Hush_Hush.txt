Hush hush shh  
Hush hush  
  
I didnt mean to kiss you  
You didnt mean to fall in love  
I never meant to hurt you  
We never meant for it to mean this much  
Hush hush now  
  
I wanted to keep you  
Forever next to me  
You know that I still do  
And all I wanted was to believe  
Hush hush now  
  
So go on live your life  
So go on say goodbye  
So many questions  
But I dont ask why  
So this time I wont even try  
Hush hush now  
Mmm hush hush now  
  
When I try to forget you  
I just keep on remembering  
What we had was so true  
And somehow we lost everything  
Hush hush now  
Hush hush now  
  
So go on live your life  
So go on say goodbye  
So many questions  
But I dont ask why no  
So go on live your life  
So go on and say goodbye  
So many questions  
But I dont ask why  
Maybe someday  
But not tonight  
Hush hush now  
  
Hush hush now  
Hush hush now  
  
Dont dont dont you ever say a word word  
Of what you ever thought you heard heard  
Dont you ever tell a soul  
But you know  
I tried to hide but I still believe  
We that we were always meant to be be  
And I cant never let you go no  
Hush hush now  
  
So go on live your life  
So go on and say goodbye  
So many questions  
But I dont ask why no  
So go on live your life  
So go on and say goodbye  
So many questions but I dont ask why  
Maybe someday  
But not tonight  
Hush hush now mmm  
Hush hush now mmm
