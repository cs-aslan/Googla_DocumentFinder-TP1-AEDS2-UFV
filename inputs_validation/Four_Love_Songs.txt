Baby you say you have a little song for me  
But youre wearing shades and your eyes look real dark underneath  
Baby Im worried youll get it wrong for me  
Theres four love songs so which one did you write for me  
Baby you havent been getting along with me  
If you play the song I know whether to stay or cry or leave  
  
In the first song you love me but you dont think I love you  
In the second I love you but you leave  
In the third song youre confused til the day I set you free  
On the fourth someone else is loving me loving me  
  
Baby Im waiting to hear your song for me  
Cuz theres been delays since I asked if youre in love with me  
And baby the songs you write are not happy  
I cant find a line like I love you and you love me  
Baby I no longer think you belong to me  
So I got the song but you lost the girl goodbye from me  
  
In the first song you love me but you dont think I love you  
In the second I love you but you leave  
In the third song youre confused til the day I set you free  
On the fourth someone else is loving me loving me  
  
Baby Im worried youll get it wrong for me  
Theres four love songs so which one did you write for me  
  
And in the first song you love me but you dont think I love you  
In the second I love you but you leave  
In the third song youre confused til the day I set you free  
On the fourth someone else is loving me someone else is loving me
