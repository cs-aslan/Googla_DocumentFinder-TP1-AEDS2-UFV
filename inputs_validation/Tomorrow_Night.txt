After night youve gone away  
Theres nothing I can do  
Baby after the night I cant make you stay  
After you telling me youre through  
  
Now after the night therell be somebody new  
Loving these gone red  
Tomorrowll be another idle day for me  
After youve gone away  
  
Now you hold your life  
Having your fun  
Oh baby Ill be the lonely one  
Ill be  
  
After night youll go your way  
Thinking youve done right  
Oh baby Ill be here left all alone  
Mama after the night
