I understand theres no future for us here  
Guess I fooled myself into thinkin there was  
Now youve made it clear  
It will never be right guess we knew it all along  
Now weve got to say goodbye  
And Ive got to be strong  
So tell me one more time how its better for the both of us  
Tell me one more time how well hurt each other if we stay  
Tell me one more time my darlin theres just one more thing  
Before you walk away  
Explain it to my heart its better that were over now  
Tell me one more time this is the way its suppose to be  
Tell me that Im better off without you how its better to forget about you  
Darlin I understand now wont you please explain it to my heart  
Now if I try I can see the reasons why  
Why we cant stay together  
And I might convince my mind  
But its breakin my heart to know Ive got to let you go  
To find that I must leave behind  
The only love Ive known  
Well I can tell myself that I never really needed you  
I can tell myself that its better just to say goodbye  
I can tell myself a thousand lies but tell me now  
Tell me how I do  
Explain it to my heart its better that were over now  
Tell me one more time this is the way its suppose to be  
Tell me that Im better off without you how its better to forget about you  
Darlin I understand now wont you please explain it to my heart  
Say that Ill be better if we dont stay together  
Say that Ill be better off free but dont say it to me  
Explain it to my heart tell me that Im better off without you  
How its better to forget about you darlin I understand  
Now wont you please explain it to my heart  
Its better that were over now tell me one more time  
This is the way its suppose to be tell me that Im better off without you  
How its better to forget about you darlin I understand  
Now wont you please explain it to my heart
