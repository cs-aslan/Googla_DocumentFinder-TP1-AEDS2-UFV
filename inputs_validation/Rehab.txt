Baby baby  
When we first met I never felt something so strong  
You were like my lover and my best friend  
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it  
And all of a sudden you went and left  
I didnt know how to follow  
Its like a shock that spun me around  
And now my hearts dead  
I feel so empty and hollow  
  
And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you  
You dont even recognize the ways you hurt me do you  
Its gonna take a miracle to bring me back  
And youre the one to blame  
And now I feel like  
  
Oh youre the reason why Im thinking  
I dont wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more  
I guess thats what I get for wishful thinking  
I shouldve never let you enter my door  
Next time you wanna go on and leave  
I should just let you go on and do it  
Cause now Im using like I bleed  
  
Chorus  
Its like I checked into rehab  
And baby youre my disease  
Its like I checked into rehab  
And baby youre my disease  
I gotta check into rehab  
Cause baby youre my disease  
I gotta check into rehab  
Cause baby youre my disease  
  
Damn aint it crazy when youre love swept  
Youd do anything for the one you love  
Cause anytime that you needed me Id be there  
Its like you were my favorite drug  
The only problem is that you was using me  
In a different way than I was using you  
But now that I know its not meant to be  
It gotta go I gotta wean myself off of you  
  
And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you  
You dont even recognize the way you hurt me do you  
Its gonna take a miracle to bring me back  
And youre the one to blame  
Cause now I feel like  
  
Oh youre the reason why Im thinking  
I dont wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more  
I guess thats what I get for wishful thinking  
I shouldve never let you enter my door  
Next time you wanna go on and leave  
I should just let you go on and do it  
Cause now Im using like I bleed  
  
Chorus  
  
Uh uh now ladies gimme that  
Oh oh oh oh ohohoh oh oh oh  
Uh now gimme that  
Oh oh oh oh ohohoh oh oh oh  
My ladies gimme that  
Oh oh oh oh ohohoh oh oh oh  
Uh now gimme that  
Oh oh oh oh ohohoh oh oh oh  
  
Oh youre the reason why Im thinking  
I dont wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more  
I guess thats what I get for wishful thinking  
I shouldve never let you enter my door  
Next time you wanna go on and leave  
I should just let you go on and do it  
Cause now Im using like I bleed  
  
Chorus
