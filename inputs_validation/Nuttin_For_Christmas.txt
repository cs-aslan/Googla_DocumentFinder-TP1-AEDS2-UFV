Chorus  
Im getting nuttin for Christmas  
Mommy and Daddy are mad  
Im getting nuttin for Christmas  
Cause I aint been nuttin but bad  
  
I broke my bat on Johnnys head  
Somebody snitched on me  
I hid a frog in sisters bed  
Somebody snitched on me  
  
I spilled some ink on Mommys bed  
I made Tommy eat a bug  
Bought some gum with a penny slug  
Somebody snitched on me oh  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I put a tack on teachers chair  
Somebody snitched on me  
I tied a knot in Susies hair  
Somebody snitched on me  
  
I did a dance on Mommys plants  
Climbed a tree and tore my pants  
Filled that sugar bowl with ants  
Somebody snitched on me  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
So you better be good whatever you do  
Cause if youre bad Im warning you  
Youll get nuttin for Christmas
