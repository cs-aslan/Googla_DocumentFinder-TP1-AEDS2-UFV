Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
You say tomorrows another day  
All I know is were here today  
Ive got nightmares I could never share with you  
The kind that keeps me up all night  
So hold me tight till the room is light  
And tell me that its all right  
ohohohohoh  ohohoh  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
We may go our separate ways some day  
But we know we shared our dreams today  
Ive got nightmares I would never wish on you  
The kind that keeps me down all day  
So hold me tight till the sky is light  
And tell me that its all right  
ohohohohoh  ohohoh  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
Yoko  
its getting light  
Mummy mummy  
ohohohohoh  ohohoh  
  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye

Never say goodbye
