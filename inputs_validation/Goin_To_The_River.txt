Well Im goin to the river gonna jump off a boat and drown  
Yes Im goin to the river gonna jump off a boat and drown  
Because the gal I love shes gone and left this town  
Well when she left me I bowed my head and cried  
When she left me I bowed my head and cried  
I Never thought Id be Id be the one to cry  
  
So if you see my baby tell her goodbye for me  
If you see my baby tell her goodbye for me  
Cause Im tired of livin baby livin in misery  
Thats why Im goin to the river gonna jump off a boat and drown  
Yes Im goin to the river gonna jump off a boat and drown  
Because the gal I love shes gone and left this town
