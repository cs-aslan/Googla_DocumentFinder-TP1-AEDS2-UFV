Sometimes mmm  
Sometimes the world gets hard  
Oh na na na  
Im gonna take it from here girl  
Dont you worry  
  
I want to be your lake or your bay  
And any problems that you have  
I want to wash em away  
I want to be your sky  
So blue and high  
And every time you think of me  
I want to blow your mind  
  
I want to be your air  
So sweet and fair  
So when you feel that you cant breathe  
Ma Ill be there  
  
I want to be your answer all the time  
When you see how I put your life before mine  
With no question  
  
When all the love feels gone  
And you cant carry on  
Dont worry girl  
Im a take it from here  
Just as sure as the sun will shine  
Every morning every time  
Dont worry girl  
Im a take it from here  
  
I want to hold your hands  
Review all your plans  
I want to make sure everyone of your dreams is there  
I would be your Broadway show on review  
So I can act out how God was when he made you  
I want to be your lighthouse when you get lost  
Ill light a bright and shiny path to help you across  
I want to be your mother wait  
See what I see  
And when you see that cant nobody hold you like me  
Cause I love you  
  
When all the love feels gone  
And you cant carry on  
Dont worry girl  
Im a take it from here  
Just as sure as the sun will shine  
Every morning every time  
Dont worry girl no no  
Im a take it from here  
  
And when theres no one there to hold  
And you realize the world is cold  
Dont worry girl  
Im a take it from here  
Thats what Im gonna do  
Just as sure as the sun will shine  
Every morning every time  
Dont you worry baby  
Dont worry girl  
Im a take it from here  
  
Give me one reason why we should not be leaving  
This world is so deceiving the time is now  
Lets fly away speeding  
Through the Garden of Eden  
Where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds  
  
When all the love feels gone  
And you cant carry on  
Dont worry girl  
Im a take it from here  
Just as sure as the sun will shine  
Every morning every time  
Dont worry girl no no  
Im a take it from here  
  
Give me one reason  
Why we should not be leaving  
This world is so deceiving  
The time is now  
Lets fly away speeding  
Well fly away  
Through the Garden of Eden  
Where all the sweet and breathing  
Of love surrounds  
  
When all the love feels gone  
And you cant carry on  
Dont worry girl  
Ima take it from here  
Just as sure as the sun will shine  
Every morning every time  
Dont worry girl  
Ima take it from here  
  
Love aint always the way they write in books  
No no  
See theres the good guys  
And also heartbreak crooks  
Your hearts the real one  
Just take a look inside  
Cause its a colorful illustrated guide  
  
So there you go  
Dont worry  
To help you weather the storm  
Ill be there Mami  
No matter what time  
No matter what place  
You can always count on me  
Ill take it from here
