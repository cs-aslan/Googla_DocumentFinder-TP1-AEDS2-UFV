It cuts both ways  
Our love is like knife that cuts both ways  
Its driven deep into my heart each time  
That I realize  
How it cuts both ways  
Cant be together cannot live apart  
Were heading straight into a broken heart  
But I cant stop  
Cause I feel too much to let you go  
Im hurting you and its hard I know  
To stay and fight for what weve got  
Knowing itll never be good enough  
Cause you and I are dangerous  
We want too much and life aint that way  
Dont ask for more youd be a fool  
Havent we already broken every rule  
It cuts both ways  
Were in too deep for sorry alibis  
Cant have regrets or even question why  
We cant say goodbye  
Because it cuts both ways  
No more illusions of the love we make  
No sacrifice would ever be too great  
If you would just stay  
Cause I feel too much to let you go  
Im hurting you and its hard I know  
To stay and fight for what weve got  
Knowing itll never be good enough  
Cause you and I are dangerous  
We want too much and life aint that way  
Dont ask for more dont be a fool  
Havent we already broken every rule  
Cuts both ways  
Our love is like a knife that cuts both ways  
Its drivin deep into my heart each time  
I see we livin the lie  
And it cuts both ways  
It cuts both ways  
Cuts both ways  
Cuts both ways
