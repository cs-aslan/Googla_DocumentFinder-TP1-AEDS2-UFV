Theres a clock on the wall  
At the end of the hall  
That hasnt kept time in years  
Theres an old tattered bear  
In the bedroom somewhere  
Cause you cant hardly sleep less its near  
  
Theres an old box of letters  
I know you still save  
Cause youre too sentimental  
To throw them away  
But is there room in your heart  
For an old memory like me  
  
Theres an old satin gown  
Been twice handed down  
You were savin for your wedding day  
But you married in haste  
What a terrible waste  
And it never got used anyway  
  
Theres a bottle of champagne  
Its French 59  
But you might as well drink it  
To happier times  
Is there room in your heart  
For an old memory like me  
  
I used to tease you  
Cause you couldnt part with  
Things that were no use at all  
Now Im afraid that youll  
Toss them away after all  
  
Like the clock on the wall  
At the end of the hall  
That hasnt kept time in years  
Like the old tattered bear  
In the bedroom somewhere  
You cant hardly sleep less its near  
  
Theres a bottle of champagne  
Its French 59  
But you might as well drink it  
To happier times  
Is there room in your heart  
For an old memory like me  
  
Is there room in your heart  
For an old memory like me
