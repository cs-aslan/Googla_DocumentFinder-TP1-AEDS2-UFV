This table has four sturdy legs  
And a heart of very near wild oak  
When others would have screamed out loud my friend  
This one never even spoke  
  
Ive been sat upon Ive been spat upon  
Ive been treated like a bed  
Been carried like a stretcher  
when someone thinks theyre dead  
Ive been dined upon Ive been wined upon  
Ive been taken for a fool  
Taken for a desk  
when they should have been at school  
  
This tables been pushed against the door  
When tempers well tempers flare at night  
Banged upon with knuckles clenched my friend  
When someone thinks that they are right  
  
Ive been sat upon Ive been spat upon  
Ive been treated like a bed  
Been carried like a stretcher  
when someone thinks theyre dead  
Ive been dined upon Ive been wined upon  
Ive been taken for a fool  
Taken for a desk  
when they should have been at school  
  
Tables only turn when tables learn  
Put me on a bonfire watch me burn  
Treat me with some dignity dont treat me like a slave  
Or Ill turn into the coffin in your grave
