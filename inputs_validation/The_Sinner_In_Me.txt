Chorus  
If I could just hide  
The sinner inside  
And keep him denied  
How sweet life would be  
If I could be free  
From the sinner in me  
  
Ill never be a saint  
Thats not a picture that your memory paints  
Not renowned for my patience  
Im not renowned for my restraint  
But youre always around  
You can always be found  
To pick me up when Im on the ground  
  
Chorus  
  
Im still recovering  
Still getting over all the suffering  
More known for my anger  
Than for any other thing  
But youve always tried  
To be by my side  
And catch my fall when I start to slide  
  
Chorus
