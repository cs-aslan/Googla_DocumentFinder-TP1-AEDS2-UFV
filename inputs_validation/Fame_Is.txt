Fork lightning in your hall  
Break the skin when you break the fall  
Ill be the one to fix it up  
  
Love children of the new age  
Just a hippy with a weekly wage  
Theres no rebellion just a chance to be lazy  
  
When fame is in your blood  
You follow the science of love  
Wave the magic wand  
And hang on  
  
Now the rest of us are living in a daze  
Keep thinkin bout the choice to be made  
Here come the handmaidens of end time  
  
Lost treasure from a primitive race  
All your lives written on your face  
Cant fill the canyons of your mind  
  
When fame is in your blood  
You follow the science of love  
Wave the magic wand  
And hang on  
  
Now youve changed  
Youve jumbled the pieces youve changed  
Youre better off before you talk  
To a roomful of strangers  
Here come the handmaidens of end time  
  
When fame is in your blood  
You swallow the science of love  
Wave the magic wand  
All of your stars will fall  
And all of your spells will break  
So look out for number one  
Fame is in your blood
