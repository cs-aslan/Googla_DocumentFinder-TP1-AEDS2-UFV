I heard it in my sleep  
A voice more dead than old  
I thought Id known the fear  
But then it touched my soul and said  
  
You will pray for me  
Bow your head to me  
  
It came for me at night  
And took me dream by dream  
To where everything is dark  
And noone hears you scream  
Took everything I loved  
And turned love into pain  
It said Im the prophecy  
And Ill make you believe in me  
  
Sacrifice for me  
Be humility  
  
It said  
Ill make everyone pay  
Ill make everyone pay  
Some things you cant forget  
Ill make everyone pay  
Some things you cant forgive  
Ill make everyone pay  
  
And so it comes to this  
Death or eternity  
Or would you like to pay  
For all humanity  
Do you believe in faith  
Than choose heaven or hell or me  
A shadow on the sane  
The final treachery of god  
  
You will kneel for me  
Lose your eyes for me  
  
Betray the world for me  
Burn your soul for me  
  
It said  
Ill make everyone pay  
Ill make everyone pay  
Some things you cant forget  
Ill make everyone pay  
Some things you cant forgive  
Ill make everyone pay
