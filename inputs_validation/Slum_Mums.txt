Six filthy children  
From six absent fathers  
  
And then you turn  
To us for succour  
Because you think  
Were just suckers  
  
We may be welfare oh yeah  
But we dont care  
And we get paid to despise  
Your council house eyes  
  
You can change your name  
You can bleach your skin  
Camouflage your accent  
So that even you dont recognise it  
  
But you wont escape  
From the slum mums  
Because you are one  
Because you live and breathe like one  
  
And the Labour government  
Cant stand the slum mums  
Its ingrained  
Underneath your fingernails  
  
The office of the  
Social Service  
Is strategically placed  
In a dowdy rowdy part of town  
To discourage you  
From signing  
  
We make you feel  
As if youre whining  
When you claim  
Whats legally yours  
  
You can change your name  
And you can bleach your skin  
Camouflage your accent  
So that even you dont recognise it  
  
But you wont escape  
From the slum mums  
Because you are one  
Because you live and breathe like one  
  
And the Labour government  
Cant stand the slum mums  
Its ingrained  
Underneath your fingernails  
  
Take you and your rat pack brood  
To the long grass of the meadow  
Administer seven doses lethal and illegal  
Which may render you elsewhere
