I made myself a promise the day you put me down  
That I wouldnt see you if you came around  
But here you are within my arms the way you used to be  
And I broke the promise that I made to me  
  
They told me you were at a dance and I prepared to go  
I made myself a promise that Id only say hello  
I knew youd only hurt me but its such sweet misery  
So I broke the promise that I made to me  
  
A broken promise always means someone will surely cry  
And I know who that someones bound to be  
And tomorrow Ill be sorry that I told myself a lie  
And broke the promise that I made to me  
  
A broken promise always means someone will surely cry  
And I know who that someones bound to be  
And tomorrow Ill be sorry that I told myself a lie  
And broke the promise that I made to me
