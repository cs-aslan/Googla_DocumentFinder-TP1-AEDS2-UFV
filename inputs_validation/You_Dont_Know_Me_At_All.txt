I woke up this morning  
With an attitude  
Looked at the headlines  
Put me in a real bad mood  
Sitting here remember  
Tryin to stay sane  
Between the end of the summer  
And the comin of the blessed rains  
And I feel dirty  
All the way down  
I feel dirty baby  
Like this dirty town  
I gave you everything  
On a silver tray  
Could have been a fool forever  
But Im not made that way  
  
And after all these years  
I think its time to say goodbye  
Im doing you a favor  
I will not help you live a lie  
And believe me  
If you think Im gonna catch you when you fall  
You dont know me  
You dont know me at all  
  
I closed up the curtains  
Learned to confess  
Baby I knew better  
But you were such a pretty mess  
You took my breath away  
And now I want it back  
Aah you should have killed me  
Cause you always looked so good in black  
  
And after all these twisted roads  
That weve been down together  
I think its time to say goodbye  
And believe me  
If you think Im gonna get down and crawl  
You dont know me  
You dont know me at all  
  
Oooooo  
  
After all these years  
I think its time to say goodbye  
Im doing us a favor baby  
You know I cannot live a lie  
And when you need me  
And you think Im gonna be there when you call  
You dont know me  
You dont know me at all  
You dont know me at all la de da  
You dont know me at all  
You dont know me at all
