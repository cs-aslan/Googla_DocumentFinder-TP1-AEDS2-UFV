Away I see its going down  
Today Hoping in time  
Well bury all this pain  
And will awake  
Something inside  
  
We pushed our buttons far inside  
We tear our hearts out  
Then we fight  
  
Hey I know  
Feels like Ive lost everything that Ive known  
I cannot survive Alone  
Feels like Ive lost everything that Ive known  
  
Our lives were good in every way  
Too late time after time  
Our love just turned to hate  
But we stayed by each others side  
  
We pushed our buttons far inside  
We tear our hearts out  
Then we fight  
  
Hey I know  
Feels like Ive lost everything that Ive known  
I cannot survive alone  
Feels like Ive lost everything that Ive known  
  
I keep holding on I feel Im where I belong  
Every time we fight it feels so wrong  
I feel so enslaved fuck my pride  
Then we meet again  
  
We pushed our buttons far inside  
We tear our hearts out  
Then we fight  
  
Hey I know  
Feels like Ive lost everything that Ive known  
I cannot survive alone  
Feels like Ive lost everything that Ive known
