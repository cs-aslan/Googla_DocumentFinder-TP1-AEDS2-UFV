Im a machinist at the Springfield Armory  
Just slightly ahead of my time  
But I dont make much money  
So I sell eggs and chickens on the side  
  
Im good at what I do  
And I take great pride  
But I dont make much money  
So I sell eggs and chickens on the side  
  
And my wife does love me  
But she cant realize  
Why I wont go back down south  
And leave the armory behind  
  
But I love my job  
Ill shave metal until I die  
And until I do Ill take on  
Any extra thing it takes to provide  
  
And I know itll kill me  
Breathing all those fumes  
But Id sooner sniff solution  
Than a bakers dozen hothouse blooms  
  
And my wife does love me  
But she cant realize  
Why I wont go back down south  
And leave the armory behind  
  
But I feel it is important  
What I do upon my lathe  
I pledge to do the detail work  
Until my expiration day  
  
Until my expiration day  
Until my expiration day  
Until my expiration day
