MC T on a hit and to make sure I dont miss  
Kick the beat as this fool persists  
  
Step off me get the hell off well Im riding  
Flowing with this funky beat you suckers keep on tryina  
Diss this uhuh I aint having it  
Sucker duck understand my schedule work too heavy  
Im a man I mean sometimes it seems hammer claim  
But I can still cop a lean and explain to you  
An MC whos got beef Im giving grief to disbelief  
You said that I was new to this well put me on your hit list  
Im quipped to rule and I squash all the bull  
  
Chorus   
We got our own ideas  
We got our own ideas  
Yeah  
  
Antagonistic action its just a fraction  
Oof what I feel for you Ill take my time in a rhyme  
Yo lets bust a move Im steppin with confidence  
Yes I know its evident a backseat to you thats irrelevant  
You see its like this you shot and missed and now its my turn  
You learn you mess with the fire you burn and its a heat up  
Situation sticky  
Youre the duck huh I wont be picky Im bassin  
Youre chasing a dream that Im livin  
You stupid pigeon cause even with the high flow I keep a low pro  
You step off on me and thats a sho nuff no  
I mean a nogo  
Yeah something like that  
  
Chorus   
  
Fuck it youre tryin to step on my tip yeah  
  
Im a brother with a purpose pump it up T  
So Ill take my time and serve this right  
Despite the negativity  
Never want society to get the best of me  
You sold out just another fool holdin out  
On the pockets of my brothers tryin to get clout  
Step back cast the vapors your visions blurred check out my behaviour  
Calm cool never sweat the issue so what youre saying  
What Im saying is that were past due  
Gotta stand up and be counted cant you see the trouble keeps mountin boy  
And I wont stand for it so get off  
Cause Im about to have a fit  
You cant step unless you step legit  
Enough talk yall this is it lets get ill with this

Suckers are trying to step off on my tip

Suckers are trying to step off on my tip  
We got our own ideas  
Suckers are trying to step off on my tip  
  
As I roast you toast  cant stand the heat of the aftermath  
The worst you ran with you dis just to get a laugh  
the brother you ridiculed  
they say youre the king of rules
