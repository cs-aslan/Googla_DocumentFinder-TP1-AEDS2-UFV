She was a good witch  
She was a bad witch  
But all I really wanted was a mother fuckin sandwich  
A bandit left handed  
The woman drove me crazy  
But I couldnt understand it  
You could try to break me take me  
But youll never understand  
You could funnel tunnel  
But youll never truly comprehend  
Thats what I say  
You could bleed me feed me  
But youll never truly be my friend  
You could move me move me move me  
But youll never see the end  
Thats what I say  
A fish over here a fish over there  
Here a fish there a fish  
Everywhere a mother fuckin  
Fish over here a fish over there
