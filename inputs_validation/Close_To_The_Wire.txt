A hopeful adventure  
Got missionary ways  
Could start in the jungle  
Feel this way  
Search for an answer  
Over land and over sea  
All the mountains  
Of promised opportunities  
  
I cried out but you were lost  
In a corporate position  
So moneys the solution  
Curing all that ails the nation  
But what about the hearts of man  
The spiritual needs  
Im staring at the starlight  
And I just cant quite believe  
That Im  
  
Lost in the fire  
So close to the wire  
Got to survive  
So close to the wire  
  
The soul needs attention  
Like the body needs to breath  
But banks want investment  
So who are we  
Cultures are dying  
But gold reserves are safe  
Cant live in this jungle  
But cant escape  
  
Whatever happened  
To the dreams we shared together  
A taste of wine  
A moonlight song that lasts forever  
  
Lost in the fire  
So close to the wire  
Got to survive  
So close to the wire  
  
Feel the expectation  
Written in the ways  
Each move of a man give away  
  
You look good to me  
Sat in your ministry position  
An image for the masses  
Making serious decisions  
Talk about sham about  
For all the world to see  
Your rhetorics a quiz game  
And a mystery to me  
  
Lost in the fire  
So close to the wire  
Got to survive  
So close to the wire  
  
So close to the wire
