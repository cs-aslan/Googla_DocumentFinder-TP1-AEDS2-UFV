You Inspire Me  
When my eyes begin to glaze  
You Inspire Me  
In so many ways  
When Im on the ground  
You seem to know  
How to pull the blessings down  
And spread them all around  
You Inspire Me  
When my well is almost dry  
You Inspire Me  
And in the twinkling of an eye  
I am back on my feet  
Youre so inspiring to me  
The road is long and it winds through the night  
But when youre near you let there be light  
You Inspire Me  
When my eyes begin to glaze  
You inspire me  
In so many ways  
I am back on my feet  
Youre so inspiring  
I dont have to wish upon a star  
Thats how inspiring you are
