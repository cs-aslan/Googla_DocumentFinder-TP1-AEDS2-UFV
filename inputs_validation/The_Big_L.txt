Shes the top shes got the world on a string  
She makes me boogie makes me do anything

Hey now touch the sky  
youve got a certain kind of look in your eyes  
  
Well shes a miracle shes all that I need  
like the water and the air that I breathe  
yea yea   
Hey now reach the sky  
theres a certain kind of look in your smile  
  
And I know what love can do  
Yes I know what hearts can do  
  
The big love is taking the wheel  
the big love goes head over heels  
the big lust bring it into the small world  
the bigger the better  
Big love waiting to catch the big one  
head over heels the big one

Hey now touch the sky

Its bringing me to my knees  
Has to be a big thing  
Big thing
