Talk about love talk about trust  
Talkin bout forever baby  
When Im talkin bout us  
  
I give you my word stick to my guns  
Believe me when I tell ya baby  
That weve just begun  
  
You dont understand no  
The full intent of my plan  
  
Chorus  
I want to be your soul provider  
I want to stay that way  
For the longest time  
I want to be your sould provider  
Justsay youll let me  
And darlin I will  
  
I know youve been hurt I know youre love shy  
You dont have to say it baby  
Its gonna take some time  
Ya got my heart in the palm of your hand  
Swear its gonna stay there baby  
Give me half a chance  
  
You dont understand  
The full intent of my plan  
  
Ive been waitin for a long time for somebody like you  
To give my love all my love day and night  
Just say youll be mine for the rest of your life  
Baby Ill show you why  
  
Chorus
