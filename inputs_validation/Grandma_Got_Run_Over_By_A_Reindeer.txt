Dr Elmo 1979 Dr Elmos Twisted Christmas  
  
Grandma got run over by a reindeer  
Walking home from our house Christmas eve  
You can say theres no such thing as Santa  
But as for me and grandpa we believe  
Shed been drinking too much eggnog  
And we begged her not to go  
But she forgot her medication and she  
Staggered out the door into the snow  
When we found her Christmas morning  
At the scene of the attack  
She had hoofprints on her forehead  
And incriminating Claus marks on her back  
  
Now were all so proud of grandpa  
Hes been taking this so well  
See him in there watching football  
Drinking root beer and  
Playing cards with Cousin Mel  
Its not Christmas without Grandma  
All the familys dressed in black  
And we just cant help but wonder  
Should we open up her gifts  
Or send them back  
Send them back  
  
Now the goose is on the table  
And the pudding made of fig  
And the blue and silver candles  
That would just have matched  
The hair on grandmas wig  
Ive warned all my  
Friends and neighbors  
Better watch out for yourselves  
They should never give a license  
To a man who drives a sleigh  
And plays with elves
