So when my voice breaks  
Its called interpretation  
When I  
Hold a note  
Its cause I want to  
Not cause I feel anything about you  
So dont flatter yourself thinking that I  
Love you  
Make you emotional  
From major to the minor when I  
Lose control  
Im not trying to impress you  
Break it down  
And I get your attention  
But its just formula  
Dont need your validation validation  
  
This is just a song  
The music plays and then  
Then its gone again  
This is just a song  
The words dont mean a thing  
And everytime I sing  
I loved you all along  
Remember remember  
This is just a song  
  
Now Ive been nothing  
Yes Im on autopiolit  
Have selfish words  
Even singing while Im sleeping  
Just cause you have showed up here to see me  
Doesnt mean Im going home with you this evening
