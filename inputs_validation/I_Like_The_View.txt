I stepped on a flower foot on the petal  
Good wasnt home so I settled for better  
Im on my way to get it but get it got shot  
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got  
Now Im like Hey I like the view from here  
Im so high I cant see you from here  
Both eyes on the money its looking back at me  
Man these bitches just looking for a daddy  
Pussy getting problems cant live without em  
The weed too loud turn up the volume  
Richer than a bitch but I cant buy tomorrow  
Thats why I go hard ho Thats why I go hard ho  
  
God bless the world and most people in it  
Its anybodys game but nobodys winning  
Mona Lisa smile that bitch barely grinning  
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish  
We went from Boyz to Menace Menace II Society  
Now we get highya call that shit karate  
Blame it on the money the money is the bad guy  
Smoke so much good I dont even have a bad side  
Yeah I got a pussy hangover  
Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover  
Murder the perception make em get it right  
If Im flirting with perfection Im fucking her tonight  
Im a Southern delight Louisiana pride  
The belly of the beast it ate me alive  
Tell them bitches theyll never take me alive  
Ever today that I took a walk outside  
  
I stepped on a flower foot on the petal  
Good wasnt home so I settled for better  
Im on my way to get it but get it got shot  
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got  
Now Im like Hey I like the view from here  
Im so high I cant see you from here  
Both eyes on the money its looking back at me  
Man these bitches just looking for a daddy  
Pussy getting problems cant live without em  
The weed too loud turn up the volume  
Richer than a bitch but I cant buy tomorrow  
Thats why I go hard ho Thats why I go hard ho  
  
Ugh and we all kiss our mommas  
Cause promises are broken but tomorrow isnt a promise  
Think Im getting sick Im feelin illegal  
And not having money is the root of all evil  
Life is a midget so try to live it up  
Its Doctor Carter bitch I got this shit nipped and tucked  
If these walls could talk theyd probably wont shut up  
I need some wallpaper before they start the fuss  
Yeah pick up the phone and call yo block  
Call Mitchell Carmone now my pockets all bumped  
I dont think about the future it comes soon enough  
Motherfucker I dont shoot you bitch I shoot ya up  
I aint ride with these niggas I dont like these niggas  
I just roll another joint white spike with these niggas  
When I woke up this morning got the cold out my eyes  
And then I took a walk outside  
  
And I stepped on a flower foot on the petal  
Good wasnt home so I settled for better  
Im on my way to get it but get it got shot  
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got  
Now Im like Hey I like the view from here  
Im so high I cant see you from here  
Both eyes on the money its looking back at me  
Man these bitches just looking for a daddy  
Pussy getting problems cant live without em  
The weed too loud turn up the volume  
Richer than a bitch but I cant buy tomorrow  
Thats why I go hard ho Thats why I go hard ho

Nigga
