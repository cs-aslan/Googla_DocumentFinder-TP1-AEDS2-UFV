I may be wrong but I think youre wonderful  
I may be wrong but I think youre swell  
I like your style say I think its marvellous  
Im always wrong so how can I tell  
Deuces to me are all aces  
Life is to me just a bore  
Faces are all open spaces  
You might be John Barrymore  
You came along say I think youre wonderful  
I think youre grand but I may be wrong  
  
I may be wrong but I think youre wonderful  
I may be wrong but I think youre swell  
I like your style say I really think its marvellous  
Im always wrong so how can I tell  
Deuces to me are all aces  
Life is to me just a bore  
Faces are all open spaces  
You might be John Barrymore  
You came along say I think youre wonderful  
I think youre grand but I may be wrong  
  
You said that Edison would never make that light  
You laughed at Mr Franklin with his key and kite  
The point of the song is Im always wrong  
But with you baby Im oh so right
