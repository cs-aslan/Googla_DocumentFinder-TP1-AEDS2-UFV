Funny how secrets travel  
Id start to believe if I were to bleed  
Thin skies the man chains his hands held high  
Cruise me blond  
Cruise me babe  
A blond belief beyond beyond beyond  
No return No return  
Im deranged  
Deranged my love  
Im deranged down down down  
So cruise me babe cruise me baby  
CHORUS  
And the rain sets in  
Its the angelman  
Im deranged  
Cruise me cruise me cruise me babe  
The clutch of life and the fist of love  
Over your head  
Big deal Salaam  
Be real deranged Salaam  
Before we reel  
Im deranged  
CHORUS two times  
Cruise me cruise me cruise me babe
