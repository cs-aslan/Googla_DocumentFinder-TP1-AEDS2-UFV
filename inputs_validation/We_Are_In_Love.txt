I know you so well  
I can tell by the sound of your voice  
If youre really in love with me  
And you are  
You are  
  
You know I cant lie  
If I say to you baby I love you  
Then baby I love you  
And I do  
I do  
  
I do Could it be thats the  
Phrase you thought never would phase you  
Well baby you better hold on tight  
cause Im the one whos supposed to  
Kneel down and propose well alright  
I might I might  
  
So when I kiss you goodnight  
Just sleep tight with the thought that youll  
Always be caught up in love with me  
And youll dream that the stars up above  
Have the answer of whether well be  
Or whether we wont be  
In love  
Well we are  
We are
