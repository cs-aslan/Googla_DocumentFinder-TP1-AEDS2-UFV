Im too tired to go to bed  
Im too wired for anything except  
The crossfire in my head  
Its been a long night  
Cos I took all I can take  
Til the walls shook and the windows break  
I want to phone you but its far too late  
Its been a long night  
  
So talk me down  
Talk me down  
Talk me down  
Talk me down  
  
Cos we fought an endless war  
Til we forgot what we were fighting for  
Now we cant stop  
But we can withdraw  
In the long night  
  
So talk me down  
Talk me down  
Talk me down  
Talk me down  
  
The light flashed and I thought Id died  
My life passed before my eyes  
It went too fast for the love I feel  
Inside  
  
So talk me down  
Talk me down  
Talk me down  
Talk me down  
  
Down down down  
  
Lay your head near mine  
Tell me that its all fine  
Love me while theres still time  
Its been a long night
