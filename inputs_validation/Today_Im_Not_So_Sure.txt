Didnt I promise always to  
Shelter and protect you  
Didnt I answer  Yes I do  
Well today Im not so sure  
Didnt the stars shine awful bright then  
Didnt I look into your eyes and  
Didnt I swear Id always be there  
Well yeah yeah yeah  
Today Im not so sure  
Today Im not so sure  
Wasnt the world much younger then  
Isnt the word indifferent  
Which Best describes this man in descent  
Caught beteween love  
And what I meant  
Didnt I promise always to  
Shelter and protect you  
Didnt I answer  Yes I do  
Well today Im not so sure  
Didnt the stars shine awful bright then  
Didnt I look into your eyes and  
Didnt I swear Id always be there  
Well yeah yeah yeah  
Today Im not so sure
