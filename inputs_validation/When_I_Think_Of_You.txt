Magic moments  
Therere the things I will remember  
Wheres the time we spent together laughing  
Then you walk into my dream dear  
  
And I see your face  
Young and so free smiling at me  
So long since Ive had you near  
  
Now youve come back again  
Where the love never ends  
And youre right here  
When I think of you  
  
When I need you I just close my eyes  
And youre here  
Right beside me when Im lost in shadows  
Of the memories of you oh my dear  
  
And I see your face  
Young and so free smiling at me  
In your eyes I walk without fear  
Were together again  
Where the love never ends  
Cause youre right here  
When I think of you  
  
Hold on just for a while  
Hold on hold on  
  
I try to forget the night that you left  
Its all so unreal with you gone  
I can dream once again  
Where the love never ends  
Cause youre right here  
When I think of you  
When I think of you  
When I think of you
