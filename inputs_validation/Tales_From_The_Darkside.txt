Verse one ice cube  
  
Peace Haha dont make me laugh  
All I hear is muthafuckers talkin sucotash  
Livin large tellin me to get out the gang  
Im a nigga gotta live by the trigger  
How the fuck do you figure  
That I can say peace and the gunshots wont cease  
Every cop killin goes ignored  
They just send another nigga to the morgue  
A point scored they could give a fuck about us  
They rather catch us with guns and white powder  
If I was old theyd probably be a friend of me  
Since Im young they consider me the enemy  
They kill ten of me to get the job correct  
To serve protect and break a niggas neck  
cause Im the one with the trunk of funk  
And fuck tha police in the tape deck  
You should listen to me cause theres more to see  
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cause it houses minorities  
The other color dont know you can run but not hide  
These are tales from the darkside  
  
Verse two  
  
You wanna free africa I stare at yuh  
cause we aint got it too good in america  
I cant fuck with them overseas  
My homeboy died over a key of cocaine  
It was plain and simple  
The 9mm went to the temple  
Was the sound I put the bitch down  
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom  
Looked in the trash can yo it had room  
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute  
Covered with sweat I had the layback  
Mad as fuck thinkin about the payback  
Tonite the crew gonna have a little fun  
I went home and cocked the barrel of my shotgun  
Its gettin critical  I start the five point o  
There they go  drive real slow  
I yelled out ice cube sucka  
Shot gun hit  and murder mutahfuckers  
I told you last album when I got a sawed off bodies are hard off  
Its a shame that niggas die young  
But to the light side it dont matter none  
Itll be a drive by homicide  
But to me its just another tale from the darkside  
  
Verse three chuck d  
  
Standing in the middle of war  
The middle we flex  
When we die they wont make check  
Ebony cant see to the darkside  
The term they apply to us is a nigga  
Call it what you want cause Im comin from the coroner  
Same applies with a phd  
Whoz black  dont wanna role  sells his soul  
Watch his head go rollin  
Who the fuck are they foolin  
Nobody knows but I suppose the color of my clothes  
Matches the color of the one on my face as they wonder whats under my waist  
standin on the verge of them gettin brown  
Thats a fact got a fear on their bozack  
Run run run their ass off they can not hide  
Yet cube they cant fuck with the darkside
