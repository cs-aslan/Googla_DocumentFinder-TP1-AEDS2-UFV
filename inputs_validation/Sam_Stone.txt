Sam Stone came home  
To the wife and family  
After serving in the conflict overseas  
And the time that he served  
Had shattered all his nerves  
And left a little shrapnel in his knees  
But the morhpine eased the pain  
And the grass grew round his brain  
And gave him all the confidence he lacked  
With a purple heart and a monkey on his back  
  
Theres a hole in daddys arm where all the money goes  
Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose  
Little pitchers have big ears  
Dont stop to count the years  
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios  
  
Sam Stones welcome home  
Didnt last too long  
He went to work when hed spent his last dime  
And soon he took to stealing  
When he got that empty feeling  
For a hundred dollar habit without overtime  
And the gold roared through his veins  
Like a thousand railroad trains  
And eased his mind in the hours that he chose  
While the kids ran around wearin other peoples clothes  
  
Theres a hole in daddys arm where all the money goes  
Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose  
Little pitchers have big ears  
Dont stop to count the years  
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios  
  
Sam Stone was alone  
When he popped his last balloon  
Climbing walls while sitting in a chair  
Well he played his last request  
While the room smelled just like death  
With an overdose hovering in the air  
But life had lost its fun  
There was nothing to be done  
But trade his house that he bought on the GI bill  
For a flagdraped casket on a local heros hill  
  
Theres a hole in daddys arm where all the money goes  
Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose  
Little pitchers have big ears  
Dont stop to count the years  
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios
