Verse 1  
There is a secret I found a secret  
Behind a SoHo door  
There is a reason I found a reason  
Beneath the subway floor  
I found the water the devils water  
And walked along its shore  
  
BreakDown 1  
Is that what you want  
  
Verse 2  
Your channels changing the heart is racing  
From voices on the wire  
The soul is yearning the coal is burning  
The ember starts a fire  
Can we recover love for each other  
The measure of your life  
  
BreakDown 2  
Is that what you want  
Is that what you really want  
  
PreChorus  
A river a river  
A river running underground  
A river a river  
Is that what you want  
Is that what you really want  
  
Chorus x2  
I I I am a river  
I I I am your river  
  
BreakDown 2  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Bridge  
I am a river  
  
Chorus x3
