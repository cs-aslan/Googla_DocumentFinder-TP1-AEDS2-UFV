She had four white stallions coming up around the bend  
Four strong angels at her command to send  
Four more seasons for all thats broken to mend  
  
I got four good reasons why I cant go back there again  
  
She had skin like a statue milky white and pure  
Carved by an artist whose hand is demure  
Got a mind like a sabre  
Razor sharp and sure  
  
God how I hate myself for still wanting her  
  
Tell me its nicer dreaming visions soft and sure  
No way to find theres nothing left to me and her  
Nothing more but a heart still at war  
  
She had four white stallions coming up around the bend  
Four strong angels already sent  
Four more seasons for all thats broken to mend  
  
She had four more seasons wrong broken to mend  
And I got four good reasons why I cant go back there again
