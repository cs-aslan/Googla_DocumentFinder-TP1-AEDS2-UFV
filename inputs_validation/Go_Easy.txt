Looking at me never find out what a working mans about  
Raving all night sleeping away the day  
Something to ask something to say something to keep the pain away  
Something Id like to see if its alright  
  
Life go easy on me  
Love dont pass me by  
  
Spending my time making A chime And Ill throw away the rest  
Looking for ways to And ease my mind  
Something I need something I plea for something I have to say  
Something to keep me safe when Im away  
  
One way for me one way for you one way for all of us  
To get back home do whatever we want to do  
Nothing to tell you nothing to show nothing that you dont know  
Something to play something to say for now
