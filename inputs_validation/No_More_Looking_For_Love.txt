Ive been waiting  
For a love to call my own  
Ive been hoping  
You would say youre coming home  
I will put my arms around you  
Baby Im so glad I found you  
There aint nothing I can do  
Now that Im in love with you  
  
No more looking for love  
Now that Im in love with you  
No theres no more looking for love  
Now Ive found a love thats true  
  
Ive been thinking  
Bout the way you looked last night  
I remember how we held each other tight  
As we lay beside the fire  
Felt the heat of pure desire  
There aint nothing I can do  
Now that Im in love with you  
  
No more looking for love  
Now that Im in love with you  
No theres no more looking for love  
Now Ive found a love thats true  
  
Im so glad that love has come around  
Im so thankful for the love Ive found  
  
No more looking for love  
Now that Im in love with you  
No theres no more looking for love  
Now Ive found a love thats true  
  
No more looking for love  
Now that Im in love with you  
No theres no more looking for love  
Now Ive found a love thats true
