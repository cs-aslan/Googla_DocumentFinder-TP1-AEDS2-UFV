O Sacred King O Holy King  
How can I honour You rightly  
Honour thats fit for Your name  
O Sacred friend O Holy friend  
I dont take what You give lightly  
Friendship instead of disgrace  
For its the mystery of the universe  
Youre the God of holiness  
Yet You welcome souls like me  
And with the blessing of Your Fathers heart  
You disciple the ones You love  
Theres kindness in Your majesty  
Jesus those who recognise Your power  
Know just how wonderful You are  
That You draw near
