Thought Id take the slide  
I thought Id be alright  
But when the details swam  
Oh no the door got jammed  
Someone took the hand  
And we were out slow dancing  
In the blue light blue light uhhuh  
In the blue light blue light uhhuh  
In the blue light blue light uhhuh  
In the blue light blue light  
Blue light blue light  
There was a crowd below  
Swanning in the glow  
All the paste it shimmered  
In the swimmers glimmer  
It was a sticky summer  
And I was diving under  
The Blue light blue light uhhuh  
In the blue light blue light uhhuh  
In the blue light blue light uhhuh  
In the blue light blue light  
Blue light blue light  
Well nothing drove out behind me  
I was so glad  
Even the walls were turning round  
Well someone said  
There was something wrong  
But I couldnt quite  
Put my finger on it  
What the  
Well I thought I heard  
And I tried to  
Then we were just diving  
In the blue light blue light uhhuh  
In the blue light blue light uhhuh  
In the blue light blue light uhhuh  
In the blue light blue light  
Blue light blue light
