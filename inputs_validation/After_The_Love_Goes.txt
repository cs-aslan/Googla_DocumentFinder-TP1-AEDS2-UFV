Its been a year since I last saw Mary  
When she said goodbye  
She casts a spell on my intention  
Thats the reason why  
Im taking my thought from a bottle lately  
And breaking them up in my mind  
All my problems they dont look pretty  
Oh but its no surprise  
  
Well its so hard  
To take what youre given  
Well its so hard  
To give what youve got  
  
After the love goes  
Here I go  
Theres no easy way  
  
Bright lights of Memphis  
Sounds like a real good time  
But I lost my heart and my money  
Honed like cherry wine  
But I dont remember the church bells ring  
Through the day or the night  
But I kept my soul on my own  
Not without a fight  
  
Well its so hard  
To take what youre given  
Well its so hard  
To give what youve got  
  
After the love goes  
Here I go  
Theres no easy way  
  
Its been a while since I last saw Mary  
Wipe a tearful eye  
Well I remember I first saw Mary  
Saying her last goodbye  
Breaking it up from a bottle lately  
And making it up in my mind  
But all my problems they dont look pretty  
Oh thats the bottom line  
  
Its so hard  
To take what youre given  
Well its so hard  
To give what youve got  
  
After the love goes  
Here I go  
Theres no easy road
