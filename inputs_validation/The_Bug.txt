Well its a strange old game  you learn it slow  
One step forward and its back to go  
Youre standing on the throttle  
Youre standing on the brakes  
In the groove til you make a mistake  
Sometimes youre the windshield  
Sometimes youre the bug  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes youre a fool in love  
Sometimes youre the louisville slugger  
Sometimes youre the ball  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes youre going lose it all  
You gotta know happy  you gotta know glad  
Because youre gonna know lonely  
And youre gonna know bad  
When youre rippin and a ridin  
And youre coming on strong  
You start slippin and slidin  
And it all goes wrong because  
Sometimes youre the windshield  
Sometimes youre the bug  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes youre a fool in love  
Sometimes youre the louisville slugger baby  
Sometimes youre the ball  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes youre going lose it all  
One day you got the glory  
One day you got none  
One day youre a diamond  
And then youre a stone  
Everything can change  
In the blink of an eye  
So let the good times roll  
Before we say goodbye because  
Sometimes youre the windshield  
Sometimes youre the bug  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes youre a fool in love  
Sometimes youre the louisville slugger baby  
Sometimes youre the ball  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes youre going lose it all
