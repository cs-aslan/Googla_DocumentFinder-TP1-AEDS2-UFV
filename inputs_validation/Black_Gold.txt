Black is gold is pure  
And true kings of this earth  
  
1  
  
So I say its up to us to straighten  
Out this mess  
We got to go through hell  
And then thats the last of this  
Miserable test  
  
2  
  
Black must be bold  
Because its gold and true  
Kings of this world  
So let them go to the moon  
Yes let them go to mars  
Because deep down inside  
Theyre really from the stars  
  
3  
  
Thats why they dont want  
Us to mix Just the way  
The word of God had said  
So let them go to saturn Thats  
Where theyll learn instead  
Because black and white  
Together is right  
And white by itself is  
An egotistic elf  
  
4  
  
So they show you how to  
Kill And if you dont  
They will  
What do they know about  
Happiness  
How can they about life  
They just got lost in space  
So when they landed  
Atlantis cried  
  
So if theyre so alone try  
To make them feel at home  
So let them fetch you fire wood  
And let them nibble on the bone  
So invent a word called love  
And then they blame our mistakes on god  
Dont you know how lonely they must be  
So many light years from home  
Hey soulful people Im calling  
Dont be no more slaves  
Because God will protect us  
When it comes to doomsday  
Realize before its too late  
That no one on earth will escape  
We are the kings of earth  
And axis gonna put them slaves  
They killed so many worlds before  
But they will pass sentence upon themselves  
When the earth opens up Will  
They be saved from our hell  
  
I feel the truth of life  
We better all realize  
People like me and you  
We feel so bad dont know  
What to do They keep us  
High low on drugs  
And they got us making their rugs  
As we go dripping blood  
But the sun knows as  
The wind blows and the  
Fire grows towards the  
Far shores and the water  
Foams to make steamed  
Bones of all of those who dont belive that  
Black is gold is the kings of this world  
We all better get our places  
Before God tells us to our  
Face we are Past the human race  
Lets pray that we all agree  
We got to straighten out the family tree  
Life is for you and me togather  
Thats the way it was meant to be  
White man watch your mouth  
Because our drums they face the south  
And you cant kill the god  
That kept you alive between  
The poles of the north and south  
You better adjust your place  
In this world Before your  
Hair it starts to curl And the  
Yellow red and black of this  
World will tear your ass and soul apart  
  
Where is he coming from  
From heaven where 1 000 000  
Worlds are one  
Where is he going to  
Hes going to make contact  
With the living and the dead  
Here comes black gold  
Gather round young and old  
Hes going to be felt by the  
Timid and the bold  
Within a wink of an eye  
  
With the wink of an eye  
Egos swell bust and die  
Kingdoms fall and cry  
With the wink of an eye  
With the wink of an eye  
A new born baby cries  
And a 100 soldiers die with  
The wink of an eye
