We go on and on  
From dawn to dawn  
The years have flown  
Much faster than we know  
And still in love we grow  
  
Time has placed us here  
Afraid of fear  
Weve seen through tears  
That never should have come  
And still in love we grow  
  
Like a baby dove  
Our love in time its snowy wings unfold  
To soar above  
Ill stay another hour another day  
My whole life  
As long as I feel this way  
Ill stay with you and know  
As long as I feel this way  
In well grow
