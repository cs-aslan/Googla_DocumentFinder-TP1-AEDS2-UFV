Im sweating  
And breathing  
And staring and thinking  
And sinking  
Deeper  
Its almost like Im swimming  
The sun is burning hot again  
On the hunter  
And the fisherman  
And hes trying to remember when  
But it makes him dizzy  
Seems like Ive been here before  
Seems so familiar  
Seems like Im slipping  
Into a dream within a dream  
Must be the way you whisper  
The sun is setting cool again  
Im the thinker  
And the fisherman  
And Im trying to remember when  
But it makes me dizzy  
And Im sweating  
And breathing  
And staring and thinking  
And sinking  
Deeper  
And its almost like Im swimming  
Seems like Ive been here before  
Seems so familiar  
Seems like Im slipping  
Into a dream within a dream  
Its the way you whisper  
It drags me under  
And takes me home
