Youre gonna change your mind  
Youre not the loving kind  
Cause everywhere I go  
Seems that you never show  
All you do is keep on  
To talk and try to all night  
Im gonna change my mind  
Im just the loving kind  
Cause everywhere I go  
Feels that you never show  
All you do is keep on  
To talk and try to all night  
Gonna change your mind  
Youre not the loving kind  
Cause everywhere I go  
Feels that you never show  
Only to keep on  
To talk and try to all night  
All you do is keep on  
To talk and try to all night
