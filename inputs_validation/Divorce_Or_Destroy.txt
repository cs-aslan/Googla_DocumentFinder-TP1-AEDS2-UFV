Weve lived together for a long time  
But now the love is gone we once knew  
Were old enough to know we cant live life this way  
And young enough to start with somebody new  
  
So its divorce or destroying each other  
Which one of the two should we chose  
You say in your heart theres no love left for me  
And in my heart theres no love left for you  
  
We stay together for the children  
Soon the children will be grown and be gone  
Yet we keep on destroying each other  
And to live life this way just must be wrong  
  
So its divorce or destroying each other  
Which one of the two should we chose  
You say in your heart theres no love left for me  
And in my heart theres no love left for you  
  
In my heart no love left for you
