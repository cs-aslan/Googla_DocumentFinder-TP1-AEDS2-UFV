Its not cause I wouldnt  
Its not cause I shouldnt  
And you know though well its not cause I couldnt  
Its simply because Im the laziest gal in town  
  
My poor heart is achin  
To bring home the bacon  
And if I find myself alone and forsaken  
Its simply because Im the laziest gal in town  
  
Though Im more than willing to learn  
How these gals get so much extra money to burn  
Every proposition I just turn it down  
way down  
  
Its not cause I wouldnt  
Its not cause I shouldnt honey  
And you know that its not cause I couldnt  
Its simply because Im the laziest gal in town
