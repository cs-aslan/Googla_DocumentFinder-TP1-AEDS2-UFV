Bum luck will you ever know  
Im not in love with you  
A nice girl flown around in pretty girl limbo  
Im not in love with you  
Not a mean bone in her body I said  
Im not in love with you  
I love her like a bullet to the back of the head  
Im not in love with you

Lookin like a school girl dressed to kill  
Im not in love with you  
A pretty girl dress would make a mean girl ill  
Im not in love with you  
Like Jon Bonham locked to a doctor beat  
Im not in love with you  
I need a mean girl to knock me off my feet  
Im not in love with you

You just want mean girl to be nasty and mine  
So what you say  
I just want mean girl to be nasty and fine  
You just want mean girl to be nasty and mine

I just want mean girl to be nasty and fine  
You just want mean girl to be nasty and mine
