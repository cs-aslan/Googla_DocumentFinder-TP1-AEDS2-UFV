Verse 1 John Legend  
All this trouble in this here town  
All this shit going down  
When will they focus on this  
Streets ride up with the TV crews  
Look ma we on the news  
But they didnt notice before this  
They float above the city lights  
Forget the truth inhale the lies  
Just enjoy the show  
They see us reaching for the sky  
Just in order to survive  
  
Chorus John Legend  
Maybe we should go  
Go to the penthouse floor lets go lets go lets go  
Go to the penthouse floor lets go lets go lets go  
Lets ride the elevator they cant keep us out no more  
Go to the penthouse floor lets go lets go lets go  
Penthouse floor  
  
Verse 2 John Legend  
All that bubbly all that wine  
Oh man look at the times  
Didnt they notice notice  
Only future I can see aint what it used to be  
And I didnt know this I didnt know this  
Once youre above the city lights  
Wont want to spend another night down there on your own  
The holding on is made for us  
The altitude is dangerous but we aint going home  
  
Chorus John Legend  
Go to the penthouse floor lets go lets go lets go  
Go to the penthouse floor lets go lets go lets go  
Lets ride the elevator its what weve been waiting for  
Cant keep us out no more lets go lets go lets go  
Penthouse floor  
  
Verse 3 Chance The Rapper  
I heard this old joke once it was like uh  
Knock knock who there its us us who  
Just us who dis Just playin  
Just me new phone new hair new era  
Im in the penthouse baby  
Handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs  
Held back I had to grab crab legs  
And then there were only but a few  
Conversations held with patience what a party what a view  
What a dress what a song  
What a beautiful time  
My folks downstairs still waitin in line  
They never been in these rooms  
Never stayed with these folks  
Never laughed at the news never hated these jokes  
So as I fly in my suit in a group undercover  
Forcin a new smile he tells me another  
He said What happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk  
Then he pushed me off the top and said Jump nigga jump  
  
Bridge John Legend  
Oh dont bring me down I need a room in the clouds  
I wanna get there babe I wanna elevate  
Oh my favorite mix a little ignorance and bliss  
In the penthouse babe go to the penthouse  
  
Chorus John Legend  
Go to the penthouse floor lets go lets go lets go  
Go to the penthouse floor lets go lets go lets go  
Lets ride the elevator its what weve been waiting for  
Well tear down those penthouse doors lets go lets go lets go  
Those penthouse doors  
Well tear down the penthouse doors lets go lets go lets go  
Baby Im in the penthouse floor  
Baby lets ride the elevator  
Til we can rise some more  
Go to the penthouse floor penthouse floor lets go lets go lets go
