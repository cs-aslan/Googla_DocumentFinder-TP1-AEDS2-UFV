You know I deceived ya  
You see its all in my eyes  
A marquee of madness  
DeSade I claim that youre mine  
The mad eyes of your lover  
In through my eyes you see  
No youll never run  
  
I know your emotions  
Are slaves Ive bound and Ive tied  
Youll never be free  
Cause you Masters chained to your life  
The mad eyes of your lover  
In through your soul I see  
No youll never run  
  
I got no face  
But Ive a name  
Ill touch and add you to my fame  
Ill set you free but understand  
Mom and daddy made me what I am  
The mad eyes of your lover  
In through your soul I see  
No youll never run  
  
I know you hate to  
Love me love me  
No matter what you do  
I know you hate to love me love me  
Oh no you got nothing to lose no no
