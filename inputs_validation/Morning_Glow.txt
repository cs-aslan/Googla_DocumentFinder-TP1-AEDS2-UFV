Morning glow morning glow  
Starts to glimmer when you know  
Winds of change are set to blow  
And sweep this whole land through  
Morning glow is long past due  
  
Morning glow fill the earth  
Come on shine far all youre worth  
Well be present at the birth  
Of all faith looking new  
Morning glow is long past due  
  
Oh oh morning glow  
Id like to help you grow  
You should have started long ago  
  
Morning glow all days long  
For we sing tomorrows song  
Never knew we could be so strong  
But now its very clear  
Morning glow is almost here  
  
Oh oh morning glow  
Id like to help you grow  
We should have started long ago  
  
Morning glow all your life  
We can make the new day right  
All the bad songs of the night  
Will fade into the past  
Morning glow is here at last
