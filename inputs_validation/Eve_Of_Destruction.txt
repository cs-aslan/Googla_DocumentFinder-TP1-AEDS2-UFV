The eastern world it is explodin  
Violence flarin bullets loadin  
Youre old enough to kill but not for votin  
You dont believe in war whats that gun youre totin  
And even the Jordan river has bodies floatin  
  
But you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah you dont believe were on the eve of destruction  
  
Dont you understand what Im trying to say  
Cant you feel the fears that Im feeling today  
If the button is pushed theres no running away  
Therell be no one to save with the world in a grave  
Take a look around you boy its bound to scare you boy  
  
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah you dont believe were on the eve of destruction  
  
Yeah my bloods so mad feels like coagulatin  
Im sittin here just contemplatin  
I cant twist the truth it knows no regulation  
Handful of Senators dont pass legislation  
And marches alone cant bring integration  
When human respect is disintegratin  
This whole crazy world is just too frustratin  
  
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah you dont believe were on the eve of destruction  
  
Think of all the hate there is in Red China  
Then take a look around to Selma Alabama  
Ah you may leave here for four days in space  
But when your return its the same old place  
The poundin of the drums the pride and disgrace  
You can bury your dead but dont leave a trace  
Hate your nextdoorneighbor but dont forget to say grace  
  
And you tell me over and over and over and over again my friend  
You dont believe were on the eve of destruction  
You dont believe were on the eve of destruction
