Who are you girl  
Who are you boy  
Bet I know what youre up to  
Can I come along  
Your home numbers on the wall  
I just had to call had to  
Im not the only one  
Who will run with a knife  
  
Chorus  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your room  
Open up your arms  
  
One six two seven eight  
Two six three seven eight nine  
Wheres your daddy now  
I heard he ran away  
Who are you girl  
  
Cause Im so bored with myself  
Anyway  
Any time and any place  
Ill just hang around  
  
Chorus  
  
One six two seven eight  
Two six three seven eight nine  
  
Chorus  
  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your room  
Open up your arms  
Open up your door  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your room
