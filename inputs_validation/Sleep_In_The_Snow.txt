I took a flight headed north  
I wasnt waiting anymore  
And there I was hoping high  
If I could only make you mine  
  
I was safe in my fortress alone  
Then you came and tore it all down  
  
I wanted to show you the depth of this dream  
The one where I see you and fall finally  
But youre like the winters that youve always known  
Warm on the inside while I sleep in the snow  
  
I took a flight headed home  
And maybe now well never know  
But I would lose everything  
If it would bring you back to me  
  
I was safe in my fortress alone  
Then you came and tore it all down  
  
I wanted to show you the depth of this dream  
The one where I see you and fall finally  
But youre like the winters that youve always known  
Warm on the inside while I sleep in the snow  
  
Ive always run right through the moments that count  
But somehow with you I slowed down  
And whatever happened that drove you away  
I know now I cant make you stay  
  
I wanted to show you the depth of this dream  
The one where I see you and fall finally  
But youre like the winters that youve always known  
Warm on the inside while I  
  
Wanted to show you all of my dreams  
Things that I buried and no one could see  
But youre like the winters that youve always known  
Warm on the inside while I sleep in the snow
