A Night In The Life Of A Blues Singer  
Lynott  
In the old days  
I could sing the blues  
I had nothin to live for  
And nothin to lose  
And all the time  
I was paying my dues  
Like an old blues singer  
And I had no troubles then  
But I had lots of friends  
Friends they come and go  
And sometimes friendship ends  
All the time Ive had a friend on whom I depend  
So blues singer  
Oh  
Oh mama mama mama this is your boy  
Oh mama mama mama mama my souls been destroyed  
Oh mama mama your pride and joy  
Is a blues singer  
An old blues singer  
And the partys over now  
Everybodys goin home  
The band is packin up  
And Im on my own  
Oh but I miss you now youre gone  
Mama your boys a blues singer  
Such an old blues singer  
Nothin oh but nothins changed  
Oh sometimes you win sometimes you lose  
I lost ya mama  
I lost ya mama  
In the old days  
I could sing the blues  
Had nothin to live for  
And nothin to lose  
But all the time  
You must chose  
Im an old blues singer  
Oh
