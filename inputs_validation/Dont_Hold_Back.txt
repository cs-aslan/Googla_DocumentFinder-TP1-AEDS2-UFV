lead vocal  clare torry  
  
Some are born to lose their heads  
And some are born to use them  
And some will never know their ends  
And some are born to choose them  
  
Dont let your fantasies be blinded by the light  
You dont have to save your wildest dreams for the night  
  
Dont hold back dont hold back dont hold back reach out  
Touch the sky with your minds eye dont be afraid to reach out  
Some you win and some you lose  
And some will bring you sorrow  
Some are born to lead the rest  
And some are born to follow  
Dont rely on miracles to open any door  
And dont let a shadow be your guide anymore  
  
Dont hold back dont hold back dont hold back reach out  
Touch the sky with your minds eye dont be afraid to reach out  
Ride the wave of destiny  
Rise above the crest  
And believe everything that happens to you happens for the best  
Dont allow the world of men  
To turn your head no more  
Cause if you cant let yourself go  
What are you saving yourself for  
  
Dont hold back dont hold back dont hold back reach out  
Touch the sky with your minds eye dont be afraid to reach out  
  
Dont let your fantasies be blinded by the light  
For you dont have to save your wildest dreams for the night  
  
Dont hold back dont hold back dont hold back reach out  
Touch the sky with your minds eye dont be afraid to reach out
