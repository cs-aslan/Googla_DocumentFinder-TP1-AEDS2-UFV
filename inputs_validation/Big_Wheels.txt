Oh them big wheels are turning goin somewhere  
And theyre carryin her away from my side yes I cried thought Id die  
Love was just a game to me I thought Id never cry  
I thought shed be the loser but standin here am I  
And that long train is rolling goin somewhere  
And its carryin her away from my side yes I cried thought Id die  
A broken heart is somethin that I have never had  
But I learned the hard way didnt know it hurt so bad  
And them big wheels are turnin goin somewhere  
And its carryin her away from my side yes he cried thought hed die  
This burnin love unwanted this love that never dies  
Keeps right on a hurting no matter how I try  
And that old rattler rolling goin somewhere  
And its carryin her away from my side yes I cried thought Id die  
Many years Ive fooled around and many years Ive lied  
Id always be a leaving with that suitcase by my side  
But that big engines rolling goin somewhere  
And its carryin her away from my side yes I cried thought Id die  
Yes I cried thought Id die
