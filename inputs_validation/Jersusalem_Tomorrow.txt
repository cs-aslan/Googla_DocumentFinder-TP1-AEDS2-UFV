Man you should have seen me way back then  
I could tell a tale I could make a spin  
I could tell you black was white I could tell you day was night  
Not only that I could tell you why  
Back then I could really tel a lie  
  
Well Id hire a kid to say he was lame  
Then Id touch him and make him walk again  
Then Id pull some magic trick Id pretend to heal the sick  
I was takin everything they had to give  
It wasnt all that bad a way to live  
  
Well Im in this desert town and its hot as hell  
But no ones buyin what I got to sell  
I make my lame kid walk I make a dumb guy talk  
Im preachin up a storm both night and day  
But everyone just turns and walks away  
  
Well I can see that Im only wasting time  
So I head across the road to drink some wine  
This old man comes up to me He says I seen you on the street  
Youre pretty good if I do say myself  
But the guy that come thru here last month he was somethin else  
  
Instead of callin out for fire from above  
He just gets real quiet and talks about love  
And Ill tell you somethin funny He didnt want nobodys money  
Now Im not exactly sure what this all means  
But its the damndest thing I swear Ive ever seen  
  
Well since that time every town is the same  
I cant make a dime I dont know why I came  
I decide Ill go and find him And find out whos behind him  
He has everyone convinced that hes for real  
Well I figure we can work us out a deal  
  
So he offers me a job and I say fine  
He says Ill get paid off on down the line  
Well I guess Ill string along Dont see how too much can go wrong  
As long as he pays my way I guess Ill follow  
Were headed for Jerusalem tomorrow
