Excuse Me I Think Ive Got A Heartache  
From WheelsEP iTunes exclusive  
  
They just dont know how lost I feel without you  
My teardrops never see the light of day  
I laugh and joke and paint a bright tomorrow  
But if I told the truth Id have to say  
  
Excuse me I think Ive got a heartache  
Theres an aching deep inside  
And it just wont be denied  
  
Excuse me I think Ive got a heartache  
And Id better say goodbye  
Before I cry  
  
I guess its pride that makes me hide my sorrow  
I live a lie in all I do and say  
My lips may lie and paint a bright tomorrow  
But if I told the truth Id have to say  
  
Excuse me I think Ive got a heartache  
Theres an aching deep inside  
And it just wont be denied  
  
Excuse me I think Ive got a heartache  
And Id better say goodbye  
Before I cry
