I is just what I was  
And am aint who I be  
To love the language  
You got to be born  
On the banks of the Mississippi  
  
Ax ya x what talks in tongues  
Say never mo neither me  
To love the language  
You got to be born  
On the banks of the Mississippi  
  
Stayin by my mamas  
In slippers and pajamas  
Where theres always somethin good to eat  
Bettin strawberries  
Honey and cherries  
And pecanpies oh so sweet  
  
With a dewrag on my brow  
Jasmine wysteria and fleurdelis  
To love the language  
You got to be born  
On the banks of the Mississippi  
  
If you wont work fo a livin  
And live life leisurely  
Pull up a screen poch  
Flop out in a rockin chair  
To love the language  
You got to be born  
On the banks of the Mississippi
