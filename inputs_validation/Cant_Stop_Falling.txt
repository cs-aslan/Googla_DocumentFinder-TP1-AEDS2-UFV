I wasnt looking for a lover I wasnt looking for a friend  
I wasnt working undercover I wasnt trying to pretend  
But when you walked across the dance floor just like the moon across the sky  
I knew that I would have to see more I knew that I would have to try  
I look into your eyes and I realize  
  
Oh no I cant stop falling  
My heart betrays me  
And I know Ill start to feel it all again  
Wont someone save me  
  
She jumped aboard the brown line I accidentally caught her eye  
She told me she was born a Libra and I told her I was Gemini  
She made suggestive conversation then she lightly brushed my hand  
Overcome by her temptation we jumped off down by the strand  
And in the English night oh I realize it again  
  
Oh no I cant stop falling  
My heart betrays me  
And I know Ill start to feel it all again  
Wont someone save me  
  
She asks me to come inside we could just talk for a while  
I wonder if I should but her touch her touch it feels so good  
I look into your eyes and I realize it again  
  
Oh no I cant stop falling  
My heart betrays me  
And I know Ill start to feel it all again  
Wont someone save me
