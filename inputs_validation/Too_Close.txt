You know what I want I know what you dont  
I should be the one you love uh  
Boy you got my mind playing truth or dare  
Daring me kiss you right here  
  
Though weve been friends so long and it seems so wrong  
And everyone can see youre perfect for me  
But I just cant let it show  
  
Ive been thinking about you  
Boy its killing me and I got to let you know  
Baby tell me dont you feel it like I do  
Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close  
ah hah ha  
Down if we get too close  
ah hah ha  
Down if we get too close  
  
  
Remember that girl that you used to date  
She with my exboyfriend thats great  
So what would you do What would you say  
If I said I loved you   
  
Though weve been friends so long and it seems so wrong  
And everyone can see youre perfect for me  
But I just cant let it show  
  
Ive been thinking about you  
Boy its killing me and I got to let you know  
Baby tell me dont you feel it like I do  
Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close  
ah hah ha  
Down if we get too close  
ah hah ha  
Down if we get too close
