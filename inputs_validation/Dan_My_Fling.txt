I said that I felt jailed up  
As if our doors were nailed up  
I said I needed separate places  
Parties room to move around in  
I said I needed my fling  
Had to get out and do some other thing  
It took me months to calculate  
That I had nothing left without you  
  
Chorus  
Dan my fling is all flung out  
Now Ive got to fall back on dreams  
  
I thought Id try and write you  
I thought Id try and phone you  
I thought Id try to tell you  
That I smell your hair still on my pillow  
But youd just mile to please me  
Youd shake your head youd tease me   
Remind me it was I who first claimed  
That we both required freedom  
  
Chorus  
  
Id dream up schemes to meet you  
Id nonchalantly greet you  
Id ask you up for coffee  
Anytime you had an hour open  
You say you like my hair long  
You ask me if Ive written any new songs  
Youd laugh youd turn and cross the street  
And leave me dizzy with your laughter   
  
Chorus  
  
I hear youre leaving this town  
You and some girl gonna travel around  
You bought a car with foldback seats  
youll camp out by the lakes and forests  
I lie alone in our old bed  
Your laughter its echoin inside my head  
I close my eyes I smell your hair  
Its like I havent slept in years   
  
Chorus
