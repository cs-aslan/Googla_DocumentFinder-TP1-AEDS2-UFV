Theres a river in  
Evening ember glow  
And youre wishing you could see  
How far it flows  
Rolling on to an endless sea  
Youd be well on your way  
If you could only set sail  
  
But dreams can drift away  
And sails can fill with doubt  
Wheres your vision  
If the embers flicker out  
Dont let it slip from view  
  
The horizons are waiting  
Your river is fading  
  
Chorus  
So keep the fire burning tonight  
See just what comes into sight  
Dont take forever  
Take it through the night  
  
And believe the sun  
Will rise with the dawn  
Thats all you need to go on  
But for tonight  
Just keep the fire burning bright  
  
I will never need to ask  
What have I done  
Comes a moment when its clear  
Theres only one  
Oh whatever you need of me  
Ive made up my mind  
Ill give you more than youve asked for  
  
And there are those who can foresee  
Where we will go  
All the future  
I dont really want to know  
Only that youll be here with me  
  
While the embers still glow  
Well be safe till tomorrow
