I gave up cigarettes havent had to light one yet  
Its been a year sense I stopped  
Same goes for alcohol  
I dont touch the stuff at all  
I used to drink till I dropped  
  
CHORUS  
But those were tough this is easy and it feels  
So good to say Forgetting you is not that hard to do  
For Ive done it a thousand times a day Oh Ive done it a  
Thousand times a day  
  
Friends said it would take some time to get you off my mind  
Some said Id never let you go But I guess Ive proved  
Them wrong One more bad habit gone  
Just like the whiskey and the smokes  
But those were tough this is easy and Im  
All right Im ok  
Forgetting  
  
CHORUS  
  
Ive given you up for good just like I said I would  
Oh the night you walked away  
But that was tough this is easy  
  
 CHORUS
