When you feel down and out  
Sing a song itll make your day  
Heres a time to shout  
Sing a song itll make a way  
Sometimes its hard to care  
Sing a song itll make your day  
A smile so hard to bear  
Sing a song itll make a way  
  
Singasong  
Singasong  
Singasong  
Singasong  
  
Bring your heart to believing  
Sing a song itll make your day  
Life aint about no retrieving  
Sing a song itll make a way  
Give yourself what you need  
Sing a song itll make your day  
Smile smile smile and believe  
Sing a song itll make a way  
  
Singasong  
Singasong  
Singasong  
Singasong
