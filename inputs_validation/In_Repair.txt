Well its good to know that youll be okay  
Ive been waiting for this and Ill be there  
To sit while you pray no ones blaming me Im  
Not supposed to wait when they open up your heart  
  
Chorus  
I have been good I understood and  
Like a machine theyll fix you from  
The start Im in repair the life that  
We share I know that Ill be lost  
But we are always in repair  
  
And its good to know that youll drive away  
From this car crash nightmare and  
Ill be there to help you again theres  
No danger were just killing time  
Again until they order up new parts  
  
Chorus
