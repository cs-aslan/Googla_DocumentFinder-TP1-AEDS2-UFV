Life is fast but I dont wanna live past you cuz you are my only roots  
  
I was the king of the drug booze thing now Ive worn out the soles of my party
boots  
  
So call me shitfaced master of disgrace I dont care cuz my outer skin  
  
Is think like crust and a liver thats rusted out now Im on a list for a
better one  
  
Everybody wants to give a shit outta me I wont give it but ill give
ambivalence  
  
I gotta memory box cuz my memory blocks me from remembering weeks  
  
All the blacked out nights into white out mornings into grey matter
damagings  
  
So call me fat fuck geriatric punk rock Give it straight cuz I deserve  
  
A verbal beating from an audience bleating not bleeding and a melee with no
concern  
  
Everybody wants to give a shit outta me I wont give it but ill give
irresponsiveness  
  
Everybody wants to drag me up again I wanna go but the price keeps goin up  
  
Goin down is simple and practical laying low but keeping it cynical  
  
Im on the wagon and its such a drag without a key kick shot and a drag  
  
Hefes good old fashioned solo  
  
Evidently no one likes a quitter or an old punks bitterness  
  
So Im waitin for the tap on my shoulder cuz were all getting older not
better  
  
And the laughs are no longer with us theyre at us  
  
So call me fat fuck geriatric punk  
  
Call me fat fuck geriatric punk  
  
Call me fat fuck geriatric punk shit face master of disgrace
