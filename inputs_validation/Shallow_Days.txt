Mary Jane says its all right  
Shes just around the corner from the main light  
Any day now its all right  
Shes standing on the precipice of big time  
  
And I know Im a little uptight  
I got to go before the sun shines  
Were just a couple small people squeezing out a life  
We need a little good time  
  
Its not far from here  
Mary comes and goes  
Drifting through the scenery  
Of shallow days below  
Now thats everybody knows  
  
You follow trains out of town  
And they vanish somewhere under the horizon  
Yeah well I saw Mary Jane drag her shadow  
Down the tracks stare off in the distance  
  
Its not far from here  
Mary waves Hello  
Smiling though shes sinking  
In the shallow days below  
  
Oh no I cant find a way out of here  
Out on the road again  
Im much much too concerned about Mary Jane  
  
Im all alone again and  
I like what she said but not what it means  
She leaves me drowning  
Through the shallow days down below  
  
You know I heard a band  
Playing waltzes in a grange hall  
The sun is sinking lower  
People staring Mary Jane humming softly to herself  
And nobody really knows her  
  
Any day now its all right  
She tells herself that this will be the last time  
Then Mary Jane pulls her hair back and wonders  
What shell do with all her free time  
  
Not too far from here  
Mary turns to go  
Smiling while the waltz begins  
Dancing down the road  
  
Hey hey hey hey Mr Freedom  
What are we supposed to think  
Cause Im a very tiny person and it worries me  
  
Im all alone again and  
I like what she says but not what it means  
She leaves me drowning  
In the shallow days way down below  
  
Im sorry she said  
I know its not the kind of thing you want  
Im falling falling down  
Im sorry she said  
I know Im not the kind of girl you want  
Were falling falling falling falling down
