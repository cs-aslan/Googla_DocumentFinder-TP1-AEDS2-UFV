You said you wont  
I bet my neck I bet you will  
Im gonna check my love  
You Im gonna thrill  
Cant imagine what youve missed  
Cant go on  
Meet me at midnight in the light that starts the love  
  
CHORUS  
Since theres was you  
I changed my mind about it all  
Instead of goin on  
Im gonna settle for a fall  
My love my love will lift you up up up  
  
You came into my life and now I realize  
Today we love we might but it is for sure at midnight  
  
CHORUS  
  
You came into my life and now I realize  
Today we love we might but it is for sure at midnight  
At midnight at midnight at midnight
