I left my baby  
I bought a ticket for the train  
I waited all day long  
But the train never came  
  
And I was so glad  
I was so glad  
The train never came  
  
The reason I was leaving  
Was all because of sin  
I didnt want to do it  
But I was sucked in  
  
And I was so sad  
I was so bad  
I didnt go home  
  
I was out with the boys  
Drinking all night  
Gambling all my money  
Got into a fight  
  
And I cried for my baby  
But my baby never came  
Sirens were a wailing  
And I stepped off of the train  
  
I picked up my bags  
And started down the road  
The night was drawing in now  
And I was getting cold  
  
And I was so glad  
I was so glad  
She was still home  
  
Ill never go out with the boys  
Drinking all night  
Im saving all my money  
Never getting in a fight  
  
And Ill stay with my baby  
Never leaving her alone  
Im keeping outta trouble  
So Ill be staying at home  
  
Ill be so glad  
Were both still home  
  
Were both still home  
  
Were both still home  
  
Staying at home  
Staying at home  
  
Were both still home
