Send me no roses what I need most is you  
Oh without fail everyday since you went away  
The doorbell rings youre sending roses again  
In my room all petals fall but darling thats not all  
  
I read your card then tears began to fall  
Send me no roses please no more roses  
Roses are red I know but through my tears they look blue  
Send me no roses please no more roses  
Your roses cant hold me what I need most is you  
  
Send me no roses
