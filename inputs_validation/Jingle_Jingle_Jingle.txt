Jingle jingle jingle  
You will hear my sleigh bells ring  
I am old Kris Kringle  
Im the King of Jingling  
  
Jingle jingle reindeer  
Through the frosty air they go  
They are not just plain deer  
Theyre the fastest deer I know Ho Ho  
  
You must believe that on Christmas Eve  
I wont pass you by  
Ill dash away in my magic sleigh  
Flying through the sky  
  
Jingle jingle jingle  
You will hear my sleigh bells ring  
I am old Kris Kringle  
Im the King of Jingling Ho Ho For Thy mercy and Thy grace  
Constant through another year  
Hear our song of thankfulness  
Father and Redeemer hear  
  
Dark the future
