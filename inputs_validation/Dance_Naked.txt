I want you to dance naked  
So I can see you  
Id like to get to know you  
You dont have to act naughty  
Spin it round and round  
Spin it round and round and round  
I want you to dance naked  
I promise I wont touch you  
I promise to tell no one no  
I want you to dance naked  
Spin it round and round  
Spin it round and round and round  
Spin it round and round  
I want you to dance naked  
If you like Ill join you  
I want to enjoy your body  
I want to hear all your secrets  
I want to know if you like me  
As much as I like you  
I want you to dance naked  
But only if you want to  
Spin it round and round  
Spin it round and round and round  
Spin it round and round  
I want you to dance naked  
So I can see you  
Id like to get to know you  
But only if you want to  
Spin it round and round  
Spin it round and round and round  
Spin it round and round  
Spin it round and round and round  
I want you to dance naked
