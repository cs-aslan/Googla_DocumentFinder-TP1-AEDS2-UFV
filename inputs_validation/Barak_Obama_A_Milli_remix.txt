Call the president hes the next new president  
He a senator from Illinois yeah  
His criteria compared to John Mccain just isnt fair  
Cuz hes blac so the eyes are on he  
Through is pencil he write  
Legislation with the country on his mind  
And he dont cope ish  
Cuz he aint got time  
Every second minute hour kkk wanna devour  
He got guards ready to pop him  
With their ch ch ch ch choppers  
Every brother mother sister cousin grandma wanna hump him  
Even got Hilary Clinton on the side ready to jump him  
Tell the Clintons naaaaaaaaah  
Couldnt catch him couldnt stop him  
They go by the party rules  
If you cant beat em you cant top em  
Thought youd smack couldnt pop em  
Delegates couldnt cop em  
Bill Clinton couldnt help her  
Too bad she couldnt drop him  
  
Man Obama so Ill  
  
Obama goes here Obama goes there  
Sayin yes we can just like Michelle he sittin in the deriere  
He travel to Arizona ready to cause some drama  
Hopin Mccain dont comment  
Look at that bastard Obama  
Hes too young hes too hip  
Negroes always causing problems  
His pale lookin face got him lookin like a goblin  
Mccain Mccain please dont vote for Mccain  
First they up in office talkin bout some heart pain  
Call the ambulance quick all you hear is sirens  
His temper isnt private  
Dang I hate a mad prick  
Dont you had a mad prick  
Plus Mccains an old prick  
Baracks a yonger guy so choose him  
Hes the right pick  
But if you choose the wrong pick  
Your stepson will probably end up in Iraq quick  
  
His health care plan is so immaculate  
So even if you broke you can afford to take a doc trip  
Youll be feelin much better not sick  
And hes ok but his wifes sick  
And her backs thick and her walks sick  
Shes a fly chick  
Might hit  
  
Man obama so Ill  
  
Hes makin history like x King and Douglas  
And rfk Obama he s that new black knew that  
Red neck said he wont beat john mccain  
He dont wear a flag and his middle names Hussein  
But who gon be that boy dat dat dat boy they call Obama  
Got republicans sweatin like they up in saunas  
Even Mccains 90 somethin momma  
He ready to pull his lever every hour  
And Id rather eat a field mouse  
Than to see John Mccain in the White House  
Vote Obama in and I promise you wont turn back  
In to some uncle Tomas  
No Aunt Jemima or southern fried chicken  
Call him cheif obama or Mr Keeps on tickin  
Man pass the riots comment couldnt pass his tally  
Even Oprah Winfrey said that she was right behind him  
People I say this country shol holt without him  
But hes gotta go out relate to every body  
He do what he do like give his wife a hug then a fist dap  
Gotta do that stuff in public so the hood know that hes black  
Gotta use big words white people love to hear them  
If they hear it they dont fear him they dont know him but they feel him  
Thats real
