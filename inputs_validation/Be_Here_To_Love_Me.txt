Your eyes seek conclusion in all this confusion of mine  
Though you and I both know its only the warm glow of wine  
Thats got you to feeling this way but I dont care  
I want you to stay  
And hold me and tell me youll be here to love me today  
  
Children are dancin the gamblers are chancin their all  
The windows accusing the door of abusing the wall  
But who cares what the night watchmen say  
The stage has been set for the play  
Hold me and tell me youll be here to love me today  
  
The moons come and gone but a few stars hang on on to the sky  
The winds runnin free but it aint up to me ask why  
The poets are demanding their pay  
Theyve left me with nothin to say  
Cept hold me and tell me youll be here to love me today  
Just hold me and tell me that youll be here to love me today
