Gather round me everybody  
Gather round me while I preach some  
Feel a sermon coming on here  
The topic will be sin  
And thats what Im agin  
If you wanna hear my story  
Then settle back and just sit tight  
While I start reviewing  
The attitude of doing right  
  
You got to accenttchuate the positive  
Eliminate the negative  
And latch on to the affirmative  
Dont mess with mister in between  
  
You got to spread joy up to the maximum  
Bring gloom down to the minimum  
And have faith or pandemonium  
Liable to walk upon the scene  
  
To illustrate my last remark  
Jonah in the whale Noah in the ark  
What did they do just when everything looked so dark  
Man they said we better  
  
Accenttchuate the positive  
Eliminate the negative  
And latch on to the affirmative  
Dont mess with mister in between
