Watching your bright blue eyes  
In the freeze frame  
Ive seen them so many times  
I feel like I must be your best friend  
Youre looking fine so fine oh my  
Dressed up like a lovely day oh  
  
Babyface babyface  
Slow down child let me untie your lace  
Babyface babyface  
Cover girl with natural grace  
How could beauty be so kind  
To an ordinary guy  
  
Coming home late at night  
To turn you on  
Checking out every frame  
Ive got slow motion on my side  
Turning around and around  
With the sound and color  
  
Under my control go  
Round and around going down  
Dressed up like a lovely day  
  
Babyface babyface  
Tin foil hair all tied up in lace  
Babyface babyface  
Bitter sweet girl wont you give me a taste  
How could beauty be so kind  
To an ordinary guy  
  
Do do do do do do do do dodo do  
Do do do do do do do do dodo do  
  
Babyface babyface  
Slow down child let me untie your lace  
Babyface babyface  
Open the door let me unpack my case  
Babyface babyface  
Youre everywhere child  
Youre all over the place  
Babyface babyface  
Youre coming to me from outerspace  
How could beauty be so kind  
To an ordinary guy
