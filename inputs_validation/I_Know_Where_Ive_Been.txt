Theres a light in the darkness  
Though the night black as my skin  
Theres a light burning bright showing me the way  
But I know where Ive been  
  
Theres a cry in distance  
Its a voice that comes from deep within  
Theres a cry asking why  
I pray the answers up ahead yeah  
cause I know where Ive been  
  
Theres a road weve been travellin  
Lost so many on the way  
But the riches will be plenty  
With the price the price we had to pay  
Theres a dream in the future  
  
Theres a struggle that we have yet to win  
And theres pride in my heart  
cause I know where Im going yes I do  
And I know where Ive been yeah  
  
Theres a road that we must travel  
Theres a promise that we must make  
Oh the riches will be plenty  
Oh the dream in the future  
Oh the struggle we must win  
Use that pride in our heart  
To lift us up  
Lord knows i know  
Where Ive been
