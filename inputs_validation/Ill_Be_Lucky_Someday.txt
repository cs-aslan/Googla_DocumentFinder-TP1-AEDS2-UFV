Feeling low feeling blue  
All the troubles come my way  
But I just wont worry  
Ill be lucky someday  
  
My moneys gone aint got no friends  
More debts than I can face  
But I just wont worry  
Ill be lucky someday  
  
Let it rain oh let it pour  
Cause it just cant get worst no way  
And I know maybe soon  
My luck will change someday  
  
The gal I love done said goodbye  
She went on her marryin way  
But I just wont worry  
Ill be lucky someday  
  
Ill be lucky someday  
Maybe Ill get lucky someday
