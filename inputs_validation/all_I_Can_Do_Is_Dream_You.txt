I close my eyes  
And love so warm and tender  
Feel you touching me  
I close my eyes  
I dont even have to try  
It comes so easily  
I dont know why  
I ever let us drift apart  
But look whos sorry now  
Cause every time  
I wake up and youre not around  
It only brings me down  
CHORUS  
Oh baby  
All I can do is dream you  
All I can do is dream you  
Oh baby  
All I can do is dream you  
All I can do is dream you  
Everyday I pray  
That somewhere down the line  
We will meet again  
Ill find a way  
To get you back somehow  
But baby until then  
CHORUS
