When the stars are in her eyes  
And the sun is in her smile  
The only moment in a life  
That happens the same time  
Is when a woman loves a man  
  
Shell be a mother and a child  
Sacrifice her days and nights  
And no other will exists  
Shell put life in every kiss  
When a woman loves a man  
  
And youll be amazed how when  
Youre stumbling  
Shell fight for you  
And wont let you give in  
Shell do all that she can  
When a woman loves a man  
  
A soothing breeze always blows  
Somebody understands another soul  
Its like the planets have aligned  
Every sentence has a rhyme  
When a woman loves a man  
  
Oh youll be amazed how when  
Youre needing it  
Shell fight for you  
From the beginning to the end  
And shell do all that she can  
When a woman loves a man  
  
Its the greatest gift of all  
Knowing that unconditionally  
Shell catch you when you fall  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Oh yeah  
When a woman loves a man  
  
When the stars are in her eyes  
And the sun is in her smile  
Shell be a mother and a child  
But all at the same time  
When a woman loves a man  
  
Shell be your air  
Shell bring you life  
Shell make me sacrifice  
When a woman loves a man
