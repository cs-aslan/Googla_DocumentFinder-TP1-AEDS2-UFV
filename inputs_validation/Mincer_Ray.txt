Mincer ray dont worry  
If the roads a little worn  
Its a cold and filthy cavern  
That were traveling on  
richer day assured me  
Of the weaklink mending plan  
Dangers always there to follow  
Just do the best you can  
And a light shines down  
mincer ray dont worry  
If the roads a little worn  
Its a cold and filthy cavern  
That were traveling on  
And a light shines down  
And a light shines down
