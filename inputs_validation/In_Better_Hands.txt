Its hard to stand on shifting sand  
Its hard to shine in the shadows of the night  
You cant be free if you dont reach for help  
You cant love if you dont love yourself  
  
There is hope when my faith runs out  
Cause Im in better hands now  
  
Chorus  
Its like the sun is shining when the rain is pouring down  
Its like my soul is flying though my feet are on the ground  
So take this heart of mine theres no doubt  
Im in better hands now  
  
I am strong all because of you  
I stand in awe of every mountain that you move  
Oh I am changed yesterday is gone  
I am safe from this moment on  
  
Theres no fear when the night comes round  
Im in better hands now  
  
Chorus  
  
Its like the sun is shining when the rain is pouring down  
Its like my soul is flying though my feet are on the ground  
Its like the world is silent though I know it isnt true  
Its like the breath of Jesus is right here in this room  
  
So take this heart of mine theres no doubt  
Im in better hands now  
Im in better hands now
