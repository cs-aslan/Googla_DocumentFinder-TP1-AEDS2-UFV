Yesterday we were gay  
I was high on a rainbow but now theres no rainbow  
Youve gone and so a lover is blue  
Life was sweet so complete  
Now Ive suddenly waken to find Im forsaken  
Alone and so a lover is blue  
Do you still remember our love affair  
Does it matter to you  
But Ill have to go through our door to care  
Here and there everywhere  
Every scene just reminds me  
Of something that binds me  
To you and so a lover is blue
