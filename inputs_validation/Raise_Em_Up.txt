Raise em up  
Im talkin bout a lighter on a Saturday night  
The band plays a song you like and you sing along  
  
Raise em up  
Im talkin bout Daddys old pickup truck  
Shotgun seat theres the one you love and youre kissin on  
  
Get those white sails sailing down in Mexico  
Its just a whiskey glass if you aint makin a toast  
Lift your tearfilled eyes up to the sky  
A comin home youve been gone too long  
Tonight were gonna  
Raise em up  
  
Raise em up  
You got a voice you got a choice  
Go make some noise  
Dont ever let em tell you who you are  
Raise em up  
Fist black and blue fight for the truth  
Its what you do  
Hand on your heart for the stripes and stars  
  
Black umbrellas in the pourin rain  
A Sunday Morning Coming Down Amazing Grace  
Lift those tearfilled eyes up to the sky  
As the flag flies say goodbye  
Tonight were gonna  
Raise em up  
  
So you meet someone  
The only one  
You take her by the hand  
Make a stand  
Buy some land  
Make some love  
And them babies come  
  
Raise em up  
Raise em up  
Raise em up trophy high  
Raise em up to the sky  
Raise em up show everybody that newborn smile  
Raise em up tall and strong  
Raise em up right from wrong  
Raise em up so damn high they can hear God singing along  
Woah woah woah woah woah  
Woah woah woah woah woah  
Woah woah woah woah
