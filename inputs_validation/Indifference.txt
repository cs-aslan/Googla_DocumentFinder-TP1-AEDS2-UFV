I will light the match this mornin so I wont be alone  
Watch as she lies silent for soon light will be gone  
Oh I will stand arms outstretched pretend Im free to roam  
Oh I will make my way through one more day in hell  
How much difference does it make  
How much difference does it make yeah  
  
I will hold the candle till it burns up my arm  
Oh Ill keep takin punches until their will grows tired  
Oh I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind  
Hey I wont change direction and I wont change my mind  
How much difference does it make  
How much difference does it make how much difference  
  
Ill swallow poison until I grow immune  
I will scream my lungs out till it fills this room  
How much difference  
How much difference does it make
