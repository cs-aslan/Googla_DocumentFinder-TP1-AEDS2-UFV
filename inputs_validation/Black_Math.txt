Dont you think that Im bound to react now  
My fingers definitely turning to black now  
Maybe Ill put my love on ice  
And teach myself maybe thatll be nice  
  
My books are sitting at the top of the stack now  
The longer words are really breaking my back now  
Maybe Ill learn to understand  
Drawing a square with a pencil in hand  
  
Mathematically turning the page  
Unequivocally showing my age  
Im practically center stage  
Undeniably earning your wage  
Maybe Ill put my love on ice  
And teach myself maybe thatll be nice  
  
Listen master can I ask you a question  
Is it the fingers or the brain  
That youre teaching the lesson  
Maybe Ill put my love on ice  
And teach myself maybe thatll be nice
