I never thought Id find someone  
But you came along and made me see  
That you were the only one for me  
Boy I love you constantly  
  
Bridge  
You are my love my only love  
Baby my heart belongs to you  
Be with me dont play with me  
If you want love just let me know  
  
Chorus  
Lovelove is such a crazy thing  
Never understood the way I was supposed to feel  
Is this love for real  
Oh love love is such a crazy thing  
Never understood the way I was supposed to feel  
Is this love for real love for real  
  
I dreamed of someone like you before  
But I never thought Id get the chance  
To romance someone as sweet as you  
I hope you feel the same as I do  
  
Repeat Bridge  
  
Love love is such a crazy thing crazy feeling  
Never understood the way I was supposed to feel  
Is this love for real boy you are my love
