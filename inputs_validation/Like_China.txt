My mom and daddy both say  
I must be crazy to be this infatuated  
But I know you know  
We got something special never felt before  
You get me going just looking at you  
And the feelings not hard to recognize so  
Alright Ill come out in the open with it  
Will you walk out with me  
  
Cause youre the first girl Ive ever loved  
Tell me do you feel the same way  
Well Ill show you Im not like all the rest  
Cause I know who I am  
  
Your skin is smooth as silk and your eyes like stars  
Youre just like a picture book standing there  
But I cant go on  
No I cant go on thinking you dont feel the same way that I do  
  
Ill be so careful Ill hold you like china  
Ill promise not to hurt you Ill hold you like china  
You wont feel nothing Ill hold you like china  
Cause I know its your first time  
  
Your mum and dad dont like me  
And they tell me every time I call around to see you  
I dont know why  
Cause I always straighten my tie and comb my hair  
I know your brother thinks that  
Im a limp wristed wimp from the other side of town  
I know hes got me wrong  
Because Im really not like that Ill tell you why  
  
Youre the first girl Ive ever loved  
Tell me do you feel the same way  
Well Ill show you Im not like all the rest  
Cause I know who I am  
  
I remember the very first time I held your hand  
And that was the last time you were so close to me  
But I cant go on  
No I cant go on thinking you dont feel the same way as I do  
  
Ill be so careful Ill hold you like china  
Ill promise not to hurt you Ill hold you like china  
You wont feel nothing Ill hold you like china  
Cause I know its your first time  
  
I know you know and now I want to I want to tell everybody  
I know you know and now I want them all to see
