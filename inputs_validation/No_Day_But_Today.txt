Theres only us theres only this  
Forget regret or life is yours to miss  
No other path no other way  
No day but today  
  
Theres only us only tonight  
We must let go to know whats right  
No other road No other way  
No day but today  
  
I cant control my destiny  
I trust my soul my only goal  
Is just to be  
  
Theres only now theres only here  
Give in to love or live in fear  
No other path No other way  
No day but today  
  
Theres only us Theres only this  
Forget regret or life is yours to miss  
No other road no other way  
No day but today  
  
No day but today  
No day but today  
No day but today  
No day but today  
No day but today  
No day but today  
No day but today
