You know something girl Im thinking about you right now  
You dont want to know what Im thinking girl  
Or or do you  
Girl you think Im the bomb  
But Im old enough to be dating your mom And I did  
She wasnt that bad but youre grounded if you tell your dad  
That you like the way we dance with rockhard abs and plastic pants  
You give us teddy bears  
And in return we shave our chest hairs Yeah were so manly  
Cause were singing in a boy band  
The words are stupid and the musics bland  
Never see a dime for selling out to the man  
Yeah were a boy band  
We say we met in church but were a product to market research  
We sing about sex to little girls who shouldnt think about sex yet  
Its not like they listen its not like they care  
Cause when we sweat our bodies glisten  
We like the color blue blue blue  
And were appearing at a mall near you right beside the food court  
Cause were singing in a boy band  
The words are stupid and the musics bland  
No one likes us here but were big in Japan  
Yeah were a boy band  
Throw your hands up in the air  
And wave them around like you just dont care  
You just dont care you just dont care  
Now bring your hands down from the air  
Doo doo doot doot doot doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot doot doot doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot doot doot doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot doot doot doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot ahh ahh ahh ahh  
Cause were singing in a boy band  
The words are stupid and the musics bland  
Another pollutant in the pop wasteland  
Yeah were a boy band  
Yeah were a boy band  
Yeah were a boy band
