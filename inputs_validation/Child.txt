Child youre talking of freedom  
Painted on your garden wall  
Its not there at all  
Child youre talking of wisdom  
  
You say wisdom is a golden rule  
You aint no fool  
But you dont know who it is  
Who calls you name  
  
In the light of the golden moon  
You dont know who it is who brought you here  
And chained up your heart  
So soon  
  
Child youre life is a fairytale  
And its not the same  
And the clouds  
Youre hiding behind  
  
In your misty mind have disappeared  
Like a sailor far from the shores of your dreams  
And far from the love of your home  
Sailor lost on your own misty seas  
  
And the chains on your heart baby  
Might be my love  
Might be my love  
Its so confusing  
  
And you feel that youre loosing yourself  
But there over the mountain  
You thought youd never have to climb  
Theres a road  
  
Reaching and stretching  
To the corner of your mind  
Like a river casts aside the dust  
And grows and grows as it flows  
  
The feeling deep inside of you  
Must break like a dam  
  
So set you free  
So set you free  
So set you free
