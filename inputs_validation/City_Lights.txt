Dont these city lights light these streets to life  
All these crazy nights bring us together  
Any rainy day you can dance your blues away  
Dont these city lights bring us together  
Charlie Chaplins cane well it flicked away the rain  
Things werent quite the same after he came here  
But then when he left upon our own request  
Things werent quite the same after he came here  
Dont these city lights bring the streets to life  
All these crazy nights bring us together  
Any rainy day you can dance your blues away  
Dont these city lights bring us together  
Were supposed to be a land of liberty  
And those city lights to blaze forever  
But that little tramp ooh on that street corner lamp  
When he left us its humor left for ever  
Were supposed to be a land of liberty  
And those city lights to blaze forever  
But that little tramp leaning on that street corner lamp  
When he left us its humor left for ever  
Dont these city lights bring the streets to life  
All these crazy nights bring us together  
Any rainy day you can dance your blues away  
Dont these city lights bring us together
