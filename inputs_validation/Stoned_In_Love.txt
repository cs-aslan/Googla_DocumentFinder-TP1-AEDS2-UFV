If you could see me here this way  
Looking backwards from today  
Would you do it all again  
  
If I could roll it back to you  
Just like lovers always do  
Im stoned in love but not with you  
  
Good luck cause were not feeling stoned in love  
Its how Im feeling now  
I feel the love is made of stone  
Were not feeling stoned in love  
  
If we could wash the past away  
Would we go our separate ways  
Ill do it all again as if I care  
  
Is this the way its meant to be  
Stoned in love but not with me  
Youre stoned in love in love me  
  
Good luck cause were not feeling stoned in love  
Its how Im feeling now  
I feel the love is made of stone  
Were not feeling stoned in love  
  
Stoned in love  
Im stoned in love love but not with you  
  
Good luck cause were not feeling stoned in love  
Its how Im feeling now  
I feel the love is made of stone  
Were not feeling stoned in love  
  
Stoned in love  
Stoned in love but not with you  
As if I care
