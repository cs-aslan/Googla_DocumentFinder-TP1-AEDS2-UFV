Its no good trying to place your hand  
Where I cant see because I understand  
That youre different from me  
Yes I can tell  
That you cant be what you pretend  
And youre rocking me backwards  
And youre rocking towards the  
Red and yellow mane of a stallion horse  
  
Its no good trying to hold your love  
Where I cant see because I understand  
That youre different from me  
Yes I can tell  
That you cant be what you pretend  
The caterpillar hood wont cover the head of you  
Know you should be home in bed  
  
Its no good holding your sequin fan  
Where I cant see because I understand  
That youre different from me  
Yes I can tell  
That you cant be what you pretend  
Yes youre spinning around and around in a car  
With electric lights flashing very fast
