All our monkeys have monkeys  
We drive our death crush diamond jaguar limousines  
Were not fantastic motherfuckers  
But we play them on TV  
Its a dirty word Reich  
Say what you like  
Its a dirty word Reich  
Say what you like  
  
Were the low art gloominati  
And we aim to depress  
The scabaret sacrilegends  
This is the golden age of grotesque  
Were the low art gloominati  
And we aim to depress  
The scabaret sacrilegends  
This is the golden age of grotesque  
  
The devils are girls with van gohs missing ear  
You say want you want but filth is all that they hear  
And Ive got the jigger  
To make all of you bigger so  
ladies und gentlemendrop your pissroom bait  
And make sure youre not late you tramps and lunatics  
Heres a trick thats gonna make you
