All the pretty girls on a Saturday night  
  
So I call your name  
Cross my fingers uncross the others  
Hesitate oh I dont think straight  
With nothin to prove  
  
I dont wanna say Im leavin  
Ill stay until the weekend  
You can take all the things the boxes and rings  
And get goin  
  
Cause Ive been waitin for  
  
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night  
Let it be and come to me with the look in your eyes  
Well you break and take all the words from my mouth  
I wish all the pretty girls were shakin me down  
  
So I call I call you out out baby  
Just to feel a little bit better about myself he does  
I do you do baby  
I do I do I do  
  
Until their lips start to move  
And their friends talk music  
Ill say Ive never heard the tune  
But I have I just hate the band  
Cause they remind me of you  
  
Every single night ends up the same  
I dont say much at all but I bring up your name  
Over and over and over  
I think its striking me out  
  
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night  
Let it be and come to me with the look in your eyes  
Well you break and take all the words from my mouth  
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down  
  
But not you  
You still wear boots and your hair is too long  
And then this one doesnt wanna admit shes fallin in love  
Oh cmon oh cmon whats a boy to do  
When all the pretty girls cant measure to you   
  
Ha   
  
I dont understand your reasons  
Please just stay over the weekend  
You cant take all those things  
They define you and me  
Everything weve become  
Youre all that I need  
Please dont make me face my generation alone  
  
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night  
Let it be and come to me with the look in your eyes  
And you break and take all the words from my mouth  
I wish all the pretty girls were shakin me down  
  
But not you  
I feel your faith is destroying the world  
And then this one never really understood  
The 80s is over and done  
Oh cmon whats a boy to do  
When all the pretty girls cant measure to you   
  
Say  
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night  
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night  
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night  
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
