I just want to see you  
When youre all alone  
I just want to catch you if I can  
I just want to be there  
When the morning light explodes  
On your face it radiates  
I cant escape  
I love you till the end  
  
I just want to tell you nothing  
You dont want to hear  
All I want is for you to say  
Oh why dont you just take me  
Where Ive never been before  
I know you want to hear me  
Catch my breath  
I love you till the end  
I love you till the end  
  
I just want to be there  
When were caught in the rain  
I just want to see you laugh not cry  
I just want to feel you  
When the night puts on its cloak  
Im lost for words dont tell me  
Cause all I can say  
I love you till the end  
  
All I can say  
I love you till the end
