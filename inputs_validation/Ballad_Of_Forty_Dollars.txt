The man who preached the funeral  
Said it really was a simple way to die  
He laid down to rest one afternoon  
And never opened up his eyes  
They hired me and Fred and Joe  
To dig the grave and carry up some chairs  
It took us seven hours  
And I guess we must have drunk a case of beer  
  
I guess I ought to go and watch them put Im down  
But I dont own a suit  
And anyway when they start talkin about  
The fire in Hell well I get spooked  
So Ill just sit here in my truck  
And act like I dont know Im when they pass  
Anyway when theyre all through  
Ive got to go to work and mow the grass  
  
Well here they come and whos that  
Ridin in that big ol shiny limousine  
Mmh look at all that chrome I do believe  
Thats the sharpest thing Ive seen  
That must belong to his great uncle  
Someone said he owned a big ol farm  
When they get parked Ill mosey down  
and look it over that wont do no harm  
  
Well that must be the widow in the cr  
And would you take a look at that  
That sure is a pretty dress  
You know some women do look good in black  
Well hes not even in the ground  
And they say that his truck is up for sale  
They say she took it pretty hard  
But you cant tell too much behind the veil  
  
Well listen aint that pretty  
When the bugler plays the Military Taps  
I think that when yous in the war  
They always hide n play a song like that  
Well here I am and there they go  
And I guess youd call it my bad luck  
I hope he rests in peace the trouble is  
The fellow owes me forty bucks
