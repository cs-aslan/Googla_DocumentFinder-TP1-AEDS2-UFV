Your dress is hangin on a hook on the door  
My jeans are lying in a pile on the floor yeah  
Flat on my back tryin to catch my breath  
When we were rockin tonight  
I thought that we were gonna rock to death  
  
But whats that in your eyes  
Im no longer paralyzed  
Here we go again  
  
Crawlin you come crawling to me  
I go crawling to you  
We come crawling  
You come crawling to me  
I go crawling to you  
  
Your hair is tangled and your lipstick is gone  
Youre stretched out calling my name  
With just your high heels on  
We hunt each other on our hands and our knees  
Well Im an alley cat  
And youre a hot little Siamese  
  
But whats that in your eyes  
Im no longer paralyzed  
Here we go again  
  
Crawlin you come crawling to me  
I go crawling to you  
We come crawling  
You come crawling to me  
I go crawling to you
