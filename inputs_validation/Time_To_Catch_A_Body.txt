Kool Keith  
Yeah We gettin ready to smear peanut butter in the crowd  
and throw mayonnaise all down your ears  
You know what We got some jams for you boy  
Yo the meltdown on em check it out  
  
A lot of rappers think they can rap and then do that  
Who dat Jumpin on my testicles my black scrotum  
Show em that they style is cold butt doo doo  
Like a babys heiny a stinky funky boo boo  
Kickin with more rounds hi pops all sounds  
Get with the drift what Im sayin Slayin  
Bringin MCs to the program  
Not like HTown soft on a slow jam  
I kick it wicked with the funky style lick it  
Suck it jump on the jock just like a groupie woopi  
I make MCs look bad like Charlie Brown and Snoopy  
Your mother act wild sister act goofy  
DJs go wild and act retarded illiterate  
Put me in the mix well consider it oh yeah  
Im down to step and throw a gun in your face  
Hijack all that shit spray your station with mace  
I got my things in effect all plans down  
The boys ready stupid crazy with they masks down  
I walk around okay you think Im jokin  
Just go to sleep and see what happen remember  
Where could I be when youre lonely for Tony  
Take him outside on the highway for a ride  
Remember when the detectives come you dont remember anything
