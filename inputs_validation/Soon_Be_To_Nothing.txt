Kelly mountain road  
Saw a heavy load  
With a sagging heart  
And a break apart  
Voices in me  
Stood as thick as thieves  
With no sympathy  
For the beggars art  
I have passed these pines  
bout a million times  
Effortlessly  
effortlessly  
Now I grip the wheel  
Fear is what I feel  
At the slow unraveling of  
slow unraveling of  
Me  
me  
ah  
ah  
  
But you tell me its temporary  
tell me its temporary  
Its a matter of time  
its a matter of time  
By god  
Dont you think I know its in my mind  
in my mind  
And its right over left  
right over left  
And healing the then  
healing the then  
Ill soon be to nothing  
But I dont know when  
  
Well the way I flee  
daylight  
On my crooked feet  
Barn happy horse  
fading  
On a onetrack course  
Then I self despise  
daylight  
Cryin out my eyes  
cause the happy trail  
fading  
Led me to remorse  
But the road is long  
but the road is long  
And the song is gone  
I blow empty  
In my cicada shell  
If I saw my choice  
if I saw my choice  
I might find my voice  
But I dont know when  
dont know when  
And I just cant tell  
just cant tell  
ah  
ah  
  
You tell me its temporary  
tell me its temporary  
Its a matter of time  
its a matter of time  
By god  
Dont you think I know its in my mind  
in my mind  
Its right over left  
right over left  
And healing the then  
and healing the then  
Ill soon be to nothing  
But I dont know when  
  
Deep behind my face  
Is a safer place  
But old gears are hitched tight  
To the gate  
Its a daily grind  
Waiting to unwind  
Till I hear that click  
That unlocks my fate  
ah  
ah  
  
Yeah  
But you tell me its temporary  
but tell me its temporary  
And its a matter of time  
and its a matter of time  
By god  
Dont you think I know its in my mind  
Its right over left  
its right over left  
And healing the then  
and healing the then  
Ill soon be to nothing  
ill soon be to nothing  
But I dont know when  
Ill soon be to nothing  
ill soon be to nothing  
But I dont know when  
Ill soon be to nothing  
But I dont know when  
but I dont know when
