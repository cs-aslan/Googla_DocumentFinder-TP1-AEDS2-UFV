Verse 1  
Ive been the distance and Ive seen it all  
Ive been turned around by love and hate  
I have resided in my private hell  
But I love this life and I live to tell  
  
Chorus  
Blind Faith is the cause of the trouble  
Blind faith what we bleed  
  
Verse 2  
When I was young I didnt realize  
There was hope and fear with no compromise  
And now I testify before myself  
I keep walking on in my innocence  
  
Bridge  
I know if you follow me you get what want you get what you need  
Somebodys got to set you free you get what want you get what you need  
Now dont you give it and learn to breathe  
You hear a message now before you leave  
You know the fortune here that you have found  
There aint no doubt about it there aint no doubt about it
