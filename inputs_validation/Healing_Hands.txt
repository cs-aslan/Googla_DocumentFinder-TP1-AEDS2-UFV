I never dreamed I could cry so hard  
That aint like a man  
I could fly like a bird somedays  
Had a place where I could land  
  
I could have sworn we were all locked in  
Aint that what you said  
I never knew it could hurt so bad  
When the power of love is dead  
  
But giving into the nightime  
Aint no cure for the pain  
You gotta wade into the water  
You gotta learn to live again  
  
Chorus  
  
And reach out for her healing hands  
Reach out for her healing hands  
Theres a light where the darkness ends  
Touch me now and let me see again  
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands  
  
I never knew love like poison  
That burned like a fire  
All I ever wanted was a reason  
To drown in your eyes  
  
I never knew sleep so restless  
Empty arms so cold  
Thats not the way its supposed to be  
It aint the spell that I was sold  
  
But giving into the nightime  
Aint no cure for the pain  
You gotta wade into the water  
You gotta learn to live again  
  
And reach out for her healing hands  
Reach out for her healing hands  
Theres a light where the darkness ends  
Touch me now and let me see again  
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands  
  
But giving into the nightime  
Aint no cure for the pain  
You gotta wade into the water  
You gotta learn to live again  
  
Reach out for her healing hands  
Reach out for her healing hands  
Theres a light where the darkness ends  
Touch me now and let me see again  
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands  
  
Reach out for her healing hands  
Reach out for her healing hands  
Theres a light where the darkness ends  
Touch me now and let me see again  
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands  
  
Reach out for her healing hands  
Reach out for her healing hands  
Theres a light where the darkness ends  
Touch me now and let me see again  
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands
