I woke in the mornin wandrin  
Wasted and worn out  
I woke in the mornin wandrin  
Wasted and worn out  
Wishin my longlost lover  
Will walk to me talk to me  
Tell me what its all about  
  
I was standin at the side road  
Listenin to the billboard knock  
Standin at the side road  
Listenin to the billboard knock  
Well my wrist was empty  
But my nerves were kickin  
Tickin like a clock  
  
If I got anything you need babe  
Let me tell you in front  
If I got anything you need babe  
Let me tell you in front  
You can come to me sometime  
Night time day time  
Any time you want  
  
Sometimes Im thinkin  
Im too high to fall  
Sometimes Im thinkin  
Im too high to fall  
Other times Im thinkin Im  
So low I dont know  
If I can come up at all  
  
Black crows in the meadow  
Across a broad highway  
Black crows in the meadow  
Across a broad highway  
Though its funny honey  
I just dont feel much like a  
Scarecrow today
