Kill her Thats all you have to do  
Kill Mary  
Shes a risk and get the priest as well  
  
10 PM I feel the rain coming down  
My face feels the wet my mind the storm  
Flashing lights as people race to find shelter from the pour  
Moving silent through the streets theyre mine theyre mine  
  
Midnight she sings praises in the Hall  
To saintly faces hallowed be their names she cant recall  
Sister Mary virgin Mary silent with her sin  
What are you doing out in the rain  
She feels me I can taste her breath when she speaks  
Ive been waiting for you Come in  
  
Mary Mary just a whore for the underground  
They made you pay in guilt for your salvation  
Thought you had them fooled Now theyve sent me for you  
You know too much for your own good  
Dont offer me faith Ive got all I need here  
My faith is growing growing tight against the seam  
What we need is trust to keep us both alive  
Help us make it through the night  
  
Ive no more want of any faith  
Binds my arm and feed my mind  
The only peace Ive ever known  
Ill close my eyes and you shoot  
  
No Mary listen youve got to pull your strength from my lips  
I pray I feed you well  
Your precious cross is gone it made me wait so long  
For what you gave to everyone  
The priest is cold and dead on his knees he fed  
From my barrel of death he turned the Holy water red  
As he died he said thank you  
I just watched him bleed  
  
I feel the flow the blessed stain  
Sweating hands like fire and flames  
Burn my thighs spread in sacrificial right  
The hallowed altar burns my flesh once more tonight  
  
Mary sweet lady of pain  
Always alone  
Blind you search for the truth  
I see myself in you parallel lives  
Winding at lightspeed through time  
  
No time to rest yet  
Weve got to stop his game  
Before madness has the final laugh  
Too much bloodshed  
Were being used and fed  
Like rats in experiments  
No final outcome here  
Only pain and fear  
Its followed us both all our lives  
Theres one thing left to see  
Will it be him or me  
Theres one more candle left to light  
  
Dont turn your back on my disgrace  
The blood of Christ cant heal my wounds so deep  
The sins of man are all I taste  
Cant spit the memory from my mind  
I cant cry anymore  
  
Mary my lady of pain always alone  
Blind you search for the truth  
I see myself in you parallel lives  
Winding at lightspeed through time youre mine
