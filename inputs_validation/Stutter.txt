Oh or else you gotta let me go  
I really I really  
  
This time I really need to do things right  
Shivers that ya give me keep me freezing all night  
You make me shudder oh yeah  
I cant believe it  
Im not myself  
Suddenly Im thinkin of bout no one else  
You make me shudder

Oh I really need to know  
Or else you gotta let me go  
  
Your just a fantasy girl  
Its an impossible world  
All I want is just you and me always  
Ill give you everything  
Give some attention to me  
All I want is just you and me always  
  
Give me affection  
I need your perfection  
Cause you feel so good  
You make me stutter stutter oh  
  
If I could touch you Id never let go  
Now ya got me screaming and I cannot shut up oh shut up yeah  
Now I am lying on the bedroom floor barely even speaking  
And I cannot get up  
Oh I really I really I really need to know  
Or else you gotta let me go  
  
Your just a fantasy girl  
Its an impossible world  
All I want is to be with you always  
Ill give you everything  
Give some attention to me  
All I want is just you and me always  
Give me affection  
I need your perfection  
Cause you feel so good  
You make me stutter stutter stutter

Gotta stop shaking me up

Sinking under

Its an impossible world  
All I want is to be with you always  
Ill give you everything  
Give some attention to me
