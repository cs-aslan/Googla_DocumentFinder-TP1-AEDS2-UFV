Hes unimaginative at his best but you know thats all right  
We like the way he sings  
Hes unimaginative at his work but we say that thats ok  
Hes made for better things  
Hes not intelligent we like the way he dances yeah  
But you wanna talk about this and talk about that  
And everything he says is just impossibly fast  
Hes never that bad hes never that good  
Hes always just a little bit and over understood  
And you say Hes unAmerican a little bit  
And you think that thats so cool  
You like a little bit and if hes unAmerican a little bit  
Then you think that hes no fool  
Not matter if he is  
So alternative he likes to take our chances  
And you wanna talk about this talk about that  
And everything he said is just impossibly crass  
Hes never that bad hes never that good  
Hes always just a little bit and over understood  
And you say Hes not intelligent we like the way he dances  
Hes hearing voices he cant attribute to the ordinary noise  
What do you swallow to relax you ordinarily  
Hes looking forward to a little rest  
But you know that hes so tired  
Hes fallen in a jar  
And everybodys sympathetic more or less even if hes bombed or wired  
Its just the way we are  
Hes so alternative he likes the blue romances  
But you wanna talk about this and talk about that  
And everything he does is just impossibly fast  
Hes never that bad hes never that good  
Hes always just a little bit and over understood  
And you say hes so alternative he like to take our chances  
Hes hearing voices he cant attribute to the ordinary noise  
What do you swallow to relax you ordinarily  
Whos gonna explain this mess to the mother of an ordinary boy  
Who was expected to act extra ordinarily  
But you wanna talk about this talk about that  
And everything he says is just impossibly fast  
Hes never that bad hes never that good  
Hes always just a little bit ah ah ah ah  
I dont wanna talk about it I dont wanna talk about it  
I dont wanna talk about it I dont wanna I dont wanna  
I dont wanna talk about it I dont wanna talk about it  
I dont wanna no no no no no no yeah
