Feelings you see  
Are so hard to believe  
All the chaos I have in my heart  
Devils I make and the love can relate  
All the solace inside tears me up  
  
Take me away  
Set me on fire  
Theres no other way  
  
Give me a reason cause I got nothing to gain  
So what are we doing now  
Feeling complacent I cannot be contained  
Im so lost and lonely now  
  
Weve been deceived  
Its so easy for me  
Cause the loathing Ive had from the start  
Evil disease all the hatred it breathes  
As Im down on my knees torn apart  
  
Take me away  
Set me on fire  
Theres no other way  
  
Give me a reason cause I got nothing to gain  
So what are we doing now  
Feeling complacent I cannot be contained  
Im so lost and lonely now  
  
Where do I run  
Where do I hide  
Give me a reason to end my life  
  
Where do I run  
Where do I hide  
Give me a reason to get out alive  
  
Give me a reason cause I got nothing to gain  
So what are we doing now  
Feeling complacent I cannot be contained  
Im so lost and lonely now  
  
Give me a reason cause I got nothing to gain  
So what am I doing now what a am I doing now  
Feeling complacent I cannot be contained  
Im so lost and lonely now
