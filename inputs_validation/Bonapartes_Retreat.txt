Met the girl I I love in a town way down in Dixie  
Beneath the stars up above  
She was the sweetest girl I ever did see  
  
So I held her in my arms and told her of her many charms I  
Kissed her while the guitars played  
The Bonapartes Retreat  
Guitar  
  
All the world was bright as I held her on that night  
And I heard herer say  
Please dont you go away  
  
So I held her in my arms and told her of her many charms I  
Kissed her while the bagpipe played  
The Bonapartes Retreat  
Bagpipe
