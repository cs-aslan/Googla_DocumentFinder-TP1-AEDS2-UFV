You may think Im fooling  
For the foolish things I do  
You may wonder how come I love you  
When you get on my nerves like you do  
Well baby you know you bug me  
There aint no secret about that  
Well come on over here and hug me  
And baby Ill spill the facts  
Well honey it aint your money  
Cause baby I got plenty of that  
  
I love you for your pink Cadillac  
Crushed velvet seats  
Riding in the back oozing down the street  
Waving to the girls  
Peeling out of sight  
Spending all my money on a Saturday night  
Honey I just wonder what you do there in back of your pink Cadillac  
Pink Cadillac  
  
Well now way back in the Bible temptations always come along  
Theres always somebody tempting you  
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong  
Well they tempt you man with silver and they tempt you sir with gold  
And they tempt you with the pleasures that the flesh does surely hold  
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple  
Man I aint going for that  
  
I know it was her pink Cadillac  
Crushed velvet seats  
Riding in the back oozing down the street  
Waving to the girls  
Peeling out of sight  
Spending all my money on a Saturday night  
Honey I just wonder what you do there in back of your pink Cadillac  
  
Now some folks say its too big and uses too much gas  
Some folks say its too old and that it goes too fast  
But my love is bigger than a Honda its bigger than a Subaru  
Hey man theres only one thing and one car that will do  
Anyway we dont have to drive it honey we can park it out in back  
And have a party in your pink Cadillac
