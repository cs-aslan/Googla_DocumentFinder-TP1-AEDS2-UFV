A suburban man  
At my door  
But I dont think Ill let him in  
He wants discipline  
Discipline  
Control over the way I live  
  
He wants the best for me  
Old school philosophy  
So I cant turn my back on him  
Hed buy me anything  
But I just need a friend  
  
Chorus  
Its all for you  
Youve got me where you want  
Its all for you oh  
Just stop breaking my heart  
Youre the blood Im the seed  
And its all that I need  
Youve got me where you want  
Its all for you oh  
Youve got me oh youve got me  
  
Jack Kerouac  
Kerouac  
On the road and in my head  
I need relevance  
Intelligence  
A new tattoo and lots more sex  
  
Broken families  
Are the new enemies  
And you will not make up for this  
This suburban man  
He wants discipline  
Discipline  
But I just need a friend  
  
Chorus  
  
Where you want  
  
Alone  
Leave me alone  
  
Its all for you  
Youve got me where you want  
Its all for you oh  
Just stop breaking my heart  
  
Chorus  
  
Its all for you  
Just stop breaking my heart Repeat x6  
  
Leave me alone
