Let me introduce myself Im a social disease  
Ive come for your wealth leave you on your knees  
No time for feeling sorry I got here on my own  
I wont ask for mercy I choose to walk alone  
  
Whats yours is mine and whats mine is mine too  
If you shake my hand better count your fingers  
  
What if I do get caught  
What if there is no judgment  
If Im right I lose nothing if youre right I lose it all  
I ought to get caught because Im doing something wicked  
Im guilty haunted by my fear and the only consequences  
Are dread and the fugitive mind  
  
You built walls to protect you so no one will infect you  
Pursued by those out there that vanish in thin air  
Come a long way to find what you really left behind  
You dont know when the end is but its coming fast  
  
Whats yours is mine and whats mine is mine too  
If you shake my hand better count your fingers  
  
What if I do get caught  
What if there is no judgment  
If Im right I lose nothing if youre right I lose it all  
I ought to get caught because Im doing something wicked  
Im guilty haunted by my fear and the only consequences  
Are dread and the fugitive mind
