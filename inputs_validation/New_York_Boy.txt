New York City look at me now  
Being stared at from behind the plow  
Mississippi dont get annoyed  
I aint no hippie just a New York boy  
Didnt want the mayor to come  
Or a big brass band to greet me  
But then the reception I got  
Well it wasnt what I had in mind  
People gawkin at me  
Like Im talkin strange  
Me I aint much better  
Cause Im thinkin the same  
  
Hey boy  
New York City look at me now  
Being stared at from behind the plow  
Mississippi dont get annoyed  
I aint no hippie just a New York boy  
Sayin whyall and eatin on grits  
Talkin as slow as molasses  
And all the time just pointing at me  
And the hair growin over my ears  
Gets my mind to wondering  
Just whos right and whos wrong  
I guess if theyll get used to the sideburns  
Ill get used to the corn  
  
Hey boy  
New York City look at me now  
Being stared at from behind the plow  
Mississippi dont get annoyed  
I aint no hippie just a New York boy  
New York City look at me now  
Being stared at from behind the plow  
Mississippi dont get annoyed  
I aint no hippie just a New York boy  
New York City look at me now
