Down in old Kentucky where horseshoes are lucky  
Theres a village smithy standin under the chestnut tree  
Hear the hammer knockin see the anvil rockin  
He sings the boogie blues while hes hammerin on the shoes  
  
See the hot sparks aflyin like fourth of Julyin  
Hes even got the horses cloppin pop down the avenue  
Folks love the rhythm the clang bangin rhythm  
Youll get a lot of kicks out of the blacksmith blues

Oh down in old Kentucky where horseshoes are lucky  
Theres a village smithy standin under the chestnut tree  
Hear the hammer knockin see the anvil rockin  
He sings the boogie blues while hes hammerin on the shoes  
  
See the hot sparks aflyin like fourth of Julyin

Folks love the rhythm the clang bangin rhythm  
Youll get a lot of kicks out of the blacksmith blues  
  
Out of the blacksmith blues  
Out of the blacksmith blues  
Hammer knockin anvil rockin  
Horses cloppin pops are boppin  
The blacksmith blues
