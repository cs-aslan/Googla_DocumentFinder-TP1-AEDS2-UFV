Goodbye so long  
Were the last words from you  
Seems like youre over  
All the goodness we knew  
  
You think that youre strong  
You think that you dont  
You dont need no one  
Well I was talkin to some of your friends  
Just to see how everyone was doin  
And they said you needed me  
  
Said it was something youd never admit  
But it was hard to see you going through it  
They said you needed me  
Guess Ill suffer til Im where I belong  
Im under the pressure  
But Ill keep being strong  
  
You say that youre strong  
You say that you dont need anyone  
What in the world are you telling your friends  
I get confused every time I see them  
They said you needed me  
  
I know the people talk just for the thrill  
But the fact of the matter is still  
They said you needed me  
Take your time reinvent your mind  
Youll feel better youll feel stronger  
Then decide if Im in your life  
For forever or longer  
  
You think that youre strong  
You think that you dont  
You dont need no one  
Well I was talkin to some of your friends  
Just to see how everyone was doin  
And they said you needed me  
  
Said it was something youd never admit  
But it was hard to see you going through it  
They said you needed me
