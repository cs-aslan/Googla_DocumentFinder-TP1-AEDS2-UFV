What kind of fool I am  
Theres no smoke without a fire  
You dont want me in your game  
Theres a shadow of desire  
Come on in my arms again  
I dont need no heart thats broken  
Come and try me as friend my love  
  
Arabian gold  
For your gangster love  
Arabian gold  
The last albatross  
Arabian gold  
For your heart and pride  
Arabian gold  
For you midnight child  
  
Arabian gold  
For your precious love  
Arabian gold  
I can turn it off  
Arabian gold  
Frozen in my tears  
Oh Im crying  
Take away away my fears  
  
Take the ship that never sailed  
Silent lover and devotion  
Seven lonely nights too late  
Oh youre breaking my emotions  
Like a loser I will smile  
Hearts are better left unbroken  
Come an try me for a while my love
