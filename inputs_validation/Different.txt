When I look you in the eyes  
Something deep inside me dies  
Cause I know you wont get better better better  
Youd rather be right done with love  
The only thing I understood  
Nothings ever good enough  
  
I stumble through the words as theyre leaving me  
Tremble at the side of Your Majesty  
And I cut myself just to get them out  
  
This time Ill be different I promise you  
This time Ill be special you know I will  
Just dont leave with me in your eyes  
This time Ill be better I want you to know  
This time Ill be special oh God make it so  
Just dont leave with me in your eyes your eyes your eyes  
  
You took my youth you took my health  
And if youre not here I find myself  
Youre supposed to make this better better better  
No selfcontrol and no reason why  
If I dont change then we both die  
This is it for you and I  
  
Blisters at the end of my fingertips  
Praying to a god I dont think exist  
Will you listen now  
Can you forgive me somehow  
  
This time Ill be different I promise you  
This time Ill be special you know I will  
Just dont leave with me in your eyes  
This time Ill be better I want you to know  
This time Ill be special oh God make it so  
Just dont leave with me in your eyes your eyes your eyes  
  
Closer now to the end  
If love was the answer  
Then what was the question  
Closer now lets pretend  
Weve never been out here before  
  
This time Ill be different I promise you  
This time Ill be special you know I will  
dont leave with me in your eyes  
This time Ill be better I want you to know  
This time Ill be special oh God make it so  
Just dont leave with me in your eyes your eyes your eyes
