You are my loved one you are my all  
Come to my arms and love me forever  
Ive waited so long  
You are the reason for bluebird songs  
You are my loved one you are the reason  
Ive waited so long  
Time never mattered till you left me in vain  
My heart was shattered put it together and then  
Heaven will love us surely you know  
That stardust will twinkle above us  
Ive waited so long
