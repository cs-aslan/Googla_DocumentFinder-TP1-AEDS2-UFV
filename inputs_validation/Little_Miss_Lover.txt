Little miss lover  
Where have you been in this world for so long  
Well I love a lover that feels like you  
Would you like to tag along  
  
Well I really dont need any help little girl  
But I believe you could help me out anyway  
Ah sack it to me  
Would you believe baby Ive been looking for a soul  
That feels like you  
For some time
