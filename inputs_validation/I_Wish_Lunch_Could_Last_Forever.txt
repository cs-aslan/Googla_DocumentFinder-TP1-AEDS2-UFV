The place down the block the one  
with no clock  
Covert rendezvous with you at the  
usual time  
I savor the scent of the fish on  
the grill  
Lifes so spicy up on barbe qhill  
  
Lookin good you look so fine  
Waiter bring us one more bottle of wine  
  
CHORUS  
  
I wish lunch could last forever  
Make the whole day one big afternoon  
Well begin with dessert a little coconut tart  
Mmmm tastes as sweet as a piece of your heart  
Cafe au lait beneath the Paris moon  
  
Dont hide you eyes just wear your disguise  
Brazils in the air I swear it feels like Mardi Gras time  
I savor the scent love that Anik Goutal  
As we walk in time to the cathedral bell  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I wish lunch could last forever  
Make the whole day a first time love affair  
Well begin with a kiss such a warm place to start  
Let me into your life let me into your heart  
Mea culpa mea culpa carnivals in the air
