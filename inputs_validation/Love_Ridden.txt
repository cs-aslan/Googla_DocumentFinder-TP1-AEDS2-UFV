Love ridden Ive looked at you  
With the focus I gave to my birthday candles  
Ive wished on the lidded blue flame  
Under your brow  
And baby I wished for you  
Nobody sees when you are lying in your bed  
And I want to crawl in with you  
But I cry instead  
I want your warm but it will only make  
Me colder when its over  
So I cant tonight baby  
  
No not baby anymoreif I need you  
Ill just use your simple name  
Only kisses on the cheek from now on  
And in a little while well only have to wave  
  
My hand wont hold you down no more  
The path is clear to follow through  
I stood too long in the way of the door  
And now Im giving up on you  
  
No not baby any moreif I need you  
Ill just use your simple name  
Only kisses on the cheek from now on  
And in a little while well only have to wave
