Many a year ago in old sorrento  
A certain ditty was quite the thing  
Whenever a mother rocked her baby in sorrento  
This little ditty she used to sing  
  
Chibaba chibaba chiwawa  
An chilawa kooka la goombah  
Chibaba chibaba chiwawa  
My bambino go to sleep  
  
Chibaba chibaba chiwawa  
An chilawa kooka la goombah  
Chibaba chibaba chiwawa  
My bambino go to sleep  
  
All the stars are in the skies ready to say  goodnight  
Cant you see your doll is sleepy too  
Close your drowsy little eyes mama will hold you tight  
While she sings a lullaby to you  
  
Oh chibaba chibaba chiwawa  
An chilawa kooka la goombah  
Chibaba chibaba chiwawa  
My bambino go to sleep  
  
chibaba chibaba chibaba chibaba chiwawa and chilawa  
Chibaba chibaba chiwawa  
An chilawa kooka la goombah la goombah  
Chibaba chibaba chiwawa  
My bambino go to sleep  
  
chi chi chibaba  
Chi chi chibaba chibaba chiwawa  
An chilawa kooka la goombah la goombah  
Chibaba chibaba chiwawa  
My bambino go to sleep  
  
All the stars are in the skies ready to say  goodnight goodnight  
Cant you see your doll is sleepy too  
Close your drowsy little eyes mama will hold you tight  
While she sings a lullaby to you ever so sweetly  
  
Chibaba chibaba chiwawa  
An chilawa kooka la goombah la la goombah Chibaba  
Chibaba chibaba chiwawa
