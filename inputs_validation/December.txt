December is the cruelest month  
But this time for once my cheeks are warm  
After long years in the monkeyhouse  
I am ready for the storm  
Let them throw all their cannonballs  
Let all their strongmen come  
Im ready to go anywhere  
Through venom sick and scum  
  
December isnt always cold  
But this year shes mine and I know why  
Somewhere a flower has to grow  
For every flower that dies  
Im stricken with fever  
But my heart is strong as steel  
Im ready to go anywhere  
I can believe I can feel  
  
December is a trusted friend  
I always recognise her face  
Its a plague of fool blown aside  
Forever by her soft and silent grace  
She is reckless as a mayday  
Gentle as a stone  
And ready to go anywhere  
To carry me back home  
  
December fell deep in the bleak  
Midwinter time when jesus christ  
Howled a baby saviours howl  
A primal truth as pure as ice  
And though we crucified him on a cross  
And dragged his name from payer to curse  
He was able to go anywhere  
He was almost one of us
