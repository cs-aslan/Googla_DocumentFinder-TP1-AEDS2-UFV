Rock a bye Baby  
On the treetop  
When the wind blows  
The cradle will rock  
When the bow breaks  
The cradle will fall  
So down down down down  
Down will come Baby  
Cradle and all  
  
I gave you my kisses  
Right from the start  
I gave you my true love  
For I wasnt smart  
But you took advantage  
And broke my heart  
An down down down down  
Down went my soul  
An you threw away my heart  
  
Dont make me cry for you  
Dont make me die for you  
I never thought itd be like this  
But in the end you see  
You took the best of me  
So down with all  
Down came my heart  
  
You learned to love me  
Much too late  
Offered me kisses  
I wouldnt take  
When the wind blew  
You saw me fall  
So down down down down  
Down will come Baby  
Cradle and all
