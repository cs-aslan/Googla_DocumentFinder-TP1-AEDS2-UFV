Kind of Woman I Got  
  
version from Osborne Brothers  Country Bluegrass tape  
  
You aint the kind of woman I wanted but youre the kind of woman I got  
  
Well the very first thing in the morning is  Get Up  
  
The last thing I hear every night is  Shut Up  
  
I found out my own cooking dont tast too hot  
  
You aint the kind of woman I wanted but youre the kind of woman I got  
  
Well when Im around the house youre always a fussing  
  
Nothing pleases you and you start cussing  
  
I put up with you and thats a heck of a lot  
  
You aint the kind of woman I wanted but youre the kind of woman I got  
  
If I had any sense at all Id go crazy  
  
But that would do you too much good so Im not  
  
Your mamma and your daddy both told me you was lazy  
  
You aint the kind of woman I wanted but youre the kind of woman I got  
  
Banjo plays a verse  
  
If I had any sense at all Id go crazy  
  
But that would do you too much good so Im not  
  
Your mamma and your daddy both told me you was lazy  
  
You aint the kind of woman I wanted but youre the kind of woman I got
