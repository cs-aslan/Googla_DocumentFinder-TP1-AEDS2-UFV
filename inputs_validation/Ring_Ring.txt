I was sitting by the phone  
I was waiting all alone  
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you  
Its a dark and dreary night  
Seems like nothings going right  
Wont you tell me honey how can I go on here without you  
  
Yes Im down and feeling blue  
And I dont know what to do ohoh  
  
Ring ring why dont you give me a call  
Ring ring the happiest sound of them all  
Ring ring I stare at the phone on the wall  
And I sit all alone impatiently  
Wont you please understand the need in me  
So ring ring why dont you give me a call  
So ring ring why dont you give me a call  
  
You were here and now youre gone  
Hey did I do something wrong  
I just cant believe that I could be so badly mistaken  
Was it me or was it you  
Tell me are we really through  
Wont you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking  
  
Please forgive and then forget  
Or maybe darling better yet ohoh  
  
Ring ring why dont you give me a call  
Ring ring the happiest sound of them all  
Ring ring I stare at the phone on the wall  
And I sit all alone impatiently  
Wont you please understand the need in me  
So ring ring why dont you give me a call  
So ring ring why dont you give me a call  
Ohoh ring ring why dont you give me a call  
So ring ring why dont you give me a call
