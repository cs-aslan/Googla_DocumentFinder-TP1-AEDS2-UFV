Higher  
  
Im a king yes Im a head of state  
But Im the kitchen boy wholl wash your dirty plate  
I had no message and the message was  
Were all Jesus Buddha and the Wizard of Oz  
  
Im merely a man  
And I bring nothing but love for you  
Im merely a man  
And I want nothing that you cant do  
  
And you know its true  
That with logic and love well be lifting humanity higher  
Higher  
  
Im all religious figures rolled into one  
Gaddafy Duck propelled from Jimmy Swaggarts tommy gun  
Dont promise rainbows with some golden pot  
In fact what I can offer I know youve already got  
  
Im merely a man  
And I bring nothing but love for you  
Im merely a man  
And I want nothing that you cant do  
  
And you know its true  
That with logic and love well have power enough  
To raise consciousness up and for lifting humanity higher  
Higher  
  
And you know its true  
We should chase superstition and fear from our hearts  
If were going to survive and take levels of sanity higher  
Kick it uphigher  
  
Im merely a man  
And I bring nothing but love for you  
Im merely a man  
And I want nothing that you cant do  
  
And you know its true  
That with logic and love well have power enough  
To raise consciousness up and for lifting humanity higher
