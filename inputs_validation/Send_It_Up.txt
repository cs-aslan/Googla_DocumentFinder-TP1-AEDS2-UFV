Oh you make me lay down  
Oh you make me forget I am here  
Oh youre making me safe now  
Oh you make the faces disappear  
  
Im all right by the way  
Everyone saves the day  
Sometimes I feel it  
  
Chorus x2  
Send it up  
Send it up now  
Send it up  
  
Oh I feel so close now  
Oh youre taking me back from where Ive been  
Oh Im not alone now  
Oh you rest me up and rush me in  
  
Im all right by the way  
Everyone saves the day  
Sometimes I feel it  
  
Chorus
