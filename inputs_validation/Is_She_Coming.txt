Is she coming home Ill leave the light on  
But through times and space shell go  
If shes coming home she wont tell me  
And I wonder if I should know  
  
Wonder if I should feel something  
Wonder if I should know  
But its dark in here  
  
Tiptoe softly do not wake her  
As she sleeps so very slow  
Dim the light on her daydream  
But her dreams youll never know  
  
See her fading dress and frame its colours  
For a memory youll long to know  
Drape the covers in her bedroom  
But life freezes with melting snow  
  
Ah Is she coming home
