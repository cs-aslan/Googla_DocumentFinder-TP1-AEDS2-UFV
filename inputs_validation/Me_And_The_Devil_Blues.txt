Early this mornin when you knocked upon my door  
Early this mornin when you knocked upon my door  
And I said Hello Satan I believe its time to go  
Me and the Devil was walkin side by side  
Me and the Devil was walkin side by side  
Im goin to beat my woman until I get satisfied  
She say you dont see why that I will dog her round  
Now baby you know you aint doin me right now  
She say you dont see why that I will dog her round  
It must be that old evil spirit so deep down in the ground  
You may bury my body down by the highway side  
I dont care where you bury my body when Im dead and gone  
You may bury my body down by the highway side  
So my old evil spirit can take the Greyhound bus and ride
