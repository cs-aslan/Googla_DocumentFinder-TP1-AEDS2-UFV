I didnt think it could happen again  
Im just too old and set in my ways  
I was convinced I would always be lonely  
All of the rest of my days  
Maybe I give up on romance  
In my longing to give up the pain  
I just didnt believe I would ever love again  
  
I was like one who had shut myself in  
Closed the windows locked all the doors  
Afraid of the dark and the beat of my heart  
Yet knowing there had to be more  
Though it sounds like a great contradiction  
Its the easiest thing to explain  
You see I was afraid I might never love again  
  
What does it take for a blind man to see  
That theres more there than just meets the eye  
What are the ways that the magic comes in  
That can turn a song into a sigh  
Sometimes I think that Im dreaming  
Or maybe Im going insane  
Or maybe its just that Im falling in love again  
  
Here I am standing beside you  
Oh lifes such a wonderful game  
Look at me now Im falling in love  
Look at me now Im falling in love  
Look at me now Im falling in love again
