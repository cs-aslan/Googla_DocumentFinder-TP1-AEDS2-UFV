Oh kiss the mountain air we breathe  
Goodbye its time to fly  
Sparrow climb the air is thinner  
Open wings cast this valley in the shade  
  
Fires dance the shadows  
Winds whisper the trees  
Mother talkin the waters  
Spirit moves it moves through all things  
  
Oh kiss the mountain air we breathe  
Goodbye its time to fly  
Sparrow climb the air is thinner  
Open wings cast this valley in the shade  
  
Fires dance the shadows  
Winds whisper the trees  
Mother talkin the waters  
Spirit moves it moves through all things
