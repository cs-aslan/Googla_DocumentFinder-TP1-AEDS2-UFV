Weve got barefoot ladies  
And tricked out Mercedes  
People getting crazy on the boulevard  
Weve got classic colas and ice cold Coronas  
Big cool parties in the back yard  
  
I said Hey thats the way we do it  
New friends and blue skies that never end  
Hey thats the way we like it  
Good times sunshine and summertime  
  
Youll see straw sombreros  
And Ttop Camaros  
Stereos blastin in the parking lot  
Youll see rock hard bodies and bikini hotties  
And everybodys got it goin on  
Theyre showing what they got  
  
Hey thats the way we do it  
New friends and blue skies that never end  
Hey thats the way we like it  
Good times sunshine and summertime  
  
I said Hey everybody  
Cant you feel the rhythm now  
Hey everybody dont you wanna party  
Hey everybody cant you feel the rhythm now  
Hey everybody dont you wanna party  
  
Hey thats the way we do it  
New friends blue skies that never end  
Hey thats the way we like it  
Good times sunshine and summertime  
Hey thats the way we do it  
New friends and blue skies that never end  
Hey thats the way we like it  
Good times sunshine and summertime  
  
Good times sunshine and summertime  
Good times sunshine and summertime
