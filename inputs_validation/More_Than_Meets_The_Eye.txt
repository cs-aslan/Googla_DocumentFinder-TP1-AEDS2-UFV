Now he walks in shadows  
Hes tryin to pretend she never walked away  
But its not deceivin  
Hes closer to an end he never could foresee  
  
Where love goes  
When love dies heaven knows  
  
But its more than meets the eye  
So much more than just a last goodbye  
Its a cold and lonely heart  
So sad and torn apart  
Yes its more than meets the eye  
  
Now hes in for trouble  
His luck has turned away nobody seems to care  
Well theres a cold moon risin  
And another lonely day has passed and shes not there  
  
Where love goes  
  
But its more than meets the eye
