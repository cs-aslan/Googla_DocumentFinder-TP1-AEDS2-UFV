Hear the call of the ringneck loon  
Hear the sound he will be home soon  
Hear the cry in the afternoon  
Ringneck Loon he knows best  
Hes a loon and he dont care less  
Ringneck loon away off shore  
How could anybody ask for more  
Hear the call of the ringneck loon  
Hear the sound he will be home soon  
Hear the cry in the afternoon  
Ringneck loon he cant rest  
Hes a loon and he dont care less  
Ringneck loon around the bend  
Been a loon since he dont know when  
Hear the call of the ringneck loon  
City life is what I see  
City life is the life for me  
Ringneck loon he knows best  
Hes a loon and he dont care less  
Hear the cry of the ringneck loon  
Hear the sound he will be home soon  
Hear the cry in the afternoon  
Ringneck loon you cant rest  
Youre a loonie and you dont care less  
Ringneck loon my old friend  
Been a loon since he dont know when  
Hear the cry of the ringneck loon  
Hear the sound he will be home soon  
Hear the cry in the afternoon
