I gaze into Your glorious light  
I know youre with me day and night  
And now I want to praise Your name  
  
theres nothing else that I want more  
Than just to look on You in awe  
I sense Your spirit set to move  
  
I know Your love it never ends  
I know Your power gives me strength  
I know somehow Ill never be the same  
  
Its Your grace  
That brought me freedom to praise  
And glorify Your name  
My passion is to worship You  
  
Its Your love  
A sacrifice to give eternal life  
I praise You Lord  
And glorify Your name
