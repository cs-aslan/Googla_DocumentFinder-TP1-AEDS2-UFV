I need headroom  
Got to have headroom  
Some place to rest my head  
Im gettin taller  
Thinkins gettin smaller  
Time is winnin out instead  
Well I heard it on the news  
Theyre selling everything they can  
And the American flag  
Is manufactured in Japan  
Theyre fightin battles in the stars  
Theyre pourin billions into Mars  
And layin right there at my feet  
Therere people sleepin in the street  
Give me room room room room room room  
Well Im livin on the farm  
Where chemistry has lost its charm  
And every dusty wind that blows  
Is burnin big holes in my clothes  
Theyre burnin big holes in the sky  
Makin people wonder why  
With all our land and sea and space  
Progress is wreckin every place  
Give me room room room room room room  
Well if you want an assenell  
The government will wish you well  
And if you steal a million bucks  
The government will wish you luck  
And they might even give you more  
If youre makin things for war  
But if youre poor and stealin cars  
Youll spend your life behind the bars  
Give me room room room room room room  
Theyre talkin ethics on the hill  
Theyre talkin union at the mill  
Theyre talkin justice at the farm  
Theyre talkin safety in the car  
Theyre talkin murder in the states  
Theyre talkin cash to get a fix  
Theyre talkin virus in the bed  
Im talkin room to rest my head  
Give me room room room room room room  
I need headroom  
Got to have headroom  
Some place to rest my head
