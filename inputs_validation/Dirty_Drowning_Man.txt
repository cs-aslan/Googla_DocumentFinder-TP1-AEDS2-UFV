Im a dog a dirty flying dog  
I drink Campari with marinated wild hog  
Ive no sense I like electric fence  
I put barbed wire in my pants and do a Celtic dance  
  
But when I can Im a giving man  
Ill flip you out the fire and back up into the frying pan  
  
And if youre down looking like youre gonna drown  
Of all your friends Im the one whos most apt to stick around  
  
Im a drowning man  
Who will save this drowning man  
Who will save this drowning man  
Who will save this dirty drowning man  
  
Youre so fine so bright and shiny fine  
And Im so proud to say that you in fact are a friend of mine  
And doubly pleased with crooked wobbly knees  
I dive on in and backstroke right across these seas of cheese  
  
But on the times when Im not such a giving man  
Please flip me out of the fire and backup into the frying pan  
  
And if youre down looking like youre gonna drown  
Of all your friends Im the one whos most apt to stick around  
  
Im a drowning man  
Who will save this drowning man  
Who will save this drowning man  
Who will save this dirty drowning man
