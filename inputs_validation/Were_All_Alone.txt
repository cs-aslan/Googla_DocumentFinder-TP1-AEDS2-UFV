Outside the rain begins  
And it may never end  
So cry no more  
On the shore a dream  
Will take us out to sea  
Forever more forever more  
  
Close your eyes Aimie  
And you can be with me  
Neath the waves through the caves of hours  
Long forgotten now  
Were all alone were all alone  
  
Close the window calm the light  
And it will be all right  
No need to bother now  
Let it out let it all begin  
Learn how to pretend  
  
Once a storys told  
It cant help but grow old  
Roses do lovers too so cast  
Your seasons to the wind  
And hold me dear  
Oh hold me dear  
  
Close the window calm the light  
And it will be all right  
No need to bother now  
Let it out let it all begin  
Alls forgotten now  
Were all alone all alone  
  
Close the window calm the light  
And it will be all right  
No need to bother now  
Let it out let it all begin  
All forgotten now  
My love  
  
My my love  
My love
