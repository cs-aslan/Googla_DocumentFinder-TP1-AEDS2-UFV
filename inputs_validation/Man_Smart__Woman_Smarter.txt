Let us put men and women together see which one is smarter  
Some say men but I say no women got the men like a puppet show  
  
It aint me its the people that say men are leading women astray  
I say its the women today smarter than the men in every way  
Thats right the women are smarter the women are smarted thats right  
  
Little boy sitting in the corner and cry big man come and ask him why  
He said I cant do what the big boys do the man sat down and he cried too  
  
It aint me its the people that say men are leading women astray  
I say its the women today smarter than the men in every way  
Thats right the women are smarter the women are smarted thats right  
  
Ever since the world began women been imitating the ways of men  
But listen cause Ive got a plan give it up just dont try to understand  
  
It aint me its the people that say men are leading women astray  
I say its the women today smarter than the men in every way  
Thats right the women are smarter the women are smarted thats right
