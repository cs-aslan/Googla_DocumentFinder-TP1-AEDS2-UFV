Shame  
Dog shame  
I know whats wrong  
Mans too old and wise  
Bring in the dog  
Turn on  
Down the mountain rescue  
Slip and slide when sunny  
Small cat better move along  
Or this bitch could do harm baby  
Straight as an arrow  
Im walking the dog  
  
Three is a crowd  
Two is a dog and me playing  
Whats he saying  
Free as a cloud  
No one ever really knew you  
Make clear your illusion no no no no  
  
Some dreams you dream you alone  
You thank Christ youre coming home  
Better better give the dog a bone  
Go go go go chew chew chew chew  
Some dreams you dream alone  
Go get a life and ease the pain  
Dogs a best friends dog  
Dogs a best friends dog  
  
Word speech blurred bleached  
Tell Mr Godot Im walking the dog  
Walking the dog  
  
Some dreams you dream you alone  
You thank Christ youre coming home  
Better better give the dog a bone  
Go go go go chew chew chew chew  
Some dreams you dream alone  
Go get a life and ease the pain  
Dogs a best friends dog  
Dogs a best friends dog
