Chorus x2  
I aint no new sensation no no  
But Im better than I ever been  
  
Take a look at my situation  
Tearing it down just to start it up  
I aint no new sensation  
But Im better than I ever been  
Used to spend time trying to chase it  
Now I spend time trying to erase it  
I aint no new temptation  
But Im better than I ever been  
  
Chorus  
  
Now take a look at this reputation  
Its not what it is but what its not  
It aint some new sensation  
But it keeps getting better and better and  
Used to spend time thinking theres a reason  
Now I spend time knowing Im in season  
I aint no new temptation  
But Im better than I ever been  
  
And Ive been running away from you for way too long  
And all my trying all your lying all of your crying  
I kept buying it  
Ive waited too long  
  
Chorus x2
