Once upon a time I made a lion roar  
He was sleeping in the sunbeams on the old zoo floor  
I had gone to see the park where my papa used to play  
Its called called Villa Borghese and its on the way  
To East Africa  
  
Down on Grand Comoro Island where I grew past four  
I could swim and fish and snorkel on the ocean floor  
And the wind laughed and the wind laughed through the trees as if to say  
Heres a child wholl want the world to go his way  
In East Africa in East Africa  
  
Suddenly for me the world turned upside down  
Far from my friends the lions and the dolphins came this awful sound  
  
Dark shadows sounds of thunder raging over me  
Came this monster called Adrenoleukodystrophy  
Wheres my East Africa  
  
Well they said they said they said the ones who know it all  
They said from now on for you there will be no more standing tall  
So I took my parents hands I lifted my head to say  
Ill just have to be a hero theres no other way  
Back to East Africa  
Back to East Africa  
Back to East Africa  
Come with me Im going back going back to East Africa
