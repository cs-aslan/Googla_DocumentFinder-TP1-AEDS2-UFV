Found a head and an arm in da garbage can  
Dont know why Im here  
Livin on the run for oh so long  
I gotta go collect  
Double talkin jive  
Get the money motherfucker  
Cause I got no more patience  
Double talkin  
I got Lies  
No more patience man  
  
Back in town ana all new friends  
They sayin how ya been  
Fucked up and outta place  
Thats how I felt back then  
Double talkin jive  
Get the money motherfucker  
Cause I got no more patience  
Double talkin  
I got Lies  
No more patience man  
You dig what Im sayin
