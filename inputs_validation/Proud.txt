Must you keep looking at me  
Before you looked the other way  
Must you keep glaring at me  
I know you look inside and see what you made  
  
You took no pride in me  
But now Im your everything  
Its finding out ya own me  
Not all of your gloating  
  
Must you keep looking at me  
Now you see what I am  
Trust I knew what it was  
I dont forget things thinking Im nothing  
  
You took no pride in me  
But now Im your everything  
Its finding out ya ownowe me  
Not all of your gloating  
  
Pride of me  
No Pride  
Why  
  
Must you keep looking at me  
Before you looked the other way  
Trust I knew what it was  
I dont forget things look what youve made  
  
You took no pride in me  
But now Im your everything  
Its finding out ya ownowe me  
Not all of your gloating
