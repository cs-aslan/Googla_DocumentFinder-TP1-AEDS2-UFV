One night one empty room one man gettin over you  
One star one lonely moon I make a wish I know will never come true  
You call my name and you beg me to hold you again  
But the truth remains Im only a fool who cant help but pretend  
  
Its all over but Im holding on I cant let go until the love is gone  
Its all over but I keep holding on with a desperate heart  
With my desperate heart  
  
Some nights I try in my mind I see myself learning someone new  
Still I know Im wasting my time no one can take the place of you  
So I close my eyes I swear I feel you here by my side  
But its all only a lie I need to believe for my heart to survive  
  
Its all over but Im holding on I cant let go until the love is gone  
Its all over but I keep holding on with a desperate heart  
With my desperate heart I keep holding on  
  
All this time Ive been drowning in hopeless illusions Im keeping inside  
That someday youll walk out of the shadows and back into my life  
  
Its all over but Im holding on I cant believe your love for me is gone  
Its all over but I keep holding on With a desperate heart  
Yeah with my desperate heart I cant let go until the love is gone  
All over but Im holding on I keep holding on  
All over but Im holding on I cant believe your love for me is gone  
All over but I keep holding on  
All over but Im holding on  
All over but I keep holding on
