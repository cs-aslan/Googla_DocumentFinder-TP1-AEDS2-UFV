So long ago  
Certain place  
Certain time  
You touched my hand  
All the way  
All the way down to Emmiline  
But if our paths never cross  
Well you know Im sorry but  
If I live to see the seven wonders  
Ill make a path to the rainbows end  
Ill never live to match the beauty again  
The rainbows end  
  
So its hard to find  
Someone with that kind of intensity  
You touched my hand I played it cool  
And you reached out your hand for me  
But if our paths never cross  
Well you know Im sorry but  
If I live to see the seven wonders  
Ill make a path to the rainbows end  
Ill never live to match the beauty again  
The rainbows end  
  
So long ago  
Its a certain time  
Its a certain place  
You touched my hand and you smiled  
All the way back you held out your hand  
If I hope and I pray  
Ooh it might work out someday  
If I live to see the seven wonders  
Ill make a path to the rainbows end  
Ill never live to match the beauty again  
  
If I live to see the seven wonders  
Ill make a path to the rainbows end  
Ill never live to match the beauty again  
  
If I live to see the seven wonders  
Ill make a path to the rainbows end  
Ill never live to match the beauty again
