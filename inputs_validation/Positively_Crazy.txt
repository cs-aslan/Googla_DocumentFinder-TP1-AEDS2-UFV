We rode our horses in the city  
Didnt we love living there  
Now its gone to those more beautiful  
Cause younger is always so pretty  
The marmalade the bed we made  
Seemed to stretch out into forever  
And we tried to stay together  
Yeah we tried to stay together  
  
Yeah hey we had some good times  
Reckless at heart but never never unkind  
In a perfect world wed have done just fine  
Were positively crazy now
