Love when we touch I shiver  
Just body language can you blame it  
My loves like a raging river  
And I think youre the one to tame it  
You youre the quiet shy type  
You always whisper never shout it  
Ooh Baby you are my type  
Why dont you tell me all about it  
I got ways to make you  
Make you tell me all about it  
Thats what Im gonna do  
Till you tell me all about it  
Making love till you do  
Till you tell me all about it  
Musical Interlude  
Me Im a lousy loner  
Just call my number come be near me  
Me Im a soulful moaner  
Stay chez moi so you can hear me  
You youre the quiet shy type  
You always whisper never shout it  
Ooh Baby you are my type  
Why dont you tell me all about it  
Background singers repeat  
I got ways to make you make you tell me all about it  
Thats what Im gonna do till you tell me all about it  
Making love till you do till you tell me all about it  
I got ways  
I got some special ways  
I got some very special ways to make you tell me  
Baby baby  
Scat  
Tell me tell me  
I got ways to make you  
Make you love me  
Background singers change to  
Thats exactly what Im  
Thats what Im gonna do till you tell me all about it  
We wont stop making love  
Making love till you do till you tell me all about it  
I got some ways  
I got ways to make you make you tell me all about it  
Ooh tell me that you love me  
Tell me all about it Baby  
Scat  
Tell me Baby that you love me
