If you feel the rolling thunder  
An your eyes see lightning strike  
Dont be afraid just call on me  
Ill bring you shelter from the night  
  
When the wind is howling  
Ill hold you near  
An soothe your troubled mind  
With a little bit of this  
An a little bit of that  
Ill make you leave all your worries behind  
  
Dont try to hold on to what you got  
Cause I got what you need  
Dont try to hold on for anyone  
Come on give it to me  
  
Youngblood youre hot property youngblood  
Youngblood youre hot property youngblood  
Youngblood  
  
When youre burning hot with fever  
An you shake down to your bones  
Dont get yourself into a cold sweat  
Cause its just your bad blood throwing stones  
The devil has got your number  
An he wants you hanging on a line  
But before the night is over baby  
Im gonna make you mine  
  
Dont try to hold on to what you got  
Cause I got what you need  
Dont try to hold on for anyone  
Come on give it to me  
  
Youngblood youre hot property youngblood  
Youngblood youre hot property youngblood  
Im coming to get you  
  
Dont try to hold on to what you got  
Cause I got what you need  
Dont try to hold on for anyone  
Come on give it to me  
  
Youngblood youre hot property youngblood  
  
Im gonna make you mine
