From diamond mine to the factory  
Everybodys doing what youve got to keep on doing for society  
Make this world a good place to be  
Let livin be but dont work for free  
Playing isnt paying so work is what Im saying  
Working for the world go round  
The battle cry dont mess with me  
Ive traveled the world for eternity  
  
Warriors of the wasteland  
Sailboats of ice on desert sands  
Warriors of the wasteland  
  
It seems to me that the powers that be  
Keep themselves in splendour and security  
Armoured cars for megastars  
No streets no bars yours wealth is ours  
They make the masses kiss their assets  
Lower class jackass pay me tax take out the trash  
Working for the world go round  
Your job is gold do as youre told  
They pay you less then run for congress  
  
Warriors of the wasteland  
Sailboats of ice on desert sands  
Warriors  what a waste man  
Im working for the world go round go round  
  
Diamond mine to the factory yeah  
Make this a world a good place to be  
  
Warriors  what a waste man  
  
Warriors  
  
Were rats in a cage  
  
Suicide a go go
