Princess in a school girls dream  
May I please speak with you  
Im having troubles with control  
And its all because of you  
Today I kept on falling down  
I thought it was the street  
So I look down at my shoes  
They were on the wrong feet  
  
I find it hard to be myself  
can you please explain  
I do not think its my health  
youre the one to blame  
Youre the one I wish I had  
And now my girlfriend is getting mad  
I cannot call this sane  
  
Today as I was walking down  
You bumped into me  
You said excuse me and walked away  
As I dropped to my knees  
I prayed to the being in the sky  
That my parents told me of  
I asked about you but no reply  
No clues about your love  
My girlfriend left me on the phone  
Im pathetically left here alone  
I cannot call this sane  
  
Can we find a way  
So that you can stay  
I think Im gonna Pop
