Stage acoustics ancient harps  
Music sounds of flats and sharps

Splints syringes lamps and forceps  
Fire extinguishers thermometers

Parchment prisms puppets dollies  
  
Verse 10  
Shock absorbers charts and maps  
We were oh such brainy chaps  
Anchors chewing gum the list does never cease  
Spinning tops the dice the crane

Did they come from Spain  
No they came from Greece
