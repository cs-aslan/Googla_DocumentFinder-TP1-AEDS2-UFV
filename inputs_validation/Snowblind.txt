What you get and what you see  
Things that dont come easily  
Feeling happy in my vein  
Icicles within my brain  
Cocaine  
  
Something blowing in my head  
Winters ice it soon will spread  
Death would freeze my very soul  
Makes me happy makes me cold  
Cocaine  
  
My eyes are blind but I can see  
The snowflakes glisten on the tree  
The sun no longer sets me free  
I feel theres no place freezing me  
  
Dont you think I know what Im doing  
Dont tell me that its doing me wrong  
Youre the one whos really a loser  
This is where I feel I belong  
  
Crystal world with winter flowers  
Turns my day to frozen hours  
Lying snowblind in the sun  
Will my ice age ever come  
  
My eyes are blind but I can see  
The snowflakes glisten on the tree  
The sun no longer sets me free  
I feel theres no place freezing me
