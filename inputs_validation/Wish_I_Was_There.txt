The sun has fallen  
  
Another day gone without you  
  
My heart keeps calling  
  
And I dont know just what to do  
  
When youre near me  
  
I seem to forget my lonely days  
  
Its more than a feeling  
  
Its something that cant be explained  
  
Chorus  
  
I wish that I was there  
  
I wish that I was there  
  
When youre not here  
  
I wish that I was there  
  
repeat  
  
You were falling  
  
Now Im coming around again  
  
I was calling  
  
Cause without you its the end  
  
I just want to see you a little more  
  
I just want to dream of you some more  
  
I just want to see you a little more  
  
I just want to be with you some more  
  
Chorus  
  
And you make me feel  
  
Wont you take me when youre not here  
  
Its been raining here  
  
And I just want you to be near  
  
I just want to see you a little more  
  
I just want to dream of you some more  
  
I just want to see you a little more  
  
I just want to be with you some more  
  
Chorus
