Imagine a world where no music was playing  
And think of a church with nobody praying  
Have you ever looked up at a sky with no blue  
Then youve seen a picture of me without you  
  
Have you walked in a garden where nothing was growing  
Or stood by a river where nothing was flowing  
If youve seen a red rose unkissed by the dew  
Then youve seen a picture of me without you  
  
Can you picture Heaven with no angels singing  
Or a quiet Sunday morning with no church bells ringing  
If youve watched as the heart of a child breaks in two  
Then youve seen a picture of me without you  
  
Can you picture Heaven with no angels singing  
Or a quiet Sunday morning with no church bells ringing  
If youve watched as the heart of a child breaks in two  
Then youve seen a picture of me without you
