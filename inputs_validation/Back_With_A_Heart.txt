Every day the pain dies a little  
Im not at the end but Im way past the middle  
I know when Im all healed up  
Ill be back with a heart and ready to love  
Good as new or maybe better  
So glad to know that tears arent forever  
Tears dry and soon enough  
Ill be back with a heart and ready to love  
Doesnt mean that all my hurt is through  
But more and more I think of me  
And less and less of you  
Oh youre hard to forget but Im gonna do it  
Thought I would die but Im livin right through it  
I wont give up so dont call my bluff  
Ill be back with a heart and ready to love  
No it doesnt mean that all the hurt is through  
But more and more I think of me  
And less and less of you  
Every day the pain dies a little  
Im not at the end but Im way past the middle  
I know when Im all healed up  
Ill be back with a heart and ready to love  
I know when Im all healed up  
Ill be back with a heart and ready to love  
Ooh ready to love
