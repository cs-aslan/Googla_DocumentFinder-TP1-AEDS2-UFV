Chorus  
Oh a lifetime isnt enough to love you  
And a lifetime isnt enough to live  
Oh a lifetime isnt enough to love you  
And one lifetime isnt enough to live  
  
I may be different than you criticized for what I do  
I chose to explore the truth the truth of me  
And I wont be afraid on that day  
I stand on my feet because I am yeah  
Took the risk the chance just to understand  
Well I been cold bold selfish misunderstood  
Like the lamb I will sacrifice to find you  
  
Chorus  
  
Been around so many people without you Im always alone  
Gazing into space my existence unknown  
I dont want to be here I wanna be near  
I stand on my feet because I am yeah  
Took the risk the chance just to understand  
Well I been cold bold selfish misunderstood  
Like the lamb I will sacrifice to find you  
  
Chorus  
  
Am I so different than you criticized for what I do  
I chose to explore the truth the truth of you  
And I wont be afraid on that day  
I stand on my feet because I am yeah  
Took the risk the chance just to understand  
  
 Chorus   
  
Hey a lifetime isnt enough to love you  
And one lifetime isnt enough to live
