Out on the street corner  
Just like every morning I sit here  
And I watch you walk my way  
And even though I dont know you  
As you get closer I swear I feel  
My heart start racing aching  
Maybe its in my mind  
And maybe Im only dreaming  
And I swear you catch my eye  
As you walk on by  
Oh why you gotta leave me so blue  
  
Chorus  
Baby why cant you see  
That Im the only one for you  
You could search the world over  
But youll never find another so true  
Cause if youre looking for love  
Im standing right in front of you  
  
Im standing right in front of you  
  
I bet your heart like mine  
Has been broken by someone  
We never should have given it to oh no  
So we put up a wall to keep from falling so hard  
Its so sad  
Cause theres such good love inside  
And Ive been hoping that I might find  
Someone who feels the same way  
Someone to share my life  
On this beautiful ride together  
We could see it all through  
  
Chorus  
  
Standing right in front of you  
  
So this morning Im just going to walk up and say hello to you  
Cause if given a choice between love and being alone  
I know which one  
I know which one I choose  
And give me a chance  
Id be a better man for you I believe I would  
And open your heart girl  
Let me make your dreams come true  
  
You can search the world over  
But I can take it to the moon  
Cause if youre looking for love  
Im standing right in front of you yes I am  
Standing right in front of you  
Standing right in front of you  
Open your eyes Im standing right in front of you  
Just give me a chance baby  
Im standing right in front of you
