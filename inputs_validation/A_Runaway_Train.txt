All aboard watch your step people  
Last call for the Nightmare Express  
  
I found myself slippin away  
Just this side of dead  
I woke up in a boxcar  
I wasnt in my bed  
  
I found my leg chained to a spike  
That ran down through the floor  
Attached to thirteen angry men  
All rotten to the core  
  
But Im innocent I cried right out  
Im in someone elses dream  
They looked around and laughed out loud  
Said Brother so are we  
Yeah brother so are we  
But Im a big celebrity  
Known all round the land  
Well buddy you aint no one here  
Man you aint in demand  
  
Speedin towards a flamin wall  
Like a screamin sonic boom  
I really gotta wake up now  
Or I may meet my doom oh Lord  
I may meet my doom  
  
So all that I remember  
Is how much my body hurt  
Now Im sleepin in the graveyard  
On the wrong side of the dirt  
Now on the wrong side of the dirt  
Wrong side of the dirt dont you know  
Im on the wrong side of the dirt
