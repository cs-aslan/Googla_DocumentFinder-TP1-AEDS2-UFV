What keeps on telling me to stay on the way I chose  
What keeps on giving me all the strength to carry on  
  
Give me some time cant sleep anymore at night  
I want to show Im here with an aim of mine  
  
I feel strong but someone is crying I know  
Its so hard to find a sign of a way to go  
  
Dont need to stone my brain I need my head for something else  
I want to live and learn step by step Im going on  
  
Send me a sign dont want to resign too soon  
What situation will come I cant endure  
  
I feel strong but someone is crying I know

What situation will come I cant endure
