Living in a rabbit tunnel  
Keep the doggy in her kennel  
Mustnt let her see the world  
Oh no  
Dont treat her like that  
Oh no  
Dont treat her like that  
Leaving after mom and daddy  
Carry home just like a cat he  
Mustnt let them see your kill  
Shout it clear for all to hear  
You wont shoot this bird down  
Shout it clear for all to hear  
Were going to take this town  
Turn and done bridge give the orders  
Keeping lunch in perfect orders  
Mustnt let them know their minds  
Turning on too early music  
Bring up on each other that they  
Mustnt let them over the lines  
Its time she stopped being your ornament  
Its time she put it in the past for permanent  
You cant hold her if she wants to roam around  
Around around around around  
You cant hold her dreamin keep her gagged and bound  
Gagged and bound  
Were going  
Were going to  
Were going to take  
Were going to take this  
Were going to take this
