Im in here a prisoner of history  
Can anybody help  
  
Cant you hear my call  
Are you coming to get me now  
Ive been waiting for  
You to come rescue me  
I need you to hold  
All of the sadness I can not  
Living inside of me  
  
Im in here Im trying to tell you something  
Can anybody help  
  
Im in here Im calling out but you cant hear  
Can anybody help  
  
Cant you hear my call  
Are you coming to get me now  
Ive been waiting for  
You to come rescue me  
I need you to hold  
All of the sadness I can not  
Living inside of me  
  
Im crying out Im breaking down  
I am fearing it all  
Stuck inside these walls  
Tell me there is hope for me  
Is anybody out there listening  
  
Cant you hear my call  
Are you coming to get me now  
Ive been waiting for  
You to come rescue me  
I need you to hold  
All of the sadness I can not  
Living inside of me  
  
Cant you hear my call  
Are you coming to get me now  
Ive been waiting for  
You to come rescue me  
I need you to hold  
All of the sadness I can not  
Living inside of me  
  
Im in here can anybody see me  
Can anybody help
