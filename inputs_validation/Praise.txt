Let me begin by telling you  
Something that happened turned my head around  
I took a walk on a cloudy day  
I met a friend this is what he said  
  
Now is the time for change  
Im trying to get to a higher place  
Life is surrounded by grace  
Lets join together singing songs of freedom  
  
What do you do when you gain the world  
You pay the price baby you lose your soul  
Live in a world of make believe  
It wont work baby cant you see  
  
Now is the time for change  
Im trying to get to a higher place  
Life is surrounded by grace  
Lets join together singing songs of freedom  
  
Praise  
Praise  
  
Its three o clock in the mornin  
When Im all by myself  
And I feel the spirit comin on again  
  
Now is the time for change  
Im trying to get to a higher place  
Life is surrounded by grace  
Lets join together singing songs of freedom
