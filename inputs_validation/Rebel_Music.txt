I rebel music  
I rebel music  
Why cant we roam this open country  
Oh why cant we be what we want to be  
We want to be free  
  
Three oclock roadblock curfew  
And Ive got to throw away  
Yes Ive got to throw away  
Yes Ive got to throw away  
My little herb stalk  
  
I rebel music  
I rebel music  
  
Take my soul and cuss me out  
Check my life if I am in doubt  
Three oclock roadblock  
And hey Mr Cop aint got no  
What you say down there  
Aint got no birth certificate on me now  
  
I rebel music  
I rebel music  
  
Take my soul and cuss me out  
Check my life if I am in doubt  
Three oclock roadblock  
And hey Mr Cop aint got no  
What you say down there  
Aint got no birth certificate on me now
