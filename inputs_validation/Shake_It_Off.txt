Chorus  
I gotta shake you off  
Cause the loving aint the same  
And you keep on playing games  
Like you know Im here to stay  
I gotta shake it off  
Just like the Calgon commercial  
I really gotta get up outta here  
And go somewhere  
I gotta shake it off  
Gotta make that move  
Find somebody who  
Appreciates all the love I give  
Boy I gotta shake it off  
Gotta do whats best for me  
Baby and that means I gotta  
Shake you off  
  
By the time you get this message  
Its gonna be too late  
So dont bother paging me  
Cause Ill be on my way  
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes  
Just ask your momma she knows  
Youre gonna miss me baby  
Hate to say I told you so  
Well at first I didnt know  
But now its clear to me  
You would cheat with all your freaks  
And lie compulsively  
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton  
Jumped in your ride and took off  
Youll never ever find a girl  
Who loves you more than me  
  
Chorus  
  
I gotta shake shake shake shake shake it  
Off shake shake shake shake shake it  
Gotta shake it off off shake shake shake shake  
Shake it off shake shake shake shakeshake it off  
  
I found out about a gang  
Of your dirty little deeds  
With this one and that one  
By the pool on the beach in the streets  
Heard yall was  
Hold up my phones breakin up  
Ima hang up and call the machine right back  
I gotta get this off of my mind  
You wasnt worth my time  
so Im leaving you behind  
Cause I need a real love in my life  
Save this recording because  
Im never coming back home  
Baby Im gone  
Dont cha know  
  
Chorus  
  
I gotta shake shake shake shake shake it  
Off shake shake shake shake shake it  
Gotta shake it off off shake shake shake shake  
Shake it off shake shake shake shakeshake it off  
  
Chorus
