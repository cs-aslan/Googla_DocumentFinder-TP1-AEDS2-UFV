Get up and jump get up and jump get up get upget up and jump  
Jump on up  
Jump on down  
Just jump a jump a jump a jump a jump around  
Jump the day away  
Jump all over town  
Cause jumpin is OK in a jumpin kinda way hey hey  
Jump a boy  
Jump a girl  
Jump a rope  
Jump for joy  
Just dont stop jumpin  
Keep your heart muscle pumpin  
Hillel be jumpin on that little baby frumpkin  
Say what You got a pumpkin in your pants  
When youre just standing or sitting still  
Think about the frogs gettin a thrill  
Take a little lesson from the kangaroos  
Dont you know theyre jumpin foos jump you  
Jump a nun  
Jump a Jack  
Jump for fun  
Jump back  
Hows about us jumpin in the sack  
And now its time for a jump attack  
Get up and jump x8  
Jam Bob Jim Bob Slim Bob Boogie  
To the tune of slima Billy  
Lookin like youre mighty silly  
Say what You got a pumpkin in your pants  
Say what You got a pumpkin in your pants  
Mister Mexican jumpin bean knows  
His fun is skeaky clean

Not from sittin on his goddamn spleen Get up  
Oh I be jumpin I be jumpin I be jumpin alone  
I be jumpin for the phone

I really want to jump on Kinskis bones  
Get up and jump x8  
Get up and jump x8  
Jam Bob Jim Bob Slim Bob Boogie  
To the tune of slima Billy  
Lookin like youre mighty silly  
Say what You got a pumpkin in your pants
