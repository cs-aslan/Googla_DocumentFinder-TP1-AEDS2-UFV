Big bad insane Strong Arm Steady gang  
Way beyond the days of rockin them stupid rapper chains  
Comin through clear the lane send a bullet through your brain  
Number one with a bullet faster than the bullet train  
Pop it if you pull it mayne hang with orangutans  
I live for my soldiers ask them they gon say the same  
My gauge rings your bells like the Hunchback of Notre Dame  
Aint even gotta say it you motherfuckers know the name  
Legendary classic niggaz be punk pussy and plastic  
Wastin the time and the minds of the masses yeah  
But look how strong we are man Im a motherfuckin star  
Every week I cop a house and a car  
The minimansion off in Vegas with the vanquish  
Thats where I mastermind my situations determination and patience  
We dont speak the same language no I got a translator  
Spittin twenty five times see your bitch ass later seemon  
  
Chorus  
That nigga X to the Z that boy is somethin to see cause he a G  
I got the whole world waitin on me  
Im about that grind so motherfucker dont waste my time  
I got the whole world waitin on me  
If you ready to ride cmon get in my ride and lets slide  
I got the whole world waitin on me  
Yeah I got the whole world waitin on me  
  
Niggaz screamin they the shit but that shit aint real  
I dont need to be the shit cause shit roll downhill  
Im escalatin aggressively millions built up in equity  
Corporations invest in me bangin shit til the death of me yeah  
Cooked coke recipe money come back so thick  
My kids kids couldnt spend this shit  
Get a grip pop a clip chop down that brick  
No amount of fame gon change this gangsta spit  
Quick to roll out the backwood yeah smoke out your buildin  
We soldiers devoted dressed down like civilians  
Niggaz wanna kill me because I make millions thats weak  
Thats weak like gangstas that hide behind children hahaha yeah  
Novocain the game no shame  
No feelings no names no numbers naw bitch  
You cant hang with us no  
Ashes to ashes and you cant bust  
You so popcorn and fake industrious yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah yeah whattup Key  
Im liftin plates youll never find in the weight room  
So stay tuned my platoon finna touch down soon  
Cancun to St Thomas St Thomas to the Bahamas  
Most niggaz aint really honest so Im watchin my step  
Im the hardest coldhearted artist the coast is clear  
Dubai Australia to Africa this is the year  
Let the alcohol you sippin saturate in yo system  
I be swimmin through these women man fuck em and flip em  
I know you hopin I would fall to the side or go to Way Side  
It aint a motherfucker alive to come and take mine no  
Dont procrastinate dont waste time  
Never faced time Houdini with crime traffic over state lines  
Military minded stickin to the base lines  
Intellectually brighter than California sunshine  
Yeah I got my bars up go pull my cars up yeah  
I love my struggle never cover my scars up cmon  
Nigga  
  
Chorus
