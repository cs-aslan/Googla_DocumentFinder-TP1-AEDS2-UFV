The view from the top can be oh so very lonely  
And you can be missing such a lot that could be yours  
  
Why cant I stop forgetting myself  
Why am I always trying to be like somebody else  
Why cant I love you  
Why bother flying high above you  
I know where you are  
  
The view from the top can be oh so very lonely  
And you can be missin such a lot that could be yours  
  
And whos going to miss me  
Therell only be myself to blame  
You know Id love to hold you tight  
And love you all the night  
But I dont even know my name  
  
La la la da la  
  
Why cant I stop forgetting myself  
Why am I always trying to be like somebody else  
Why cant I love you  
Why bother flying high above you  
I know where you are  
  
The view from the top can be oh so very lonely  
And you can be missin such a lot that could be yours
