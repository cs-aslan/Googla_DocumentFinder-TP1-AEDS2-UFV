Verse  
I want to be extraordinary  
Not just extraordinary  
It seems like everywhere I see  
People far more interesting than me  
I know the changes kinda scary  
But maybe I should try to vary  
  
Hook  
Some minor details  
A small degree  
A slightly different version of me  
  
Chorus  
Well I could learn to cook vegetarian  
Or take fashion workshop  
Meditate calculate  
Learn to knit a tank top  
  
Yoga hula  
Clogging jogging  
Walking on a tight rope  
Take a correspondence course  
And learn to make my own soap  
  
Jumping on a pogo stick  
Standing in a wheat field  
Going on a snipe hunt  
Gonna keeps my eyes peeled  
Take a little time to really decorate my door  
And change my hair to black and then Ill dye it back orange  
  
Underwater taxidermy  
Shopping for a suitcase  
Peeling tangerines while placing second in a sack race  
  
Lion taming online gaming  
Tryn to win a prize fight  
Appear in a talk show  
Dressup like a water sprite  
  
Yeah  
Im gonna be extraordinary  
Im gonna stand out from the crowd  
And shout out loud  
Youll see  
That its a brand new me
