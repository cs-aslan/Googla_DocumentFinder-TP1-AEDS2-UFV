Youre so pretty when you cry when you cry  
Wasnt ready to hear you say goodbye  
Now youre tearing me apart tearing me apart  
Youre tearing me apart  
  
Youre so London your own style your own style  
And together were so good so girl why  
Are you tearing me apart tearing me apart  
Youre tearing me apart  
  
Did I do something stupid yeah girl if I blew it  
Just tell me what I did lets work through it  
Theres gotta be some way to get you to want me like before  
  
Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress  
And it hurts cause I know you wont be mine tonight  
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile  
Baby tell me how to make it right  
Now all my friends say its not really worth it  
But even if thats true  
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on  
Baby even if I wanted to  
Nobody compares to you  
  
Were so Paris when we kissed when we kissed  
I remember the taste of your lipstick  
Now youre tearing up my heart tearing up my heart  
Youre tearing up my heart  
  
Did I do something stupid yeah girl if I blew it  
Just tell me what I did lets work through it  
Theres gotta be some way to get you to want me like before  
  
Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress  
And it hurts cause I know you wont be mine tonight  
No one ever makes me feel like you do  
When you smile baby tell me how to make it right  
Now all my friends say its not really worth it  
But even if thats true  
No one in the world could stop me  
From not moving on baby even if I wanted to  
Nobody compares to you  
Nobody compares to you  
  
Theres gotta be some way to get you to want me like before  
Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress  
And it hurts cause I know you wont be mine tonight  
No one ever makes me feel like you do  
When you smile baby tell me how to make it right  
Now all my friends say its not really worth it  
But even if thats true  
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on  
Baby even if I wanted to  
Nobody compares to you
