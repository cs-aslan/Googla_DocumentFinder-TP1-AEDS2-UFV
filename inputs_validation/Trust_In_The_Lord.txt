Chorus  
Trust trust in the Lord  
Lean not on your own understanding  
In all all of your ways  
Acknowledge Him  
Hell make your path straight  
  
Youll be my guide for life  
Ill walk by Your side  
With Your hand in mine  
Ill go where You lead me  
  
Chorus  
  
My eyes can only see  
The ground beneath my feet  
Your dreams are greater  
Your ways are higher  
O Lord please show me  
  
Chorus  
  
Bless my thoughts  
My dreams my imaginations  
Step by step  
Your delight Your creation  
  
Chorus
