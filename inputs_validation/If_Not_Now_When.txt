I have waited  
Dined on ashes  
Swung from chandeliers and climbed Everest  
And none of its got me close to this  
  
Ive waited all my life  
If not now when will I  
  
Weve been good  
Even a blast but  
Dont you feel like somethings missing here  
Dont you dare ooh ooh  
  
Ive waited all my life  
If not now when will I  
Stand up and face the bright light  
Dont hide your eyes  
Its time its time its time  
  
No umbrellas  
No sunglasses  
Heal and hallelujah everyday  
  
Ive waited all my life  
If not now when will I  
Stand up and face the bright light  
Dont hide your eyes  
Its time its time its time  
Its time
