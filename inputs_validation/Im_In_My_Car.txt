Im in my car  
I got my telephones and radio  
This is my home  
I have learnt to love and live  
The only way I know  
And I dont want to change a thing  
This is my world you are sitting in  
I got a fax so I press send  
Send a message to my DJ  
A message to my DJ  
cause hes my best friend  
Im in my car  
  
And I am happy here  
Even though the fools will never know  
I got peace in here  
My private world and endless  
Stop and go  
  
And I dont want to change a thing  
This is my world you are sitting in  
I got a fax so I press send  
Send a message to my DJ  
A message to my DJ  
cause hes my best friend  
  
Im in my car  
  
Safe from my boss  
Safe from all the gumbos  
That I hate so much  
Its not GT  
Its not all about you think  
That you may see  
Oh its not about what you think  
You see  
Im safe from my family   
Im safe  
Im safe  
  
Im in my car  
  
Im happy here  
  
Im in my car
