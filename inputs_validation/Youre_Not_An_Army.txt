We can drag you out of bed in the middle of the night  
Drive tanks along your street looking for a flight  
We can put you in a cell an dash away the key  
Make you stand against the wall torture chamber style  
The reason is simple its obvious to see  
We can shoot at you but you cant kill we  
Dont you see dont you see your not an army  
  
The reason is simple its obvious to see  
Right is on your side but the medias with we  
Dont you see dont you see your not an army  
  
The thing you must remember since these troubles first began  
Were supported by a tax paying population  
And if the rest of this world is against we  
Its a fact that the people of this country wont see  
  
They can give you a trial by military  
But you wont be sentenced politically  
Youll be beat by other prisoners for political views  
But you just another killer when we read it in the news
