A will we ever understand  
Or is the fate of man at hand  
Or will we live or shall we die  
  
How will we ever know if we never try  
The governments the Devils hands  
Its a lie and its a scam  
  
They wind us up put us down  
And watch us go  
And if you close your eyes  
Theres a big surprise  
  
What the fuck are we sayin  
Do we feel what we dream about  
Weve got to keep on aprayin  
And one day well see the light  
  
Ive been lost in the name of love  
And we kill our brothers daily  
In the name of God  
  
Wed better chill before  
We take on some tribulation  
And if we realized  
And then well make a little love now sing  
  
What the fuck are we sayin  
Do we believe what we read about  
Weve got to keep on aprayin  
And one day well see the light  
  
And one day well see the light  
And one day well see the light  
And one day well see the light  
  
What the fuck are we sayin  
Do we believe what we dream about  
Weve got to keep on aprayin  
And one day well see the light  
  
And one day well see the light  
And one day well see the light  
And one day well see the light
