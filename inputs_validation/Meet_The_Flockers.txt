First you find a house and scope it out  
Find a Chinese neighborhood cause they dont believe in bank accounts  
Second you find a crew and a driver someone ring the doorbell  
And someone that aint scared to do what it do  
Third you pull up at the spot  
Park watch ring the doorbell and knock  
Four make sure nobody is home  
They gone okay its on  
Dont be scared nigga youre in now  
If the police come you gonna find out who your friends now  
That aint them talking thats your mind playing tricks on you  
Youre conscious cause you know you got nines with two clips on you  
But fuck that motherfuck that plasma  
And fuck that laptop go and get that jewelry box  
You tryna get paid  
Go take that jewelry box to the Slauson theyll give you cash back  
  
Meet the motherfucking flockers  
Make some noise if youve ever stole something in your life  
Dont be ashamed its okay baby  
Make some noise if youve ever stole a dollar out your mamas purse  
  
Niggas dont know the history bout the fly  
Put the flathead in the door pull it make it go fly  
Hit the first drawer grab a nigga some socks  
That nigga in the car better be listening to that box  
Ay I aint staking out shit nigga  
Eeny meeny miny moe and ding dong ditch  
Aint a safe I cant crack nigga thats on Crip  
Im with my Pirus from Compton we gon pass and get rich

Let some weeks go by we at the dealership  
I never took notes nigga I need the pinkslip  
Hit Icy Mac and Ave for my bullshit

Jumped in the whip and did the whole dash  
DLoc my nigga my nigga hit my first lick
