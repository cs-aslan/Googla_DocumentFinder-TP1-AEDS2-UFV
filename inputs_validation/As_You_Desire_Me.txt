As you desire me so shall I come to you  
Howeer you wander so shall I be  
Be it forever or be it just a day  
As you desire me come what may  
I doubt not but you will do what you will with me  
I give my life to you cause youre my destiny  
And now come take me my soul is yours  
As you desire me I come to you  
And now come take me my very soul is yours  
As you desire me I come to you
