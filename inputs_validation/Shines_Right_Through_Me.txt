These days I feel a change All the patterns rearranged  
Though I cant explain I know Im not afraid  
Now I realize all good things can be supplied  
And they come from you  
  
Its all brand new and it shines right through  
Shines Right Through Me  
I look at you and you and it shines right through  
Shines Right Through Me  
  
This feeling that Ive found like sleeping on a cloud  
Smiling at the sky Not even knowing why  
Strange how things work out I know without a doubt  
That it comes from you  
  
Break me out of emptiness Lead me to your light  
Anything worth having is worth some sacrifice  
Laid too long in loneliness This world was made to change  
Half an hour of sunshine is worth a week of rain  
  
Air is flowing free its a little easier to breathe  
This soul unbound was lost and found  
No reason left to hide I feel a light inside and it comes from you
