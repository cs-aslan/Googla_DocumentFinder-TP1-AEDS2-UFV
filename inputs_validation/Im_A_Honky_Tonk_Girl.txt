Ever since you left me Ive done nothing but wrong  
Many nights Ive laid awake and cried  
We was so happy  
My heart was in a whirl  
But now Im a honky tonk girl  
So turn that jukebox way up high  
And fill my glass up while I cry  
Ive lost everything in this world  
And now Im a honky tonk girl  
Instrumental  
I just cant make a right with all of my wrongs  
Every evening of my life seems so long  
Im sorry and ashamed for all these things you see  
But losing him has made a fool of me  
So fill my glass up to the rim  
To lose my memory of him  
Ive lost everything in this world  
And now Im a Honky Tonk Girl
