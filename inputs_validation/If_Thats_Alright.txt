Every day is dreamlike  
It seems like in every way  
And thats why  
When I look back on my life  
Its like a slideshow out of focus  
  
And as the carousel goes round  
The slides are upsidedown  
Theres nothing to make out or even notice  
  
When will it all become concrete wouldnt that be sweet  
To know where you stand  
But until then its a slideshow  
That youre yawning through  
Or even sleeping  
  
And as the carousel goes round  
The slides are still upsidedown  
Theres nothing to make out or even notice  
  
And if thats alright then its alright  
If thats alright then its alright  
And if thats alright  
Then I want to hear you say it  
And if thats alright  
Then I gotta hear you say it now
