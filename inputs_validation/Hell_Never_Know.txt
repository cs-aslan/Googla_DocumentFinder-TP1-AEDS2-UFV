They go off and leave me behind  
They have so many words to find  
I run to catch a glimpse of them  
  
Just walking in the sun  
Knowing theyll be mine again  
When the evening has begun  
And when I see them hand in hand  
The boy who walks beside the man  
I pray that I will always have the world  
  
That I have found  
The husband and the son  
That I built my life around  
  
Hell never know of that night long ago  
Hell never know its locked in my mind  
No hell never know  
From the feelings I show  
Hell never know  
His son is only mine  
  
Sometimes I lie awake at night  
Watching darkest turn to light  
Thinking back on all the things  
I said to him today  
Wondering if I might had a careless word to say  
When the mornings almost here  
He reaches out to draw me near  
Silently I search his face for the love  
I hope to see and once again  
Im sure that all his love belongs to me
