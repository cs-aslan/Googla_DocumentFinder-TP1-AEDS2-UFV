So long weve been married  
Lifes burdens weve carried  
Though faith kept us humble  
And made our love grow  
The plans that we make up  
Someone seems to break up  
But darlin what else can we do  
  
Chorus  
We may have to leave here  
To find peace of mind dear  
Some place where we can live  
A life all our own  
For I know you love me  
And happy we could be  
If some folks would leave us alone  
  
They say you are leaving  
That you are deceiving  
But you tell me they say  
The same about me  
But well show them that theyre wrong  
That loose talk will do harm  
And hope that the truth they will see  
  
Chorus  
  
When I go out walkin  
Theres lots of loose talkin  
They say were unhappy  
And well break apart  
But darling its not true  
Because I still love you  
And I do with all of my heart  
Yeah  
  
Chorus
