Zazou whatcha gonna do  
Theres a lot of people and theyre coming for you  
Zazou comment allezvous  
A knock on the door in the night  
That Zazou he dont care  
The dark glasses  
The long hair  
Takes his time  
Sneers at men  
Some ugly people want revenge  
Zazou comment allezvous  
A knock on the door in the night  
In the night  
That Zazou he sleeps all day  
Then down to Select or Le Collisee  
Sips his drinks orders more  
Says what he thinks and its a crazy war  
Zazou whatcha gonna do  
A knock on the door in the night  
Zazou comment allezvous  
A knock on the door in the night  
And when the soldiers strut  
All he cares about is love  
When the flags are out  
All he cares about is love  
Well theres a thin line between love and crime  
And in this situation  
A thin line between love and crime and  
Collaboration  
In the night  
In the night  
In the night  
Zazou whatcha gonna do  
Theres a lot of people and theyre coming for you  
Zazou comment allezvous  
A knock on the door in the night  
Now everybodys under somebodys spell  
Unless theyve already gone to Hell  
In the streets you can hear the people say  
That Zazou he should be locked away  
And when the soldiers strut  
All he cares about is love  
When the flags are out  
All he cares about is love  
Well theres a thin line between love and crime  
And in this situation  
A thin line between love and crime and  
Collaboration
