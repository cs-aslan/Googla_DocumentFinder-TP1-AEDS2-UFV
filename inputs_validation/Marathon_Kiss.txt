I cherished the night of your marathon kiss  
Chemicals flying oh I love this  
Whats it all for if you cant feel the ecstasy  
Whats it all for if you cant touch the power  
The will to live in the hour   
Dont steal what I have got baby  
Cause its hardly enough for myself  
Dont steal what Ive got baby  
Cause the balance is thin like a shell  
I cherished the night of your marathon kiss  
Chemicals flying oh I love this  
Whats it all for if you cant feel the moment  
Whats it all for if you cant feel the moment  
The moment of kiss  
Fearless when Im with you  
Fearless when Im with you  
Fearless when Im with you  
Fearless through and through  
What am I gonna wear I dont care  
Nobody sees the inside  
Oh the radios gonna take us out  
Take us out on a ride  
I put on perfume and I walk in the room  
The world stands still with you in the room  
I cross the floor and Im high and Im rich  
When Im under your lips and your fingertips  
I cherished the night of your marathon kiss  
Chemicals flying into the mist  
Whats it all for if you cant feel the moment  
Whats it all for if you cant feel the power  
Whats it all for if you cant cant live right here  
In the hour in the hour in the hour  
Fearless when Im with you  
Fearless when Im with you  
Fearless when Im with you  
Fearless through and through
