Carbon monoxide  
Making me choke

Cars backed up  
Far as you can see  
Seems like Ive been waiting here for all eternity  
Oh and just in case youre wondering

Im right here right here right here right here  
Stuck right here in the middle of this  
  
Traffic jam  
I havent moved one inch from this here spot  
Traffic jam  
The freeways one big parking lot  
Traffic jam  
My radiators boiling hot  
And Im stuck right here in the middle right here in the middle  
Right here in the middle of a traffic jam  
  
Trapped inside  
My automobile  
Cobwebs gowin  
On the steerin wheel  
Now Im no genius  
But one thing I know

An hour and a half ago
