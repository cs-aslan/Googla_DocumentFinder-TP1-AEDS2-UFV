Na Na Na Na Na Na Na  
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na  
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na  
Na Na Na Na Na  
Repeat  
In the darkest night  
You called my name  
Beckoned me to come  
Let me hear your voice  
Day by day  
Your the holy one  
I will sing  
Of your freedom  
I will tell of all the wonderous things youve done  
Let me run  
In your presence  
Let me dance gonna get a little crazy for you  
Cant stop thinking about you Lord  
Cant stop thinking about your love  
Cant stop thinking about what youve done for me  
Cant stop thinking about you Lord  
Cant stop thinking about your love  
Cant stop thinking about what youve done for me
