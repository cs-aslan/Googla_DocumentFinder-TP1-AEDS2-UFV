My new purple shoes  
Been amazin the people next door  
And my rock n roll forty fives  
Been enragin the folks on the lower floor  
  
I got a way with the girls on my block  
Try my best to be a real individual  
And when we go down to smokies and rock  
They line up like its some kind of ritual  
Oh give me a good guitar  
And you can say that my hairs a disgrace  
Or just find me an open car  
Ill make the speed of light outta this place  
  
I like the good things in life  
But most of the best things aint free  
Its the same situation just cuts like a knife  
When youre young and youre poor and youre crazy  
Young and youre crazy  
  
Oh give me a good guitar  
And you can say that my hairs a disgrace  
Or just find me an open car  
Ill make the speed of light outta this place
