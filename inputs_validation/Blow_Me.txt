Verse 1  
White knuckles and sweaty palms from hanging on too tight  
Clench of jaw Ive got another headache again tonight  
Eyes on fire eyes on fire and the burn from all the tears  
Ive been crying Ive been crying Ive been dying over you  
Tie a knot in the rope trying to hold trying to hold  
But theres nothing to grab so I let go  
  
Chorus  
I think Ive finally had enough I think I maybe think too much  
I think this might be it for us blow me one last kiss  
You think Im just too serious I think youre full of shit  
My head is spinning so blow me one last kiss  
Just when I think it cant get worse I had a shit day no  
You had a shit day no weve had a shit day no  
I think that lifes too short for this Ill pack my ignorance and bliss  
I think Ive had enough of this blow me on last kiss  
  
Verse 2  
I wont miss all of the fighting that we always did  
Take it in I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left  
I am sick whiskeydick no more battles for me  
Youll be calling a trick cause youll no longer sleep  
Ill dress nice Ill look good Ill go dancing alone  
Ill laugh Ill get drunk Ill take somebody home  
  
Chorus  
I think Ive finally had enough I think I maybe think too much  
I think this might be it for us blow me one last kiss  
You think Im just too serious I think youre full of shit  
My head is spinning so blow me one last kiss  
Just when I think it cant get worse I had a shit day no  
You had a shit day no weve had a shit day no  
I think that lifes too short for this Ill pack my ignorance and bliss  
I think Ive had enough of this blow me one last kiss  
  
Bridge  
Blow me one last kiss  
I will do what I please anything that I want  
I will breathe I wont breathe I wont worry at all  
You will pay for your sins youll be sorry my dear  
All the lies all the wise will be crystal clear  
  
Chorus  
I think Ive finally had enough I think I maybe think too much  
I think this might be it for us blow me one last kiss  
You think Im just too serious I think youre full of shit  
My head is spinning so blow me one last kiss  
Just when I think it cant get worse I had a shit day no  
You had a shit day no weve had a shit day no  
I think that lifes too short for this Ill pack my ignorance and bliss  
I think Ive had enough of this blow me on last kiss  
  
Blow me one last kiss  
Blow me one last kiss  
  
Just when I think it cant get worse I had a sht day no  
You had a sht day no weve had a sht day no  
I think that lifes too short for this Ill pack my ignorance and bliss
