Im a workaholic even on  
Friday afternoons  
Snatchin up a taxi is easy and I jump right in  
Ive got my eye on you  
  
The taxi driver looks to me and says Where to  
Oh just kinda over there  
The bad economys a problem closing  
Please watch out for the door  
  
Riding on the wind Climbing up to the moon  
My place is here right next to you  
The problem is its hard to go home  
Admist the dreamy spring night  
  
Traveling with you  
Traveling onward  
Lighting up the asphalt In the asphalt blazing up a trail  
Traveling where  
Traveling are you going  
To anywhere far  
  
Traveling beyond  
Traveling get down shake it  
Let the light shine away all your troubles  
Traveling lets fly now  
Traveling speed up  
Even though were not in a hurry  
  
Ta ta are you Ta ta are you Ta ta are you Ta ta are you Ta ta are you Ta
ta are you Ta ta are you  
Oooh Woa  
Ta ta are you Ta ta are you Ta ta are you Ta ta are you Ta ta are you Ta

Theres a song and I want to sing it  
Over and over again  
So I can spur my feelings on until they wont stop  
Thats the plan  
  
Partying with the waves Thanking the clouds  
I finally met you  
Because were young  
Nothing more than dust blowing in the wind  
  
Traveling our hearts  
Traveling press closer  
Now and forever lets abandon the usual  
Traveling this place is  
Traveling shabby  
Our destination is not here  
  
Traveling Your window  
Traveling open it  
Theres nothing to fear  
Traveling here  
Traveling all is well  
Everything weve got is in our hearts  
  
This is the time to dance and have fun  
Dont hold it back tonight  
The hidden wishes in your heart are gonna hurt you  
Put up your hands and have some fun  
And why does  
Some wariness remain  
  
Traveling with you  
Traveling still  
In the asphalt blazing a trail  
Traveling where  
Traveling are you  
The good times are about to begin  
  
Traveling lets fly now  
Traveling shake it  
Let the light shine away all your troubles  
Traveling lets fly now  
Traveling speed up  
I dont want to stop  
  
Can you take me up  
You look quite good  
Can you keep it up

Can you take me up  
You look quite good  
Can you keep it up
