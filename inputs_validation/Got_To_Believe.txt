Take me to your heart  
Show me where to start  
Let me play the part of your first love  
All the stars are right  
Every wish is ours tonight my love  
  
Maybe those who wait  
Trust in love to fate  
Findin out to late where they lost it  
Never letting go  
They will never know the ways of love  
  
Chorus  
You got to believe in magic  
Tell me how do people find each other  
In a world thats full of strangers  
You got to believe in magic  
Something stronger than the moon above  
Cos its magic when two people fall in love  
  
I may never know  
Why I need you so  
All that is to know is this feeling  
Handle it with care  
We were born to share this dream my love  
  
Chorus  
  
Times on our side  
And we always cross our ways  
I guess were meant to stay  
Dont take the magic away  
  
You got to believe in magic2x  
  
Chorus  
  
Got to believe uvvjvcfd
