On the city streets I got the tunes in my pocket  
Ill play the Chili Pepper so the public can rock  
Excuse me mister wont you hear my thought  
I play in a band yeah were called the Red Hots  
While Im away boy Im afraid not  
Ive got no time to flick and talk  
But this baby rocked out on the spot  
She was a shakin and a kickin and that did a bit of tot  
Her pop said no but I just couldnt stop  
The killer had a case of tod the rock  
  
But heres a funky fact that I know is real  
The Red Hots have baby appeal  
They dig a funky spiel theyll make some spiel  
I say the Peppers have baby appeal  
The funk mobile is the one we wheel  
Im overjoyed we have baby appeal  
We serve those tots in the funk mobile  
Im overjoyed we have baby appeal  
  
We stop the fire we quench the heat  
We groove the buttocks walking out in the street  
cos thats when in the store when who do we meet  
On a hop skip jump up a baby beat  
She was a shakin and a kickin those itty bitty feet  
The next thing you know was she got out of her bleat  
Five thousand babies walkin out in the street  
Well thats a serious sight for me and golly gee wizz  
I just cant tell ya how much we did  
Rockin right out for those itty bitty girls right out  
  
But heres a funky fact that I know is real  
The Red Hots have baby appeal  
They dig a funky spiel theyll make some spiel  
I say the Peppers have baby appeal  
The funk mobile is the one we wheel  
Im overjoyed we have baby appeal  
We serve those tots in the funk mobile  
Im overjoyed we have baby appeal so get down
