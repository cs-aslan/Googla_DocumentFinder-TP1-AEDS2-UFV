Never give your heart  
  
Baby baby dont you hurt me  
Dont you say youve got to go  
Dont you threaten to desert me  
Is it something I should know  
First you tell me its the real thing  
Then you say you just dont know  
  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Never tell yourself that youll make them stay  
Put away your heart for another day  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
  
All the heartache that weve been through  
That means nothing to you now  
You cant come up with a reason  
Cant explain it anyhow  
Only leave me with a meaning  
Im not asking for your vow  
So nice  
So fine  
One day going to make you mine  
Some day  
Could be  
Youll know what you mean to me  
  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Theres nothing you can do that will make them stay  
Stop them moving on on another day  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
  
Save a little love  
Save a little love  
Save a little love  
For a rainy day  
Save a little love  
Ha ha  
  
So nice  
So fine  
One day maybe make you mine  
Some day  
Well see  
Youll know what you mean to me  
  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Passing like a kiss on a holiday  
Save a little love for another day  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Theres nothing you can do that will make them stay  
Stop them moving on on another day  
  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Never tell yourself that youll make them stay  
Put away your heart for another day  
Never give your heart to a runaway
