Taken in by the delicate noise  
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder  
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice  
Wandering around in silent wonder  
  
What chance did I have  
With the silver moon  
Hanging in the sky  
Opening old wounds  
  
Taking hold of the hem of your dress  
Cleanliness only comes in small doses  
Bodily whole but my heads in a mess  
Fueling obsession that borders psychosis  
  
Its a sad disease  
Creeping through my mind  
Causing disabilities  
Of the strangest kind  
  
Getting lost in the folds of your skirt  
Theres a price that I pay for my mission  
A body in heaven and a mind full of dirt  
How I suffer the sweetest condition  
  
Taken in by the delicate noise  
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder  
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice  
Wandering around in silent wonder
