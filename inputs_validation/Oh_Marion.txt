The boys got brains  
He just dont use em thats all  
The boys got brains  
He just refuse to use em and thats all  
He said the more I got to thinkin  
The less I tend to laugh  
The boys got brains  
He just abstains  
The boys got a heart  
But it beats on the opposite side  
Its a strange phenomenon  
The laws of nature defied  
He said its a chance I had to take  
So I shifted my heart for its safety sake  
The boys got a heart but it beats on  
His opposite side  
Oh marion  
I think Im in trouble here  
I should have believed you  
When I heard you saying it  
The only time  
That love is an easy game  
Is when two other people  
Are playing it  
The boys got a voice  
But the voice is his natural disguise  
Yes the boys got a voice  
But his words dont connect to his eyes  
He says oh but when I sing  
I can hear the truth auditioning  
The boys got a voice  
But the voice is natural
