You want what you think you need  
But what you really need isnt anything  
That you want  
You think that youve got it made but  
Its what you dont know that is gonna  
Pull you down down down  
  
Its not for free  
No  
Its not for free  
No  
  
You want what you think you need  
But what you really need isnt anything  
That you want  
Stand back  
Take a step aside take a look at yourself  
Put away your stupid pride  
Its not for free  
No  
Its not for free
