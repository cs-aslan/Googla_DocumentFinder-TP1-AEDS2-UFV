Im so fucking sick  
Im the king of the world  
Im a genius of useless stuff  
Some people they gotta work  
Well I just hang around  
Dreaming up useless stuff  
So if I call you from time to time  
I said my life is such a drag  
I feel like a hag please shut me up  
Girl would you like to live my life  
And Ill be with you tonight  
Ill be your useless stuff  
Now everybody wants to be our friend  
So we act real Zen  
And hang around with movie stars  
So if I call you from time to time  
I said my life is such a drag  
I feel like a hag kick me in the ass  
Girl would you like to live my life  
And Ill be with you tonight  
Ill be your useless stuff  
Ill be your useless stuff  
Can I be your useless stuff
