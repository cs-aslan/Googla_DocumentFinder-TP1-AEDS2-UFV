So Im letting it go again  
Im halfway full on  
Left my meds on the sink today  
My head will be racing by lunchtime  
  
So Im holding her hand again  
My palm sweats  
Hold on  
Think Ive had too much coffee  
Im manic as hell  
But Im goin strong  
Left my meds on the sink again  
My head will be racing by lunchtime  
  
Dont sleep behind the wheel at the stoplight  
Cant sleep behind the wheel as youre drivin home  
  
You keep comin down the hill as youre fallin  
You keep fallin from the hill as youre comin down
