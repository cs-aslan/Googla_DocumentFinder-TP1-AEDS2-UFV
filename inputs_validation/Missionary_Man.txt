Well I was born an original sinner  
I was borne from original sin  
And if I had a dollar bill  
For all the things Ive done  
Thered be a mountain of money  
Piled up to my chin  
  
My mother told me good  
My mother told me strong  
She said Be true to yourself  
And you cant go wrong  
But theres just one thing  
That you must understand  
You can fool with your brother  
But dont mess with a missionary man  
  
Dont mess with a missionary man  
Dont mess with a missionary man  
  
Well the missionary man  
Hes got god on his side  
Hes got the saints and apostles  
Backin up from behind  
Black eyed looks from those bible books  
Hes a man with a mission  
Got a serious mind  
There was a woman in the jungle  
And a monkey on a tree  
The missionary man he was followin me  
He said Stop what youre doing  
Get down upon your knees  
Ive a message for you that you better believe
