Cascades of gentle touch  
Her passion blinding my eyes  
Ill find Ill lose myself  
Drowning from her colorful sky  
Im aware of her grace  
Those careless kisses  
  
Tattered on a sacred place  
Shes a mystery  
Shes mine  
Wonderin if she loves me  
Shes a mystery  
So fine  
Shes a sweet confusion  
  
Shes my zen my home  
My only ShangriLa  
Shes my French champagne  
Shes my ooh la la  
  
Tattered on a sacred place  
Shes a mystery  
Shes mine  
Wonderin if she loves me  
Shes a mystery  
So fine  
Shes a sweet confusion  
  
Like a gentle wind she moves  
Her fascination I desire  
Shes a butterfly  
Shes a Mona Lisa smile  
  
Tattered on a sacred place  
Shes a mystery  
Shes mine  
Wonderin if she loves me  
Shes a mystery  
So fine  
Shes a sweet confusion  
  
Id give her all the time  
If shes feeling so fine yeah  
In and out of my life  
Shes a mystery yeah yeah yeah
