Well I think its fine building jumbo planes  
Or takin a ride on a cosmic train  
Switch on summer from a slot machine  
Get what you want to if you want  
Cause you can get anything  
  
I know weve come a long way  
Were changin day to day  
But tell me  
Where do the children play  
  
Well you roll on roads over fresh green grass  
For your lorryloads pumping petrol gas  
And you make them long and you make them tough  
But they just go on and on  
And it seems you cant get off  
  
Oh I know weve come a long way  
Were changin day to day  
But tell me  
Where do the children play  
  
When you crack the sky scrapers fill the air  
Will you keep on building higher  
Til theres no more room up there  
Will you make us laugh will you make us cry  
Will you tell us when to live  
Will you tell us when to die  
  
I know weve come a long way  
Were changin day to day  
But tell me  
Where do the children play
