Pumpin the blood through the heart of New Orleans  
Shes the mystic heat of the Bourbon street dream  
Shes just made out of flesh and bones  
  
But let me tell you little boy  
You better leave her alone  
Leroy Brown thought he was bad too  
Till she left him floatin in the old bayou  
  
Shes the kind of girl  
Shes built like a bomb  
Shes the blackeyed blackeyed  
Blackeyed blond get down  
  
That blackeyed beauty with the golden crotch  
French electric sex a cock shocking swamp fox  
Heaten queen of sleeze shes hot to box  
  
But let me tell you little boy  
Shell clean your clock  
A slick and sly spy  
Stuck in the muck of the moat  
  
Blew his mind to find a diamond in the boat  
Doubleodooms day for Mr James Bond  
Shes the blackeyed blackeyed  
Blackeyed blond Get down
