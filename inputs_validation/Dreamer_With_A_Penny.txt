Id rather be a dreamer with a penny  
Than a rich man with a worried mind  
Here I am with wealth untold  
The moonlight is my silver the sunshine is my gold  
Id rather have a shanty filled with laughter  
Than a palace someones tears designed  
Lady luck and I keep walking hand in glove  
Got a gal who loves me for nothing but my love  
Id rather be a dreamer with a penny  
Than a rich man with a worried mind  
Id rather have a shanty filled with laughter  
Than a palace someones tears designed  
Lady luck and I keep walking hand in glove  
Got a gal who loves me for nothing but my love  
Id rather be a dreamer with a penny  
Than a rich man with a worried mind
