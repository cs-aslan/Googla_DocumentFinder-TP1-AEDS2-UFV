Kool Keith  
Yo Don  
I got a white mask  
A black cape two pair of silver gloves  
And nobody know who I am  
I will not take my mask off to reveal  
Check it out but Ima drop lyrics  
You know what Hit it  
  
Yo niggaz want to get in the backdoor but fuck it  
Rappers cant rap a lick chompin on other dick  
I gotta do this for X and make them brothers quit  
Dont try that sissy shit that gettin busy shit  
I bang a nail up in your dooty hole and booty quick  
Rappers know me Im bugged I chop your ass right  
Take that body and bag it then Im out of sight  
I got the FBI not the FOI  
Tryin to find the design and  went underline  
The pure facts on the stupid wicked wax  
People they know Im out the hospital  
Cold buggin and illin like Dr Doolittle  
You better walk up the street now look around black  
  
See that man on the street whos at the corner yea 8X  
Back to hell to the graveyard  
With fog on the street you see the Ghostrider home piss  
I walk down on your block and see you sleepin  
Cold jump in your bed and fuck you up yea yea  
Down with the X Im at the basement  
Got the body and bag up on the pavement  
Cement I went just hid em in the vent  
I put the rappers upstairs and let em air out  
Before the cops came I cleaned the blood up  
I called detectives in town and said yo whattup  
I wasnt home  somebodys in my house  
I took them rappers back out up in a pickup truck  
Think Id tell on myself  
  
See that man on the street whos at the corner yea 10X  
Yeah  
Im not gon reveal myself  
Still standing here with this black cape on  
White gloves these big silver boots  
Aint nobody notice
