Five hundred will buy you a stack  
Bet it on the red or the black and you lose  
Bet on the blues  
You tell me you are a gambling man  
Try to beat the house if you can and you lose  
Bet on the blues  
If youre looking to get an inside slant  
If youre looking for something so good you cant refuse  
Bet on the blues  
Find a man who thinks hes over the hump  
And Im here to tell you hes a kind of a chump you can use  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
Lucky old sun is shining today  
Even money says youll be paying some dues  
Bet on the blues  
You say you found your lady fair  
Eight to five says shes wearing her traveling shoes  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues bet on the blues  
Five hundred will buy you a stack  
Bet it all on the red or the black and you lose  
Bet on the blues  
If youre looking to get an inside slant  
If youre looking for something so good you cant refuse  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
You better bet on the blues
