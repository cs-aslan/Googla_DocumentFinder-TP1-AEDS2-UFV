Hey the people are worried in every town  
Why their main street mamas hangin around  
They followed me back to Tennessee  
They picked up on my rock n roll beat yeah  
  
Hey the piedpied piper sings his song  
Now all of you chicks better move along  
Get some life oh baby in your bones  
Tennessee well Im abringin em home  
  
Hey we know that the old folks hang too low  
To get out here and do the rock n roll  
Theyre just a little stubborn settin their way  
But theyre agonna dig this beat some day  
  
Hey the piedpied pipers ramblin round  
Cleanin them chicks out of every town  
And man them chicks are diggin that sound  
Pickin em up lawdy puttin em down
