Well I see you standin there  
With your finger in the air  
Evrything we do  
You want to leave it up to you  
  
Who do you think you are  
You think you are a star  
Tryn to run the town  
Always tryn to put us down  
  
Well you think that youre right  
You think youre out of sight  
Tell me something mister  
Whyd you have to make us so uptight  
  
Well you say youve been tryn  
You know that youre lyn  
I think you need some groovin  
Who do you think youre foolin now  
  
Well you better start changin  
You life needs rearrangin  
You better do some talkin  
Or you better do some walkin now  
  
Yeah you think that youre right  
You think youre out of sight  
Tell me something mister  
Whyd you have to make us so uptight  
  
I know what youre doing  
All that you been doin wrong  
I dont know what youre feelin  
Oh but you been feelin long  
  
Well you think that youre right  
Tell me something mister  
Whyd you have to make us so uptight
