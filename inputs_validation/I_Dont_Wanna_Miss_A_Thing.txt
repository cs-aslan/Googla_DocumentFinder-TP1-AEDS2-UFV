I could stay awake just to hear you breathing  
Watch you smile while you are sleeping  
While youre far away and dreaming  
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender  
I could stay lost in this moment forever  
When every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure  
  
Chorus  
I Dont wanna close my eyes I dont wanna fall asleep  
Cause Id miss you baby and I dont wanna miss a thing  
Cause even when I dream of you the sweetest dream would never do  
Id still miss you baby and I dont wanna miss a thing  
  
Lying close to you feeling your heart beating  
And I wonder what youre dreamin wonderin if its me youre seeing  
And then I kiss youre eyes and thank God were together  
I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever forever and ever  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont wanna miss one smile  
I dont wanna miss one kiss  
I just wanna be with you  
Right here with you Just like this  
I just wanna hold you close  
And feel your heart so close to mine  
And just stay here in this moment for all the rest of time yeah ah ah ah ah  
  
Chorus x3
