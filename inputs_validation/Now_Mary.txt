Now Mary  
Cant you find a way  
To bring me down  
  
Im so sorry  
That I had to go  
And let you down  
  
Knowing you Ill think  
Things are gonna be fine  
But then again youll  
Probably change your mind  
  
Im sorry Mary but  
Being your mate  
Means trying to find something  
That you arent going to hate  
  
What a season  
To be beautiful  
Without a reason  
  
Knowing you Ill think  
Things are gonna be fine  
But then again youll  
Probably change your mind  
  
Mary  
Cant you find a way  
To bring me down
