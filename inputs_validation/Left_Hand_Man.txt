Seems they got a runaround a runaround where they stand  
All over yeah all over you  
Think they got an underground an underground where they plan  
Right under yeah right under you  
Think you get the left hand  
Backhand slap then youre going to do your living on the downside  
  
God cant hear when I call  
And God cant know just when I fall  
God cant see where I stand  
So God cant be my left hand man  
All I have is hatred when the fire fills my eye  
Right under yeah right under me  
And all I have is fate when the numbers fill the sky  
Right over yeah right over me  
Think Ill use the left hand  
  
Am I spent laidout got no more to see  
With a locked down tight clamp all over me  
No love just like before am I one more no more  
Have I crashed crashed and burned  
Have I cashed in not to return  
Have I taken taken my last ride  
Do you feel what I feel inside  
Over over and done  
Well I found something that I cant outrun  
Watching waiting open the door  
Am I one more no more
