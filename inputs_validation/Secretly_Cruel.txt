I saw my pictures hangin on her wall  
She cut it out of that magazine  
It was a hot day she wore lingerie  
And nothin else in between ooh  
She had long hair and thigh high snake skin boots  
And she was all over me like a cheap suit  
Then she bared herself aha  
And stripped my soul  
Began to shake rattle and roll  
Then I took control yeah  
  
But I know shes secretly cruel  
I aint nobodys fool  
Yeah I know shes secretly cruel  
Just when I though it was safe  
She puts her lips to my face  
Shes secretly secretly cruel  
  
Well she grabbed my hair  
And I began to rise  
I could tell what she wanted  
By that look in her eyes oh ow  
By that look in her eyes yeah  
I said Come here babe and make it quick  
She said Not so fast  
And had a drink  
  
Well it aint just luck  
But I better knock on wood  
Shes gonna give me everything  
Somehow I knew she would  
  
Oh but I know shes secretly cruel  
I aint nobodys fool  
Well I know shes secretly cruel  
I said baby youre the fire but I am the fuel  
Shes secretly secretly cruel  
Yeah so cruel  
  
Well it aint just luck aint just luck  
But I better knock on wood yeah  
Shes gonna give me everything  
Somehow I knew she would  
  
Oh but I know shes secretly cruel  
I aint nobodys fool nobodys fool  
Secretly shes so cruel cruel  
Im in love but I dont play the fool  
Secretly shes so cruel secretly so cruel
