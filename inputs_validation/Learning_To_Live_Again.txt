I burned my hand I cut my face  
Heaven knows how long its been  
Since Ive felt so out of place  
Im wonderin if Ill fit in  
  
Debbie and Charley said theyd be here by nine  
And Deb said she might bring a friend  
Just my luck theyre right on time  
So here I go again  
  
Im gonna smile my best smile  
And Im gonna laugh like its going out of style  
Look into her eyes and pray that she dont see  
That learning to live again is killing me  
  
Little cafe table for four  
But theres just conversation for three  
I like the way she let me get the door  
I wonder what she thinks of me  
  
Debbie just whispered Youre doin fine  
And I wish that I felt the same  
Shes asked me to dance now her hands in mine  
Oh my god Ive forgotten her name  
  
But Im gonna smile my best smile  
And Im gonna laugh like its going out of style  
Look into her eyes and pray that she dont see  
That learning to live again is killing me  
  
Now here we are beneath her porch light  
And I say what a great time its been  
A kiss on the cheek a whisper goodnight  
And I say can I see you again  
  
And she just smiles her best smile  
And she laughs like its going out of style  
Looks into my eyes and says Well see  
Oh this learning to live again is killing me  
God this learning to live again is killing me
