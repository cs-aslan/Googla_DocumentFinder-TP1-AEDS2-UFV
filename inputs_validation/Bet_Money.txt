Break a line to a bunch of dimes then you grind up  
Money got me sure my ass cant even hold my pants up  
Twenty niggas standing on the flat all getting off  
Found a jacket get em bro late with his head soft  
Try me in the six Ima raise this forty five up  
Shave a brick put it back together thats a lineup  
We mix the chick use a little cut thats a temp fade  
And if he got a chopper never ever bring a switchblade  
  
Im a multimillionaire I got a couple hundred on me  
And no more mac I told the scrap I make you stick yourself like Tony  
I give a nigga my whole stash if he can take this jewelry off me  
And Im so bossy in my altar smoking kush and sipping coffee  
Walk walk walk  
  
They said I couldnt get rich I hid that money pick up that money  
All that sideline talk dont make no money  
Bout that bread yall niggas out here too funny yall niggas too funny  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money she broke  
They said I couldnt get rich I hid that money I did it  
All that sideline talk dont make no money yall niggas out crocked  
Bout that bread yall niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money  
  
Money is a motto if you speak it then Im with ya  
Any sideline nigga they get cropped out the picture  
If you ask me yeah Im ready got your hoe on a mission  
Catch me running through your city like a damn politician  
Boy Im all about a chick  
She dont ask no questions boy she all about the nig  
Say she want to crash so I let my partners rip  
Looking at this nigga that stay flyer than a jet  
They dont hear me yet

You know yall nigga on the go  
Gotta have that green light gumby

On the clock monday through sunday  
Everyday gotta get that money  
And I learned that from the big homie  
  
They said I couldnt get rich I hid that money pick up that money  
All that sideline talk dont make no money  
Bout that bread yall niggas out here too funny yall niggas too funny  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money she broke  
They said I couldnt get rich I hid that money I did it  
All that sideline talk dont make no money yall niggas out crocked  
Bout that bread yall niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money

Then get lost cause when you said youd never cross me then you crossed me  
And these hoes count the vapors like biz marquee  
Its since they brought me these keys niggas idolize me  
Critics criticize me haters sabotage me  
I get angry then I cut through whoever camouflaged veep  
Better workers thats my killers aint gonna jeopardize me  
I know these fuck niggas with they could paralyze me  
Walk walk walk  
  
They said I couldnt get rich I hid that money pick up that money  
All that sideline talk dont make no money  
Bout that bread yall niggas out here too funny yall niggas too funny  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money she broke  
They said I couldnt get rich I hid that money I did it  
All that sideline talk dont make no money yall niggas out crocked  
Bout that bread yall niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money
