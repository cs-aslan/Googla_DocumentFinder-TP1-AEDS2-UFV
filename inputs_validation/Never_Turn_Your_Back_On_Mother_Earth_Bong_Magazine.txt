When shes on her best behaiviour  
Dont be tempted by her favours  
Never turn your back on mother earth  
Towns are hurled from A to B  
By hands that looked so smooth to me  
Never turn your back on mother earth  
Grasp at straws that dont want grasping  
Gaze at clouds that come down crashing  
Never turn your back on mother earth  
Three days and two nights away from my friends  
Amen to anything that brings a quick return  
To my friends  
To my friends  
Never turn your back on mother earth  
Ill admit I was unfaithful  
But from now Ill be more faithful  
Never turn your back on mother  
Never turn your back on mother  
Never turn your back on mother earth
