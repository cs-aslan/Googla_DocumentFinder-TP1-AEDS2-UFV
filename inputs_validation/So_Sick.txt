Gotta change my answering machine now that Im alone  
Cause right now it says that We cant come to the phone  
And I know it makes no sense cause you walked out the door  
But its the only way I hear your voice anymore  
  
Its ridiculous  
Its been months and for some reason I just  
Cant get over us  
And Im stronger than this  
  
Enough is enough  
No more walking round with my head down  
Im so over being blue crying over you  
  
And Im so sick of love songs so tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said Im so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why cant I turn off the radio  
  
Gotta fix that calendar I have thats marked July 15th  
Because since theres no more you theres no more anniversary  
Im so fed up with my thoughts of you and your memory  
And now every song reminds me of what used to be  
  
Thats the reason Im  
So sick of love songs so tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said Im so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why cant I turn off the radio  
  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
Stupid love songs  
Dont make me think about her smile  
Or having my first child  
Let it go  
Turning off the radio  
  
Cause Im so sick of love songs so tired of tears  
So done with wishing she was still here  
Said Im so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why cant I turn off the radio  
  
Said Im so sick of love songs so tired of tears  
So done with wishing she was still here  
Said Im so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
Why cant I turn off the radio  
Why cant I turn off the radio  
  
And Im so sick of love songs so tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said Im so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
Why cant I turn off the radio  
Why cant I turn off the radio  
Why cant I turn off the radio
