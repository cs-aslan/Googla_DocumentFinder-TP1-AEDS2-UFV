Oh  
Mm  
  
I am thinking of you  
In my sleepless solitude tonight  
If its wrong to love you  
Then my heart just wont let me be right  
Cause Ive drowned in you  
And I wont pull through  
Without you by my side  
  
Id give my all to have  
Just one more night with you  
Id risk my life to feel  
Your body next to mine  
Cause I cant go on  
Living in the memory of our song  
Id give my all for your love tonight  
  
Baby can you feel me  
Imagining Im looking in your eyes  
I can see you clearly  
Vividly emblazoned in my mind  
And yet youre so far  
Like a distant star  
Im wishing on tonight  
  
Id give my all to have  
Just one more night with you  
Id risk my life to feel  
Your body next to mine  
Cause I cant go on  
Living in the memory of our song  
Id give my all for your love tonight  
  
Id give my all to have  
Just one more night with you  
Id risk my life to feel  
Your body next to mine  
Cause I cant go on  
Living in the memory of our song  
Id give my all for your love tonight  
Id give my all for your love  
Tonight
