Help I need somebody  
Help Not just anybody  
Help You know I need someone help  
  
When I was younger so much younger than today  
I never needed anybodys help in any way  
But now these days are gone Im not so self assured  
Now I find Ive changed my mind Ive opened up the doors  
  
Help me if you can Im feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being around  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Wont you please please help me  
  
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways  
My independence seems to vanish in the haze  
But evry now and then I feel so insecure  
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before  
  
Help me if you can Im feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being around  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Wont you please please help me
