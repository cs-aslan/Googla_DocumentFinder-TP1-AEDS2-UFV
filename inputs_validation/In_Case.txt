Pictures in my pocket  
Are faded from the washer  
I can barely just make out your face  
Food you saved for later  
In my refrigerator  
Its been too long since later never came  
  
I know  
One day eventually  
Yeah I know  
One day Ill have to let it all go  
But I keep it just in case  
Yeah I keep it just in case  
  
In case  
You dont find what youre looking for  
In case  
Youre missing what you had before  
In case  
You change your mind Ill be waiting here  
In case  
You just want to come home  
  
Strong enough to leave you  
But weak enough to need you  
Cared enough to let you walk away  
I took that dirty jacket  
From the trash right where you left it  
Cause I couldnt stand to see it go to waste  
  
I know  
One day eventually  
Yeah I know  
One day Ill have to let it all go  
But I keep it just in case  
Yeah I keep it just in case  
  
In case  
You dont find what youre looking for  
In case  
Youre missing what you had before  
In case  
You change your mind Ill be waiting here  
In case  
You just want to come home  
In case  
  
Youre looking in that mirror one day  
And miss my arms  
How they wrapped around your waist  
I say that you can love me again  
Even if it isnt the case  
  
Ohh  
You dont find what youre looking for  
Ohh  
Youre missing my love  
You dont find what youre looking for  
In case  
Youre missing what you had before  
In case  
You change your mind Ill be waiting here  
In case  
You just want to come home  
In case  
Yeah ooh
