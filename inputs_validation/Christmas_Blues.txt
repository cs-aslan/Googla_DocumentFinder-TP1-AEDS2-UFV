The jingle bells are jingling  
The streets  
Are white with snow  
The happy crowds are mingling  
But theres no one that I know  
  
Im sure that youll forgive me  
If I dont enthuse  
I guess  
Ive got the Christmas blues  
  
Ive done my window shopping  
Theres not a store Ive missed  
But whats the use of stopping  
When theres no one on your list  
  
Youll know the way Im feeling  
When you love and you lose  
I guess  
Ive got the Christmas blues  
  
When somebody wants you  
Somebody needs you  
Christmas is a joy of joys  
But friends when youre lonely  
Youll find that its only  
A thing for little girls  
And little boys  
  
May all your days be merry  
Your seasons full of cheer  
But til its January  
Ill just go and disappear  
Oh Santa  
May have brought you  
Some stars for your shoes  
  
But Santa only brought me  
The blues  
Those brightly packaged  
Tinsel covered  
Christmas blues  
  
Oh Santa  
May have brought you  
Some stars for your shoes  
But Santa only brought me  
The blues  
Those brightly packaged  
Tinsel covered  
Christmas blues
