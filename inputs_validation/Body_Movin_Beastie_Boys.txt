Body movin body movin  
A1 sound sound so soothin  
Body movin body movin  
We be gettin down and you know were crush groovin  
  
Let me get some action from the back section  
We need body rockin not perfection  
Let your backbone flip but dont slip a disc  
Let your spine unwind just take a risk  
I wanna do the freak until the break of dawn  
Tell me party people is that so wrong  
The ship is dockin interlockin  
And uprockin electroshockin  
Were getting down computer action  
Do the robotic satisfaction  
All of yall get off the wall  
Have a ball and get involved with  
  
Body movin body movin  
With the A1 sound sound so soothin  
Body movin body movin  
We be gettin down and you know were crush groovin  
  
Flame on Im gone  
Im so sweet like a nice bon bon  
Came out rappin when I was born  
Mom said Rock it til the break of dawn  
Puttin bodies in motion cause I got the notion  
Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion  
  
The sound of the music drivin you insane  
You cant explain to people this type of mind frame  
Like a bottle of Chateau Neuf de Papsic  
Im fine like wine when I start to rap  
We need body rockin not perfection  
Let me get some action from the back section  
  
Body movin body movin  
A1 sound sound so soothin  
Body movin body movin  
We be gettin down and you know were crush groovin  
  
Mike D with the master plan  
Ooh my my and thank you maam  
And when I grab the mic you scream ooh goddamn  
The creme de la creme is who I am  
Mca where have you been  
Packed like sardines in the tin  
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins  
Cause when it comes to quarries Im known to swim  
Adrock light up the place  
And if you pull my card you pull the ace  
And if you ask me turn up the bass  
And if you play Defender I could be your hyperspace  
  
Body movin body movin  
A1 sound sound so soothin  
Body movin body movin  
We be gettin down and you know were crush groovin
