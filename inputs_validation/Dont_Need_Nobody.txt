Verse 1  
Ive been too numb to understand  
Im just a victim of the weapon in my hand  
So many casualties of love  
But Ive been bulletproof Im staring at the sun  
  
PreChorus  
I was the one you took home  
Never a flame to burn slow  
But I was hoping youd see me a different way  
So many bodies Ive touched  
Crushing around me like dust  
You are the realest thing Ive never had to fake  
  
Chorus  
I dont need nobody need nobody but  
I dont need nobody need nobody but you  
I dont need nobody need nobody but you  
I dont need nobody need nobody but you  
  
Verse 2  
Im just so used to emptiness  
Cant feel your heartbeat when Im lying on your chest  
Youre different from the ones before  
I know you dont believe its you Ive waited for  
  
PreChorus  
I was the one you took home  
Never a flame to burn slow  
But I was hoping youd see me a different way  
So many bodies Ive touched  
Crushing around me like dust  
You are the realest thing Ive never had to fake  
  
Chorus  
I dont need nobody need nobody but  
I dont need nobody need nobody but you  
I dont need nobody need nobody but you  
I dont need nobody need nobody but you  
  
Bridge  
But I was hoping youd see me a different way  
You are the realest thing Ive never had to fake  
  
Chorus  
I dont need nobody need nobody but  
I dont need nobody need nobody but you  
I dont need nobody need nobody but you  
I dont need nobody need nobody but you
