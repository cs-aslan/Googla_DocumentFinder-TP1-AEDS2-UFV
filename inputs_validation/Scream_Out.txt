123 go  
  
Well all my life its been the same  
Me I cannot afford your fear of pain  
My frustration it needs release  
Cut me open and hear me breath  
Playing punk keeps me sane  
Dont need drugs to numb the pain  
It keeps me alive  
I hope it helps you  
Do you think I want to let America ruin me  
No way  
  
Im screaming out somebody listen  
It feels so good to share my pain  
Im screaming out somebody listen  
It feels so good to share my pain  
  
Well I lost control and hurt myself  
I knew deep down that I needed some help  
This self abuse it would not stop  
No matter how hard I tried  
So I ran away from here  
And I pulled myself together  
Am I going insane think again  
I got so fed up with being unstable  
No more  
  
Im screaming out somebody listen  
It feels so good to share my pain  
It feels so good to share my pain  
It feels so good to share my pain  
It feels so good to share my pain  
  
Im screaming out somebody listen  
It feels so good to share my pain  
It feels so good to share my pain  
It feels so good to share my pain  
It feels so good to share my pain  
  
Im screaming out  
Im screaming out  
Im screaming out  
Im screaming out  
Im screaming out  
Im screaming out  
Im screaming out  
That I needed some help
