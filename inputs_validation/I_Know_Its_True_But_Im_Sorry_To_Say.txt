I know its true but Im sorry to say  
Yesterdays a day away  
Nothing I can do to make it stay like that  
Aint that a fact  
  
I know its true but Im sorry to say  
I just cant handle things this way  
I know its late but Id like to stay a while see you smile  
  
Will you meet me in the morning with sun fresh on the dew  
Will you meet me in the afternoon made just for me and you  
Will you meet me in the evening when the nighttime starts to crawl  
Will you meet me in the hall  
Will you meet me on the wall  
Will you meet me at all  
  
One more time one more time  
Shaking up and down my spine  
Jump a rope or skip a line or two  
What can I do  
  
One more time one more time  
Color flashing neon signs  
Advertising a friend of my distraction latest attraction  
  
Oh my body has been punished  
Lord I think Ive had enough  
Oh my body has been punished  
With too much and not enough  
Oh my body has been punished  
And my mind can no longer bluff  
My mind is so unkind my mind is so unkind  
It keeps me crying all the time  
  
I know its true but Im sorry to say  
Yesterdays a day away
