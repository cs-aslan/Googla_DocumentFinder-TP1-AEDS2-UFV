Taken to the brink of something  
Something but we cant know what  
To wait to want its so bad and  
Try something and moving to slow  
To get where you want to go  
Looking for results  
You cant begin to find a way out  
From the cold place youre in  
But it suits you your condition  
Symptoms that keep you in  
Keep you from motion  
Until its cold  
Slowing you down until you cant go  
Taken by something  
But you cant hold on to it you cant  
It slips through your fingers  
Slips through your hand  
Because theyre too cold  
Cant get a grip on whats in your sight  
Its like getting old  
Its like getting told to sit still  
But it suits you your condition  
Symptoms that keep you in  
Keep you from motion  
Until its cold  
Slowing you down until you cant go  
Its not me  
Is there something so wrong  
Process of depraving yourself  
Of peace of mind
