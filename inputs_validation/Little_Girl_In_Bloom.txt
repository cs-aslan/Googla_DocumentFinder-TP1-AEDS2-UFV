Little girl in bloom  
With happy heart you wipe aside  
Any sadness sorrow or gloom  
Tomorrow youll be a blushing bride  
That loves her blushing groom  
  
Little girl in bloom  
You watch the men play cricket  
From the window in your room  
See the ball go from bat to wicket  
Pass away the afternoon  
  
Little girl in bloom  
Carries a secret  
The child she carries in her womb  
She feels something sacred  
Shes gonna be a mammy soon  
  
When your daddy comes home  
Dont tell him till alone  
When your daddy comes back  
Go tell him the facts  
Just relax and see how hes gonna react  
  
Little girl in bloom  
All the clouds will go drifting by  
So sing your lullabying tune  
Every word is in your eyes  
As you sit and softly croon  
  
Little girl in bloom  
Your love it fills the air  
With the scent of the sweetest sweet perfume  
You feel so good you just dont care  
Youre gonna be a mammy soon  
  
When your daddy comes home  
Dont tell him till alone  
When your daddy comes back  
Go tell him the facts  
Just relax and see how hes gonna react
