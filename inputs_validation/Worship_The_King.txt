Walking down the road called life  
Thinking how my world has changed  
Since i met the saving grace  
of the man they called Jesus Christ  
  
Hes not just an ordinary guy  
He is supernatural in all ways  
Hes not just in my imagination  
He is real in everyway  
  
I will stand in awe  
I will stand in awe  
  
Worship the King of Glory  
Open up the doors lift up the gates  
The King of Glory may He enter in  
May His power fall may His glory fill  
All the earth  
  
People come and people go  
Somethings in and then its out  
One thing that remains the same  
Is the Love Ive found Jesus Christ
