My son was born about four and a half years ago  
Loved and protected him amazin how fast they grow  
I came to know about his likes and his dislikes yeah  
Video games taught him how to ride his first bike thats it  
This is the life my little nigga I see you gettin all upset  
When I leave the house poutin let me tell you about  
Tryna make it in this world and provide for you  
Cause on them overseat plane rides I miss you too  
Never knew that I would have to be away so much  
Five thousand dollar phone bills keepin in touch  
We Starskey and Hutch yeah we partners for life yeah  
I rock mics so Im sorry when I hug you if I squeeze too tight  
Long nights in the studio take me away  
Gettin mad cause Im tired and you want me to play

Xzibit  
I got a brother locked down he be out in a couple  
Knuckle for knuckle a veteran and nothin but muscle  
Now broadcastin live from behind the wall  
Stayin tight through long kites and telephone calls  
Gettin hype when you see your brother on TV  
Cant wait for your release so you can roll with me  
Arrange everything exactly how its supposed to be  
For right now heres a thousand J stay lokey  
You say damn Xzibit whynt you pay a nigga a visit  
Time limits got me movin a million miles a minute  
Knee deep gotta strike while the iron is hot  
Still gotta eat and keep the lights on when its not  
Sleepin on cots bullet wounds got you in knots  
I wish I was there to snatch you up instead of the cops  
Muthafuck it do the time and get it out of the way  
You goin from convict to corporate nigga in one day in one day  
  
Chorus  
  
Quik  
Now I aint never been this hot before  
So in essence its obvious I aint never been this out before  
Im spending 258 days 366 times a year  
Up in the studio freakin and mixin rhymes in here  
Nothin but beer bud smoke Hen and Coke women and sheer  
Callin playa niggas there  
Not the kinda place I really want to bring my son  
Get on lil Dane gon in there and have you some fun  
Used to be that  be up there sewin ya clothes
