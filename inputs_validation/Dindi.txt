Sky so vast as the sky  
With far away clouds just wandering by     
Where did they go  
Oh I dont know dont know     
Wind that speaks to the leaves  
Telling stories that no one believes     
Stories of love  
Belong to you and me     
Oh Dindi     
If I only had words  
I would say all the beautiful things that I see  
When youre with me  
Oh my Dindi  
Oh Dindi     
Like the song of the wind in the trees  
Thats how my heart is singing Dindi happy Dindi  
When youre with me  
I love you more each day  
Yes I do yes I do     
Id let you go away  
If you take me with you  
Dont you know Dindi     
Id be running an searching for you  
Like a river that cant find the sea  
That would be me without you my Dindi  
  
Dont you know Dindi     
Id be running an searching for you  
Like a river that cant find the sea  
That would be me without you my Dindi
