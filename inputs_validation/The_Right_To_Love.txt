They say were young and undecided that we should wait before we love  
But this aint no what they dinied us when they take away our right to love  
Though were not together darling youre still a part of me my love  
But time will give a flame thats burning for they took away our ight to love  
  
Hear this song and listen closely the words I got from him above  
I asked him this and hes told me were entitled to the right to love  
Youll be sad if youre unblessed that young hearts feel the meaning of  
True love they offer set us fancy theyre entitled to the right to love
