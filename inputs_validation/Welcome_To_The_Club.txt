I couldnt help but overhear you talkin to yourself  
How she slipped right through your hands  
And in between all of the four letter words  
You said youre never gonna understand  
  
You gave her everything you thought she wanted  
Now all you want is gone  
Youre just one of many broken hearted  
Wonderin what went wrong  
  
Welcome to the club  
Dont be thinkin youre the only one  
Whose heart was in a hit and run  
While you looked the other way  
As youre howlin at the moon  
Take a look around the room  
At all your fellow fools of love  
Welcome to the club  
  
Over in the corner is old Larry John  
Gettin over wife number two  
And sittin next to him is a regular here  
Theyre as lonely as me and you  
We got one thing in common when we walked in  
A memory were tryin to kill  
Swearin up and down well never try again but we know we will  
Welcome to the club  
Dont be thinkin youre the only one  
Whose heart was in a hit and run  
While you looked the other way  
As youre howlin at the moon  
Take a look around the room  
At all your fellow fools of love  
Welcome to the club  
  
Welcome to the club  
Welcome to the club  
Welcome to the club  
Welcome to the club
