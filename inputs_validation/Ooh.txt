One two  
  
Ooh Central Park  
Ooh evening skyline  
Ooh helicopter  
Ooh firecrackers  
Ooh July 4th in New York City  
  
Ooh trees are laughing  
Ooh windows smiling  
Ooh water shining  
Ooh people rolling  
Ooh July 4th in New York City  
  
I never knew we could be so nice to each other  
I never thought wed be laughing together  
I never knew life could be sweet and simple  
I never thought that was possible  
  
Ooh dogs are chasing  
Ooh clouds are dreaming  
Ooh people dancing  
Ooh July 4th in New York City  
  
I never knew we could be so kind to each other  
I never thought wed be singing together  
I never knew life could be so sweet and simple  
I never thought that was possible  
  
Ooh Central Park  
Ooh evening skyline  
Ooh helicopter  
Ooh firecrackers  
  
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh  
Ooh Ooh Ooh OohOoh  
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh  
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
