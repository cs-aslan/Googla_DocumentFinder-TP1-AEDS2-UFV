You know I wait for you  
If it takes a lifetime to do  
Girl I will wait for you  
Youre the only thing worth holding on to  
No matter how far  
Girl I cant live without my heart  
I hope you come home soon soon  
Girl I will wait for you  
If it takes a lifetime to do  
Girl I wait  
Wait wait wait for you oh  
  
Our phone calls will have to do  
Write you letters just to prove  
Youre the only thing on my mind  
Im going  
Just hold on I promise you  
Soon youll be here by my side  
But we cant stop time  
Seems like the clock is running way too fast  
And now Im feeling lost  
And I cant read your mind  
But you dont have to ask  
  
You know I wait for you  
If it takes a lifetime to do  
Girl I will wait for you  
Youre the only thing worth holding on to  
No matter how far  
Girl I cant live without my heart  
I hope you come home soon soon  
Girl I will wait for you  
If it takes a lifetime to do  
Girl I wait  
Wait wait wait for you oh
