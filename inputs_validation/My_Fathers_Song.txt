My Fathers Song  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
When I was just a little child  
Wed climb in this old family car  
And daddy would start to sing  
Before we rode very far  
I really dont remember  
If his songs were quite on key  
But that didnt matter to me  
It was my Fathers song  
CHORUS  
And he sings a song of love  
And a song of caring  
You sing it with your heart  
You sing it with your life  
And its a song of giving  
Much more than youre asked  
And knowing that  
What youve done for Christ  
Is all thats going to last  
As I grew up I heard that song  
Time and time again  
A gentle word or a tender touch  
And that song would begin  
I can hear it in his laughter  
And it moves me more and more  
I can see it in his eyes  
When he talks about the Lord  
Its my Fathers song  
And if I were the greatest musician  
Who ever walked upon a stage  
If I could sing any song I liked  
Any instrument I could play  
I wouldnt need a piano  
I wouldnt need a violin  
Id choose a heart filled with his love  
And then Id begin  
To sing my Fathers song  
His song
