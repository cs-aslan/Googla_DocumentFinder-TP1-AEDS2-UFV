Like moths to a flame  
Is man never gonna change  
Times seen untold aggression  
And infliction of pain  
If thats the only thing thats  
Stopping war  
  
Then thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
  
Nuke ya nuke ya  
  
War is just another game  
Tailor made for the insane  
But make a threat of their  
Annihilation  
And nobody wants to play  
If thats the only thing that  
Keeps the peace  
  
Then thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
  
Nuke ya nuke ya  
  
Today was tomorrow  
Yesterday  
Its funny how the time can slip  
Away  
The face of the doomsday  
Clock  
Has launched a thousand wars  
As we near the final hour  
Time is the only foe we have  
  
When war is obsolete  
Ill thank god for the wars  
To end  
But any talk about hell  
Freezing over  
Is all said with tongue in cheek  
Until the day the war drums  
Beat no more  
  
Then thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
  
Nuke ya nuke ya
