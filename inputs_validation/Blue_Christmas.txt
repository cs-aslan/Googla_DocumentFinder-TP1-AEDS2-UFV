Ill have a blue Christmas without you Ill be so blue thinking about you  
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree  
Wont mean a thing dear if youre not here with me  
Ill have a blue Christmas for certain  
And when that blue blue heartache starts hurtin  
Youll be doing alright with your Christmas of white  
But Ill have a blue blue Christmas  
 guitar   
And when those blue heartaches start hurtin  
Ill have a blue memry for certain  
Youll be doing alright  
Youll be doing alright  
But Ill have a blue blue Christmas
