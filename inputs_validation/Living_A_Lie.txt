Im living a lie because I cant tell the truth  
Theres a fire in the basement  
A fire on the roof  
Im just sitting in my chair wearing a smile  
Im going to vanish in the air after awhile  
Did did you get the news that Im lost at sea  
Hey hey somebodys confused though it couldnt be me  
I wasnt near that place  
I dont know where it was  
She didnt see my face  
You know its true because  
I know wise things  
I know about these things  
I know why it is caged  
So I dont know why Im enraged  
  
Im lying about my birth and Im lying about my death  
For all Im worth I lie with every breath  
Lying homes are built on my crying habitations  
Heres the milk that I spilt  
My undying limitations  
I know about these things I know about these things  
I know why it is caged  
So I dont know why Im enraged  
  
Always the brides maid never the bride  
Look what my brides made out of my life  
Always the brides maid never the bride  
Look what your brides made you shook my life  
Always the brides maid never the bride  
Look what your brides made and you know you shouldnt have lied
