Finally I see whats right in front of me the chance to be free  
From all the troubles that this life could bring if only we would sing  
Ive been living for tomorrow so long I cant recall the feeling I had when I
was with you  
  
Living every single day as if its my last day  
I missed the reason why Im here  
Everything is meaningless except a life that is confident in you  
That you would walk beside me in all the things I see and in all I do  
Its because of you  
  
No more living for tomorrow  
Todays the day that I will be the one to change the world  
Living every single day as if its my last day  
I know the reason I am here  
  
Finally I see whats right in front of me the chance to be free  
From all the troubles that this life could bring if only we could sing  
No more living for tomorrow  
Todays the day that I will be the one to change the world  
  
Living every single day as if its my last day  
I know the reason I am here  
No more living for tomorrow  
Todays the day that I will be the one to change the world  
  
Living every single day as if its my last day  
I know the reason for today Im living for today
