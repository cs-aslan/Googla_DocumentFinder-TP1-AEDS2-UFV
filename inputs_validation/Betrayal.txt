We met as friends of friends while still at school  
I was all you ever really knew  
When we met it was like a dream  
For all I knew we could not fail  
  
But now I know of your betrayal  
Living in the older part of town  
I worked all hours I could to bring us round  
Your career was alive for you  
  
But deep inside I watched it fail  
And now I know of your betrayal  
Your betrayal  
If only I could hold you close  
  
But now I know how love grows frail  
When I asked if youd leave me  
Or bout the boyfriends youd had  
You said youd stay with me always  
  
And that youd never be bad  
But I would notice a smile  
That you would hold within  
As if your vanity flirted  
  
With your knowledge of sin  
Now youre quiet and cold  
Your eyes just stare into space  
And if I ask you to talk  
  
You just dissemble your face  
And the smile that I hated  
Is now a frown of denial  
And thats how I know of your unspoken betrayal  
  
Oh thats how I know of your unspoken betrayal  
Now I wish that Id set you free  
But I was terrified that I would fail  
And now I know of your betrayal  
  
Your betrayal  
If only I could hold you close  
But now I know how love grows frail  
Oh now I know of your betrayal  
  
Now I know of your betrayal
