I wanna mother you smother you  
With a love youve never known  
I wanna talk to you  
Say sweet things to you  
  
Let you know that Im yours alone  
And now you need a lot of loving  
And my darlin you need it now  
Youve been alone for so long  
Youve forgotten what love is all about  
  
Let me rock you in the cradle of my arms  
And let my love protect you from all harm  
Ill be your shelter when you want me to  
Ill be your comfort when you need me to  
  
Mother you smother you  
With a love thats gentle and true  
I wanna talk to you say sweet things to you  
And my love will see you through  
  
Put your head on my shoulder  
Put your hand darling in mine  
Just let me take you in my arms  
And love away the loneliness you hide  
  
And when life sometimes gets you down  
And you feel the need to cry  
Oh Ill be standing by your side  
To be your strength and be your guide  
  
I wanna mother you smother you  
Show me what love is about  
I wanna talk to you say sweet things to you  
Take away all of your doubt  
  
Just let me mother you smother you  
With a love youve never known  
I wanna talk to you say sweet things to you  
Let me know that Im yours alone  
  
Ooh mother you smother you  
With a love that youve never known  
I wanna talk to you say sweet things to you  
Let me know that Im yours alone  
  
Mother you smother you  
With a love
