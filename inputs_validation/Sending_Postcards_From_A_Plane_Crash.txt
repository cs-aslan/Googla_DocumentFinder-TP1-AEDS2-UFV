I am such a sucker  
And Im always the last to know  
My insides are copper  
And Id kill to make them gold  
  
Conversation got me here another night alone in the city  
So make my bed the grave and shovel dirt onto my sheets  
  
Every friend we ever had in common  
I will sever the tie with you  
You can thank your lucky stars  
That everything I wish for will never come true  
  
When you go I will forget everything about you  
  
Ive seen sinking ships go down with more grace than you  
Turn this up Ill tune you out  
Another night alone in the city  
Thinking that you matter  
Thats a lie we can both keep  
  
Every friend we ever had in common  
I will sever the tie with you  
You can thank your lucky stars  
That everything I wish for will never come true  
  
When you go I will forget everything about you  
  
Every friend we ever had in common  
I will sever the tie with you  
You can thank your lucky stars  
That everything I wish for will never come true
