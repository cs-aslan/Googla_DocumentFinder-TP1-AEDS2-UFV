Remember how we used to party up all night  
Sneaking out and looking for a taste of real life  
Drinking in the small town firelight  
Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice  
  
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived  
Walking down the street as they whistle Hi hi  
Stealin police cars with the senior guys  
Teachers said wed never make it out alive  
  
There she was my new best friend  
High heels in her hands swayin in the wind  
While she starts to cry mascara runnin down her little Bambi eyes  
Lana how I hate those guys  
  
This is what makes us girls  
We dont look for heaven and we put our love first  
Dont you know wed die for it Its a curse  
Dont cry about it dont cry about it  
This is what makes us girls  
We dont stick together cause we put our love first  
Dont cry about him dont cry about him  
Its all gonna happen  
  
And thats where the beginning of the end begun  
Everybody knew that we had too much fun  
We were skippin school and drinkin on the job  
With the boss  
  
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived  
Babys table dancin at the local dive  
Cheerin our names in the pink spotlight  
Drinkin cherry schnapps in the velvet night  
  
Know we used to go break in  
to the hotel pool glittering wed swim  
Runnin from the cops in our black bikini tops  
screaming Get us while were hot  
We dont give a whaaat  
  
This is what makes us girls  
We dont look for heaven and we put our love first  
Dont you know wed die for it Its a curse  
Dont cry about it dont cry about it  
This is what makes us girls  
We dont stick together cause we put our love first  
Dont cry about him dont cry about him  
Its all gonna happen  
  
The prettiest crowd that you had ever seen  
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean  
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens  
And you know something  
  
They were the only friends I ever had  
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad  
I got sent away I was waving on the train platform  
Crying cause I know Im never comin back  
  
This is what makes us girls  
We dont look for heaven and we put our love first  
Dont you know wed die for it Its a curse  
Dont cry about it dont cry about it  
This is what makes us girls  
Darlin little queens do you know what youre worth  
Ill tell you everyday till you get it girl  
Its all gonna happen  
  
This is what makes us girls now baby  
This is why we rule the world now baby  
This is what makes us girls now baby  
Why we rule the world now baby oh  
  
This is what makes us girls now baby  
This is why we rule the world now baby  
This is what makes us girls now baby  
Why we rule the world now baby oh
