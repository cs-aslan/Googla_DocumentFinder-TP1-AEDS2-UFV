I think Im goin mad and its makin me sad  
Its a yearnin for my old back door  
I realize maybe I was born to lead better swallow my silly country pride  
  
Goin home running home down the Gasoline Alley where I started from  
Goin home and Im running home down the Gasoline Alley where I was born  
  
When the weathers better and rails unfreeze  
And the wind wont whistle round my knees  
Ill put on my weather suit and catch you in the rain  
Ill be home before the milks upon the door  
  
Goin home running home down the Gasoline Alley where I started from  
Goin home and Im running home down the Gasoline Alley where I was born  
  
But if anything should happen and my plans go wrong  
Should I stray to the house on the hill  
Let it be known that my intentions were good  
Id be singing in my alley if I could  
  
And if Im goin away and its my turn to go  
Should the blood run cold in my veins  
Just one favor Id be askin of you  
Dont bury me here its too cold  
  
Take me back carry me back down to Gasoline Alley where I started from  
Take me back wont cha carry me home down to  
Gasoline Alley where I started from  
  
Take me back carry me back down to gasoline Alley where I started from  
Take me back wont cha carry me home down to
