We all want peace we dont want misery  
So many of us wont let us be these things  
But we only are confused  
We feel stronger as we grow older  
But still we feel bemused  
  
Always asking questions  
Were always asking questions  
  
And the temptation is to just step back  
Well we give what we lack  
We will always be asking questions  
Why rich  
Why poor  
  
Always asking questions  
Were always asking questions  
  
Why this  
Why that  
Were always asking questions  
Why this  
Why that  
Always asking  
Dont stop asking  
  
Dont stop asking questions  
Always asking questions  
  
In answer to this question is just shut up  
You dont know  
I dont know  
Nobody knows  
This is an answer to every question  
This is a place to begin  
  
Always asking questions  
Always asking questions  
  
Why this  
Why that  
Why this  
Why that  
  
Always asking questions  
why this why that  
Always asking questions  
why this why that  
Always asking questions  
why this why that
