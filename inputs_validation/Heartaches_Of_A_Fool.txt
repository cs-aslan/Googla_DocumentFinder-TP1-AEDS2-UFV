Started out with the dreams  
And the plans of a wise man  
And ended up with the heartaches of a fool  
  
As a boy I would walk through the valley  
Gazed at the world all around  
Made a vow that somehow I would find fame and fortune  
I found it but look at me now  
  
I had a sweetheart who would love me forever  
Didnt need her I would reign all alone  
And look at me Im the king of cold lonely castle  
The queen of my heart is gone  
  
So get around me you fools for a dollar  
Listen to me a lesson youll learn  
Well theres happiness and love sent from heaven above  
And the fires of ambition will burn  
  
Started out with the dreams  
And the plans of a wise man  
And ended up with the heartaches of a fool
