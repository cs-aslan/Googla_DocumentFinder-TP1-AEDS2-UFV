Summer night city  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
In the sun I feel like sleeping  
I cant take it for too long  
My impatience slowly creeping  
Up my spine and going strong  
I know whats waiting there for me  
Tonight Im loose and fancy free  
Ahah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know its time to go  
Cant resist the strange attraction  
From that giant dynamo  
Lots to take and lots to give  
Time to breathe and time to live  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Its elusive call it glitter  
Somehow something turns me on  
Some folks only see the litter  
We dont miss them when theyre gone  
I love the feeling in the air  
My kind of people everywhere  
Ahah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know its time to go  
Cant resist the strange attraction  
From this giant dynamo  
And tomorrow when its dawning  
And the first birds starts to sing  
In the pale light of the morning  
Nothings worth remembering  
  
Its a dream its out of reach  
Scattered driftwood on the beach  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city
