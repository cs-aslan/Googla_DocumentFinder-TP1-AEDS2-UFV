Parking lot movie screen I cant feel anything  
Cigarette beat up tv I cant feel anything  
Now that Im  
Im in town  
I feel fine  
Fine for now  
Hang around with the people I used to be  
Hang around on a corner waiting to go have a seat  
Now that Im  
Im in town  
I feel fine  
Fine for now  
Fifty cents or a dollar three  
I dont owe you anything  
Spent a life on a heart  
That would rather not feel anything  
I can try I can see  
I can want it to be  
I can laugh I can feel  
I cant see anything without dreaming  
Its just like a dream  
I can feel  
I cant see anything that seems real  
Now that Im  
Im in town  
I feel fine  
Fine for now
