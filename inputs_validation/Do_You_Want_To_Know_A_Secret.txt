Youll never know how much I really love you  
Youll never know how much I really care  
Listen do you want to know a secret  
Do you promise not to tell woh woh woh closer  
Let me whisper in your ear  
Say the words you long to hear  
Im in love with you oo  
Ive known the secret for a week or two  
Nobody knows just we two  
Listen do you want to know a secret  
Do you promise not to tell woh woh woh closer  
Let me whisper in your ear  
Say the words you long to hear  
Im in love with you oo
