Ive got this feelin inside  
And it wont go away  
Itll take time for it to subside  
And oh by the way  
Come 2 my house  
Where we can play  
Like Im your flower  
Well hide and seek  
Then we will find  
Loves highest power  
Could you stop by for some really good beer  
Or a glass of wine  
Theres no threat theres no danger here  
If you fore go go the time  
A look in your eyes  
And you remind  
Me of my daddy  
I cant say why  
I decided tonight  
Yes you can have me  
Love will surrender  
Oh when the heart cries out  
Dont leave me standin here  
Not here not now
