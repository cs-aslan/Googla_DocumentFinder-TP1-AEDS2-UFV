Ah yeah  
Theres a red house over yonder  
Thats where my baby stays  
Lord theres a red house over yonder  
Lord thats where my baby stays  
I aint been home to see my baby  
In ninety nine and one half days  
  
Wait a minute somethings wrong here  
The key wont unlock this door  
Wait a minute somethings wrong lord have mercy  
This key wont unlock this door  
Somethings goin on here  
I have a bad bad feeling  
That my baby dont live here no more  
  
Well I might as well go back over yonder  
Way back up on the hill  
Thats something to do  
Lord I might as well go back over yonder  
Way back yonder cross the hill  
Cause if my baby dont love me no more  
I know her sister will  
Yeah
