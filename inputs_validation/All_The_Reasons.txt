When I find myself in trouble and I need someone to lean on  
I only have to call and youre right there by my side  
When I cant see all the reasons why you have to be so far away  
I wonder if your love is really here to stay  
And I cant help my feelings and I cant hide my love for you  
And Ill always believe in all the things that you want me to  
  
When youre telling me not to worry cause youre being there wont be long  
I only live in hope that you just cant be wrong  
Because I cant help my feelings and I cant hide my love for you  
And Ill always believe in all the things that you want me to  
  
And I cant help my feelings and I cant hide my love for you  
And Ill always believe in all the things that you want me to
