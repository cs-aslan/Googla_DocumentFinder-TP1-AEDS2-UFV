Maybe its much too early in the game  
Ooh but I thought Id ask you just the same  
What are you doing New Years  
New Years eve  
  
Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight  
When its exactly twelve oclock that night  
Welcoming in the New Year  
New Years eve  
  
Maybe Im crazy to suppose  
Id ever be the one you chose  
Out of the thousand invitations  
You received  
  
Oh but in case I stand one little chance  
Here comes the jackpot question in advance  
What are you doing New Years  
New Years Eve  
  
Maybe Im crazy to suppose  
Id ever be the one you chose  
Out of the thousand invitations  
You received  
  
Oh but in case I stand one little chance  
Here comes the jackpot question in advance  
What are you doing New Years  
New Years Eve
