Eve and Adam had a garden everything was great  
Till one day a boy says pardon Miss my name is snake  
See that apple over yonder if youll take a bite  
You and Adam both are bound to have some fun tonight  
Go on and eat forbidden fruit  
Its mighty sweet forbidden fruit  
Its quite a treat forbidden fruit  
Go ahead and taste it you dont wanna waste it  
  
The Lord had said in the beginning everything is free  
Except that apple that leads to sinning so let that apple be  
But Eve got tempted so she tried it and as all chicks do  
Teaser her man till he decided hed just try some too  
Go on and eat forbidden fruit  
Its mighty sweet forbidden fruit  
Its quite a treat forbidden fruit  
Go ahead and bite it I bet youd be delighted  
  
I hate to tell you all what followed the Lord was most upset  
Saw them making love and hollered what have you to add  
And when they made a full confession the Lord said hm I see  
I guess Ill have to teach you a lesson about not minding me  
Go on and eat forbidden fruit  
Its mighty sweet forbidden fruit  
Its quite a treat forbidden fruit  
Youre all indebted now you gonna get it  
  
The Lord made Eve Adams madam have his kids and all  
Placed some labor laws on Adam and he made the snake to fall  
Ever since the days of Eden folks been sinful my  
Nowadays theyre even eating apples in their pie  
Go on and eat forbidden fruit  
Its mighty sweet forbidden fruit  
Its quite a treat forbidden fruit  
Go ahead and taste it you dont wanna waste it  
Oh go ahead and bite it I bet youd be delighted  
You always did it now youll gonna get it  
Forbidden fruit
