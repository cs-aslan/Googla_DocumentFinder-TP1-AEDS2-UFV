Twelve noon  
Watch her sleeping in your room  
Why cant that still be me  
Two oclock and Im still driving round your block  
Feeling a little  
Crazy  
  
Youd change your number and move to the suburbs  
You run but you cant hide  
You thought Id forget all of your passwords  
But I like showing up at your place  
So surprising is that look on your face  
  
I am underneath your street light  
Blowing kissing every night  
Psycho love forever  
Im right outside your window  
Throwing rocks and starting fights  
Psycho love forever  
  
So weeks pass and I found myself another guy  
Someone who loves me equally yeah  
The tables turn and youre not happy  
When you learn hes moving in with me  
He bought me a big ring we moved to the city  
Now you wont stop calling  
Cause you always thought that youd have your plan B  
Now your showing  
Up at my place  
Not surprising  
We both play this game  
  
Youre underneath my street light  
Blowing kisses every night  
  
Psycho love forever  
Youre right outside my window  
Throwing rocks and starting fights  
Psycho love forever  
  
La la la la  
La la la la  
Forever  
La la la la  
La la la la  
  
Youd change your number and move to the suburbs  
You run but you cant hide  
You thought Id forget all of your passwords  
But I like showing up at your place  
So surprising that look on your face  
  
I am underneath your street light  
Blowing kissing every night  
Psycho love forever  
Im right outside your window  
Throwing rocks and starting fights  
Psycho love forever  
  
I am underneath your street light  
Blowing kissing every night  
Psycho love forever  
Im right outside your window  
Throwing rocks and starting fights  
Psycho love
