She came to the coast from the show me state  
With her daddys blue eyes and her mamas blind hate  
Guess she didnt know much but she knew the rules  
What she needed to learn she would find in L A  
Not back in that school  
Didnt wanna read about it  
Guess she wanted to see  
Carolea shes carolea  
Yeah yeah never quite sure what she wanted to be  
Just a little girl alone in a big bad place  
With a devious mind and a beautiful face  
Ever since she was a baby she learned how to play  
Wanted money in her hands from the easiest way  
All her friends said stop girl you cant pay the price  
But the hard way out dont appeal to the beast inside  
She dont wanna hear about the better life  
Guess shes ready to be  
Hey carolea  
  
She never tells the truth to the folks back east  
Truth about the drugs and the men she gets paid to please  
Well they dont know  
Yeah they dont see  
Yeah that finally now after all these years  
Shes let the beast inside roam free  
Carolea
