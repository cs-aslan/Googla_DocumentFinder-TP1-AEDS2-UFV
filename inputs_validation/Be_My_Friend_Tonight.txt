I threw a party Nobody came  
I bought all the tickets They cancelled the game  
I give you my picture It didnt fit your frame  
Be my friend tonight  
  
Be my friend tonight Be my friend tonight  
Ill sleep on the couch You can leave on that light  
Well I wont do nothing wrong till you say its right  
Come on honey be my friend tonight  
  
Now you bring the glasses and Ill bring the wine  
Ill rub your shoulders just like they were mine  
I wont make no passes till its passing time  
If youre only gonna be my buddy tonight  
  
Be my friend tonight Be my friend tonight  
Ill sleep on the couch You can leave on that light  
Well I wont do nothing wrong till you say its right  
Come on honey be my friend tonight  
  
Well Ill mind my manners My ps and qs  
I wont give you nothing that you cant use  
Ill whip out that old guitar and sing you the blues  
Be my friend tonight  
  
Be my friend tonight Be my friend tonight  
Ill sleep on the couch You can leave on that light  
Well I wont do nothing wrong till you say its right  
Come on honey be my friend tonight  
Be my friend tonight be my friend tonight  
  
Ill sleep on the couch You can leave on that light  
Well I wont do nothing wrong till you say its right  
Come on darling be my friend tonight  
Oh come on honey be my friend tonight  
Please be my friend tonight
