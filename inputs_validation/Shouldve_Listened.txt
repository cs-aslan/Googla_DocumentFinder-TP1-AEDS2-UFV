Theres clothes all over the floor  
Dont remember them being here before  
Smell of perfume is in here whys lipstick on the mirror  
And still I dont understand  
  
No pictures left in the hall  
Theres three new holes in my wall  
Where the hells my credit cards whys my wallet in the yard  
And still I dont understand  
  
Well now I guess I shouldve listened  
When you said youd had enough  
A little trick I picked up from my father in one ear and out the other  
Whys love gotta be so tough  
  
Should see the look on my face  
My shits all over the place  
Whys this happening to me whyd you take both sets of keys  
And still I dont understand  
  
Well now I guess I shouldve listened  
When you said youd had enough  
A little trick I picked up from my father in one ear and out the other  
Whys love gotta be so tough  
  
Oh and now I guess I shouldve listened  
Ahhoh ahhahh ahhoh ahhahh ahhoh ahhahh  
  
Theres clothes all over my floor  
I dont remember them being there before  
There are no candles in here lipsticks still on my mirror  
And still I dont understand  
  
Oh and now I guess I shouldve listened  
When you said youd had enough  
A little trick I picked up from my father in one ear and out the other  
Why must love be so tough  
  
Well now I guess I shouldve listened  
Ahhoh ahhahh  
When you said youd had enough  
Ahhoh ahhahh  
A little trick I picked up from my father in one ear and out the other  
Ahhoh ahhahh  
Whys love gotta be so tough
