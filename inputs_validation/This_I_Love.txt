And now I dont know why  
She wouldnt say goodbye  
But then it seems that I  
Had seen it in her eyes  
  
And it might not be wise  
Id still have to try  
With all the love I have inside  
I cant deny  
  
I just cant let it die  
Cause her hearts just like mine  
She holds her pain inside  
  
So if you ask me why  
She wouldnt say goodbye  
I know somewhere inside  
  
There is a special light  
Still shining bright  
And even on the darkest night  
She cant deny  
  
So if shes somewhere near me  
I hope to God she hears me  
Theres no one else  
Could ever make me feel  
Im so alive  
I hoped shed never leave me  
Please God you must believe me  
Ive searched the universe  
And found myself  
Within her eyes  
  
No matter how I try  
They say its all a lie  
So whats the use of my  
Confessions to a crime  
Of passions that wont die  
In my heart  
  
So if shes somewhere near me  
I hope to God she hears me  
Theres no one else  
Could ever make me feel  
Im so alive  
I hoped shed never leave me  
Please God you must believe me  
Ive searched the universe  
And found myself  
Within her eyes  
  
So if shes somewhere near me  
I hope to God she hears me  
Theres no one else  
Could ever make me feel  
Im so alive  
  
I hoped shed never leave me  
Please God you must believe me  
Ive searched the universe  
And found myself  
Within her eyes  
  
And now I dont know why  
She wouldnt say goodbye  
It just might be that I  
Had seen it in her eyes  
And now it seems that I  
Gave up my ghost of pride  
Ill never say goodbye
