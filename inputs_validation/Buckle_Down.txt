Hah  
On the ice  
No holdin  
My soul  
I want men  
Not mice  
No stoppin  
My throw  
  
Hah  
Get this  
Reds are  
Back bills  
Work  
Or play ball  
Or just turn me loose  
  
I know whats fight in life you better buckle down  
Dont give up your fight in life you better buckle down  
Two days with might in life you better buckle down  
Leave dreams tonight in life you better buckle down  
Cos I know whats right
