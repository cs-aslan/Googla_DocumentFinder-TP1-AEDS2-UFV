She gives me love that I could never hope to have  
She tells me that she needs meshe tells me that shes glad  
And if she goes away Im like someone whos left out in the rain  
I need I need her I need her love  
  
She came in from the west a summer breeze I couldnt rest  
I had to take a fast train to be there by her side  
She made me feel so good she made it like it should be all the time  
I need I need her I need her love  
  
Just when I was thinkin of her she came along and made me  
want her I need her love I need her love I need her love  
  
If she goes away Im like someone whos left out in the rain  
I need I need her I need her love  
  
The boats that sail the planes that flyshe is with me  
I wonder if she wonders if this is all for real  
I couldnt stand to see her cry because of me that would be sad  
I need I need her I need her love  
  
She tells me everything she makes me smile she tries to sing  
But never shares her suffering if things are going wrong  
She makes it like a dream if things are as they seem the  
world is good I need her love I need her love I need her love
