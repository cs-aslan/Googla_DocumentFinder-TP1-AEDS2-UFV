Chorus  
why mussed oui stay wear wee dont bee longe  
why mussed oui stay wear wee dont bee longe  
  
Because theres never gonna be enough space  
So eat the meek enjoy the waste  
Its always gonna be a delicacy  
Lick your chops and eat the meek  
  
Chorus  
  
The factory mass produced fear bottled  
Capped distributed near and far  
Sold for a reasonable price  
And the people they love it they feed it  
Brush with it bathe with it breathe it  
Inject it direct to the blood  
It seems to be replacing love  
  
Chorus  
  
Because theres always gonna be token truth  
Forgotten code discarded youth  
You know theres always gonna be pedigree  
One own the air one pay to breathe  
  
Chorus
