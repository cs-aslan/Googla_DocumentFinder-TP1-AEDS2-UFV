Walking across the sittingroom I turn the television off  
Sitting beside you I look into your eyes  
As the sound of motor cars fades in the night time  
I swear I saw your face change it didnt seem quite right  
And its hello babe with your guardian eyes so blue  
Hey my baby dont you know our love is true  
  
Coming closer with our eyes a distance falls around our bodies  
Out in the garden the moon seems very bright  
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly  
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand  
And its hey babe your suppers waiting for you  
Hey my baby dont you know our love is true  
  
Ive been so far from here  
Far from your warm arms  
Its good to feel you again  
Its been a long long time Hasnt it
