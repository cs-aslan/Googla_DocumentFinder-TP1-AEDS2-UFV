Violent J  
Time is all I have anymore  
Verse  Violent J  
I tried to visit Shaggy I stepped up off of my porch  
And it was dark as fuck I couldnt see not even with a torch  
I hear the streets talkin and they aware of my move  
They whisperin and swingin from the trees above I hear the loons  
I try to jog a little crow eyes glow like cats  
Demonic zombies runnin up on me I slap em with the bat  
But my eyes keep bleedin from the rays of the darkness  
They powerful and burn you somethin heartless uh  
I hear a giant thumpin some kind of ogre or somethin  
I see the phantom screamin as this giant behemoth is comin  
And it swung at me I felt a rip my head went spinnin  
And flippin and rollin and finally landed in position  
I could see my body still standin headless as fuck  
It finally fell but what the hell still got my nugget but Im stuck  
I cant move fuck Im only a face why even try  
On top of that its a centipede crawlin in my eye  
I want to die  
Hook  x2  
Everyday I die  
Back to the start another try  
I got the time so why shouldt I  
Violent J  
I got too much time on my hands  
Verse  Shaggy 2 Dope  
I tried to visit J I walked out into the cold  
I see they dont collect they dead they all up over the road  
And some are fully rotted and some they mustve just spotted  
I seen a headless body that resembles Js but I doubt it  
I seen a centaur I threw a pitch fork at it above  
I watch it fall into a bloody patch of bodies and blood  
Im fuckin bout to hurl I close my eyes and walk on  
Its giant crows swoopin at me got me carry me on  
I cut its claws with the hatchet that I keep in my hand  
Even in Hell you best believe I keep the hatchet in my hand  
And as Im fallin now I see the Witch is ridin my chest  
With its claws on my neck screamin I shouldve confessed  
I slammed down into an iron gate a demon statue near me  
Four points stickin out my chest Im hangin there dearly  
And the hungry goblins they got a fire beneath me  
They cookin my legs to make myself eat me  
I want to die  
Hook  x2  
Everyday I die  
Back to the start another try  
I got the time so why shouldt I  
Violent J  
I got too much time on my hands  
I got too much time on my hands  
I got too much time on my hands  
I got too much time on my hands  
I got too much time on my hands  
Hook  x2  
Everyday I die  
Back to the start another try  
I got the time so why shouldt I
