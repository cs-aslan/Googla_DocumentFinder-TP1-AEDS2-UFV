I used to jump when you called  
And I would cry when you leave  
I had to plan every move  
Just to keep you pleased  
  
Chorus  
But I dont care no more  
About nothing you do  
Now Im goin shoppin  
Finger fingerpoppin on you  
  
I got bags under my eyes  
From losin sleep  
You gave me malnutrition  
Cause I just couldnt eat  
  
Chorus  
  
You never bought me no clothes  
I had to steal what I wear  
I wore shoes so long  
Til my feet were bare  
  
Chorus
