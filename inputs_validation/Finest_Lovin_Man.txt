The man Im lovin dont worry bout me runnin around  
You wont ever find my baby hustlin after me all over town  
You dont have to shout you dont even have to call  
Knows Im comin home even if I got to crawl  
Hell get me when he wants me hes the finest lovin man around  
When he gets up in the morning or when he comes home late at night  
You know the mans always hungry knows Im gonna cook it up just right  
He dont ever hurry he just takes his time  
Just a little taste is all it takes to make him mine  
Hell get it when he wants it hes the finest lovin man around  
Some women they act just like their men will never amount to no good  
You know they are always on the cheat  
And never treat him like a good woman should  
You want him to do you right honey that aint the way yeah  
You got to love him all night you do just what he say  
And you get just what you give out thats the only way to gain his place  
Now me and my baby we always know just what were puttin down  
And we know well be together  
Till the day when something better comes around  
Till that day comes you wont hear me complaining yeah  
Ill take him like he is cause you know I cant change him  
Ill love him best I can hes the finest lovin man around  
Oh yeah yeah
