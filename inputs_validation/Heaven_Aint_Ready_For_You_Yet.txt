When they carried you into the parlor  
Your wounds were the worst Id seen  
Cold as snow as your body trembled  
Cradled in the arms of morphine  
All the kinfolk cried out loud  
Good Shepherd save this man  
But you whispered with icy breath  
It is not in His hands and you said  
Heaven aint ready for me yet and you looked at me  
Give me your heart and take a bet and you held my hand  
Now Ive seen your face now that weve met  
I shall not slip away  
Mama said to me daughter  
You must nurse your cousin well  
So I cared for you through days and nights  
But your fever I did not quell  
For weeks I watched you suffer pain  
That no laudanum could ease  
All I had left to do is pray  
Lord have mercy on him please and you said  
Heaven aint ready for me yet and you looked at me  
Give me your heart and take a bet and you held my hand  
Now Ive seen your face now that weve met  
I shall not slip away  
Now winters lights has cooled the air  
At last your strengths returned  
You talk to me of the life you spent  
And of the life youve earned  
Youll waste no time on vengeance  
Youve no wish to fight again  
To find peace you say In God we trust  
But little faith in Man  
Heaven aint ready for you yet Jesse  
Ill give you my heart Ill take a bet Jesse  
Now Ive seen your face now that weve met  
I shall not slip away
