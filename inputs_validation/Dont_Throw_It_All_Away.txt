Maybe I dont wanna know the reason why  
But lately you dont talk to me  
Darling I cant see me in your eyes  
I hold you near but youre so far away  
And its losing you I cant believe  
To watch you leave and let this feeling die  
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive  
And tomorrow if Im here without your love  
You know I cant survive  
Only my love can raise you high above it all  
  
Dont throw it all away our love our love  
Dont throw it all away our love  
Dont throw it all away our love our love  
Dont throw it all away our love  
  
break  
  
We can take the darkness and make if full of light  
But let your love flow back to me  
How can you leave and let this feeling die  
This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone  
And I wont even have your shoulders for the crying on  
No other womens love could be as true Im begging you  
  
Dont throw it all away our love our love  
Dont throw it all away our love  
Dont throw it all away our love our love  
Dont throw it all away our love  
  
We changed the world we made it ours to hold  
But dreams are made for those who really try  
This losing you is real  
But I still feel you here inside  
  
Dont throw it all away our love our love  
Dont throw it all away our love  
Dont throw it all away our love our love  
Dont throw it all away our love  
  
repeat last verse at least twice more and fade out
