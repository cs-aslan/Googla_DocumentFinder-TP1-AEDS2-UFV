You keep on asking me  
Why cant we be together  
I keep saying wont you wait a while  
Whats all the hurry  
I thought we had forever  
I just need time til i can make up my mind  
  
Im not asking for  
A love to last forever  
I dont expect to get a guarantee  
Its just that i believe  
Lovers should stick together  
Im only saying  
Wont you wait for me  
  
Chorus  
Ive got to be  
Got to be certain  
Ive got to be so sure  
Ive had my share of hearts broken  
And i dont want to take that any more  
  
Ive got some friends who say  
Boys are all the same  
Theyre only looking out for just one thing  
Im only hoping that  
You wont turn out like that  
I need some time til i can make up my mind  
  
Been hurt in love before  
But i still come back for more  
I was such a fool  
I couldnt stop myself  
If you believe in me  
If you want our love to be  
I know youll wait for me oh oh oh oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Chorus until fade
