Some folks find that their role in life is to fail at everything they try
while other folks see but not like me  
Theres one thing that theyre damn good at  
  
Gather around you all  
Come around and see  
Those who stand tall  
Why dont you please watch me fall  
  
The hole it is wide and its there to divide its no ones fault  
Its put there by design and theres a bridge yet to build as many men have
willed that can stand the weight of all those who wish to pass  
  
Gather around you all  
Come around and see  
Those who stand tall  
Why dont you please watch me fall
