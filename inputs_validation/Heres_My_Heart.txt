Our two worlds met in strange surprise  
I hid my love in thin disguise  
I tried to leave how could I stay  
What if my heart gave me away  
I always thought Id be prepared  
But love just caught me unaware  
You said the words and I believed  
I fell so hard I fell so deep  
  
Love cant hide though it tries  
Hearts catch fire so has mine  
Heres My Heart  
  
So true love triumphs once again  
It always makes it in the end  
And if you let the heart run free  
It will return faithfully  
  
Love cant hide though it tries  
Hearts catch fire all the time  
Helpless love walks the line  
Hearts catch fire the hour is fine  
Heres My Heart  
  
Ooh Ooh  
Love cant hide though it tries  
Hearts catch fire all the time  
Helpless love walks the line  
Hearts catch fire so has mine  
  
Heres My Heart  
Heres My Heart  
Heres My Heart  
Heres My Heart  
  
Ooh Hey Hey Hey
