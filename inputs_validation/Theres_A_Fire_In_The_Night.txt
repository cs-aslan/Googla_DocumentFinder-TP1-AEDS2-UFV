Running scared  
Wonderin what Im doing so far from home  
Pretending not to care  
That I was so alone  
Then my eyes met hers  
And without one word  
I could tell what was gonna happen  
I could feel it in my bones  
  
By the dark of the moon  
Theres a fire in the night  
She took me to her room  
Ah you know it felt so right  
It keeps growing higher  
The flame of desire  
By the dark of the moon  
Ah theres a fire in the night  
  
Well she told me  
She didnt often do this kind of thing  
She said please hold me  
Hold me tight so I dont have to think  
Oh her gentle touch  
Really moved me so much  
The flames of love swept over us  
Like a burning light  
  
By the dark of the moon  
Theres a fire in the night  
She took me to her room  
Ah you know it felt so right  
It keeps growing higher  
The flame of desire  
By the dark of the moon  
Mm theres a fire in the night  
Fire in the night  
  
By the dark of the moon  
Theres a fire in the night  
She took me to her room  
Ah you know it felt so right  
It keeps growing higher  
The flame of desire  
By the dark of the moon  
Oh theres a fire in the night  
  
Theres a fire in the night  
We started a fire  
Oh  
  
Theres a fire in the night  
Oh Im on fire
