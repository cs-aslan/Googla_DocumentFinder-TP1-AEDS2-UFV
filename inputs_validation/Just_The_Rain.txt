Once in your life you love  
Once in your life you try  
The one youre holdin  
Is the one that tears you apart  
  
Deep in her arms you lie  
Deep in the night her eyes  
Tell your secrets  
To the one you try to deny  
  
Touch me touch me crazy  
How your kiss betrays me  
Its not the love its just the rain  
Two broken hearts  
But not in vain  
Its not the love its just the rain  
  
Inside you keep on lyin  
Inside your soul is dyin  
You still cant hold back  
Still you cant say goodbye  
Touch me touch me crazy  
How your kiss betrays me  
Its not the love its just the rain  
  
Two broken hearts  
But not in vain  
No reasons why no ones to blame  
Its not the love its just the rain  
Its just the rain Its just the rain  
Its just the rain Its just the rain  
Falling falling falling  
Its just the rain
