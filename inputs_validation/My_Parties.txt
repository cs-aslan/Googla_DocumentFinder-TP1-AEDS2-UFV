Well this is my back yard  
My back gate  
I hate to start my parties late  
Heres the party cart  
Aint that great   
That aint the best part baby  
Just wait  
Thats a genuine weathervane  
It moves with the breeze  
Portable hammock honey  
Who needs trees  
Its casual entertaining  
We aim to please  
At my parties  
  
Check out the shingles  
Its brand new  
Excuse me while I mingle  
Hi how are you  
Hey everybody  
Let me give you a toast  
This ones for me  
The host with the most  
  
Its getting a trifle colder  
Step inside my home  
Thats a brass toilet tissue holder with its own telephone  
Thats musical doorbell  
It dont ring I aint kiddin  
It plays America the beautiful and tie a yellow ribbon  
  
Boy this punch is a trip  
Its ok in my book  
Here take a sip  
Maybe little heaven on the fruit  
Ah here comes the dip  
You may kiss the cook  
Let me show you honey  
Its easy look  
You take a fork and spire em  
Say did you try these   
So glad you like em  
The secrets in the cheese  
Its casual entertaining  
We aim to please  
At my parties  
  
Now dont talk to me about the polar bear  
Dont talk to me about ozone layer  
Aint so much of anything these days even the air  
Theyre running out of rhinos  
What do I care   
Lets hear it for the dolphin  
Lets hear it for the trees  
Aint runnin out of nothin in my deep freeze  
Its casual entertaining  
We aim to please  
At my parties
