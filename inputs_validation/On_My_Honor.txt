Here I am on my own again  
The days rush by  
The nights all seems so slow  
Guess Ive let you down  
In my way some how  
If you take me back  
I know well make it  
Well make a promise  
And then break it  
  
On my honor I will try  
Always do the best I can  
Though the tears  
May fall like drops  
From my eyes honey  
On my honor I will try  
  
If you want me to be strong  
Ill give it everything I have  
Youll never have to worry  
Cause were not in a hurry  
On my honor I will try  
  
Its a lovers dance  
In a fiery chant  
Dont be afraid to face the music now  
Its a gamblers chance  
Not a lost romance  
And Im not you  
And youre not me and  
Sometimes we feel differently  
  
On my honor I will try  
Always do the best I can  
Though the tears  
May fall like drops  
From my eyes honey  
On my honor I will try  
If you want me to be strong  
  
Ill give it everything I have  
Youll never have to worry  
Cause were not in a hurry  
On my honor I will try  
I will try  
I will try  
Ill try
