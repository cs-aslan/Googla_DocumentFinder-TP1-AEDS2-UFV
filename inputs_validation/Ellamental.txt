Way back take a look she would cook  
When they were stompin at the Savoy  
She would blow and they would dance dont you know   
It was an uptown kind a show  
  
Cool notes and melodies harmonies  
She sang the song of the universe  
She can make a joyful noise up to heaven  
And call the angels down to the earth  
  
From jazz to swing to bebop  
She kept the spirit alive  
For Bo Duke Dizzy and Miles  
She spoke her mind  
Shes Ellamental to the art  
She spoke her mind  
Shes Ellamental to the art  
  
Too hot until the dawn she sang on  
When joints were jumpin and jive was in  
Bodies movin back and forth to the rhythm  
Ever since Ella first did her thing  
  
From jazz to swing to bebop  
She brought emotions and moves  
She kept the spirit alive  
She spoke her mind  
  
Act like ya know Oh  
Was it the smooth tones that was so much like butter  
Oh Ella was singin just like no other singer  
Cause you know I be the funky bringer of the new style  
because I be the wild child  
Listenin to hiphop listening to bebop and jazz  
Ella made you move that ass  
Sensation for the people insperation for the sisters and brothers  
Smooth jazz for the midnight lovers  
Savoy was the spot for shakin on your rump and  
Ella made it hoppin  
Got the joint jumpin remembering you til the dawn  
Because Ella your memory goes on  
  
She spoke her mind yeahand it just dont stop  
Shes Ellamental to the art the memory goes on and oncause it just dont
stop  
She spoke her mind yeahjazz to the bebop  
Shes Ellamental to the art  
She spoke her mindyeahmuch love  
She spoke her mind
