Yesterdays heartbreak brings tomorrows tears  
A laugh of remembering to live through the years  
Yesterdays heartbreak a love from the past  
I lost you forever your love is my last  
Well alone alone my heart left to wonder  
Alone alone my lonely heart does ponder  
Ohohohyes yesterdays heartbreak your love to be lost  
I gave my love freely now I pay the cost  
Yesterdays heartbreak a love from the past  
Well I lost you forever your love is my last
