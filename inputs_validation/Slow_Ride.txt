She takes her time when its time to get ready  
Always has her way  
Always leaves me waiting by the phone  
She told me more than once to take it slow  
And I said OK  
But lately Ive been sleeping all alone  
Im not breaking up inside  
Im much to proud to moan  
Baby please come home  
  
I feel a little lucky so I try to play it cool  
I think she laughs inside  
With the words that burn like fire in my mouth  
Try to be a man like I got the master plan night out on the town  
Drink and dance and we can turn it out  
  
Whoa maybe its how your body moves I just dont know  
Maybe its just the way you move so slow  
  
Hello  
Hi its me  
I thought I told you not to call me here  
I know I just really needed to talk to you  
Get a clue babe theres nothing to talk about  
  
Click  
  
Ask me why I play myself play myself for a fool  
Swear I would do most anything  
Walk a mile to see her smile  
Walk a mile just to rock for a while  
Babe Im thinking with my dingaling  
  
Whoa Ive been doing some thinking  
Now I just dont know  
Maybe just the way you move so slow  
Maybe cause you move so slow  
Maybe cause you move so slow  
  
But sitting on the verge of tears does not become my twenty two years  
You took my shame and you took my pride  
And now you gonna take me for a slow ride  
  
But uh uh Waiting waiting on the phone  
Got the words that burn like fire in my mouth  
Come on down reggae style  
Wind up your body like a bass line wild  
Drink and dance and we can turn it out  
  
Whoa Im not going crazy but I just dont know  
  
Maybe cause you move so slow Repeat x3  
  
Like love  
Move nice and low  
  
Slowride Repeat x3
