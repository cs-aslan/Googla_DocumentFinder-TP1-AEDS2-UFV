Im standing with you on your roof  
Looking at the chemical sky  
All purple blue and oranges  
Some pigeons flying by  
The traffic on canal streets so noisy  
Its a shock  
And someones shooting fireworks or a gun  
On the next block  
Ananand I wanna hookywooky with you  
I wanna hookywooky with you  
The traffics so noisy its a shock  
Sounds like fireworks or a gun on the next block  
Ah hookywooky with you  
Your exlover satchel is here from france  
Yet another ex  
They gather about you like a mother superior  
All of you still friends but   
None of my old flames ever talk to me when things  
End for me they end  
They take your pants your money your name  
But the song still remains  
Ananand I wanna hookywooky with you  
Ahhahaha I wanna hookywooky with you  
Then they take your pants your money your name  
But the song still remains sayin   
I wanna hookywooky with you  
Youre so civilized it hurts  
I guess I could learn a lot haha  
About people plants and relationships  
How not to get hurt a lot  
And each lover I meet up your roof  
I wouldnt want to throw him off mmmmm  
Into the chemical sky down into the streets to die  
Under the wheels of a car on canal street  
And each lover I meet up on your roof  
I wouldnt want to throw him off mmmmm  
Into the chemical sky  
Under the wheels of a car to die on canal street  
Ahahhi I wanna ah hookywooky with you

I wouldnt want to throw him off into the chemical sky  
Down into the streets to die  
Under the wheels of a car on canal street  
Under the wheels of a car on canal street  
Under the wheels of a car on canal street  
Hookywooky
