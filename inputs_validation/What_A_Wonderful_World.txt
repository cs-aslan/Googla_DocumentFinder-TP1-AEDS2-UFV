I see trees of green red roses too  
I see them bloom for me and you  
And I think to myself what a wonderful world  
  
I see skies of blue and clouds of white  
The bright blessed day the dark sacred night  
And I think to myself what a wonderful world  
  
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky  
Are also on the faces of people going by  
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do  
But theyre really saying I love you  
  
I hear babys cry and I watched them grow  
Theyll learn much more than Ill ever know  
And I think to myself what a wonderful world  
Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world
