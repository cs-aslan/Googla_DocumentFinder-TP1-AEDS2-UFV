In this world of sorrow Ive seen trouble and woe when I get to glory Ill see
no more  
For I know my prayers have not been in vain  
When I get to glory Im gonna sing sing sing  
When I get to glory Im gonna sing sing sing Im gonna let the hallelujahs
ring  
Im gonna praise my blessed Saviours name  
When I get to glory Im gonna sing sing sing  
 banjo   
Sometimes I get so weary inside then I recall how my Jesus died  
Up there I know therell be no pain when I get to glory Im gonna sing sing
sing  
When I get to glory  
 fiddle   
Up there no tears will blind my eyes and Ill walk along by my Jesus side  
Ill meet my loved ones all once again when I get to glory Im gonna sing sing
sing  
When I get to glory
