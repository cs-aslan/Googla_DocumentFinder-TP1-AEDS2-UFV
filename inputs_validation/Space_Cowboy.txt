I told you bout living in the US of A  
Dont you know that Im a gangster of love  
Let me tell you people that I found a new way  
And Im tired of all this talk about love  
And the same old story with a new set of words  
About the good and the bad and the poor  
And the times keep on changin  
So Im keepin on top  
Of every fat cat who walks through my door  
  
Im a space cowboy  
Bet you werent ready for that  
Im a space cowboy  
Im sure you know where its at  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
I was born on this rock  
And Ive been travelin through space  
Since the moment I first realized  
What all you fast talkin cats would do if you could  
You know Im ready for the final surprise  
There aint no way around it  
Aint nothing to say  
Thats gonna satisfy my soul deep inside  
All the prayers and surveyors  
Keep the whole place uptight  
While it keeps on gettin darker outside  
  
Im a space cowboy  
Bet you werent ready for that  
Im a space cowboy  
Im sure you know where its at  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
I see the show downs slow downs lost and found turn arounds  
The boys in the military shirts  
I keep my eyes on the prize on the long fallen skies  
And I dont let my friends get hurt  
All you back room schemers small trip dreamers  
Better find something new to say  
Cause youre the same old story  
Its the same old crime  
And you got some heavy dues to pay  
  
Im a space cowboy  
Bet you werent ready for that  
Im a space cowboy  
Im sure you know where its at  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
