The old maids a waitin for leap year to come the crooners just waitin to
sing  
The old cows standin by the Bull Durham sign  
Just waitin for the grass to turn green  
The barflys waitin for an easy mark the hitchhikers just waitin for a
ride  
The lifetimers waitin for a prison break the beachcombers waitin for the
tide  
Farmers daughters waitin for the salesman to take her into rown  
The city slickers waitin for the country boy to lay all his money down  
You know everything comes to standstill nothing seems to make a turn  
Worm must be waitin for the early bird  
Now I reckon the early birds waitin for the worm  
Nobody wants to do nothin just waitin to get a finger in the pie  
Waitin for a call for a big quiz show or a waitin for some rich uncle to die  
Katy shes waitin at the garden gate the moonshiners waitin at the still  
The gamblers still waitin for that Ace in the hole and I guess Jacks still
waitin for Jill  
Everybodys waitin for something but nothing seems to turn out right  
Cause the night shifts waitin for mornin and the burglar hes just waitin
for night  
The congregations waitin for the preacher the preachers just waitin for
the groom  
The grooms just waitin for the June bride and the brides just waitin for
June  
Sunflowers waitin for the sunshine violets just waitin for dew  
Bees just waitin for honey and honey Im just waitin for you
