Im here at Fourth and Main  
Been standing in the rain  
I feel no joy I feel no pain  
I got nothing to lose nothing to gain  
Im at Fourth and Main  
Been down at City Hall  
Been writing on the wall  
The grass is wet and the trees are tall  
I listen to the pigeons to the raindrops fall  
Im at City Hall  
Been down at Pershing Square  
I cant seem to care  
If the people stop or the people stare  
I dont care if Im leaving Im going somewhere  
Im at Pershing Square
