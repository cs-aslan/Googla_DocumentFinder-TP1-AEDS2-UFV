I can feel those thrills walking over  
When you hold me tight  
Now I feel those pains taking over  
When you say goodnight  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh what sweet sensation  
Lord what strange emotion  
Youve got love and devotion  
And I wont forget your touch  
  
Now theres nothing left for me to say girl  
But stay in your world  
Youve got so much soul deep inside girl  
And love thats richer than gold  
  
Chorus
