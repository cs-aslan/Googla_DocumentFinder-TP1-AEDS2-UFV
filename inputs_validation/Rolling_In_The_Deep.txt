Theres a fire starting in my heart  
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark  
Finally I can see you crystal clear  
Go ahead and sell me out and Ill lay your ship bare  
See how I leave with every piece of you  
Dont underestimate the things that I will do  
Theres a fire starting in my heart  
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark  
The scars of your love they leave me breathless  
I cant help feeling  
We could have had it all youre gonna wish you never had met me  
Rolling in the deep tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside youre gonna wish you Of your hand never had
met me  
And you played it tears are gonna fall To the beat rollin in the
deep  
Baby I have no story to be told  
But Ive heard one of you and Im gonna make your head burn  
Think of me in the depths of your despair  
Making a home down there as mine sure wont be shared  
The scars of your love remind me of us  
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all  
The scars of your love they leave me breathless  
I cant help feeling  
We could have had it all youre gonna wish you never had met me
Rolling in the deep  
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside youre gonna wish you Of your hand never had
met me  
And you played it tears are gonna fall To the beat rolling in the
deep  
Could have had it all  
Rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside of your hand  
But you played it to the beat  
Throw your soul through ever ope door whoa  
Count your blessings to dins what you look for whoa uh  
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold whoa  
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow  
Youre gonna wish you Never had met me  
We could have had it all tears are gonna fall Rolling in the deep  
We could have had it all youre gonna wish you Never had met me  
It all tears are gonna fall  
It all  
It all rolling in the deep  
We could have had it all youre gonna wish you never had met me  
Rolling in the deep tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside youre gonna wish you Of your hand never had
met me  
And you played it tears are gonna fall To the beat rolling in the
deep  
We could have had it all youre wish you never had met me  
Rolling in the deep tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside youre gonna wish you Of your hand never had
met me  
But you played it  
You played it  
You played it  
You played it to the beat
