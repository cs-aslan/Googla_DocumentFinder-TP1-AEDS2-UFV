Dont wanna know you  
Dont wanna know your name  
Said I dont wanna call you  
Dont wanna talk about anything  
I dont wanna like you  
I dont care if you like me  
Said and if you havent caught on yet  
Im lying through my teeth  
  
See the problem is the more I fight it  
The harder it gets to deny it  
And everything in me wants to be with you  
But Ive seen where love can leave you devastated  
So everyday I look in the mirror and I say this  
  
I tell my self I dont wanna be I dont wanna be in love  
Said I dont wanna be I dont wanna be in love  
Cause I know what it is and I know just what it does  
So I dont wanna be in love  
Right now it was too much  
I dont wanna be in love  
  
Dont wanna love when you walk in the room  
Dont wanna love everything to the click clack of your shoes  
Dont wanna love when you put on sweats in the afternoon  
And you curl up next to me as we watch cartoons  
  
Said I dont wanna be  
I tell myself I dont wanna be I dont wanna be in love  
SaiD I dont wanna be I dont wanna be in love  
Cause I know what it is and I know what it does  
So I dont wanna be in love  
Right now it was too much  
I dont wanna be in love  
  
Wish I didnt love the way you smile at me  
And the sun shines  
Wish we could live happily ever after but girl Im terrified  
Even though it feels so right  
  
I tell myself I dont wanna be I dont wanna be in love  
Said I dont wanna be I dont wanna be in love  
Cause I know what it is and I know just what it does  
So I dont wanna be in love  
Right now it was too much  
I dont wanna be in love  
  
I dont wanna be I dont wanna be in love  
Said I dont wanna be I dont wanna be in love  
Cause I know what it is and I know what it does  
So I dont wanna be in love  
Right now it was too much  
So I dont wanna be in love  
  
So now I dont wanna be in love  
Right now is just too much  
So I dont wanna be in love
