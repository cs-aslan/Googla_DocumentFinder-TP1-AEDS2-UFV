Tea time wont be the same without my Donna  
At night I lie awake and dream of Donna  
I think about that small cafe  
Thats where we used to meet each day  
And then we used to sit a while  
And drink our afternoon tea  
  
Ill take afternoon tea afternoon tea  
If you take it with me afternoon tea  
You take as long as you like  
Cause I like you girl  
  
I take sugar with tea afternoon tea  
You take milk if you please afternoon tea  
Like you talking to me  
Because you ease my mind  
  
Babababababa afternoon tea  
Babababababa afternoon tea  
Babababababa afternoon tea  
Babababababa afternoon tea  
  
Tea time still aint the same without my Donna  
At night I lie awake and dream of Donna  
I went to our cafe one day  
They said that Donna walked away  
Youd think at least she might have stayed  
To drink her afternoon tea  
  
Ill take afternoon tea afternoon tea  
If you take it with me afternoon tea  
You take as long as you like  
cause I like you girl  
  
I take afternoon tea afternoon tea  
Every day of the week afternoon tea  
Please come along if you like  
Because I like you girl  
  
Babababababa afternoon tea  
Babababababa afternoon tea
