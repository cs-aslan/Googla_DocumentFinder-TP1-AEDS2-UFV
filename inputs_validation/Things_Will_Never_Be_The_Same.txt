Lay it down pull my heart to the ground  
Times getting cold now the leaves all turn hard and blue  
And I know when I gaze to the sun no place to hide  
I got nowhere to run from you away from you  
  
Hold me now  
girl I dont know when  
when we will ever meet again  
That was then  
baby this is now  
I try to get over you  
Losing you  
Things will never be the same  
Can you hear me call your name  
If we changed it back again  
things would never be  
  
In your hand  
babe I dont understand  
youve got the eyes of a child  
but you hurt like a man  
always do always do  
Touch me now girl  
I dont when  
when we will ever meet again  
That was then  
baby this is now  
time wont get over you  
Losing you  
Things will never be the same  
Can you hear me call your name  
If we changed it back again  
things would never be
