I was dreamin when I wrote this  
Forgive me if it goes astray  
But when I woke up this mornin  
Could of sworn it was judgment day  
  
The sky was all purple  
There were people runnin everywhere  
Tryin to run from the destruction  
You know I didnt even care  
  
Cause they say two thousand zero zero  
Party over oops out of time  
So tonight Im gonna party like its 1999  
  
I was dreamin when I wrote this  
So sue me if I go to fast  
But life is just a party  
And parties werent meant to last  
  
War is all around us  
My mind says prepare to fight  
So if I gotta die  
Im gonna listen to my body tonight  
  
Yeah they say two thousand zero zero  
Party over oops out of time  
So tonight Im gonna party like its 1999  
Yeah yeah  
  
Lemme tell ya somethin  
If you didnt come to party  
Dont bother knockin on my door  
I got a lion in my pocket  
And baby hes ready to roar yeah yeah  
  
Everybodys got a bomb  
We could all die here today uhh  
But before Ill let that happen  
Ill dance my life away  
  
They say two thousand zero zero  
Party over oops out of time  
Were runnin outta time  
So tonight we gonna we gonna tonight Im gonna party like its 1999  
  
Say it one more time  
Two thousand zero zero  
Party over oops out of time  
Yeah yeah  
So tonight we gonna we gonna tonight Im gonna party like its 1999
