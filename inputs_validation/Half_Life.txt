Im awake in the afternoon I fell asleep in the living room  
Its one of those moments when everything is so clear  
before the truth goes back into hidding  
I wanna decide cause its worth deciding  
to work on finding something more than fear  
It takes so much out of me to pretend  
tell me now tell me how  
Make amens  
  
Maybe I need to see the daylight  
live beyond the half life  
dont you see Im breaking down  
O lately Something here dont feel right  
this is just a half life  
is there really no escape no escape from time  
of any kind  
  
I keep trying to understand  
this thing and that thing my felo man  
I guess ill let you know when I figure it out  
I dont mind a few mysteries they can stay that away  
Its fine by me but you are another mystery I am missing  
It takes too much out of me to pretend  
  
Maybe I need to see the day light  
live beyond the half life  
dont you see Im breaking down  
O lately Something here dont feel right  
this is just a half life  
Is there really no escape no escape from time  
or any kind  
  
Cmon lets fall in love  
well cmon lets fall in love  
cmon lets Fall in love Again  
  
Cause lately something here dont feel right  
this is just a half life  
without you I get breaking down  
O wake me  
I wanna see the day light  
save me from this half life  
let you and I escape  
escape from time  
  
Cmon lets fall in love  
cmon lets fall in love  
cmon lets fall in love Again
