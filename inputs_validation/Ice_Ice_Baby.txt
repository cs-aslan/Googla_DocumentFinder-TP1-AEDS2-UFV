All right stop  
Collaborate and listen  
Ice is back I got a brand new invention  
Something grabs a hold of me tightly  
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly  
Will it ever stop  
YoI dont know  
Turn off the lights and Ill glow  
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal  
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle  
  
Too cold Too cold x3 Too cold  
  
Dont you be talkin that shit x6  
  
Dance  
Bum rush the speaker that booms  
Im killin your brain like a poisonous mushroom  
Deadly when I play a dope melody  
Anything less that the best is a felony  
Love it or leave it  
You better gain way  
You better hit bulls eye  
The kid dont play  
If there was a problem  
Yo Ill solve it  
Check out the hook while my dj revolves it  
  
Ice Ice Baby 4X  
  
Take heed cause Im a lyrical poet  
Miamis on the scene just in case you didnt know it  
My town that created all the bass sound  
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground  
Cause my styles like a chemical spill  
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel  
Conducted and formed  
This is a hell of a concept  
We make it hype and you want to step with this  
Dj plays on the fade slice it like a ninja  
Cut like a razor blade so fast  
Other djs say Damn  
If my rhyme was a drug  
Id sell it by the gram  
Keep my composure when its time to get loose  
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice  
If there was a problem  
YoIll solve it  
Check out the hook while dj revolves it  
  
Ice Ice Baby x4  
  
Too fuckin cold  
  
Ice Ice baby Too Cold Too cold  
Ice Ice baby Too Cold Too cold  
Ice Ice baby too cold too cold  
Ice Ice Baby too cold too cold
