Ill walk alone  
But to tell you the truth Ill be lonely  
I dont mind being lonely  
When my heart tells me you are lonely too  
  
Ill walk alone  
Theyll ask me why and Ill tell them Id rather  
There are dreams I must gather  
Dreams we fashioned the night you held me tight  
  
Ill always be near you wherever you are each night  
In every prayer  
If you call Ill hear you no matter how far  
Just close your eyes and Ill be there  
  
Please walk alone  
And send your love and your kisses to guide me  
Till youre walking beside me  
Ill walk alone  
  
Ill always be near you wherever you are each night  
In every prayer  
If you call Ill hear you no matter how far  
Just close your eyes and Ill be there  
  
Please walk alone  
And send your love and your kisses to guide me  
Till youre walking beside me Ill walk alone  
Ill walk alone
