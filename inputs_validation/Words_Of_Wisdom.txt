Um can you make it  
So can you make it  
Are you something special  
  
Some stupid a things say they thrill a lot of my life  
Like the feeling that I want to get to know you better  
Say If youre in my heart  
Say I could and I would  
And you might and you shouldnt  
No I cant go on  
Thinking this love isnt strong  
This love isnt strong  
Till I seek those words of wisdom  
Until I seek those words of wisdom  
Till I seek those  
Until I seek those words  
Until I seek those words of

You may wear your heart upon your sleeve  
But vicious lies they only tease tease  
Every eye open is not seeing  
Every eyes closed  
  
Say If youre in my heart  
Say I could and I would  
And you might and you shouldnt  
No I cant go on thinking this love isnt strong  
This love isnt strong  
Till I seek those words of wisdom  
Until I seek those words of wisdom  
Till I seek those words  
Until I seek those words  
Until I seek those words of  
She said you gotta learn gotta learn baby

Until I seek those words of wisdom  
Till I seek those words  
Until I seek those words  
Until I seek those words of wisdom  
  
She said I shall sing a sad sad song  
I shall sing a sad sad song  
Had many lovers in my day  
Just like the wind theyve all blown away  
Say Ive had many lovers in my day  
Just like the wind theyve all blown away  
  
Say if your girl  
Say if your girl  
  
I seek those words
