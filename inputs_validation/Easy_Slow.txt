You say youre confused  
And all of your friends  
Asking you why  
You act like you do  
The faster you run  
The farther youre behind  
It goes to show  
Take it easy slow  
I think youll like what you find  
Hey hey  
You paint on your face  
Eager to please  
And take your place  
Now outside  
So sadly to find  
All of your pictures there  
Were painted by the blind  
Goes to show  
Take it easy slow  
I think youll like what you find  
Like what you find  
Was a time when  
The world was turnin slower  
You could sit back  
Enjoy it growin older  
And now when you go  
Its twice the speed of sound  
Everyone is gettin much smarter  
How come lifes gettin much harder  
Take it easy baby  
Take it slow  
You say youre confused  
And all of your friends  
They keep askin why you  
Why you act like you do  
And maybe you do  
But its no good to cry  
It only goes to show  
Take it easy slow  
I think youll like what you find  
Like what you find  
Takin it slow  
Slow slow slow  
Take it easy  
Takin it slow  
Slow slow slow  
Take it easy  
Take  
Take take it takin it easy  
Takin it slow  
Slow slow slow  
Take it easy  
Takin it slow  
Slow slow slow  
Take it easy  
Takin it slow  
Slow slow slow  
Take it easy
