People like the way my style is rollin  
The crowd rebounds as I flow slowin  
Im not bullshittin  
Heres how Im hittin  
  
Funkin it up more than George Clinton  
Swingin and bringin in a new format  
A new breed indeed and Im sure of that  
I live press the best I wont rest the pest  
  
Cause Im blessed and I jus wont settle for less  
Yes the kid who gets the crowd up  
The one with the hair that stands straight up  
People look and stare in shock  
  
Trippin over a Rock  
Trippin over a Rock  
  
Chasedand chased and chased but never close to caught  
And the skills I filled were all self taught  
With so many styles on each panfulls  
And they hit ya like a fifth a jack daniels  
  
As the girls admire the way I aspire  
To move piles of dough in my own empire  
Not a liar I tell no lies  
So hey girl you can trust these blue eyes  
  
But dont get me wrong I get wicked  
Shake that ass in my face and ill stick it  
Hit it get wit it  
Knock it out the box  
  
Trippin over a rock  
Trippin over a rock  
  
A genuine badman  
Like Yosemite Sam man  
I seeseeseecan rock the land  
And bring a new swing and sensation  
  
To represent the next generation  
So slack up You better back up  
Here comes the score and the weed in a jigsaw  
Fuck with me  
  
With no doubt  
Ill put my foot in your ass and wont pull it out  
Ill go deep in I wont weaken  
Guaranteed to keep the house beepin  
  
Girls rockin guys  
Try to to cockblock  
  
Trippin over a rock
