I know theres something in the wake of your smile  
I get a notion from the look in your eyes yea  
Youve built a love but that love falls apart  
Your little piece of heaven turns to grey  
  
Listen to your heart when hes calling for you  
Listen to your heart theres nothing else you can do  
  
I dont know where youre going and I dont know why  
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye  
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile  
The precious moments are all lost in the tide yea  
Theyre swept away and nothing is what is seems  
The feeling of belonging to your dreams  
  
Listen to your heart when hes calling for you  
Listen to your heart theres nothing else you can do  
  
I dont know where youre going and I dont know why  
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye  
And there are voices that want to be heard  
So much to mention but you cant find the words  
The sense of magic the beauty thats been  
When love was wilder than the wind  
  
Listen to your heart when hes calling for you  
Listen to your heart theres nothing else you can do  
  
I dont know where youre going and I dont know why  
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye  
  
Listen to your heart when hes calling for you  
Listen to your heart theres nothing else you can do  
  
I dont know where youre going and I dont know why  
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye
