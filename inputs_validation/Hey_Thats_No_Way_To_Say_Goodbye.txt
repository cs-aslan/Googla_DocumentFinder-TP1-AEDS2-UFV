Leonard Cohen  Hey Thats No Way To Say Goodbye  
  
I loved you in the morning our kisses deep and warm  
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm  
Yes many loved before us I know that we are not new  
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you  
But now its come to distances and both of us must try  
Your eyes are soft with sorrow  
Hey thats no way to say goodbye  
  
Im not looking for another as I wander in my time  
Walk me to the corner our steps will always rhyme  
You know my love goes with you as your love stays with me  
Its just the way it changes like the shoreline and the sea  
But lets not talk of love or chains and things we cant untie  
Your eyes are soft with sorrow  
Hey thats no way to say goodbye  
  
I loved you in the morning our kisses deep and warm  
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm  
Yes many loved before us I know that we are not new  
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you  
But lets not talk of love or chains and things we cant untie  
Your eyes are soft with sorrow  
Hey thats no way to say goodbye
