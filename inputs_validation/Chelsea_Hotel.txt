I remember you well in the chelsea hotel  
You were talking so brave and so sweet  
Giving me head on the unmade bed  
While the limousines wait in the street  
Those were the reasons and that was new york  
We were running for the money and the flesh  
And that was called love for the workers in song  
Probably still is for those of them left  
Ah but you got away didnt you babe  
You just turned your back on the crowd  
You got away I never once heard you say  
I need you I dont need you  
I need you I dont need you  
And all of that jiving around  
I remember you well in the chelsea hotel  
You were famous your heart was a legend  
You told me again you preferred handsome men  
But for me you would make an exception  
And clenching your fist for the ones like us  
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty  
You fixed yourself you said well never mind  
We are ugly but we have the music  
And then you got away didnt you babe  
I dont mean to suggest that I loved you the best  
I cant keep track of each fallen robin  
I remember you well in the chelsea hotel  
Thats all I dont even think of you that often
