Ah ah ah  
Things just aint the way that they used to be  
Back in the day when a man meant security  
Hed be working hard all week  
Baby kick back and throw up your feet  
Let me fix you a treat  
So it might be love and sweet  
  
But hes worth it  
He deserves it  
May not be perfect  
But hes all the man I need  
Hes ready and willing  
Gives me the feeling ah  
And whenever were together  
I know where I belong  
  
Chorus  
Its just the way he looks into your eyes  
Love that man  
Its the love he gives that makes you fantasize  
Love that man  
Its the time he takes to show you that he cares  
And hes always there Hes always always there  
Dont you love that man I know  
  
Things they aint the way they used to be  
When a woman and a man work hard to be  
Happy in love and stand together ooh  
Lets stay that way forever  
  
Never give in to a fight  
Just trying work it out  
Never give up on him  
Thats not what loves about  
Stay true to your feelings  
And remember  
All the things hes done for you  
  
Chorus  
  
Youd better know Im talking about that oldschool love  
That everlasting feeling can never be too much  
Somebody loves you heart and soul  
Hold on dont stop  
And never let him go  
  
Chorus
