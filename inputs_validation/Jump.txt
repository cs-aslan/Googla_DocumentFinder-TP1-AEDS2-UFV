Scared of love love and swimming pools  
Falling in you said was for fools  
  
But when youre standing on the edge  
You wont hear me because your blood is singing  
  
Jump jump go ahead and jump jump  
If its what your heart is wanting to do  
This is real life youre dreaming through  
And there is no glue to hold you down so go ahead and  
Go ahead and jump  
  
Scared of love love and aeroplanes  
Falling out I said takes no brains  
  
But if your flight is going rough  
Your soul will lead you to the nearest exit  
Jump jump  
While youre waiting  
Time is grinning  
Clocks and watches laughing at your indecision  
While youre waiting  
Worlds are spinning  
Find another heart and drive into collision  
Knowing this can you tell me youre  
  
Scared of love love and swimming pools  
Stubbornness I say is for mules  
  
But if youre standing on the edge  
You wont hear me because your blood is singing  
  
Jump jump go ahead and jump jump  
If its what your heart is wanting to do  
This is real life youre dreaming through  
And therell be no wake up  
Jump jump go ahead and jump jump  
If its what your heart is wanting to say  
This is really your lucky day  
And there is no glue to hold you down so go ahead and  
Go ahead and jump
