You want me to say I love you too  
Theres nothing in the world Id rather do  
You will never know how hard Ive tried  
But I cant change the way I feel inside  
Its nothing that you did or havent done  
Who knows what makes somebody love someone  
I wish thats the way that we could be  
But love is up to love and not to me  
I cant help the way that I dont feel  
Take what isnt there and make it real  
Youre where I should be going  
But my heart is at the wheel  
And I cant help the way that I dont feel  
Its nothing that you did or havent done  
Who knows what makes somebody love someone  
I wish thats the way that we could be  
But love is up to love and not to me  
I cant help the way but I dont feel  
Take what isnt there and make it real  
Youre where I should be going  
But my heart is at the wheel  
And I cant help the way that I dont feel  
Oh I cant help the way that I dont feel  
Take what isnt there and make it real  
Youre where I should be going  
But my heart is at the wheel  
And I cant help the way that I dont feel oh oh oh
