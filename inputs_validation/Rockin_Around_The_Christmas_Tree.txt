Rockin around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop  
Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop  
  
Rockin around the Christmas tree let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later well have some pumpkin pie and well do some caroling  
  
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear voices singing  
Lets be jolly deck the halls with boughs of holly  
  
Rockin around the Christmas tree have a happy holiday  
Everyones dancing merrily in the new oldfashioned way hey
