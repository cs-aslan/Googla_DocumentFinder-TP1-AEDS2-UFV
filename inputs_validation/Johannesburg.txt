Please dont show your soul to me  
I think Id see the light shine through  
And please dont greet me on the street  
Id like to see a world without you  
Please dont change your uniform  
And start to mourn the thousands dead  
And please wear what youve always worn  
And dont be drawn by what Ive said  
cause Ive found theres nothing more  
That I could say to you  
Nothing I could do to change your mind  
Change your ways and your tune  
So please dont feel you have to sway  
Or move away from how you feel  
And please say what you mean to say  
And always stay with a heart of steel
