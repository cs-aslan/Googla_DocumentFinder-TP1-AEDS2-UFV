All my my friends are happy to stay  
Here in this yard day after day  
But something inside me has called me away  
I dont understand but I know I cant stay  
  
Im gonna fly  
No one knows where  
But Im gonna fly  
Im lighter than air  
  
Cause I have felt for the first time  
I can be myself  
No more faces to hide behind  
Just a smile and a dream thats mine  
Even if I am the only one who wants to fly  
  
Im gonna fly  
No one knows where  
But Im gonna fly  
I soar through the air  
  
All of my life seems Ive waited  
For the time to start  
Being the person inside of me  
Unafraid of being me  
No more faces to hide behind  
Just a smile and a dream thats mine  
Even if Im the only one who wants to fly  
  
If I had my life to live over again  
Id run bare foot relax a bit more  
And Id talk to more children  
And Id learn how they laugh  
And Id teach them how Ive learned to fly  
  
Im gonna fly  
No one knows where  
But Im gonna fly  
Im lighter than air  
  
Im gonna fly  
No one knows where  
But Im gonna fly  
I soar through the air  
  
Cause all of my life seems Ive waited  
For the time to start  
Being the person inside of me  
Unafraid of being me  
Even if Im the only one who wants to fly  
Im gonna fly
