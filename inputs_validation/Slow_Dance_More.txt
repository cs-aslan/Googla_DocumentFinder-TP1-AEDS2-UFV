Grady Johnson was a common man  
Four children and some bottom land  
Early to bed he said well that aint me  
I gotta spend some time with my family  
  
Left to its own device May becomes June  
But children grow up way too soon  
  
Chorus  
So love your neighbor as yourself  
Dont use money to measure wealth  
Trust in God but lock your door  
Buy low sell high and slow dance more  
  
Mama Johnson was Gradys wife  
She bore his children and she graced his life  
Hand in hand and side by side  
They worked hard to simplify  
  
Some folks have and some have not  
What really counts  
Is what you do with what youve got  
  
Chorus  
  
And more I think I understand  
What my fathers father meant  
When he said son what matters most  
You can count on just one hand  
  
Chorus  
  
Buy low sell high and slow dance more
