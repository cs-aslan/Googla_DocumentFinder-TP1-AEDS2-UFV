Baby youre so beautiful  
And when Im near you I cant breathe  
A girl like you gets who she wants  
When she wants it  
Youre so out of my league  
I show you no emotion  
Dont let you see what youre doin to me  
Imagine the two of us together  
But Ive been livin in reality  
  
Fear of rejection kept my love inside  
But time is running out so damn my  
Foolish pride  
  
Chorus  
Dont care if you think Im crazy  
Doesnt matter if it tums out bad  
Cause Ive got no fear of losin you  
You cant lose what you never had  
  
Rules are made for breaking  
Nothin ventured nothin gained  
Ill be no worse off then I am right now  
And I might never get the chance again  
  
Tried to fight it but it cannot be denied  
Told my heart I didnt want you but I lied  
  
Chorus  
  
Now Im gonna confess that I love you  
I been keepin it inside feelin I could die  
Now if you turn away then thats ok  
At least well have a moment before  
You say goodbye  
  
Here on the outside lookin in  
Dont want to stay dreamin bout  
What could have been  
I need to hear you speak my name  
Even if you shoot me down in flames
