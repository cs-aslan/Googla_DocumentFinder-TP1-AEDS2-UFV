Ive got something that you ought to know  
Dont even know whether to come or go  
Up down heads spinning around  
Wind up in the lost and found  
  
Wind me up Wind me up  
Wind me up Wind me up  
Wind me up Wind me up  
  
Tell me why you make it so hard  
All I ask is finish what you start  
  
Wind me up Wind me up  
Wind me up Wind me up  
Wind me up Wind me up  
  
Wind me up thats all you do  
Wind me up and leave me blue  
Id like to see if you could be  
Kind enough to me when you  
Wind me up  
  
Dont take me places then want to go home  
Sometimes I think Im better off alone  
Hey girl you know what you do  
Color me red then leave me blue
