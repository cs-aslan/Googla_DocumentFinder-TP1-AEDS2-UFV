Youve made up your mind  
We dont want the same thing  
And that we wont change things  
Wishing there were ways  
And theres no use staying together  
Nothing lasts forever  
Thats what you say  
  
And that makes one of us not in love  
And that makes one of us who cant give up  
If you can walk away from the life weve made  
Then that makes one of us  
  
I still believe weve got something worth saving  
I keep hoping and praying for another chance  
Youve held my heart and your gonna break it  
Cause you want to make it  
A part of your past  
  
And that makes one of us not in love  
And that makes one of us who cant give up  
If you can walk away from the life weve made  
Then that makes one of us  
  
Then that makes one of us
