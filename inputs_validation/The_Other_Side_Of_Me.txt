You think you know me pretty well  
But how can you tell  
You never get inside my head  
The times we talk we never speak  
We play hide and seek  
So many things are left unsaid  
  
Why cant you see  
Whats on the other side of me  
The side of me that reaches out to you  
Sweet thoughts and dreams  
Like drops of rain on rippling streams  
That wind and bend  
Rivers with no end  
Flowing on the other side of me  
  
It seems I always get unstrung  
I trip on my tongue  
With words that come out something else  
Im so afraid the things I say  
Might chase you away  
I have to hide behind myself  
  
Why cant you see  
Whats on the other side of me  
The side of me that reaches out to you  
Why must I hide  
These feelings that have been denied  
Only you can set me free  
See whats on the other side of me  
  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la  
I have to hide behind myself  
  
Why cant you see  
Whats on the other side of me  
The side of me that reaches out to you  
Why must I hide  
These feelings that have been denied  
Only you can set me free  
See whats on the other side of me  
On the other side of me  
On the other side of me
