Thought that Id be strong enough for both of us  
And you had given up  
Is there anybody strong enough for you  
She said shes scared of waking up  
Shes realized its all been a mistake  
She didnt have to be afraid  
But you walked out on me  
It doesnt really matter what you said  
cause Ive tried  
To turn this water into wine  
It doesnt have to be so hard to understand  
The things that we should do  
I know I made it difficult for you  
She said I couldnt give enough  
To make her feel the way she wanted to  
This doesnt have to be so hard  
But you walked out on me  
It doesnt really matter what you said  
And I tried  
To turn this water into wine  
It takes time  
Its not that way  
T here are several different answers here  
But you just walked away
