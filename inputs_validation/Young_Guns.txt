Hey hotshot youre a one man band  
The Don on the block with a glock in your hand  
With the girl and the ride you dont want to hear  
Think youre getting respect all youve found is fear  
The one damn thing youre sure to find  
Is another gun where you gonna hide  
Said youd never never run I guess you lied  
Youre the fool in the crew that died  
Your mother cried  
  
Hold your fire cool your temper  
Young guns ever too bold  
Hold your fire just remember  
Young guns never grow old  
  
Hey hotshot youre a one man band  
The Don on the block with a glock in your hand  
With the girl and the ride you dontt want to hear  
Think youre getting respect all you find is fear  
The one damn thing youre sure to find  
Is a bigger gun to blow away your pride  
Your young blood running in the roadside  
And in the crossfire innocents died  
We all cried  
  
Hold your fire cool your temper  
Young guns ever too bold  
Hold your fire just remember  
Young guns never grow old
