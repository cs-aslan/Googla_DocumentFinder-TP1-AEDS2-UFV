For the record  
You oughta know  
You wasnt thinking  
When you let me go  
  
But whatever  
Thats how it goes  
Win some you lose some  
And others you hold in your heart  
  
Why it gets so hard  
Tears you all apart  
Even though you try to let go  
No no no  
  
Suddenly youre here  
And its so surreal  
And I dont know  
What the deal  
  
Chorus  
Cause when Im looking in your eyes  
Feels like the first time  
Give me one good reason why  
We cant just press rewind  
I dont wanna spend my life  
Thinking what it couldve been like  
If we had another try one time  
Like back in the day  
That look on your face  
Feels like the first time  
  
Them other irregularities  
They cant compete with MC  
The whole entire world can tell  
That you love yourself some me  
  
People see ya know  
Asking all about  
Me and how they always thought we  
Were so perfect together  
  
Lets rewrite the end  
Start over again  
And its gon go better now  
  
Chorus  
  
For the record  
Youll always be a part of me  
No matter what you do  
And for the record  
Cant nobody say  
I didnt give my all to you  
  
And for the record  
I told you underneath the stars  
That you belong to me  
For the record  
Its obvious that  
We just cant let go of us honey  
  
Chorus x2  
  
For the record baby  
Now you know baby
