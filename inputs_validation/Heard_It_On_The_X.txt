Do you remember  
Back in nineteen sixtysix  
Country Jesus hillbilly blues  
Thats where I learned my licks  
Oh from coast to coast and line to line  
In every county there  
Im talkin bout that outlaw X  
Is cuttin through the air  
  
Anywhere yall  
Everywhere yall  
I heard it I heard it  
I heard it on the X  
  
We can all thank Doctor be  
Who stepped across the line  
With lots of watts he took control  
The first one of its kind  
So listen to your radio  
Most each and every night  
cause if you dont Im sure you wont  
Get to feeling right  
  
Anywhere yall  
Everywhere yall  
I heard it I heard it  
I heard it on the X
