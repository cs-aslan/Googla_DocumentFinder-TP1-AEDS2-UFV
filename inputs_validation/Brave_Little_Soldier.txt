Im a brave little soldier  
I must be bold and strong  
A brave little soldier  
And I must carry on  
Im a brave little soldier  
A brave little soldier  
Im a brave little soldier  
I must fight I must win  
Im a brave little soldier  
Through hell and back again  
Im a brave little soldier  
A brave little soldier  
Per rum pum pum  
Per rum pum pum  
Per rum pum pum pum pum  
Ye though I am marching through the valley filled with fear  
My steps are sure and sturdy and my aim is straight and clear  
The enemy is stalking me just waiting for the kill  
Like david slewed galiath  
I will claim this battle field  
Im a brave little soldier  
I must do what I can  
Im a brave little soldier  
And I must make a stand  
Im a brave little soldier  
A brave little soldier  
Marching marching marching onward  
To the light of truth  
I did not start the war  
But its a battle I cant lose  
Faith will be my armor  
And love my sword and shield  
I must defeat the enemy  
I will I will I will  
A brave little soldier  
I must be bold and strong  
A brave little soldier  
And I must carry on  
A brave little soldier  
A brave little soldier  
Im a brave little soldier  
A brave little soldier  
Brave little soldier
