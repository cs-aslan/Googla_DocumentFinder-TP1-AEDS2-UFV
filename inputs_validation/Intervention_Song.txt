We all heard what happened at the skating rink today  
When Whitey brought up your sad past you snapped and walked away  
Well maybe theyre onto something that you should give a try  
Go ahead and let it out and have yourself a cry  
  
Let it out Davey  
Aw shut your wooden mugs  
Let it out Davey  
Would you check out her bazugs  
  
You all need to deal with pain Well cheers is what I say  
This here stuff just numbs the pain it dont make it go away  
You try to act so tough but you just live a lie  
Why dont you show your feminine side and have yourself a cry  
  
Let it out Davey  
Ill pour you down the sink  
You gotta do it Davey  
Yall can bite my dink  
  
You labels and logos are wastin your time  
Makin me sit here  
Cause nothin you can say or do  
Will make me shed a tear  
  
He possesses a strong spirit  
And wont let down his guard  
So now well bring him the big gun  
His beautiful Hannukkah card  
  
Happy Hannukkah to our wonderful son  
You fill our lives with joy  
Dont ever change the way you are  
You beautiful twelve year old boy
