Now youre finally tell me how you feel  
This to us just came a little too late  
All the drama boy its over kill  
Dont be mad at me cause youve been replaced know your place  
  
PreChorus  
But if you would have manned up  
Put your hand up stand up tell me how you really felt  
Then maybe itd be different  
If it was me that would have listened  
But now Im with somebody else  
And he loves me too much for me to mess this up  
But it sucks to be all in your head  
Wondering where this thing could go  
  
But you will never know
