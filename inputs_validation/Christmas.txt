Theyre singing deck the halls  
But its not like christmas at all  
I remember when you were here  
And all the fun that we had last year  
  
The snows coming down  
Now Im watching it fall  
All the people around  
Baby please come home  
  
The church bells in town  
All ringing in song  
Full of happy sounds  
Baby please come home  
  
Theyre singing deck the halls  
But its not like christmas at all  
I remember when you were here  
And all the fun that we had last year  
  
Now the snows coming down  
Now Im watching it fall  
Lots of people around  
Baby please come home  
wont you please oh  
  
Theyre singing deck the halls  
But its not like christmas at all  
I remember when you were here  
And all the fun that we had last year  
  
The snows coming down  
Now Im watching it fall  
All the people around  
Baby baby baby please come home  
  
Baby please come home  
Baby please come home  
Baby please come home  
Now Im feeling all alone  
  
Oh the snows coming down  
Now Im watching it fall
