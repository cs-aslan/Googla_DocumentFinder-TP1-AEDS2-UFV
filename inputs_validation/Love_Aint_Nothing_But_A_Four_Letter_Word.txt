She was waiting alone at the station  
Praying for her train to arrive  
Thinking bout her destination  
The tattered bag had all she had in life  
  
She turned her back on her family  
She turned her back on her friends  
She turned her back on a married man  
When she took off that wedding band  
  
She said Im giving up silver clouds have turned to gray  
Had enough theres got to be a better way  
Giving up you know youve gotta walk  
Theres some things in life still worth fighting for  
  
Aint no big secret so forget all youve heard  
Love aint nothing but a fourletter word  
For some its for better for some its for worse  
Love aint nothing but a fourletter word love aint nothing  
  
This time he said was the last time  
Last time he said just the same  
In your heart you know that theyll be a next time  
That your battered bones would have to explain  
  
Giving up nothings changing but the score  
Had enough every night love turns to war  
Give it up gave it all and wanted more  
It aint nothing worth dying for  
  
Its no big secret so forget all youve heard  
Love aint nothing but a fourletter word  
For some its for better for some its for worse  
Love aint nothing but a fourletter word love aint nothing  
  
Forget your mamas Rosary beads  
To get you through this time of need  
You know you gotta cross that line  
You take it one day at a time  
  
Had enough the silver clouds all turning gray  
Im heading for a better day  
  
Its no big secret so forget all youve heard  
Love aint nothing but a fourletter word  
For some its for better for some its for worse  
Love aint nothing but a fourletter word  
  
Love aint nothing it aint nothing now baby  
Love aint nothing but a fourletter word  
Love aint nothing nothing now baby  
Love aint nothing but a fourletter word  
  
Love aint nothing yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Love aint nothing but a fourletter word  
Love aint nothing  
Love aint nothing but a fourletter word  
  
Love aint nothing  
Love aint nothing but a fourletter word  
Love aint nothing  
Love aint nothing but a fourletter word  
  
Love aint nothing
