Theres nothing outside my window  
But the sound of the pouring rain  
It oughta be breaking my heart  
But I feel no pain  
Trying to pick up the station  
Thatll carry me through this night  
Got a fire to keep me warm  
Til I got you in my arms  
  
Holding out dug in deep  
I got an island that Im gonna keep  
Close my eyes but I know I wont sleep  
Holding out  
Oh yeah  
I know love wont forget me I gotta keep holding out  
  
Girl Ive been dreaming about you  
For the better part of my life  
At least I can make it without you  
One more night  
  
Im not afraid of the thunder  
I wont run away from the storm  
Let the stars fall down and break  
I dont care how long it takes  
  
Holding out dug in deep  
I got an island that Im gonna keep  
Close my eyes but I know I wont sleep  
Holding out  
Oh yeah  
I know love wont forget me I gotta keep holding out  
  
Theres no other love in the world  
I could want any more  
  
Holding out dug in deep  
I got an island that Im gonna keep  
Close my eyes but I know I wont sleep  
Holding out  
Oh yeah  
I know love wont forget me I gotta keep holding out
