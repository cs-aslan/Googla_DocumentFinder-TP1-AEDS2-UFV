At night I heard God whisper lullabies  
While Daddy next door whistled whisky tunes  
And sometimes when I wanted they would harmonize  
There was nothing those two couldnt do  
  
Embrace me you child youre a child of mine  
And Im leaving everything I am to you  
Go chase the wild and nightime streets sang Daddy  
And God sang Pray the devil doesnt get to you  
  
I thought together they must sing the moon away  
I thought that they must know each other well  
For the magic that they made when they played  
Wasnt lost between their Heaven and their Hell  
  
Then one night Daddy died and went to Heaven  
And God came down to earth and slipped away  
I pretended not to notice Id been abandoned  
But noone sang the night into the day  
And later night time songs came back again  
But the singers dont compare with those I knew  
And I never figured out where God and Daddy went  
But there was nothing those two couldnt do
