Did you ever in your life before  
feel as bad as this  
Did you ever in good time think  
my life had gone amiss  
Now I feel Ive been unfair  
cause I catch you hanging there  
Did you ever in your life before  
feel as bad as this  
  
God knows I tried a half a year  
but it didnt do no good  
My damnedest try to make it work  
I knew it never would  
Now theres nothin wrong with you  
and theres nothing you could ever do  
God knows I tried a half a year  
but it didnt do no good  
  
The times were good  
but over now  
a pleasant memory  
Im sorry theres another face  
one thats close to me  
You know bout what I learned  
and theres no stone left unturned  
The times were good  
but over now  
a pleasant memory Sigh
