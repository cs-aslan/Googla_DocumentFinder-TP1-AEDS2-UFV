Show us a long  
Long long hot summer night  
As far as my eyes could see  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Well my heart was way down  
Cold cold winter stone  
Well my darlin where can you be  
Where can you be baby  
Where can you be  
  
There were three sugar walls  
And two candy cane windows  
But the silliest move melted all those inside  
Well everybodys on fire but its  
A snowin in a cold blizzard  
  
Where are you in this a hot cold summer  
Where are you in this a hot cold summer  
Where are you in this a hot cold summer  
God god god  
  
Around about this time the telephone  
Blew its horn across the room  
Scared little Annie  
Clean out of her mind  
Out of her mind  
  
Roman the Candle he peeps out of his peekaboo hide and seek  
And grabbed little Annie from the ceiling just in time  
And the telephone keeps on screamin  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Hello said my shakey voice well how you doin

She says Im gonna hurry to ya Ive been a fool  
And Im tired of cryin
