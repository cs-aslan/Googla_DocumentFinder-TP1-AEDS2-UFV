Its getting dark in here  
Dont want to leave  
Shadows falling  
And I believe  
Winds picking up  
Things so unclear  
Im afraid of my shadow  
And its getting dark in here  
  
Im scared of strangers  
On the street  
Worlds so ugly  
I cant breath  
Moons so spooky  
Im close to tears  
Ive lost it all  
And its getting dark in here  
  
And the wait isnt worth what Im getting  
Sometimes I feel Im on fire  
Ive been handed a curse and a blessing  
My lifes been stripped down to the wire  
And Im trying to get back and hold on  
Find someone somewhere who cares  
But the suns always setting on my life  
And its sure getting dark in here  
  
Dont talk about angels  
Or how Ill be saved  
Im no coward  
But Im not that brave  
Rags are blowing  
Rains getting near  
Im done with running  
And its getting dark in here  
  
And the wait isnt worth what Im getting  
Sometimes I feel Im on fire  
Ive been handed a curse and a blessing  
My lifes been stripped down to the wire  
And Im trying to get back and hold on  
Find someone somewhere who cares  
But the suns always setting on my life  
And its sure getting dark in here  
And the wait isnt worth what Im getting  
Sometimes I feel Im on fire  
Ive been handed a curse and a blessing  
My lifes been stripped down to the wire  
And Im trying to get back and hold on  
Find someone somewhere who cares  
But the suns always setting on my life  
And its sure getting dark in here  
  
Yeah the suns always setting on my life  
And its sure getting dark in here
