Every time I close my eyes  
Youre all that I can see  
I hold you in my heart  
And know youre watching over me  
  
Standing by your side  
It felt like I could fly  
If I could be half the man that you are in my eyes  
And I could face the darkest day  
And fight the tears inside  
I cant turn the page or hold back the time  
Its too hard to say goodbye  
Its too hard to say goodbye  
  
From you I learnt it all  
You would never let me fall  
Love wont come undone  
Between a father and his son  
  
Standing by your side  
Felt like I could fly  
If I could be half the man that you are in my eyes  
I would face the darkest day  
And fight the tears inside  
I cant turn the page or hold back the time  
Its too hard to say goodbye  
Its too hard to say goodbye  
  
There will come a day  
Ill have to walk alone  
And Ill have to make it on my own  
  
You taught me all there is to know  
Dad Ill never let you go  
  
Standing by your side  
I felt like I could fly  
If I could be half the man that you are in my eyes  
I would face the darkest day  
Fight back the tears inside  
But I cant turn this page or hold back the time  
  
Its too hard to say goodbye  
Its too hard to say goodbye  
Just cant say goodbye
