Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  
I will fear no evil  for you are with me  
Your rod and your staff they comfort me  
You prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies  
You annoint my head with oil my cup overflows  
Surely goodness and love will follow me  all the days of my life  
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever  
  
Niggaz in my faction dont like askin questions  
Strictly gun testin coke measurin  
Givin pleasure in the Benzito  
Hittin fanny spendin chips at Mannys  
Hope you creeps got receipts my peeps get dirty like cleats  
Run up in your crib wrap you up in your Polo sheets  
Six up in your wig piece nigga decease  
MWA may you rest in peace  
With my Sycamore style more sicker than yours  
Fourfour and fiftyfour draw  
as my pilot steers my Leer yes my dear  
Shits official only the Feds I fear  
Heres a tissue stop your blood clot cryin  
The kids the dog everybody dyin no lyin  
So dont you get suspicious  
Im Big Dangerous youre just a Lil Vicious  
As I leave my competition respirator style  
Climb the ladder to success escalator style  
Hold yall breath I told yall  death

Youre nobody til somebody kills you

Ask Nino he know  
Green with envy the green tempts me  
to make the rich the enemy and take their cheese  
Take their spots take their keys make my faculty  
live happily ever after in laughter  
Hah never seen Cristal pour faster  
And to those bastards knuckleheads squeeze lead  
Three of mine dead nuttin left to do  
but tear they ass to shreds leave em in bloodshed  
Incidents like this I take trips  
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy huh  
Some Creole CO bitches I met on tour  
Push a peach Legend Coupe gold teeth galore  
Told me meet em in the future later theyll take me shoppin

Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters  
Rich bitch shit drinkin Cristal

You aint worth spit just a memory  
Remember he used to push the champagne Range I remember that  
Silly cat all suede in the rain  
Swear he put the G in Game had the Gucci frame  
before Dana Dane thought he ran with Kane  
I cant recall his name what was his name you mean that kid  
that nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine  
Gettin his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine  
A fuckin shame dukes a lame whats his name  
Darkskin Jermaine see what I mean  
  
Youre nobody til somebody kills you  
I dont wanna die God tell me why  
Youre nobody til somebody kills you
