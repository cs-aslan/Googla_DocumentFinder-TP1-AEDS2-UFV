God is good and fate is great  
When it feels so strong its hard to wait  
You never know how it might unfold  
Hearts to break and bodies to hold  
Time will tell but it never gets old  
Like I told you Im in for the long long  
  
Had to of been one of those things that took place in outer space  
A match made in heaven not a scratch on her face  
Angels must have smoked some dust  
Singing songs about In God We Trust  
Something sly but this is a must  
Like I told you theres a time for finding out  
  
Ah people try to tell me what not to do  
You shouldnt make it with a younger girl and  
Too many chances for the foot to drop  
I tried to tell em that I found a pearl well  
Like I told you be careful what youre asking for  
  
This is to Brutus  
Gotta mess of a better hell ow  
This is to Judas  
Even you never had my back  
  
She was the cutest thing that I ever did see  
A drink in her hand and I dont mean tea  
She was with a dude but I just didnt care  
I had to find out these moments are rare  
And Stevie says All is fair  
Like I told you there is something for everyone  
  
Well I guess I never told you some things  
That I really really wanted to say  
Did I do everything I could do  
Or did the mice just need to play  
Like I told you theres more than meets the eye  
  
This is to Brutus  
Gotta mess of a better hell ow  
I said this is to Judas  
Even you never had my back  
  
Im not trying to point fingers at you  
And Im not trying to lay any blame  
But when it comes to the punishment  
Girl you know how to bring the pain  
Like I told you Id do it all again  
  
This is to Brutus  
I gotta mess of a better hell ow  
I said this is to Judas  
Even you never had my back  
  
Come on  
This is to Brutus  
Theres a jury to the womans lap ow  
This is to Judas  
Even you never had my back
