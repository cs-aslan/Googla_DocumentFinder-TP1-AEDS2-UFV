Luxury liner forty tons of steel  
If I dont find my baby now  
I guess I never will  
Ive been a long lost soul  
For a long long time  
Ive been around  
Everybody ought to know whats on my mind  
You think Im lonesome so do I  
So do I  
  
Well Im the kind of girl  
Who likes to make a livin runnin round  
And I dont need a stranger  
To let me know my babys let me down  
You think Im lonesome so do I  
So do I  
  
Luxury liner forty tons of steel  
No one in this whole wide world  
Can change the way I feel  
Ive been a long lost soul  
For a long long time  
Ive been around  
Everybody ought to know whats on my mind  
You think Im lonesome so do I  
So do I
