Now come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home  
If I had one wish I wish I could  
Go back to my old neighborhood  
Where the good folks they all love you as their own  
Then Id go over to my neighbors house  
Knock on the door and theyd all sing out  
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home  
Id sing their praises long and loud  
Cause theyre all my folks and Im mighty proud  
Of the little old town back home where I was born  
I wish that I could hear them say  
In the good oldfashioned friendly way  
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home  
Well they dont lock their doors at night  
Cause they all know theyre a doin right  
And the good Lords bound to have them for his own  
If Id go back to hear them pray  
In the little pine church they all would say  
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home  
Now come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home
