Tonight theres wind  
Tonight theres rain  
Tonight I sleep with myself again  
I punch the pillow into a mound  
With this frustration that I have found  
Today I hoped  
Today I heard  
Theres still no contact  
Still no word  
I want to hear the front door slam  
I want you back to hold my hand  
Tonight theres hope youll comfort me  
All I can do is wait and see  
But my eyes begin to close  
As footsteps softly creep  
To find me sound asleep  
  
Tonight theres pain  
Tonight theres fear  
Tonight its cold now youre not here  
The sound of tyres out in the wet  
Thats as close to you as I can get  
No turning handle on our front door  
The more I hate you I want you more
