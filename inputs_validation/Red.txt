You better watch your tape boys  
Its the tint that angers the beast  
Got their sails in the sunset  
Theyve already got the east  
  
Red red red  
Dont you let them make you  
Dont let them make you seered  
  
You better watch your lead boys  
Its already in your veins  
Did you ever see the colour  
Iron turns when it rains  
  
Its not a gross infatuation  
Its not a fear its not a crush  
Its not any special nation  
But even now they make me blush
