We poison our hearts  
We poison our seas  
We burn down the paradise  
  
Were stoppin good waves  
Were losin our trees  
The future looks bright ahead  
I dont wonder well go under in this river of lies  
  
Were lost in this timewe create so fine  
The future we already fear  
Seems like no way out seems like theres no doubt  
The future looks bright ahead  
  
Were the kids of the centurywere lost in our games  
No time for the memories we look in the haze  
Were the kids of the century it wasnt our fault  
Everythings done mum we fall  
Lets keep on crying  
But sometimes I dont want to fall  
  
Everytime when you look around things will smile at you  
Everytime when you turn around you smell the truth  
But you run away from the lies you cant say  
Dont run away from the lies you cant say  
  
Were the kids
