Almost exactly a year ago  
I came here for the very first time  
Looking up at the Spanish window  
From a trail on the edge of the timberline  
Ive been off on a journey to find myself  
Maybe find my way back home  
Been many an hour all by myself  
In the darkest of nights  
I was never ever alone  
  
Back in the San Juan Mountains again  
On a ride with some good old boys  
Telling stories around a campfire  
The sound of laughter is the loudest noise  
Theres something in a night in the wilderness  
Its a magical thing to me  
Like the sky is just a little bit brighter  
And your life is everything that youd like it to be  
  
Therell be snow on the passes tomorrow  
You can feel it in the chill of the wind  
Let the rain wash away all my sorrow  
Today is the day that my life starts all over again  
  
I guess that its just about over now  
Everything is about to change  
Everything is a brand new number darling  
Everything is a brand new game  
And its funny I could even call you that  
After all the pain weve been through  
Ah but time is the master of healing  
Love is the master of everything that we do  
  
Therell be snow on the passes tomorrow  
You can feel it in the chill of the wind  
Let the rain wash away all my sorrow  
Today is the day that my life starts all over again
