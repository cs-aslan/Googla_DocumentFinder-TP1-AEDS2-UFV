Verse  
The light of the world  
Shining in love  
Taking the fall upon Your shoulders  
You shattered the dark  
As You rose to life again  
  
You search all the earth  
For those who are lost  
And leaving the rescued for the fallen  
Youre leading us home  
As we call upon Your Name  
  
Chorus  
Youre the God who saves  
Youre the hope of all  
Reaching out Your hand  
As Your people call  
  
Verse  
Our Saviour has come  
Let Your will be done  
Your kingdom on earth as in the heavens  
Our freedom is found  
Lord in no other name  
  
You are the Way  
The Truth and the Life  
Your mercy has overcome our failings  
The battle is won  
Jesus in love You reign  
  
Bridge  
Here in Your light ever brighter  
We lift Your Name higher and higher
