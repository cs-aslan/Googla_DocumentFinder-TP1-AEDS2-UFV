Summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times  
For the times I miss you most of all are summer winter spring and fall  
Your love for me is over but sweet meries I still recall  
Each season brings its changes but in me theres been no change at all  
Summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times  
I thought some day Ill forget you but the chances now seem very small  
Theres too much of you still here with me to ever forget you at all  
Summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times  
For the times I miss you most of all are summer winter spring and fall
