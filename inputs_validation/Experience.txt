See me loving you  
A fool without a lover  
How can that possibly be  
Maybe you can show me why  
I shiver when youre closer  
I remember your touch without it  
Let me drown in your ecstasy  
Its got to be do or die  
  
Dont tell me love is just one night  
I know its not true  
There should be someone there to catch you  
When the rain falls  
And you can turn away my heaven  
And maybe I was wrong  
I depended on the inner voice of  
  
Experience or just imagination  
Whatever you believe in you can lose  
And one way or the other we can find  
Another world we can run away to  
Im living for the  
Experience is only what you make it  
You live forever but you never know  
That somebody loves you  
And when the sky is open  
Fly away lovers can share  
Ill be there  
  
And you can make the earth move  
You can take me with no struggle  
Lead me through your mystical dreams  
Show me what you are  
And we can make the wind blow  
Youre the power and Im in it  
You can be the fire I start  
I want your heart  
  
And let there be a story when the stories are told  
I need to hear you say you love me when the night falls  
We may never go to heaven but one thing that is sure  
You can not ignore  
Ill make it more than  
  
Experience is not imagination  
You get what you believe in if you choose  
Somebody loves you  
I couldnt get no higher  
Fly away lovers can share  
And well be there  
  
Experience is not imagination  
You get what you believe in if you choose  
And one way or the other  
We can find another world we can run away to  
And I love you  
Experience is only what you make it  
You come together when you let yourself go  
And somebody loves you  
I couldnt get no higher  
Fly away lovers can share  
And well be there  
  
Repeat last verse and fade
