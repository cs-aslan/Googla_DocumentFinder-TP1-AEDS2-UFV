Theres a state of grace that happens every day  
Its a feeling I thought lost or locked away  
Another question to an answer that I know  
Oh are you coming home coming home for sure  
Id walk a thousand miles just to hear you calling out my name  
Kiss me softly  
Kiss me slowly  
I get lost in you  
Like only lovers do  
Hold me closer  
Love me tender  
I get swept away  
Like only lovers do  
Youve awakened something deep inside my soul  
And every moment every breath I feel it more  
Your hidden treasure that you kept down deep inside  
We make love freely as we watch the new sunrise  
Id live a thousand lives if every one I lived could be with you  
Kiss me softly  
Kiss me slowly  
I get lost in you  
Like only lovers do  
Hold me closer  
Love me tender  
I get swept away  
Like only lovers do  
Id live a thousand lives  
If every one I lived could be with you  
Kiss me softly  
Kiss me slowly  
I get lost in you  
Like only lovers do  
Hold me closer  
Love me tender  
I get swept away  
Like only lovers do  
Kiss me softly  
Kiss me slowly  
I get lost in you  
Like only lovers do  
Hold me closer  
Love me tender  
I get swept away  
Like only lovers do  
Only lovers only lovers only lovers do  
Only lovers only lovers only lovers do  
Only lovers only lovers only lovers do  
Only lovers only lovers only lovers do
