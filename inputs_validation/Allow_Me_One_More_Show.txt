Whoa treat me sweet mama low me one more show  
Treat me sweet mama low me one more show  
I swear to the lord I wont do wrong no more  
I dont love no woman  if she got easy ways  
I dont love no woman if she got easy ways  
Im crazy about my little girl shes always been my crave  
Break  
I woke up this morning just before the brake of day  
I woke up this morning just before the brake of day  
I looked at the pillow where my good girl used to lay  
I hung my head boys I  cried just like a child  
I hung my head boys I  cried just like a child  
I said the way Im treated mama sure aint satisfied  
Ive got the blues so bad little girl  my poor ol heart is sore  
Ive got the blues so bad mama  poor ol heart is sore  
I just cant rest  mama know where I go
