Once a singer sang bout bullshit  
Everyone could see him fall  
And be sure its been his last hit  
Hes never been seen at all  
  
Some dictator felt progressive  
And lay down in the sun  
But his people were aggressive  
They killed him with a gun  
  
Sometimes youre wrong  
By some things you have done  
You see fate is too strong  
Nothings won  
  
No use for a fight  
If youre not acting right  
Youll be cut down to size  
Like a lie  
  
Chorus  
Its the rise and fall  
The prize for all  
That aint nice at all  
Luck is like a ball  
You cant recall or care at all  
So better use your brain  
  
A little dragon could spit fire  
But never so for something bad  
He didnt know the knights desire  
To throw a lance into his head  
  
Romeo loved his Juliet  
Their parents told them Stop  
Then it all turned out peculiar  
He couldnt get it up  
  
And its all in vain  
When youre living with pain  
Reap not goods you have grown  
By your own  
  
Feelings you like  
Disappear overnight  
You sip up every grin  
Free to win  
  
Chorus  
Its the rise and fall  
The prize for all  
That aint nice at all  
Luck is like a ball  
You cant recall or care at all  
You nearly go insane  
  
A spaceman flies the rocket  
That takes him to the stars  
Thinks his wife is in his pocket  
But shes strolling round in bars  
  
The king of Los Angeles  
Bought himself a teddy bear  
And the queen became shameless  
She did it with a chair  
  
Sometimes youre wrong  
By some things you have done  
You see fate is too strong  
Nothings won  
  
No use for a fight  
If youre not acting right  
Youll be cut down to size  
Like a lie  
  
Chorus  
Its the rise and fall  
The prize for all  
That aint nice at all  
Luck is like a ball  
You cant recall or care at all  
So better use your brain
