Somewhere a door is opening  
Somewhere a door is closing  
Somewhere somebody dies  
Somewhere a newborn baby cries  
  
Maybe the love has gone  
But theres still a heart thats beating  
Though the clouds have come  
Maybe the sun will come out  
  
The storm is coming back  
Maybe youll be coming back  
Cause Im still waiting  
Baby well Im still waiting  
  
Mmmna mmmna mmmna mmmnamm  
Baby well Im still waiting  
Somewhere a door is opening  
  
Maybe the love has gone  
But theres still a heart thats beating  
Though the clouds have come  
Maybe the sun will come out  
  
Maybe youll be coming back  
Cause theres still a heart thats beating  
Though the clouds have come  
Maybe the sun will come out  
  
Maybe youll be coming back  
Theres still a heart thats beating  
Maybe the sun will come out  
They say the storm will be coming back  
Maybe youll be coming back Cause Im still waiting  
  
Mmmna mmmna mmmna mmmna  
Baby well Im still waiting  
Ooh Im waiting  
Mmmmmmmmoooh  
YAYAYAYAYAYA  
Oh Im waiting  
Oh
