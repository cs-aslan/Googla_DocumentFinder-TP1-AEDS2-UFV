feat Ernest Ray  
  
Oh mama why did God take my daddy cause Id been good just like he said to be  
I heard daddy pray dear Lord dont take me from them  
Oh mama why did God take him from me  
Come here son youve asked mama somethin thats even hard for me to
understand  
For theres one thing I do know  
Daddy wouldnt gonna see those tears in the eyes of this big man  
So stop cryin now and listen real careful to every word mama has to say  
You see son God picks the sweetest most beautiful flowers that grow  
And he makes them the brightest shiniest stars that glow  
Now daddy talk with the Lord every day and daddy and Godll be real close  
So lets just say it seems that God takes the ones he loves the most  
Oh mama why did God take my daddy  
Son you havent heard a word that mama said  
So come on now lets say your prayers and mama tuck you in bed  
And we must have questioned God cause he already has everything planned  
And honey daddy cant ever come back to us though we can go to him  
Oh mama why did God take him from me
