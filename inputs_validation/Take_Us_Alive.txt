Your mamma told you  
Told you to stay away  
Pappa done scold you girl  
Dont hear a word he say  
He said  
Over my body  
No starcrossed lover lay  
  
You can run I can hide  
And well meet each other  
On the other side  
Dont you worry pretty baby  
Theyll never take us alive  
  
Tell me youre leaving it  
Leaving it all behind  
Better believe in me  
Never treat you unkind  
A little closer girl  
Come take my hand child  
Ill love you  
For a million miles  
  
You can run I can hide  
And well meet each other  
On the other side  
Dont you worry pretty baby  
Theyll never take us alive  
  
Save our souls save our souls  
Save our souls save our souls  
  
You better run I gotta hide  
And well meet each other  
On the other side  
Dont you worry pretty baby  
Theyll never take us alive  
  
You better run and I can hide  
And well meet each other  
On the other side  
Dont you worry pretty baby  
Theyll never take us  
Dont you worry pretty mamma  
Theyll never break us  
Dont you worry pretty baby  
Theyll never take us alive
