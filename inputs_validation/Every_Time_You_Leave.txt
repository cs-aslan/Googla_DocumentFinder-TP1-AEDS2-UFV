Everytime you leave  
You tear the soul from me  
I die a little more each time part  
I cant control my dreams  
My heart cant seem to learn  
To turn and lock its door when you return  
  
I know that youll come back again  
As soon as you get blue  
And I know what will happen then  
One kiss and Ill give one to you  
  
Everytime you leave  
You tear the soul from me  
But I want to live so Ill forgive  
Everytime you leave
