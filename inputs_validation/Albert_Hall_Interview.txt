This whole thing thats happened to me you see this whole success thing er
it hasnt yet really compromised the position that I took a long time ago in
texas that was to be true to myself  
Be the person that I f That was on inside of me and not play games You
see actually what Im trying to do mostly if I in the whole world is to
not bullshit myself and not bullshit anyb  
Lse To be righteous to myself I mean to be real you know what I mean And
so far you know Im Im just tryin to Im doin that I am you know
Im not wearin cardboard eyelashes an  
D you know and girdles and playin in las vegas By still bein janis I
just happens to be on a slightly different level or somethin now And You
know I suppose its because Ive never  
Premeditated enough in showbusiness that I was worried about putting on a a
face you know what I mean So I can sit here and tell you the truth You
know Otherwise its slightly inhibiting  
Lly it doesnt it doesnt f  
Orce a game on me because I refuse to let it force a game on me So I can sit
here and be just as honest as I would be in a bar although Id be a lot
happier in a bar
