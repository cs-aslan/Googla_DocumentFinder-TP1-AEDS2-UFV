Once upon a magazine  
There I saw a beauty queen  
And she challenged me to be something I could not be  
She had the looks the kind that kill  
With one look I felt so incomplete and obsolete  
I cant compete you cant compete  
So Im lookin in the mirror Im tryin to see mine  
Not the traces of the faces that Ive seen a million times  
With Jesus in my life Jesus in my life  
I dont have to change  
  
CHORUS  
Im a girl  
Livin in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind  
So come on girls weve got to get together  
You know we cant give up  
Ya know its hard enough to be a girl  
  
So you want a perfect girl  
In a mini skirt and pearls  
With a lovely disposition and changeable opinions  
That may be nice but heres the facts  
I wont sacrifice true love that lasts for house and cash  
I cant do that I wont do that  
  
So Im lookin in the mirror and I cant believe my eyes  
Cause Im seeing whats inside me for the very first time  
With Jesus in my life Jesus in my life  
I dont have to change a thing  
Im a girl  
Livin in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind  
So come on girls weve got to get together  
You know we cant give up  
Ya know its hard enough to be a girl  
  
Im a girl  
Livin in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind  
So come on girls weve got to get together  
You know we cant give up  
Ya know its hard enough to be a girl  
  
Gotta get your influence from something real  
So cmon live your life girl  
God will give you the hope  
If you just imagine  
All that He can do if you want Him to  
  
Im a girl  
Livin in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind  
So come on girls weve got to get together  
You know we cant give up  
Ya know its hard enough to be a girl Repeat
