Finders keepers losers weep  
Down on 42nd street  
Barefootchildren cryin myohmy  
I watched you on the avenue  
While other men were having you  
I think that you should led your caged bird fly  
  
And kiss your past goodbye  
Kiss your past goodbye  
Kiss your past goodbye  
Kiss your past goodbye  
  
Ive been so lost I must confess  
Ive had my share of loneliness  
But yeah its hard to keep a good man down  
The loves you lost were all in vain  
The past lives on inside your brain  
I dont think you need those memories  
Hangin round yeah  
Goodbye  
  
Kiss your past goodbye  
Youve gotta let if fly  
Kiss your past goodbye yeah  
And if that bird dont fly away  
Theres just one thing I got to say  
Its later than deuce a ticks  
Your broken heart it needs a fix  
Youre feedin off a high that would not last  
And people they dont seem to care  
And sorry just dont cut it yeah  
It seems to me youre gettin nowhere fast  
  
So kiss your past  
Or kiss your ass goodbye  
Kiss your past goodbye  
Theres no more tears to cry  
So kiss your past goodbye  
Or kiss your ass goodbye  
Yeah
