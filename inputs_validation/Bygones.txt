Naah laugh it off  
Cant laugh it off  
Naah laugh it off  
We cant let bygones be bygones anymore  
For this time we naah laugh it off  
Tell we when youre ready and well come settle the score  
But this time we naah laugh at all  
A prudent man he seeketh knowledge  
Im saying though  
Only a fool lean up on his folly  
The wicked heart knows pure bitterness  
Im saying though never get a righteous man vex  
Oh weve let bygones be bygones before  
But this time we naah laugh it off  
We wont let bygones be bygones anymore  
For this time we naah laugh at all  
This time we naah laugh it off  
Incomprehensible  
We cant let bygones be bygones anymore  
Oh this time we naah laugh it off  
Oh weve let bygones be bygones before  
But this time we naah laugh at all  
A prudent man he seeketh knowledge  
I tell you this only the fool lean up on the folly  
The wicked heart knows pure bitterness  
I tell you this never get a righteous man vex  
Weve let bygones be bygones before  
This time we naah laugh it off  
We cant let bygones be bygones anymore  
But this time we naah laugh at all  
Say this time me naah laugh it off  
Incomprehensible
