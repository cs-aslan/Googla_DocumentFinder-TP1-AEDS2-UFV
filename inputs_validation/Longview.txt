I sit around and watch the tube but nothings on  
I change the channels for an hour or two  
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit  
Im sick of all the same old shit  
In a house with unlocked doors  
And Im fucking lazy  
  
Bite my lip and close my eyes  
Take me away to paradise  
Im so damn bored Im going blind  
And I smell like shit  
  
Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving  
I sure as hell cant do it by myself  
Im feeling like a dog in heat  
Barred indoors from the summer street  
I locked the door to my own cell  
And I lost the key  
  
Bite my lip and close my eyes  
Take me away to paradise  
Im so damn bored Im going blind  
And I smell like shit  
  
I got no motivation  
Where is my motivation  
No time for motivation  
Smoking my inspiration  
  
I sit around and watch the phone but no ones calling  
Call me pathetic call me what you will  
My mother says to get a job  
But she dont like the one shes got  
When masturbations lost its fun  
Youre fucking lonely  
  
Bite my lip and close my eyes  
Take me away to paradise  
Im so damn bored Im going blind  
And loneliness has to suffice  
Bite my lip and close my eyes  
Slipping away to paradise  
Some say Quit or Ill go blind  
But its just a myth
