Youre one in a million a hundred to one shot  
I took a gamble and just lookie here what I got  
A diamond in the middle of a field full of stone  
And Im bettin everything I got  
Hey that you can keep me comin home  
  
Finders are keepers  
And Im keeping you as long as I can  
Finders are keepers  
So baby dont ever stop just keep on holdin my hand  
  
A needle in a haystack would be easy to do  
Compared to me finding somebody else like you  
I tell you chasing the perfect woman is just like rolling the dice  
Shes as pretty as a natural eleven  
And Im puttin my heart on the line  
  
Finders are keepers  
And Im keeping you as long as I can  
Finders are keepers  
So baby dont ever stop just keep on holdin my hand  
  
Finders are keepers  
So baby keep on keepin on with your lovin man
