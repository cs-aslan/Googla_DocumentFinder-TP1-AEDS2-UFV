Shes only eighteen  
Dont like the Rollin Stones  
She took a short cut  
To be in fully grown  
She got the mood ring  
Her little sister rose  
A smell of Springstein  
A pair of pantyhose  
  
Destructing pages show is leaking from a silhouette  
She said my man you know its time to get your fingers wet  
You hussle faster when you cant afford a cigarette  
The last I heard from you you were screamin Lavallette  
  
Knock to world  
Right off its feet and straight onto its head  
Oopala were lonely laughing after you are dead  
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said  
Make a play for all the brightest minds in life will share  
  
I heard some defunct  
Out on the road again  
Get your head shrunk is what I recommend  
Its on your bloodline  
A perfect Frankenstein  
Out on the lone pine  
Im gonna make you mine  
Its understood you wrap the fool right around my neck  
Youve got some glitter on ya kitty in the disco tech  
I put my lovin in your oven and I had to check  
The last I heard from you a you were screamin resurrect  
  
Knock to world  
Right off its feet and straight onto its head  
Oopala were lonely laughing after you are dead  
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said  
Make a play for all the brightest minds in life will share
