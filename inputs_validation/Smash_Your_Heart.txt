You cut me deep  
But now Im gonna see you weep yeah  
This broken man  
Is gonna do the best he can yeah  
  
Ill see you pay before I give you my heart  
Baby Ill do without  
Therell come a day  
When Ill smash your heart  
And then turn away  
  
You played with me like a toy  
And a little baby  
After I broke  
You just didnt want to know yeah  
  
Ill see you pay before I give you my heart  
Baby Ill do without  
Therell come a day  
When Ill smash your heart  
And then turn away  
  
My time will come  
And youll know when its begun yeah  
  
Youll know because  
Youre gonna be just where I was yeah  
  
Ill see you pay before I give you my heart  
Baby Ill do without  
Therell come a day  
When Ill smash your heart  
And then turn away
