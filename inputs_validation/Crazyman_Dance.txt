Well Im still here  
But Im so scared  
Got myself in trouble so much trouble  
I know Ive got to make it  
But I just cant take New York  
  
My middle name is fear  
I have a vacant stare  
And its been so long since my bodys been warm  
I know Ive got to make it  
But I just cant take New York  
  
I came here  
All dreams and wide eyes in the big big city  
No family no money  
And I dont even know whats hit me  
  
He hasnt seen a doctor  
Since he got here in the spring  
Went to the Medicentre  
But they wouldnt let him  
Without a green card  
Life can be so hard  
Take pity on a man without a home of his own  
How could he ever have known  
  
Every street and every corner  
Watch them drowning  
Watch them do the Crazyman dance  
Man and women to the slaughter  
We just stand and watch them  
Do the Crazyman dance  
  
Its been one whole year  
And its just not fair  
For all the pushing and shoving  
Ive still got nothing  
Im never gonna make it  
And Im stuck here in New York  
  
So people dont come near  
Unless youve a dollar to spare  
cause you know what they say  
About madmen on the subways of New York  
Believe it  
  
Yesterdays newspapers  
I wrap them around my body  
Outside these skyscrapers  
I wait for the night to hit me  
And boy does it hit me  
  
Every street and every corner  
Watch them drowning  
Watch them do the Crazyman dance  
For a nickel or a quarter  
For your pleasure  
Watch them do the Crazyman dance  
  
Im coming yo London  
Im coming to Paris  
Im coming yo make you good clean people embarressed  
Why dont you look at my face  
Why dont you look in my eyes  
Youd rather look at your feet  
Youd rather look at the skies  
  
Oh youd look anywhere  
But a man whose pure existence  
Says I aint got time  
And I dont care  
You just dont care  
Care
