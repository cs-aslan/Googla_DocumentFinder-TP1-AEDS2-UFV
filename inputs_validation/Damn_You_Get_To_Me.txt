Hey when I say things that bother you  
Dont be a stubborn man  
Dont leave me in the cold  
Remember who I am  
Damn you get to me  
When I cant get to you  
No fair youre silent and youre hurt  
And all I want to do  
Is know what Ive done wrong  
All I want to know is what to do  
Damn you get to me  
When I cant get to you  
Theres too much long distance  
In our love  
And tonight I need you  
Dont run away please let me know  
How Ive hurt you  
Hey its me see Im the lucky one  
Youve opened up my heart  
You led me by the hand  
You took me slow so I would understand  
Damn you got to me  
Let me get to you
