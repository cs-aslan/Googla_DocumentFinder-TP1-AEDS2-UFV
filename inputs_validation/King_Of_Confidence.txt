She had her mind made up just like her face  
She painted in the lines and shadows  
She shaded color in that would express  
The lonely mood that follows  
Love short and painful and tidy lies in selfdefense  
She just told a thing or two to the King of Confidence  
  
You said that he could tell her anything  
She even held him when he was crying  
And made her feel she was the only one  
You knew that he was lying when he said he was lying  
  
Love is short and painful that she finally made sense  
Of the love he had for the one and only King of Confidence  
  
Its hard enough to be your lover let alone your confidant  
You say you know what I need but you dont know who I want  
Its just another tawdry morning now  
Another tarnished farewell  
Your bodys tired and complaining now  
But youre too tore down to tell  
  
Love is short and painful all you kind ladies and gents  
I spent years in a couple of days as the King of Confidence
