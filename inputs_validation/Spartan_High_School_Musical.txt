Today Im starting High School  
Where boys are turned to men  
I packed my sword and shield  
We dont use paper and pen  
Everyones a jock here  
We dont have Spartan nerds  
The weedy kids were left to die  
As breakfast for the birds  
  
Were taught to love a fight  
Were taught not to be meek  
And if were good they feed us  
Three square meals every week  
  
Lets go fighting now  
Fighting is exciting now  
Rocking at the Spartan School  
  
A Spartan kindergarten  
Im the boss thats understood  
I smack them if theyre naughty  
And I thwack them if theyre good  
Im feeling rather peckish  
Im gonna steal some food  
Caught Ill have to punish you  
Ungrateful Spartan brood  
  
We promise not to steal  
Were not the thieving sort  
Stealing is considered good  
Whats bad is getting caught  
  
Lets get beating now  
Learn lies and cheating now  
Rolling at the Spartan School  
  
We have a bunch of contests  
To see who is the best  
The leanest meanest  
Roughest toughest Spartan contest  
This one is my favourite game  
Lashings of good fun  
Didnt feel a thing  
I want my mum  
  
We passed our last exam  
And its Spartan graduation  
Straight away we go to work  
No time for celebration  
Ten years active service  
In the army  
No diversion  
Theres only one job for a Spartan  
Killing lots of Persians  
  
Wondering about love  
Its banned until youre thirty  
High School doesnt teach romance  
It teaches fighting dirty  
  
Lets go fighting now  
Fighting is exciting now  
Rocking at the Spartan School  
  
Lets get beating now  
Learn lies and cheating now  
Rolling at the Spartan School
