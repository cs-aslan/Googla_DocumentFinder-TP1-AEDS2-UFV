Dolly Parton  
Oh youre out there tonight with another  
And my pain is so dreadfully sharp  
I picture you with her and shudder  
Its like a dagger through the heart  
Do you think that my feelings dont matter  
Or your cheatin or hurtful remarks  
When you leave me all broken and shattered  
Its like a dagger through the heart  
Oh I know Im a fool to keep stayin  
When youve made hurtin me such an art  
Tossed around like a used box of crayons  
Its like a dagger through the heart  
Oh you cut me to pieces so often  
Like a knife or a poisonous dart  
I would be better off in my coffin  
Its like a dagger through the heart  
Oh I know Im a fool to keep stayin  
When youve made hurtin me such an art  
Tossed around like a used box of crayons  
Its like a dagger through the heart  
Like a dagger through the heart through the heart
