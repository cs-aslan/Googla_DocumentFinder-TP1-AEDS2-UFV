Childrens choir singing in the background  
  
Have no fear  
When darkness falls  
Cause theres a light that shines  
Within us all  
  
Although this world  
Can turn so cold  
When we reach inside  
We find our warmth  
  
Cause theres a flame that burns  
In every heart  
And its the will we have  
That lights the spark  
  
Chorus  
Once in every lifetime  
Theres a chance to stand apart  
We can show the world  
Our very best  
Reveal whats in our heart  
So the story goes and glory  
Never will end  
Inspiration lights the fire within  
  
And if we fall  
We wont stay down  
We will get back up  
And use the strength weve found  
  
And we will rise  
Like champions  
Every obstacle  
Well overcome  
  
Chorus  
  
And if we just stay strong  
Then our hearts will move us on  
  
Chorus  
  
Each heart there burns desire  
Inspiration lights the fire within
