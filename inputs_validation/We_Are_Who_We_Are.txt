Momma momma momma made me the way I am  
My face my eyes someone turn me up Im speaking my mind  
And I and I Ive been wasting a lot of time looking in mirrors  
And hating on me but now I like what I see  
  
I know I know I never be perfect  
I know I know but Im gonna work it  
Let go let go put your new shoes on  
The new you on  
  
We are who we are who we are prettys just a petty word  
And Im gonna shine like a star cause Im the only me in this world  
Throw away the books and the magazines Im never gonna look like a beauty
queen  
We are who we are who we are and Im just doing me just doing me  
  
And Im just doing me just doing me  
  
Momma momma momma made me the way I am  
She told me I should look up on the world with my head held high  
And I and I Ive been wasting a lot of time looking in mirrors  
And hating on me but now I like what I see  
  
I know I know I never be perfect  
I know I know but Im gonna work it  
Let go let go put your new shoes on  
The new you on  
  
We are who we are who we are prettys just a petty word  
And Im gonna shine like a star cause Im the only me in this world  
Throw away the books and the magazines Im never gonna look like a beauty
