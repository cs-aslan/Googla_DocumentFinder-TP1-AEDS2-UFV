This nine pound hammer  
Is a little too heavy  
For my side baby for my side  
  
Im agoin to the mountain  
Gonna see my baby  
But I aint comin back  
No I aint comin back  
  
Roll on buddy  
Dont ya roll so slow  
How can I roll  
When my wheels wont go  
  
Well its a long way to Harlan  
Its a long way to hazard  
Just to get a little brew  
Just to get a little brew  
  
When Im long gone  
Dont you make my tombstone  
Outta number nine coal  
Outta number nine coal
