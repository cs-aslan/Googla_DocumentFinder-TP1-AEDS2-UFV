I am the message centre  
Local and direct  
Room to room  
An operator  
No calls today dear  
Theyll just have to wait dear  
I call  
And I collect  
So just strike him softly  
Away from the body  
Youre made up too shiny today  
Theres so much trouble  
Your thoughts are just  
Pissing away  
Its so much trouble  
I am a manager  
And I am in control  
As the local delegator  
No calls today dear  
Theyll just have to wait dear  
I offer no guarantee at all  
So dont take it lightly  
You passed your sellby date  
Youre made up too shiny today  
Its so much trouble  
Your thoughts are just  
Pissing away  
Its so much trouble  
A new typeface  
A new day  
Its so much trouble  
You cant remember ten minutes ago  
Its so much trouble  
Too much trouble
