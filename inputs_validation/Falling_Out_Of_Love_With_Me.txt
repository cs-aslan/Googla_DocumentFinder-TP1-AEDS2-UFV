  
Hardest thing Ive ever done or that Ill ever do  
Was to just walk off and leave you but I knew I had to leave you  
Cause I couldnt stay and watch you falling out of love with me  
The worst pain Ive ever known or that Ill ever know  
Was to see your love a dying and I have to watch it dying  
And I couldnt stand to watch you falling out of love with me  
  
Its hurting now but still its better I left while love was still alive  
It was dying and Id rather I didnt have to watch it die  
  
The deepest hurt Ive ever felt or that Ill ever feel  
Was to know that I was losing and I tried but I keep losing  
And I couldnt stay and watch you falling out of love with me  
  
The loneliest Ive ever been or that Ill ever be  
Is now that Im without you and I feel so lost without you  
But I couldnt stay and watch you falling out of love with me  
  
Its hurting now but still its better I left while love was still alive  
It was dying and Id rather I didnt have to watch it die  
It was dying and Id rather I didnt have to watch it die
