Never too soon to be through  
Being cool too much too soon  
Too much for me too much for you  
Youre gonna loose in time  
Every turn looking to burn  
Some never learn live and learn  
Stop your searching for a curse  
Before you end up in a hearse  
Dont be afraid to show your friends  
That you hurt inside inside  
Pains part of life dont hide behind your false pride  
Its a lie your lie  
Dont slip away and dont forget  
Ill give you more than you can get  
Its so lonely when you dont even know  
Yourself come to me  
If you see me getting mighty  
If you see me getting high  
Knock me down  
Im not bigger than life  
Im tired of being untouchable  
Im not above the love  
Im part of you and youre part of me  
Why did you go away  
Too late to tell you how I feel  
I want you back but I get real  
Can you hear my falling tears  
Making rain where you lay  
Finding what youre looking for  
Can end up being such a bore  
I pray for you most every day  
My loves with you now fly away  
If you see me getting mighty  
If you see me getting high  
Knock me down  
Im not bigger than life  
Its so lonely when you dont even know yourself
