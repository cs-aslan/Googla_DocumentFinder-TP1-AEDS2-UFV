ooooUooooHooooMmmmMmm  
Love sometimes  
Can be like Destiny  
Theres no way to say forever  
May not realize your dreams  
And love sometimes  
Is like the blowin wind  
It can take us to wherever  
Sending us on silent wings  
But I have broken  
All the rules of love  
I never dreamed that  
I could come this far  
And now Im lost in my emotions  
Youre becoming my devotion  
Theres nothing I can do  
To stop this love for you  
I was not supposed to  
Fall in love with you  
I have someone else  
Someone else is loving you  
And I was not supposed to  
Let this love get through  
let love get through  
So let me say for real  
Heavens what I feel  
When Im with you  
this feeling is forever  
It is forever  
you make me feel like heaven  
I feel like heaven  
my love is true when Im with youoohooohyouooo  
How could I have  
Known that in your eyes  
in your eyes  
I would find the deepest answer  
To the questions of my heart  
And how could I have known  
That by your side  
by your side  
Was the light to fill the darkness  
And the shadows of my life  
But I have broken  
All the rules of love  
I never dreamed that I  
Could come this far  
And now Im lost in my emotion  
Youre becoming my devotion  
Theres nothing I can do  
To stop this love for you  
I was not supposed to  
Fall in love with you  
I have someone else  
Someone else is loving you  
And I was not supposed to  
Let this love get through  
let love get through  
So let me say for real  
Heavens what I feel  
When Im with you  
this feeling is forever
