Daddy was a Cajun raised on Southern land  
And so my kinfolks tell me was a streetfightin man  
Well they rushed him down to see the doctor  
Hey doctor wont you check his head  
The only thing that was wrong with him  
Was Johnny Walkers Red  
He drank ole poison whiskey  
Til it killed him dead  
  
It happened back in the bayou many years ago  
Satan came to take him and he did it real slow  
Well they rushed him back to see the doctor  
The doctor just shook his head  
Twenty years of rotgut whiskey  
Done killed the poor man dead  
He drank ole poison whiskey  
Til it killed him dead  
  
Take a tip from me people brothers cant you see  
Aint no future in ole poison whiskey  
Theyre gonna rush you down to see the doctor  
The doctors gonna shake his head  
The only thing hes gonna tell ya  
Stop drinkin Johnny Walkers Red  
Dont drink poison whiskey dont you drink it boy
