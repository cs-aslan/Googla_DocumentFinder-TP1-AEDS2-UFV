Youre cryin now just like I used to cry before rain rain rain  
Turn off the tears girl I dont care anymore  
You can save all your lies cause Ive heard them all before  
  
Tell it to the rain and the stars that shine above  
That its me youre thinking of  
And Im your love 3 Forget him love  
  
Tell it to the rain  
  
I gave you love girl and got nothing in return rain rain rain  
How does it feel to feel what I had to learn  
Baby dont say youre sorry cause Im just not concerned  
  
Tell it baby yeah  
Tell it baby yeah  
Tell it baby  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
