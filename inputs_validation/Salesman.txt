Salesman  
  
Now well I tried the one that you put it in and you have to do it  
Manually But Id like the one that you just plug it in and it does it all  
By itself in a real long strand and you cut em up Its easier to do it  
That way because well I put all the stuff in there and it keeps flippin  
Out And I cant get the thing to stick together anything Coupled with  
The fact that I have to stick two of them together to even get on out of it  
And they always end up lookin like Lucky Strikes
