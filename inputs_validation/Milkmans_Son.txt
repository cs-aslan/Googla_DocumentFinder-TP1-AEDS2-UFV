Let the burning bridges tumble down  
Let the water come and flood the ground  
Burn a hole into this auburn sky  
I only wanna be walking by your side  
  
When I see tomorrow I see you there  
When I look around I see you everywhere  
Your face is etched into my mind  
And when its all said and done  
Im feeling like the milkmans son  
  
Let your dark spirits fly away  
Come again but you wont count again  
Spend the last time of my worthless life  
I only wanna be walking by your side  
  
When I see tomorrow I see you there  
When I look around I see you everywhere  
Your face is etched into my mind  
And when its all said and done  
Im feeling like the milkmans son
