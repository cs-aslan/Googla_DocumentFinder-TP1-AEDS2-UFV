Mr Whitey Ford  
I see the nightmare inside  
Of your American Dream  
Im screaming  
Bismi allah alrahman alraheem  
With your fascist regime  
And racist magazines  
Trying to ruin peoples livelyhood  
Youre all hoods  
All their tricks and bedfellows  
Theres safety in numbers  
Cause some cats are fighters and  
Some cats are runners  
Big game hunters assassin made politicans  
While corporate ceos  
Got their ruthless ambitions  
Nostradamus premonitions  
They see the end coming  
Every kid from the suburb  
A hundered miles and runnin  
The influence is stunnin  
Enough to make you stagger  
Cause prepschool Johnny  
Got some thug in his swagger  
Take seven politicians  
Put them in a line  
Take seven Hollow Points  
Put them in my Nine  
Ill give them seven more minutes  
For some prayin time  
Then Ill pull back my trigger  
And Ill blow your mind
