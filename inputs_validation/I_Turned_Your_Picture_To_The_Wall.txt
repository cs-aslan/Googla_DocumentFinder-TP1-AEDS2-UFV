I turned your picture to the wall  
I dont wanna see you anymore  
You once were nice to me  
Sugar and spice to me  
Now youre as salty as you can be  
  
We had some good times I recall  
We dont ever have them anymore  
Now you just lie to me  
Then say goodbye to me  
I cant believe this is happening to me  
  
When I call you on the phone  
You are never there  
And I sit home all alone  
You dont even care  
  
So Ill just turn your picture to the wall  
I aint gonna see you anymore  
Its all a memory  
Now it can never be  
Ill never see you at all  
Cause I will just turn your picture to the wall
