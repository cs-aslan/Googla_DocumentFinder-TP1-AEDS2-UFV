Its been a while since Ive seen your face  
Its been a while since Ive walked this place  
I see the monkeys riding on their bikesRacing through the impossible night  
You say youre feeling like a new tree  
  
Man theyll cut you from limb to limb  
Pick your pocket with such delightShake it to the rightShake it in the light  
Oh cant you see the glitter  
The glitter in their eyesOh cant you see the glitter  
  
The glitter in their eyes  
Genius stalking in new shoesHave you got WTO bluesDust of diamonds  
Making you sneeze  
Kids on rollers ready for  
  
Running through the junkyards  
Breezing through the hallsRacing through the malls  
Walking through the walls  
Theyll strip your mind  
  
Just for fun  
Quoth the ravenYum yum yum  
  
Children children everywhere  
Selling souls for souvenirsTheyve been sold out like as not  
Just for chunks of Ankgor Vat  
  
Theyll trade you up  
Trade you downYour body a commodity  
Our sacred stage  
Has been defacedReplaced to graceThe marketplaceDow is jonesing at the bit42nd
Disney StreetRagged hearts unravelingLook out kidsThe gleam the gleam  
All that glittersIs not all that glittersIs not all that glitters
