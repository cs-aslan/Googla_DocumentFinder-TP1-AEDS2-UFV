In this approximately infinite universe  
I know a girl whos in constant hell  
No love or pill could keep her cool  
Cause theres a thousand holes in her heart  
  
And the wind of the past blows through her heart  
Reminding her of the people she killed  
Wind of now blows off her cool  
Telling her theres something shes missed  
  
You know the town of Sapporo she says  
Where the men talk rough and never sing  
Two bottles of loneliness  
Patching the holes in her dream  
  
In this approximately infinite universe  
I know a girl whos raising constant hell  
No love or bottle could fix her good  
Cause theres a thousand holes in her head  
  
And the wind of the future blows through her head  
Saying theres no point of return  
The wind of the universe blows off her soul  
Telling her theres nowhere to go  
  
I wanna sleep wanna sleep she says  
And take her fix to bed  
Two bottles of loneliness  
Patching the holes in her dream
