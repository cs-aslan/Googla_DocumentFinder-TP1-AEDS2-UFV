I add two and two the most simple addition  
Then swear that the figures are lying  
Im a much better comic then mathematician  
Cause Im better on stage than at intermission  
  
And as far as the man is concerned  
If Ive been burned well I havent learn  
I know hes around when the sky and the ground starting ringing  
I know that hes near by the thunder I hear in advance  
  
His words and his words alone  
Are the words that can start me heart singing  
And his is the only music that makes me dance  
Hell sleep and he lies in the light of two eyes  
That adore him  
  
Oh bore him it might but he wont leave me sight  
For a glance  
In every way every single day  
I need less of myself I need more him more him  
And his is the only music that makes dance  
Yes his is the only music that makes dance
