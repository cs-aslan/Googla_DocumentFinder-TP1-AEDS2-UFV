Didnt notice I was gone  
Cause you were tying up your arm  
Oh  
And when I stand on my head  
  
You never react  
I cant get you to crack  
I cant get you to crack  
Not one fucking smile  
  
And when it comes right down to it  
Im gonna run right back to him  
I want a peace mapped out  
Cause I really love his stoneface oh  
  
I really love his stoneface oh  
I really love it  
A snaky goddess got my man man  
That kind of love dont understand  
  
Him  
Oh oh  
And when I swallow my gum  
You never react  
  
I cant get you to crack  
I cant get you to crack  
Not one fucking smile  
And when it comes right down to it  
  
Im gonna run right back to him  
I want a peace mapped out  
Cause I really love his stoneface oh  
I really love his stoneface oh  
  
I really love it  
Swallow hard until you  
Ill be the one to thrill you  
Ill be the first to kill you  
  
And if you wont die I will  
When I shortsheet the bed  
You never react  
I cant get you to crack  
  
I cant get you to crack  
I cant get you to crack  
I cant get you to crack  
I cant get you to crack  
  
Not one fucking smile  
And when it comes right down to it  
Im gonna run right back to him  
I want a piece knocked out of him  
  
I really love his stoneface oh  
I really love his stoneface oh  
I really love it
