A letter come blowin in  
On an ill wind  
Somethin bout me and you  
Never seein one another again  
  
And what I knew had come  
Stars struck deaf and dumb  
Like when we kissed  
That taste of blood on your tongue  
  
Chorus x 2  
Dont worry darlin  
No baby dont you fret  
Were livin in the future  
And none of this has happened yet  
  
Woke up election day  
Skys gunpowder and shades of grey  
Beneath the dirty sun  
I whistle my time away  
  
Then just about sun down  
You come walkin through town  
Your boot heels clickin like  
The barrel of a pistol spinnin round  
  
Chorus  
  
The earth it gave away  
The sea rose towards the sun  
I opened up my heart to you  
It got all damaged and undone  
  
My ship Liberty sailed away  
On a bloody red horizon  
The grounds keeper opened the gates  
And let the wild dogs run  
  
Alone I limp through town  
A lost cowboy at sundown  
Got my monkey on a leash  
Got my ear tuned to the ground  
  
My faiths been torn asunder  
Tell me is that rollin thunder  
Or just the sinkin sound  
Of somethin righteous goin under  
  
Chorus  
  
None of this has happened yet  
None of this has happened yet  
None of this has happened yet  
None of this has happened yet  
  
Na na na na na na na nana Repeat until fade
