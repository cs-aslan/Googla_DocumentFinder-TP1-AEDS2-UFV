If you see her down at a local bar  
Showin all the signs of a lonely heart  
Dont you be concerned  
There aint nothin wrong  
Its not her fault  
She gets that way when Im gone  
  
If shes on the floor for a dance or two  
Dont mean shes lookin for a rendezvous  
Shell only be in his arms  
Til the end of the song  
Theres no harm done  
She gets that way when Im gone  
  
She gets that way but I understand  
I know in her heart that Im her only man  
And I cant stand to think of her home all alone  
  
So I really dont mind if she paints the town red  
What we feel inside doesnt have to be said  
Its a matter of trust  
And I know our love is strong  
Thats why I dont worry none  
She gets that way when Im gone  
  
She gets a little restless but I dont mind  
Cause a woman like her  
Surely deserves to have herself a real good time  
  
So I really dont mind if she paints the town red  
What we feel inside doesnt have to be said  
Its a matter of trust  
And I know our love is strong  
Thats why I dont worry none  
She gets that way when Im gone  
  
No its not her fault  
She gets that way when Im gone  
  
No theres no harm done  
She gets that way when Im gone
