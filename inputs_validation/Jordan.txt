Come in as you tread lifes journey  
Take Jesus as your daily guide  
Though you may feel pure and safely  
Without Him walking by your side  
But when you come to make the crossing  
At the ending of your pilgrims way  
If you ever will meet our Savior  
Youll surely meet Him on that day  
  
Now look at that cold Jordan  
Look at these deep waters  
Look at that wide river  
Oh hear the mighty billows roar  
Youd better take Jesus with you  
Hes a true companion  
For Im sure without Him  
That you never will make it oer  
  
That awful Day of Judgment  
Is coming in the by and by  
Well see our Lord descending  
In Glory from on high  
So let us keep in touch with Jesus  
And in his grace the Love of God  
That we may be ever called ready  
When He calls us over Jordans Tide  
  
Now look at that cold Jordan  
Look at these deep waters  
Look at that wide river  
Oh hear the mighty billows roar  
Youd better take Jesus with you  
Hes a true companion  
For Im sure without Him  
That you never will make it oer  
  
Oh what what you gonna do  
Oh what what you gonna do  
Oh how how you gonna feel  
When you come to the end of the Way
