So I think I got it all in place now  
No distractions under control  
Yet theres something missing inside me  
Im chasing shadows of myself  
And the clocks are ticking  
Oh my world is spinning  
Spinning round and round  
And round and round again  
  
Chorus  
And I try  
I try to reason why  
Dont you know I cant go on this way  
Baby please dont walk away there is this place  
Where I toss away my pride  
So you can see that Im the one  
To take you to a higher place this time  
  
I am on the outside looking in  
To a place where I will be  
Let me give you what you need from me  
I surrender my soul to you  
And my heart is pounding  
And a fires burning  
And my head is spinning round and round again  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh I crash and burn inside my mind  
It happens time and time again I cant explain the way you make me feel  
Oh I know I dont have much to give  
But what I have I give to you with all the madness left inside of me  
With the madness left inside of me oh  
  
Chorus
