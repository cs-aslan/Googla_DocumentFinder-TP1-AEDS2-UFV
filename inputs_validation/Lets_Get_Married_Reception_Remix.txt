Chorus  
Just gots me a crib and a new car too  
I got the ring but I gotta have you babe  
Cmon lets get married babe  
Cmon lets get married  
Lets have some kids with a dog with a house  
A lil white fence just like this babe  
Cmon lets get married babe  
Lets get married  
  
Jagged Edge  
Meet me at the alter  
In your white dress your white dress  
You wont ever need another man  
You never ever want from another thing no  
Ive been feeling you  
I must confess must confess  
Aint no gonna break this thang up  
I aint going nowhere no  
Cuz when I think about you and think about me  
Plain to see that we might as well do it do it  
  
Chorus  
  
Jagged Edge  
Said you want some karats  
Babe how bout ten how bout ten  
Is it good enough for you to brag on  
When you show your friends show your friends  
I just want to be with you  
Girl there aint I think I wont do  
Want you to be the one to say I do  
We can start a family  
Cuz when I think about you and think about me  
Plain to see that we might as well do it do it  
  
Chorus  
  
Kanye West  
With my tuxedo  
He asked me do you take this  
Woman to hold and keep the safest  
Plus to lace her floss wit paper  
Crib and a car man you know tha basics  
Diamonds your bestfriend  
That makes sense because  
Your a princess and you deserve the princess cuts  
But as long as you gots your defenses up  
You can never get the love that was meant for ya  
Shouldnt you know that I use to come through wanna  
Club  
Real thugs dont never fall in love  
Always on the go for the do  
Man I had to take to smits some cutie  
Since my money get right theses days  
I wanna give you more ice than the ice capades  
I gots the church the ring  
Theres something Im forgetting  
Oh we gotta have J E Sing at the wedding  
  
Chorus  
  
Hes straight out of a neighborhood where niggaz hate  
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate  
Their stomaches ache while hes loungin in the big estate  
And he hops in a hundred thousand when a nigga scape  
Houses with a bigger gate houndin hims a big mistake  
He wont surrender hell rather give up a rib to break  
Cuz he remembers when they wouldnt lend a helpin hand  
Til he was sittin on green like a Celtic fan  
Created a buzz til where you gotta mention his name  
When you discussin the illest player thats in the game  
And hes ridin with Em 50 Cent Doc and them  
GUnit Records aint no motherfuckin stoppin them
