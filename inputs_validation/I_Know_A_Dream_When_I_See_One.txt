I know a dream when I see one  
For Im a dreamer you know  
I know a dream when I hold one  
Do you mind if I never let you go  
Im so afraid if I kiss you  
Youll vanish as dreams always do  
But make no mistake although Im wide awake  
I know a dream when I see one  
And I see one when I look at you  
But make no mistake although Im wide awake  
I know a dream when I see one  
And I see one when I look at you
