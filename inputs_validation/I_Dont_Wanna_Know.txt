Somebody said they saw you  
The person you were kissin wasnt me  
And I would never ask you  
I just kept it to myself  
  
I dont wanna know  
If your playin me  
Keep it on the low  
Cause my heart cant take it anymore  
And if your creepin  
Please dont let it show  
Oh baby I dont wanna know  
  
I think about it when I hold you  
When lookin in your eyes I cant believe  
I dont need to know the truth  
Baby keep it to yourself  
  
I dont wanna know  
If youre playin me  
Keep it on the low  
Cause my heart cant take it anymore  
And if youre creepin  
Please dont let it show  
Oh baby I dont wanna know  
  
Does he touch you better then me  
Does he watch ya fall asleep  
Does he show you love this way  
And the things you do to me  
If your better off that way  
Baby all that I can say  
Is go on and do your thing and dont come back to me  
  
P diddy  
  
I know where your whereabouts  
Or how your movin  
I know when you in the house  
Or when your cruising  
Its been proven  
My love you abusing  
I cant understand how a man got you chosen  
Undecided I came and provided my undivided  
But you came and denied it  
Dont even try it  
I know when you lying  
Dont even do that  
I know why you crying  
Im not applyin no pressure  
Just wanna let you know  
That I dont wanna let you go  
And I dont wanna let you leave  
Cant say I didnt let you breathe  
Gave you extra cheese  
Put you in the S You V  
You wanted ice so I made you freeze  
Made you hot like the west indies  
Now its time you invest in me  
Cause if not then its best you leave  
Holla  
  
I dont wanna know  
If youre playin me  
Keep it on the low  
Cause my heart cant take it anymore  
And if youre creepin  
Please dont let it show  
Oh baby  
X3
