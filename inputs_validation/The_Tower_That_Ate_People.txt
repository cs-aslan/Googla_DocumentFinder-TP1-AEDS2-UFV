Theres a bump in the basement  
Theres a knocking on the wall  
In the pumping of the pistons  
I swear I heard your call  
Theres a bump in the basement  
Theres a hole in the floor  
Theres a guard in the garden  
Locking up the door  
  
Theres a rumble in the floorboards  
No shutting out the sound  
And the workers are below me  
Digging underground  
Feel the building all around me  
Like a wrap of armoured skin  
But the more we are protected  
The more were trapped within  
  
Tell it like it is  
Till theres no misunderstanding  
When You strip it right back  
Man feed machine  
Machine feed man  
  
Tell it like it is  
Till theres no misunderstanding  
Make up what you like  
Man feed machine  
Machine feed man  
  
Brick by brick  
Brick by brick  
Brick by brick  
Were building
