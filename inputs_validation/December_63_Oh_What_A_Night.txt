Oh what a night  
Late December back in sixtythree  
What a very special time for me  
Ill remember what a night  
  
Oh what a night  
No I didnt even know her name  
But Im never gonna be the same  
What a lady what a night  
  
Oh I I had a funny feeling when she walked into the room  
And I as I recall it ended much too soon  
Oh what a night  
  
Hypnotized and mesmorizing me  
She was everything I dreamed shed be  
Sweet surender what a night  
  
I felt the rush at the rolling balls of thunder  
Spinning my head around and taking my body under  
Oh what a night  
  
Whyd it take so long to see the light  
Seemed so wrong but now it seemed so right  
What a lady what a night
