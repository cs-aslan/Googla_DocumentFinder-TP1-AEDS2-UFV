What am I gonna do now that youre gone  
What am I gonna do now that youre gone  
Looking back how I wish I had told you what was on my mind  
Looking back wish I had said what was on my mind  
Reason away reason away I cant reason away my pain  
I cannot ease my pain  
  
What am I gonna do now that youre gone  
What am I gonna do now that youre gone  
I turn out the lights and Im alone  
Youre not coming home  
I miss your skin on my skin  
  
This feeling I know cant be compared  
Nothing can replace  
The feel of your skin on my skin  
Im mystified dont know how I let you slip away  
Mystified dont know how I let you slip away  
Come back baby come back is all that I can say  
  
Come back baby is all I can say  
I turn out the lights and Im alone  
Youre not coming home  
I miss your skin on my skin  
This feeling I know cant be compared  
Nothing can replace  
  
The feel of your skin on my skin  
Missin Im missin  
the feel of your skin  
Missin Im missin missin  
On my skin  
Missin Im missin  
Missin Im missin missin
