Well Ive seen all there is to see  
And Ive heard all they have to say  
Ive done everything I wanted to do     
Ive done that too  
And it aint that pretty at all  
Aint that pretty at all  
So Im going to hurl myself against the wall  
Cause Id rather feel bad than not feel anything at all  
You know I just had a short vacation Roy  
Spent it getting a root canal  
Oh howd you like it  
Well it aint that pretty at all  
So Im going to hurl myself against the wall  
Cause Id rather feel bad than not feel anything at all  
Gonna get a good running start and throw myself at the wall as hard as I can
man  
Ive been to Paris  
And it aint that pretty at all  
Ive been to Rome  
Guess what  
Id like to go back to Paris someday and visit the Louvre Museum  
Get a good running start and hurl myself at the wall  
Going to hurl myself against the wall  
Cause Id rather feel bad than feel nothing at all  
And it aint that pretty at all  
Aint that pretty at all
