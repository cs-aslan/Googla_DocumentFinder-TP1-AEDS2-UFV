Unhappy days that left us on the floor  
And you breathe me til youre not feeling sure  
Everything will brighten up  
If we go to Brighton Ill take you along the pier  
Everything will lighten up  
If you feel too frightened Ill make it disappear dear  
  
And darling dont be nervous  
Ill understand if youll let me go  
I did this on purpose now  
  
And when Im missing you Ill stop eating food  
And Ill squeeze into a dress so I can be like you  
And then Ill see your bitterness and why youre leaving too  
Maybe Ill put you to a test and say that I love you  
I think that I love you  
  
And sunny days that left my skin bright red  
And you squeeze me til these thoughts leave my head  
If it gets too complicated  
Ill keep up and be frustrated can you see whats wrong  
If you feel like youve been hated  
This loves too overrated see whats going on on  
  
And darling dont be nervous  
Ill understand if youll let me go  
I did this on purpose now  
  
And when Im missing you Ill stop eating food  
And Ill squeeze into a dress so I can be like you  
And then Ill see your bitterness and why youre leaving too  
Maybe Ill put you to a test and say that I love you  
I think that I love you  
  
Take me back to live at home  
And take me back to Albert Road  
  
Now Im missing you Ive stopped eating food  
And Ive squeezed into your dress so I can feel like you  
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too  
I thought Id put you to a test and say that I love you  
I think that I love you  
  
And Ive stopped eating food  
And Ive squeezed into your dress so I could feel like you  
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too  
Maybe Ill put you to a test and say that I love you  
Now it seems you loved me too
