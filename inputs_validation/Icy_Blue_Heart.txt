She came on to him like a slow moving cold front  
His beer was warmer than the look in her eye  
She sat on a stool he said what do you want  
She said give me a love that dont freeze up inside  
  
He said I have melted some hearts in my time dear  
But to sit next to you lord I shiver and shake  
And if I knew love dont think Id be here  
Asking myself if I have what it takes  
  
To melt your icy blue heart  
Should I start  
To turn whats been frozen for years  
Into a river of tears  
  
These days we all play cool calm and collected  
Why our lips could turn blue shootin the breeze  
But under the frost thought he detected  
A warm blush of red and a touch of her knees  
  
He said girl youve a beauty like Ive never witnessed  
And Ive seen the northern lights dance in the air  
But Ive felt the cold follow the first kiss  
And theres not enough heat in the fire burning there  
  
To melt your icy blue heart  
Should I start  
To turn whats been frozen for years  
Into a river of tears  
  
To melt your icy blue heart  
Should I start  
To turn whats been frozen for years  
Into a river of tears
