You mean more to me  
Than words can ever say  
Just to hold your hand  
And to know our love will stay  
Feels so right  
Youre in my arms my love  
Tonight  
  
Oh you  
You mean more to me  
Than any love Ive ever known  
And i want to give you all my love  
Just you alone  
  
Oh  
Youre all my dreams come true  
Theres so much joy in your eyes  
And all the love you give  
Youve finally made me realize  
Youre all i need  
  
Oh you  
You mean more to me  
Than words can ever say
