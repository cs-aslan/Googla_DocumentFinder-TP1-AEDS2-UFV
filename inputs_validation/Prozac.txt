Verse 1  
Stop as I drop this bomb  
Blow up this place like another vietnam  
Im heavy like a holyfield blow to the dome  
Back up son now give me room give me room  
I set it off like this dont give it up uh  
Im all up in you till you just cant get enough  
Im real hard to the bone you want more  
I sneak up on you like a sniper at your back door  
Phat flavor for your brain you know the time  
So check the wrath its for real cause Im gonna get mine  
I roll up on you like eastwood  
Im blowing up fifteens as Im riding through your neighborhood  
I spreads butter like parkay  
Real smooth with the flow and even when I parlay  
Do what you feel and check the skill  
Im in your grill peep this  I got the raw deal  
And in your jeep cherokee or land cruiser  
When youre rolling through the hood I know youre gonna use a  
Track like this all up in your eardrum  
So pump the eq and let the speakers hum  
Chorus  
We gets crazy like prozac  
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack  
We gets crazy like prozac  
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack  
We gets crazy like prozac  
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack  
We gets crazy like prozac  
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack  
Verse 2  
Go and check it I think its time to wreck it  
Here I come again with my stuff so lets test it  
Im cool like the ice or vanilla hear my flavor  
Freezin up the mic I hit you with somethin you can savor  
No slippin no stonin I am gettin to the point  
So hit the mad ism and light another joint  
The easy like stylist with a kick when Im kicking  
No tripping Im hitting so get a good grip in  
Get with a style I be using and theres no dissin  
And heres a quick lesson  I carry a smith and wesson  
Listen up close and therell be no confusion  
Now youre addicted to mentally abusing  
Word to the mother Im hear to tear it up  
And if you cant get with it I dont give a fuck  
So run to your crew and tell them I am hear  
This here is for the people  
Chorus  
Its the funky rhyme killer  
The dope song thriller  
Get your ass back before you get caps in ya  
Its the funky rhyme killer  
The dope song thriller  
Get your ass back before you get caps in ya  
Its the funky rhyme killer  
The dope song thriller  
Get your ass back before you get caps in ya  
Chorus
