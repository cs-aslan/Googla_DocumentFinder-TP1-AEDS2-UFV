You got me sitting up on the shelf  
While youre out bewitching someone else  
Do I live Do I die  
Do I laugh Do I cry  
What game am I supposed to loose this time

You got chains attached to my head  
You spreading magic honey all in your bed  
What is it you want  
Just a puppet that talks  
Or maybe just a lover who makes love to the Dead  
  
Step onto the stage Just a few more minutes  
Lets see what kind of juggler you really are  
Say without that whip and those Bloody Boots  
Which are rented You actually could become  
A morning star  
But you rang your last bell  
Even your planets theyve gone to hell  
And your world turns to nothing but a bubble  
In a shotgun jar  
And now you dont know who you really are

So instead of trying to make me your slave  
Why dont you just Call it a day  
Either way Im gonna win  
So save yourself some wind  
Dont make me to be the last to see  
You to your grave  
Well well Ball and Chain For sale  
New day come Masters gone to Hell  
Well well Ball and Chain For sale  
Sunrise come Masters dying in Hell
