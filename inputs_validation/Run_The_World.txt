We got it locked they know that  
Whenever we around it goes down like Draino  
And its nothing to spend these pesos  
And you will never see us with a fake one  
You can call it in the low low  
Police on our arms with a thousand in the trunk  
Aint nothing greater hanging out the window  
Straight busting at you law haters  
  
Bonny Clyde  
No other girl will ever ride like I ride  
Thats why you need me on your passenger side  
Let me help you get that paper  
Hanging out the window busting at them love haters  
Me and you  
Im the closest youll ever be to truth  
Theres never a question of what Ill do  
Uh huh for you with me youll never lose so  
  
Chorus  
Call on your girl that can hold you right  
Ill be your protector Ill never forget you  
You need somebody that can hold you tight  
Ill be in your arm love  
Keep you out of harm boy  
Ill be your anything everything  
Rockin roll with you  
If things get to hot out in the cold with you  
Froze froze with you me and you together  
Our love could run the world uhoh uhoh  
Run the world uhoh uhoh  
Our love could run the world uhoh uhoh  
Run the world uhoh uhoh  
Our love could run the world  
Ill be your anything everything rockin roll with you  
If things get too hot out in the cold with you  
Froze froze with you  
Me and you together our love could run the world  
Repeat x15  
Run  
  
Make it through any weather baby  
Dont pay them any attention  
Itll just drive you crazy  
All that really matters is our love for one another  
And all well ever have is each other  
Let her chitchatter come around  
Lord knows shell never be done  
Shell never have your back wouldnt know how to act  
I cant say it all better than that  
  
Chorus  
  
Our love could run the world  
  
Dont you see theres no love no like you and me  
Cant you see baby theres nobody more powerful than we  
Cant you see that Im the only thing youll ever need  
Cant you see that cant you see  
  
Our love could run the world uhoh uhoh  
Run the world uhoh uhoh  
Our love could run the world uhoh uhoh  
Run the world uhoh uhoh  
Our love could run the world  
Ill be your anything everything rockin roll with you  
If things get too hot out in the cold with you  
Froze froze with you  
Run the world our love could run the world  
Repeat x15  
Run  
  
Run the world our love could run the world
