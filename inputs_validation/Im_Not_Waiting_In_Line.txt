Its clear to see that youre down to earth  
With a hold on what your worth  
Like no other  
And Id like to thank your mother for that  
  
I bet ya theres a line outside your door  
And its a line I know for sure  
That you dont want from me  
Like a hole in your head  
  
I want to be just you just me  
No tricks no show  
But I got to let you know  
  
Im not waiting in line  
Im not changing my mind for you  
Im not wasting my time  
Im not waiting in line for you  
  
Now I think if we got something started  
We would both fall in whole hearted  
Im not like no other  
And you can thank my mother for that  
  
Im sure there is a line in front of me  
And its a line Im sure to need from you  
Like a whole in my head  
  
I want to be just you just me  
No tricks no show  
But I got to let you know  
  
Im not waiting in line  
Im not changing my mind for you  
Im not wasting my time  
Im not waiting in line for you  
  
Ive been saving myself for you  
But Im not wasting my time for no one  
Oh But if you want me to be  
Baby Ill be rough enough  
Baby Ill be tough enough  
Oh you know Im rich enough  
But I wont be nobodys fool  
  
Im not waiting in line  
And Im not changing my mind for you  
Im not wasting my time  
Im not waiting in line for you  
  
Im not waiting in line  
And Im not changing my mind for you  
Im not wasting my time  
Im not waiting in line  
  
Unless you want me to
