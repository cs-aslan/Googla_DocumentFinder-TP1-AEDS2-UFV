Stand up and with your hand on the Bible  
Tell the truth to one and all  
Cause you know that feeling  
When youve got your back against the wall  
My God its only Tuesday tomorrow  
And Loved Ones gone and blown it all  
Now youve got no money and you feel your back against the wall  
  
Well if you talk to your brothers and they dont give a damn  
And you look like youre gonna fall  
You can call my number when you feel your back against the wall  
  
Some Trippers got you right in a corner  
And you feel youre gonna lose it all  
Now you dont want trouble but you feel your backs against the wall  
  
So the guy moves forward but you hold him away  
Shit theres no one there to hear you call  
So you take your chances and you push him back against the wall  
  
Now the guys in the gutter and you dont give a damn  
And he looks kind of weak and small  
Cause you called his number when you felt your back against the wall  
  
Stand up and with your hand on the Bible  
Tell the truth to one and all  
Cause you know that feeling  
When youve got your back against the wall  
  
Well if you talk to your brothers and they dont give a damn  
And you look like youre gonna fall  
You can call my number when you feel your back against the wall
