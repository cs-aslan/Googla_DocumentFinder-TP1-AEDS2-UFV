Yesterday I went outside  
With my mommas mason jar  
Caught a lovely Butterfly  
  
When I woke up today  
And looked in on my fairy pet  
She had withered all away  
No more sighing in her breast  
Im sorry for what I did  
I did what my body told me to  
I didnt mean to do you harm  
But everytime I pin down what I think I want  
It slips away  the ghost slips away  
  
I smell you on my hand for days  
I cant wash away your scent  
If Im a dog then youre a bitch  
  
I guess youre as real as me  
Maybe I can live with that  
Maybe I need fantasy  
A life of chasing Butterfly  
I told you I would return  
When the robin makes his nest  
But I aint never comin back  
Im sorry Im sorry Im sorry
