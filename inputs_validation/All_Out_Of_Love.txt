I am lying alone with my head on the phone  
Thinking of you till it hurts  
I know youre hurt too  
But what else can we do  
Tormented and torn apart  
  
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart  
For times when my life seems so low  
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring  
When today doesnt really know doesnt really know  
  
Chorus  
Im all out of love Im so lost without you  
I know you were right believing for so long  
Im all out of love what am I without you  
I cant be too late to say that  
I was so wrong  
  
I want you to come back and carry me home  
Away from this long lonely nights  
Im reaching for you are you feeling it too  
Does the feeling seem oh so right  
  
And what would you say if I called on you now  
And said that I cant hold on  
Theres no easy way it gets harder each day  
Please love me or Ill be gone Ill be gone  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh what are you thinking of  
What are you thinking of  
What are you thinking of  
What are you thinking of  
  
Chorus
