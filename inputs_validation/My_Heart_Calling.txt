Tell me who I am  
Tell me what Im hearing  
Is it God or man  
Leads us to our fate  
  
Tears cried through the night  
So much weve been fearing  
I know I can fight  
Soon will be too late  
  
Its my heart calling  
Its my heart calling  
Its my heart seeing  
What it wants to see  
  
Its my heart crying  
Its my heart flying  
Its my heart trying  
To set me free  
  
Darkness turns to light  
While my soul is healing  
I know I must fight  
This war deep inside  
  
Its my heart calling  
Its my heart calling  
Its my heart seeing  
What it wants to see  
  
Its my heart crying  
Its my heart flying  
Its my heart trying  
To set me free  
  
Waving banners swinging swords  
Queens and kings and other lords  
And the battles of our pride  
Greed and hunger deep inside  
  
All the sorrow born of pain  
Cruelty and cruelty again  
Who will stop this vicious spin  
Open arms and let love in  
Open arms and let love in  
Open arms and let love in  
Open arms and let love in
