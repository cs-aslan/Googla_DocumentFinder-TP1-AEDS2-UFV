One more day to complete my service  
One more high to decay my nevous  
Wondering how Im gonna find a way  
Its over  
  
One more day to complete my service  
One more time here to fade my servant  
One more day if I find a way  
Over  
  
She seemed to read minds  
And I know a later time  
We could make it with you  
Leave the soul  
  
Old age  
  
One more day to complain my servant  
One more doubt here to find a servant  
One more time here if I find a way  
Its over  
  
Wondering how Im here date my cover  
One more doubt here to save my never  
Wondering how Im gonna find a way  
Its over  
  
She seemed to read minds  
And I know a later time  
We could make it with you  
Leave the soul  
  
Old age  
  
Just you need  
And read  
Youre freak  
Hmmmmm  
  
And knew  
You read  
You flew  
Ooo  
Hmmmmm  
  
One more day to concrete my circuit  
One more high here to find my nervous  
Someday Im gonna find a way  
Its over  
  
One more doubt here to claim my supper  
I can have anything you want to  
One more day if I find a way  
Its over  
  
She seemed to read minds  
And I know we were out of time  
Breathe the way here with you  
Dream the same on the dew  
Breathe the same on her  
Take a moan on a man  
Breathe the shame on you  
Breathe the lie  
  
Old age
