Mister Banker  
Mister please how much does money mean  
Wont you reconsider Mister  
Wont you do this thing for me  
  
Aint got no house  
Aint got no car  
All I got lord is my guitar  
But you can have that Mister Banker  
  
Wont you bury my papa for me  
Oh Mister Banker please  
Listen to how that sound  
  
I would not be here on my knees  
But hey Mister Banker  
It means so much to me  
Oh wont you reconsider Mister  
Wont you do this thing for me

Aint got no car

Wont you take it Mister Banker  
Wont you bury my papa for me  
Oh Mister Banker please
