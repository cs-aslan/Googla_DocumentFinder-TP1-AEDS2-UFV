Take no notice Cause Im just the same  
Theres a thousand other faces with the very same name  
And we look like each other and we all live together  
We talk about the same things  
And we never try and change things  
  
Chorus  
Were the happy happy people  
  
We never give opinions and we never state views  
After all you cant be sure that what we say is true  
And if you want to join us you can follow on behind us  
You can talk about your visions  
You can make some big decisions  
  
Chorus  
  
We believe in having fun and smiling all the time  
And sometimes were on tv if were over 69  
And when we have a raffle then its just a big reshuffle  
Its a democratic poll  
But were the ones who are in control  
  
Chorus
