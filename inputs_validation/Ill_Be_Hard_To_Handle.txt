Now well say till something do us part  
That old dad of mine aint got a heart  
Any girl whos out for pleasure  
Thinks of marriage only at her leisure  
As it is theyve got the horse behind the cart  
  
When my pop said we must wed  
He kind of wowed me still Im ready  
But one thing must be clear  
At this time  
  
Ill be hard to handle  
I promise you that  
And if you complain  
Heres one little Jane  
Wholl leave you flat  
  
Ill be hard to handle  
What else can I be  
I say with a shrug  
I think youre a mug  
To marry me  
  
When you first threw me a gander  
I was willing to philander  
But I never thought Id have to be a bride  
Now youre gonna find tough sledding  
I dont want no shotgun wedding  
I was only along for the ride  
  
Ill be hard to handle  
Im telling you plain  
Just be a dear  
And scram out of here  
Im gonna raise cain  
  
Ill be hard to handle  
My bridges are burned  
This weddings a gag  
And youre in the bag  
Where Im concerned  
  
Ill be hard to handle  
When weve said I do  
See theres no hope  
I just got a dope  
When I took you  
  
Ill be living my life in bed  
But they always will be twin beds  
And I warn you youll be living like a monk  
Our affair is now a past one  
So dont think youve pulled a fast one  
Just remember I think youre a punk  
  
Ill be hard to handle  
Im no ball and chain  
Ill find some means  
To call the Marines  
Im gonna raise cain  
  
Gonna raise cain  
Im telling you plain  
Im gonna raise cain
