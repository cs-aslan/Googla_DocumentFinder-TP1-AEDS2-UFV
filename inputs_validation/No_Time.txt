No time no time for you  
I got no time baby  
Got lots of better things to do  
  
Runnin from the risin heat  
To find a place to hide  
The grass is always greener  
Growin on the other side  
  
Chorus x 3  
No time no time for you  
I got no time baby  
Got lots of better things to do  
  
Tryin to tell the world  
Somehow of how I feel  
Tell me what you said again  
I cant believe its real  
  
Chorus  
  
Andy youre a dandy  
You dont seem to make no sense  
Nevermind the furthermore  
The plea is selfdefense  
  
Chorus  
  
Got no time  
I got no time
