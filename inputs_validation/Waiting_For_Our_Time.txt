Looking up from where I stand  
I see the vapor trail  
Of a jet plane in the sky  
  
Here the wheel is in my hand  
But theres no wind in my sails  
And life is drifting by  
  
Still I hold on and wait  
I know its not too late  
And my breeze will come  
  
Muse you satisfy my soul  
Keep me warm while the  
Cold world guards the gate  
  
Im searching  
Im wondering  
Im yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
Im searching  
Im wondering  
Im yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
Your love has kept my dream alive  
A vision of my life  
With you here by my side  
  
Every forward step I take  
Every moment Im awake  
I feel your love inside  
  
So close I feel it in my bones  
I know Im not alone as I climb this wall  
But I sometimes I get so high  
I just want to live love  
And taste it all  
  
Im searching  
Im wondering  
Im yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
Im searching  
Im wondering  
Im yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
Here tonight  
I lie awake and watch you dream  
Under the light of the moon  
I wonder just how far weve been  
And where well be  
When the sun comes up  
Will this be our date with destiny  
  
Im searching  
Im wondering  
Im yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
Im searching  
Im wondering  
Im yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
And Im waiting
