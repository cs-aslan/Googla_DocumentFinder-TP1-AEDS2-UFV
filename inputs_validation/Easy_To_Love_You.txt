Good good morning so good to see you  
Werent just a dream of mine  
Real as a raven real as thunder  
Real as the sun shinin  
But still so very undefined  
Cant imagine whats  
Behind those sleepy eyes  
Little stranger dont try to hide now  
You look so young when youre afraid  
There is no danger but from the Devil  
He may want you but Im in His way  
You dont know how easy it is  
You dont know how easy it is to love you  
And come the moon rise when the dew falls  
Dont be the sun that fades away  
Dont leave me darkness  
She is no lover she hides the day  
You dont know how easy it is  
You dont know how easy it is to love you  
You dont know how easy it is  
You dont know how easy it is to love you  
You dont know how easy it is  
You dont know how easy it is to love you
