When a bird young and free  
Hangs around a certain tree  
Singing serenades that tell his love is true  
Thats because its the natural thing to do  
  
And when a cat on a fence  
Keeps his darling in suspense  
And hes brave enough to face a wellaimed shoe  
Thats because its the natural thing to do  
  
And you know every dove  
Has its heart set on love  
Rabbits too pet and pat  
And theres nothing wrong with that  
  
When a boy such as I  
Tries so hard to qualify  
With a very lovely lady such as you  
Cant you see its the natural thing to do  
  
And then the girl she acts demure  
The boy he feels proud and sure  
So proud and sure that he impulsively suggests a rendezvous  
Fine thing  
Thats because its the natural thing to do  
  
But the girl she just wont agree  
She whimpers and she simpers  
And he begs on bended knee  
But she runs away because she knows full well hell pursue  
The chump  
Thats because its the natural thing to do  
  
Then the boy in despair  
Waves his arms tears his hair  
Stamps his feet and he acts like mad  
Then you know that hes got it bad  
  
Then the girl she ought to fall  
If shes got a heart at all  
She should take him in her arms  
And kiss him too  
Oh Oh Just the natural thing to do
