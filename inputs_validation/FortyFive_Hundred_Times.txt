Theres nobody on the end of my line  
Im in time but somebodys missing  
Maybe I can find a hand for my hand  
If I find a well for my wishing  
Be my friend be my friend  
  
It gets lonely on a table for two  
Laughing on your own can be no fun  
Even people that are talking to you  
Remind you that youre really with noone  
Be my friend be my friend  
  
Take me over like a thing from the past  
Lots of people wishing theyd been there  
Noone knowing just how long it would last  
But Im sitting still here in my chair  
Be my friend be my friend  
  
Fortyfive hundred times I told you how much I care  
Fortyfive hundred times I told you how much I care  
Problems halved are the problems that we can share  
White lies in our eyes together not really there  
  
Fortyfive hundred times I told you you can lean on me  
Fortyfive hundred times I told you you can lean on me  
Though its taken a long time for you to see  
Where were at is the right place for us to be  
  
I sure want to stay here it sure feels fine  
I feel I could be here a long long time  
Now that Ive made it I dont want to fade it  
Now that Ive made it with you  
  
We came a long way a slow way too  
Up from the down way and back to you  
Now that Ive made it I dont want to fade it  
Now that Ive made it with you
