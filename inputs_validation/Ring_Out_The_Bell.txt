Im so lonely  
God wont know me  
I can hardly get up  
I sold my halo  
Back in April  
Now I cant hold my head up  
So ring out the bell  
Ill fly where theres someone to tell  
My shoulders are colder since I fell  
Someone see me  
Feel me breathing  
Someone get me closer  
If I see sunrise  
And screw up my eyes  
I dont feel so lonesome  
So ring out the bell  
Ill fly where theres someone to tell  
My shoulders are colder since I fell  
Im doing fine  
Im getting by  
Tell me what I should do  
God knows why Im  
Watching the sky  
Its so blue  
One fine morning  
Without warning  
Ill go through the  
Blue sky  
Until I do Ill  
Wait for you  
So I can get this right  
So ring out the bell  
Ill fly where theres someone to tell  
My shoulders are colder since I fell  
So ring out the bell  
Ill fly where theres someone to tell  
My shoulders are colder since I fell
