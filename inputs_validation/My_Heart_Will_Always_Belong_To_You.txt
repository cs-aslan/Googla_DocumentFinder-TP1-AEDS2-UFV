Now darling you should know  
That Im really really in love with you  
Although you dont belong to me darling  
My heart will always belong to you  
There are many many things all around me  
That will always remind me of you  
I know Ill never forget you darling  
My heart will always belong to you  
Since youve been gone darling  
Life for me has been so blue  
I guess Ill have to go it alone  
Because my heart will always belong to you  
Although although I cannot see you  
I could never never stop lovin you  
I just hope and pray youll come back to me darling  
Cause my heart will always belong to you
