Maybe youve heard your ole buddys gone crazy  
Searching for words too deep sweet reason and rhyme  
Living alone more and more and hes prone to be lazy  
Turning to stone blasted and blind  
Chorus  
Dont turn away there hey goddamn you he was your brother  
Turn on your father sister mother brother  
He was your friend  
Dont you condemn him leave it to strangers  
You ought to know him give him a hand if you can  
But at least for jesus christs sake understand him  
Maybe youve heard that they say that the ladys been changing  
Day after day more than her mind  
Learning to play where the part has her turning to strangers  
Going too far line after line  
Chorus  
Dont turn away there  hey  goddamn you you used to love her  
Turn on your father sister mother mister  
She was your friend  
Dont you condemn her leave it to strangers  
You ought to know her give her a hand if you can  
But at least for jesus christs sake understand her
