Youre so free  
Thats what everybodys tellin me  
Yet I feel like Im an outward bound  
Pushed around refuge  
  
Somethings wrong  
Got a feeling that I dont belong  
As if I have come from out of space  
Out of place like King Kong  
  
Im a marionette just a marionette  
Pull the string  
Im a marionette everybodys pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
Im a marionette see my pirouette  
Round and round  
Im a marionette Im a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
Like a doll  
Like a puppet with no will at all  
And somebody taught me how to talk  
How to walk how to fall  
  
Cant complain  
I got no one but myself to blame  
Somethings happening I cant control  
Lost my hold its insane  
  
Im a marionette just a marionette  
Pull the string  
Im a marionette everybodys pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
Im a marionette see my pirouette  
Round and round  
Im a marionette Im a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
Look this way  
Just a little smile is what they say  
Youll look better on the photograph  
If you laugh thats ok  
  
Im a marionette just a marionette  
Pull the string  
Im a marionette everybodys pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
Im a marionette see my pirouette  
Round and round  
Im a marionette Im a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
Youre so free  
Thats what everybodys tellin me  
Yet I feel like Im an outward bound  
Pushed around refugee
