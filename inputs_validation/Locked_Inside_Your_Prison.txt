Your love is like a prison wall  
And its getting higher  
I get so far and then I fall  
I cant get through the wire  
  
Oh oh oh Im locked inside your prison  
Oh oh oh Im locked inside your prison  
  
Its as though Im doing time  
And you wont free me  
Let the punishment befit the crime  
And say you need me  
  
Oh oh oh Im locked inside your prison  
Oh oh oh Im locked inside your prison  
  
Save me save me cant you see Im innocent  
Turn the key that will set me free  
Please let it end oh let it end  
  
Oh oh oh Im locked inside your prison  
Oh oh oh Im locked inside your prison  
  
Save me save me cant you see Im innocent  
Turn the key that will set me free  
Please let it end wont you let it end  
  
Ill dig a tunnel to your heart  
Let me remind you  
Even gonna tear the walls apart  
Until I find you  
  
Oh oh oh Im locked inside your prison  
Oh oh oh Im locked inside your prison
