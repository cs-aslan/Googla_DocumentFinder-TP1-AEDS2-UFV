Im Frank Sinatra in a rock n roll band  
Im a hevayweight demon with a heavyweight plan  
Im Uncle Sam with a joint in my mouth  
And my V8s floored when I headed down south  
This aint hell sure aint heaven  
Pull on over to the Seven Eleven  
Stop Rich now Pontiac here  
Big blue love Budweiser beer  
Cant you see them  
Cant you see them  
GI Joe Im Stretch Armstrong  
Every blade of grass Im the water in the bong  
Im aqua man Im the devil with a grin  
Ambidextrous now cause I use both limbs  
East Palo Alto age 26  
Full love circle not one love missed  
A1 liquor Berones too  
Crown Royal No 502  
Cant you see them  
Cant you see them  
August 27th on a calendar scale  
And on this day I went to jail  
The blue man on my trip and on my ride  
See I gotta go and will I survive  
Im the man and I do and I dont  
Im the man and I will and I wont  
Im the man and I could not lie  
Why most should live now some should die
