I stepped outside to breathe the air  
And stare up at the stars  
Big dipper hanging there  
Over the rented car  
Over the rented car  
Im a runaway from the record biz  
From the hoods in the hood and the whiny white kids  
Boring  
The old man is snoring  
And Im taming the tiger  
You cant tame the tiger  
Tiger tiger burning bright  
Nice kitty kitty  
Tiger tiger burning bright  
  
Sophia says Its hard to catch  
And harder still to ride  
The time to watch the beast the best  
Is when its purring at your side  
Purring at your side  
Accolades and honors  
One false move and youre a goner  
Boring  
The old man is snoring  
And Im taming the tiger  
You cant tame the tiger  
Tiger tiger burning bright  
Nice kitty kitty  
Tiger tiger burning bright  
In the forest of the night  
  
The moon shed light  
On my hopeless plight  
As the radio blared so bland  
Every disc a poker chip  
Every song just a one night stand  
Formula music girly guile  
Genuine junk food for juveniles  
Up and down the dial  
Mercenary style  
  
I watched the stars chuck down their spears  
And a plane went blinking by  
And I thought of Anna  
Wild and dear  
Like fireworks in the sky  
Fireworks in the sky  
Im so sick of this game  
Its hip its hot  
Lifes too short the whole things gotten  
Boring  
The old man is snoring  
And Im taming the tiger  
You cant tame the tiger  
Tiger tiger burning bright  
Nice kitty kitty  
Boring  
Tiger tiger burning bright  
You cant tame the tiger  
Oh be nice kitty kitty  
Boring  
Tiger tiger burning bright  
Nice kitty kitty  
Boring boring  
Tiger tiger burning bright  
Fight to the light fight to the light  
In the forest of the night
