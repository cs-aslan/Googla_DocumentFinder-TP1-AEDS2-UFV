She holds me when Im sleepin  
She wakes me with a kiss  
She is the only woman  
My heart cannot resist  
My sweet Augusta darlin  
Comes from those Georgia pines  
My sweet Augusta darlin  
The one true love of mine  
She whispers that she loves me  
She knows I feel the same  
I thank the Lord above me  
When I hear her call my name  
My sweet Augusta darlin  
Comes from those Georgia pines  
My sweet Augusta darlin  
The one true love of mine  
Well praise this perfect union  
And well watch the years go by  
And well be such sweet companions  
Until the end of time  
My sweet Augusta darlin  
Comes from those Georgia pines  
My sweet Augusta darlin  
The one true love of mine  
My sweet Augusta darlin  
The one true love of mine
