Some people say a man is made outta mud  
A poor mans made outta muscle and blood  
Muscle and blood and skin and bones  
A mind thats aweak and a back thats strong  
  
You load sixteen tons what do you get  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter dont you call me cause I cant go  
I owe my soul to the company store  
  
I was born one mornin when the sun didnt shine  
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine  
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal  
And the straw boss said Well abless my soul  
  
You load sixteen tons what do you get  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter dont you call me cause I cant go  
I owe my soul to the company store  
  
I was born one mornin it was drizzlin rain  
Fightin and trouble are my middle name  
I was raised in the canebrake by an ol mama lion  
Caint noa hightoned woman make me walk the line  
  
You load sixteen tons what do you get  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter dont you call me cause I cant go  
I owe my soul to the company store  
  
If you see me comin better step aside  
A lotta men didnt a lotta men died  
One fist of iron the other of steel  
If the right one dont aget you  
Then the left one will  
  
You load sixteen tons what do you get  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter dont you call me cause I cant go  
I owe my soul to the company store
