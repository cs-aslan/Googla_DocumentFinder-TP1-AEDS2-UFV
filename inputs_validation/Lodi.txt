Just about a year ago  
I set out on the road  
seekin my fame and fortune  
lookin for a pot of gold  
Things got bad and things got worse  
I guess you know the tune  
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again  
  
I came in on a Greyhound  
Ill be walkin out if I go  
I was just passin through  
Must be seven months or more  
Ran out of time and money  
It looks like they took my friends  
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again  
  
Well The man from the magazine  
He said I was on my way  
Somewhere I lost connection and  
Ran out of songs to play  
I came into town on a onenight stand  
Looks like my plans fell through  
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again  
  
If I only had a dollar  
For every song Ive sung  
And every time Ive had to play  
While people sat there drunk  
You know Id catch the next train  
Back to where I live  
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again  
Oh Lord Stuck in Lodi again  
Oh lord stuck in Lodi again
