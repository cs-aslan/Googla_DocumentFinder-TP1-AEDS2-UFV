Theres a neat little lass and her name is MariMac  
And make no mistake shes the girl Im gonna track  
Lots of other fellas try to get her on the back  
But Im thinkin that theyll have to get up early  
  
Chorus  
MariMacs mothers makin MariMac marry me  
My mothers makin me marry MariMac  
Well Im gonna marry Mari cause Maris takin care o me  
Well all be feelin marry when I marry MariMac  
  
Now Mari and her mother are an awful lot together  
In fact you hardly see the one without the other  
And people often wonder if its Mari or her mother  
Or both of them together Im courting  
  
Chorus  
  
Well up among the heather in the hills of Benafee  
Well I had a Bonnie lass sittin on my knee  
A bumble bee stung me right above the knee  
Up among the heather in the hills of Benafee  
  
Chorus  
Well I said to bonnie lass how we gonna pass the day  
She said among the heather in the hills of Benafee  
Where all the boys and girls are making out so free  
Up among the heather in the hills of Benafee  
  
Chorus  
  
Weddings on a Wednesday everythings arranged  
Soon youll never change your mind unless your mind is changed  
Of making the arrangements and feelings lots of rage  
Marriage is an awful undertaking  
  
Chorus  
  
Sure to be a grand for grand of that a fair  
Gonna be a fork and plate for every man thats there  
And Ill be a bugger if I dont get my share  
Although I may be very much mistaken  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a neat little lass and her name is Mari Mac  
Make no mistake shes the girl Im gonna track  
Lots of other fellas try to get her on her back  
But Im thinkin that theyll have to get up early  
  
Chorus
