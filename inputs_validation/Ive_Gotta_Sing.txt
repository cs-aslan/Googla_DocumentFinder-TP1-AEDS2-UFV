The suns shining beautiful and everything is going my way  
Ive got a love thats wonderful hes always there with loving words to say  
Well I hold him close and let him know that to me he is my everything  
Without a word the world is mine just one look from him and Im a queen  
A girls gotta sing when shes got everything so now Im singin my song  
Now Ive gotta sing cause hes my everything  
Dont you know Im happy wont you sing along  
Im singing la la la la la la la  
Im singing la la la la la la la  
I can thank my lucky stars for the never ending love he gives to me  
When Im by his side flame of love burns bright for all the world to see  
When he calls my name out low I can hear the bells begin to ring  
And happiness is all around thats the reason why Ive gotta sing  
A girls gotta sing
