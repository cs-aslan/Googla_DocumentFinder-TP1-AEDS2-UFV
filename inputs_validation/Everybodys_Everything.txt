Seems like everybodys waitin  
For the new change  
Come around come around  
Come around come around  
Waitin for the day when the king queen of shows  
Singing round singing round singing round  
Singing round singing round singing round for everyone  
Yeah do it  
  
You can understand everything to share  
Let your spirits dance brothers everywhere  
Let your head be free  
Turn the wisdom key  
Find it naturally  
See youre lucky to be  
  
If youre sad just spin around  
And round and round  
Do it  
Yes just hold me baby  
Something on your back  
Lay it down lay it down lay it down lay it down  
Dont you know honey maybe  
Youre like my childless hometown  
This ole town this ole town this ole town  
  
See it now  
Time for you to all get down  
Yeah do it  
Get ready get ready get ready get ready  
Dig this sound  
Spinnin round and round and round  
Do it  
You can understand everythings to share  
Let your spirits dance brother everywhere  
Let your head be free  
Turn the wisdom key  
Find it naturally see your lucky to be  
Sing it now  
Time for you to all get down  
Yeah do it  
Get ready get ready get ready get ready  
Get ready get ready get ready get ready  
Singing it now  
Time for you to all get down
