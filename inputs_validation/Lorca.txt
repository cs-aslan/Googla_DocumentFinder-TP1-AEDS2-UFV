Let the sun sing in your smile  
Let the wind hold your desire  
Let your womans voice run through your veins  
Let her be your blood dont feel ashamed  
  
Shes your home when no one wants you  
Shell give you life when youre so tired  
Shell ease your fears ah when youre a stranger  
Shes born to give faith to you  
Oh just to you  
  
Youre just a man on deaths highways  
Its life you owe youre here to praise it  
If love flows your way then be a river  
And when it dries just stand there and shiver  
  
Oh let the sun sing in your smile  
Let the wind hold your desire  
And let your womans voice run through your veins  
Let her be your blood dont feel ashamed  
Its her life you owe  
I owe you love
