Mr and Misdemeanor  
Middle of the roaders  
Set beside the ocean  
Landscapes alive agoshin  
Who put all of this in motion  
  
Lucky Luciano  
Kenneth Pasarelli  
You take the modern mosquito  
To every big city  
I sit beside Misdemeanor  
Heres new pretties for you  
  
Nobody likes me but we adore you  
Da da dda da yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Cheers  
  
Nasty Misdemeanor  
Kickin in the windows  
Parked beside the ocean  
Landscapes alive agoshin  
Who put all of this in motion  
Da da dda da yeah yeah yeah yeah
