Say you know youve got to run  
You know youve got to hide  
You dont know who to follow  
Or who is on your side  
You dont know where youre goin  
You wont talk of where youve been  
And I may see you tomorrow  
Or nevermore again  
  
And Ive seen you in the cities  
Ive seen you on the road  
And your face is all atwisted  
cause your brain is a heavy load  
And then you turn and ask me  
Say how will I ever know  
And you talk of all your searchin  
But I think its all for show  
  
Open up my friend  
Love someone if you can  
Go on let her in  
Open up again  
  
And I hear your mournful songs  
I hear your painful crys  
And Ive seen the light of hunger  
Linger deep within your eyes  
And you talk about your sinkin  
And what a hole youre in  
You expect for me to love you  
When you hate yourself my friend  
  
And youve got yourself a potion  
Oh to keep you from your sleep  
In that dark and lonely hour  
Well Ive heard you laugh and weep  
But youll always be arunnin  
Runnin till you find your doom  
Cause you never face your lonely soul  
You never face the gloom  
  
Open up my friend  
Love someone if you can  
Go on let her in  
Open up again
