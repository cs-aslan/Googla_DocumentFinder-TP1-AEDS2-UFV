Just a simple suggestion  
That you dont need to follow  
We could make it out of here  
  
We could be there tomorrow  
Cos theres always tomorrow  
Youre so silly oh so silly  
Especially just ordinary  
Weve got nothing to hurt now  
Were green behind the ears  
  
Just a pocket of people  
With their ordinary faces  
As the crow flies  
They got further to fly  
Without a word or a lie
