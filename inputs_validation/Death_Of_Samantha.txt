A friend lent me shades  
So I could hide my eyes that day  
Was a snowy day  
The shades have seen a lot of things I didnt want to know myself  
  
Was like an accident part of growing up  
People tell me  
  
But something inside me something inside me died that day  
What do you dooo what can you do  
What do you dooo what can you do
