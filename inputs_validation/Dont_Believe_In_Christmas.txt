Well  
Mom and dad  
Said we could  
So I did  
What I should  
I hung  
My stocking  
On a wall  
I didnt get  
A thing at all  
  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
  
Cause  
I didnt get  
Nothin last year  
Well  
Stayin up late  
To see  
Santa Claus fly  
Well  
Sure enough  
Dont ya know  
The fat boy  
Didnt show  
  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
  
Cause I didnt  
Get nothin  
Last year  
Well  
I tried  
To get  
A little kiss  
From  
A pretty  
Little miss  
She  
Slapped me down  
And said  
You jerk  
Mistletoe  
Doesnt work  
  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
  
Cause  
I didnt get  
Nothin last year  
Oh right  
Well  
Wakin up  
The reindeer  
Makin  
Little kids cheer  
The reason  
That his nose  
Shine  
Santa gave him  
Mmoonshine  
  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
  
Cause  
I didnt get  
Nothin last year  
Ah  
Decorate  
The street light  
People lookin  
To get right  
One hand  
Will slap ya back  
The other one  
Will take ya back  
  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
  
Cause  
I didnt get  
Nothin last year  
  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
I dont believe  
In Christmas  
I dont believe  
In christmas  
I dont believe  
In Christmas
