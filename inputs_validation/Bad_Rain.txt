Dont come around here no more  
Bringing me all of your bad rain  
Cant you see Ive got troubles of my own  
I aint got time to be messing with all of your bad rain  
Why in the world cant you just leave that stuff alone  
There was a time we had a good thing going on  
You and I both know the reason why it all went wrong  
Tried to stick by you help you see it through  
But you used me all up now youre on your own  
So dont come around here no more  
Bringing me all of your bad rain  
Cant you see Ive got troubles of my own  
I aint got time to be messing with all of your bad rain  
Why in the world cant you just leave that stuff alone  
Well I tried and tried again to be good to you  
But you wont a hear a word and I dont know what its coming to  
Comes a time when you just have to turn and walk away  
Theres nothing left to do nothing left to say  
So dont come around here no more  
Bringing me all of your bad rain  
Cant you see Ive got troubles of my own  
I aint got time to be messing with all of your bad rain  
Why in the world cant you just leave that stuff alone  
I aint someone to be preaching to nobody else  
Aint going to try and pretend to be living that clean myself  
Cant stand by and watch you throw your life away  
But theres nothing left to do nothing left to say  
So dont come around here no more  
Bringing me all of your bad rain  
Cant you see Ive got troubles of my own  
I aint got time to be messing with all of your bad rain  
Why in the world cant you just leave that stuff alone  
Why in the world cant you just leave that stuff alone
