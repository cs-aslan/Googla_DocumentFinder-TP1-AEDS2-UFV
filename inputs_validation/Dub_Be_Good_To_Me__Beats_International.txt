Youre listening to the boy from the big bad city  
This is jam hot  
This is jam hot  
Friends tell me I am crazy  
That Im wasting time with you  
Youll never be mine  
Thats not the way I see it  
Coz I feel youre glad youre mine  
Whenever youre with me  
  
People always talk about reputation  
I dont care about your other girls  
Just be good to me  
Just be good to me

Love is a game of chances  
So Ill take my chance with you  
And you I wont try to change  
We talk about it and Id  
Rather have a piece of you  
Than out of nothing  
  
Just be good to me in the morning  
Just be good to me in the afternoon or evening  
Yeah just be good to me  
Im not the jealous kind  
I wont tie you down  
When you need me  
Ill be around  
Ill be good to you  
Youll be good to me  
We could be together be together  
  
Just be good to me  
Just be good to me  
Just be good to me
