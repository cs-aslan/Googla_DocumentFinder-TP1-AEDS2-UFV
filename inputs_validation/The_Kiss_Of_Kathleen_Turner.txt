Train sounds and coughing I always take the 730 AM train  
Going to Brasil City  
Well at this hour of the day Im not too well humored  
Cause life doesnt show any pity  
Youre always complaining bout yourself  
And putting things down in the world  
Just take a good look at Kathleen Turner  
Now theres one heck of a girl  
  
Ive been to hell and back but Im alright Jack  
Now I know what love is about  
Under the seven moons  
I made a solemn vow  
I need the kiss of Kathleen Turner right now  
I need the kiss of Kathleen Turner right now  
Smack In the middle  
  
Female voice on telephone Hello  
Oh its me I know its late  
But I just had to call you  
Ill be over real soon  
  
Kathleen Kathleen  
  
Is this a dream or is it real  
Is this really happening to me  
Or is this just fantasy  
In this world theres only one woman  
Who can make my dreams my dreams come true  
And that woman Kathleen  
Its you  
  
Standing on the corner watching all the girls go by  
He wants a kiss  
Not just one I want lots of kisses  
He wants a kiss  
Standing on the corner watching all the girls go by  
He wants a kiss  
  
Hallelujah hes in love  
Hallelujah glory glory
