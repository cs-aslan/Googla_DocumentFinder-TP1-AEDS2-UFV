Listen  
I was born on the other side  
Just always looking to you  
I made it over the great divide  
Now Im coming for you  
  
Your forces lined up in battle  
Your soldiers and your machines  
The sun been blacked out by shadows  
The darkest hour now youve ever seen  
  
And Im easy and Im serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
I rose up on the doctors slab  
Like Lazarus from the pit  
And everyone wants to take a stab  
Decorate me with blood graffiti and spit  
  
Ive been held up on money  
Ive been beaten out of spite  
You want a piece of me honey  
Lose or win  
  
You know youve been in a fight  
And Im easy and Im serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
On March 6th 1836 the walls of the Alamo fell  
To the Mexican army After a 12day siege the  
Troops of Santa Ana were victorious but too  
Exhausted to hold on and the Texans won the  
War Its further from El Paso to Texarkana  
Then from New York to Chicago And when it  
Joined the Union Texas was the biggest state  
Yeah everything from Texas is big larger than  
Life and none bigger than little Marvin Aday So  
Big his daddy called him Meat Loaf He grew  
Into a big man with a big voice And he sings  
Big songs and has big hits You can try and  
Tear him down  
  
Now there aint much difference  
Between a bridge and a wall  
Without me right in the middle baby  
Youll be nothing at all  
  
And Im easy and Im serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
And Im easy and Im serious  
They try and tear me down  
You want me baby I dare you  
Try and tear me down  
  
Try and tear me down
