As the twilight shadows deepen  
Where the weeping willow waves  
All alone in tears Im kneeling  
Oer my sweethearts lonely grave  
  
Chorus  
I am asking Gods forgiveness  
For youre waiting there I know  
Out beyond that blue horizon  
Just across the bridge of gold  
  
I regret those words Ive spoken  
Every yesterday of tears  
That I caused you little darling  
As we wandered through the years  
  
Chorus  
  
If Id only read your letter  
Saying you were in despair  
That your weary heart was broken  
And in pain was lying there  
  
Chorus  
  
I tonight would not be weeping  
Oer the roses on your grave  
But instead dear Id be happy  
And this sorrow Id have saved  
  
Chorus  
  
If I only would have listened  
When you told me not to stray  
But I said I loved another  
Left you there and went away  
  
Chorus  
  
Now my life is sad and lonely  
Down lifes path I trudge along  
But Ill meet you up in heaven  
When from this old world Ive gone  
  
Chorus
