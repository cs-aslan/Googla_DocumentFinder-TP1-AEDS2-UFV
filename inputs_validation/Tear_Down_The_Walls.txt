Jesse to Congregation Dont you take me to  
Your preachers  
And blind me with  
Their teachings  
Take your sorrowed souls  
And giveem to the blind  
  
Are the Gods that made you lying  
To the bloodied faces  
And never cry  
How long you all  
Been waiting to die  
  
Blinded by your teachers  
Now theyll be hiding  
Youll be seeking  
Will you giveem mercy  
Hangem on high  
Johnny get your guns for dying  
Its time for rightn all the wrongs theyve lied  
Give me a shotgun  
Make it alright  
  
Dont tell me your  
Makers laughing  
Youre bleeding the world he made  
  
Shotgun the walls of wailing  
Come tell me  
When it starts again  
  
Running for our lives  will ya  
Tear down the walls and smile  
God in Heaven save us all tonight
