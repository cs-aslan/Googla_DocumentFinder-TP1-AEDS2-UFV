This is the moment well remember  
Every day for the rest of out lives  
Time may rush us hurt or love us  
  
But on this day we have arrived  
  
Its been a long time coming  
Weve been in the running for so long  
But now were on our way  
Let the ride just take us  
Side by side and make us  
See the world through new eyes every day  
  
Youre a winner  
Im a winner  
This is all happening so fast  
Youre a winner  
Im a winner  
Lets enjoy it all while it lasts  
  
Ive been a loser Ive paid my dues  
I fought my way up from the ground  
Now at this moment the crowd acclaim us  
Will you just listen to that song  
  
Its been a long time coming  
Weve been in the running for so long  
But now were on our way  
Let the ride just take us  
Side by side and make us  
See the world through new eyes every day  
  
Youre a winner  
Im a winner  
This is all happening so fast  
Youre a winner  
Im a winner  
Lets enjoy it all while it lasts  
  
It took us so long  
And we worked so hard  
We came so far just to compete  
But dont forget all  
The love and laughter  
Now the world is at our feet  
Looking back on all the times  
We felt downcast  
Didnt think we were going anywhere  
Just living in the past  
But in that desperation  
You get inspiration  
  
Youre a winner  
Im a winner  
This is all happening so fast  
Youre a winner  
Im a winner  
Lets enjoy it all while it lasts  
  
Cause youre a winner  
Took so long we worked so hard  
We came so far and just to compete  
But dont forget all  
The love and laughter  
Now the world is at our feet  
  
Youre a winner  
Im a winner  
This is hapWening so fast  
Youre a winner  
Im a winner  
Lets enjoy it all while it lasts  
Cause youre a winner
