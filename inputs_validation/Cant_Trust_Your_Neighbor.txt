Hit me in the the eye maybe I can see better  
I lost the only girl I ever loved now I got to forget her  
Let me tell you I found out oh baby I found out  
That you cant you cant you cant  
Trust your neighbor with your baby  
A friend of mine howd a lived next door  
You know that friend of mine he dont live there no more  
My baby use to go all out for salt  
But I found out he was giving her sugar  
I trust him with my baby the dirty dog he took her  
They said she warns the neighbors that she have him to do you  
But my neighbor didnt even have a woman to talk to  
Thats why thats why thats why you cant  
Trust your neighbor with your baby  
Oh how I loved the girl in my heart I still do  
Let me tell you when your neighbor get her  
He dont leave to much of you  
Let me tell you I found out I found out  
Can you hear me  
Come on and listen to me now  
I found out alright  
Let me say it just one more time now yall  
Let me tell you  
Let me tell you cant let me tell you cant  
Let me tell you cant you cant you cant  
That you cant you cant you cant  
Trust your neighbor with your baby
