Ive walked a million miles across this floor  
But I never have quite made it to the door  
I never thought the time would come  
Id ever see this day  
When you could make me feel so thrown away  
  
Im feeling like an old pair of shoes  
All worn out from walking through these blues  
Theres a hole in my soul  
And Im really feeling used  
Im just like an old pair of shoes  
  
Youve always been my one and only love  
It aint no easy thing to give you up  
Looking back Im feeling like  
Theres nothing left to lose  
This time I may just walk out on you cause  
  
Im feeling like an old pair of shoes  
All worn out from walking through these blues  
Theres a hole in my soul  
And Im really feeling used  
Im just like an old pair of shoes  
  
Theres a hole in my soul  
And Im really feeling used  
Im just like an old pair of shoes
