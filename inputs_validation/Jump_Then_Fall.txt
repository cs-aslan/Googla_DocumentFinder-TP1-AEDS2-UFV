I like the way you sound in the morning  
Were on the phone and without a warning  
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard  
  
I like the way I cant keep my focus  
I watch you talk you didnt notice  
I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together  
  
Every time you smile I smile  
And every time you shine Ill shine for you  
  
Whoa oh Im feeling you baby  
Dont be afraid to jump then fall jump then fall into me  
  
Baby Im never gonna leave you  
Say that you wanna be with me too  
Cuz Ima stay through it all so jump then fall  
  
Well I like the way your hair falls in your face  
You got the keys to me I love each freckle on your face oh  
Ive never been so wrapped up  
Honey I like the way youre everything Ive ever wanted  
  
I had time to think it all over and all I can say is come closer  
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me  
  
Every time you smile I smile  
And every time you shine Ill shine for you  
  
Whoa oh Im feeling you baby  
Dont be afraid to jump then fall jump then fall into me  
  
Baby Im never gonna leave you  
Say that you wanna be with me too  
Ima stay through it all so jump then fall  
  
The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet  
Ill catch you Ill catch you  
When people say things that bring you to your knees  
Ill catch you  
The time is gonna come when youre so mad you could cry  
But Ill hold you through the night until you smile  
  
Whoa oh I need you baby  
Dont be afraid please  
Jump then fall jump then fall into me  
  
Baby Im never gonna leave you  
Say that you wanna be with me too  
Ima stay through it all so jump then fall  
  
Jump then fall baby  
Jump then fall into me into me  
  
Every time you smile I smile  
And every time you shine Ill shine  
And every time youre here baby Ill show you Ill show you  
You can jump then fall jump then fall jump then fall into me into me
