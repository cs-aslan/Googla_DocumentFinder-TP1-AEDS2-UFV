Repeat x2  
Protection prevention  
Detection detention  
Theres no where to defect to any more  
  
Repeat x2  
Im building a wall  
A fine wall  
Not so much to keep you out  
More to keep me in  
  
Back then on a bomb site  
We were spies among the ruins  
Such precocious barbarians  
On TV we saw  
Cold War  
  
Repeat x2  
Protection prevention  
Detection detention  
Theres no where to defect to any more  
  
Im leaving the world  
Its all wrong  
Not so much what many are doing  
Much more whats within us  
  
Im building a wall  
A fine wall  
Not so much to keep you out  
More to keep me in  
  
Jesus and the man from Angol  
Caesar conquered Gaul  
Scouting for Centurians  
On a Roman war  
  
Through the woods the trees  
And further on the sea  
We lived in the shadow of the wall  
Sand in the sandwiches  
Wasps in the tea  
It was a free country  
who do you think you are Captain Britain  
  
Im building a wall  
A fine wall  
Not so much to keep you out  
More to keep me in  
  
Im losing my head  
Well why not  
More work for the undertaker  
Means theres less for me  
  
Repeat x3  
Im building a wall  
A fine wall  
Not so much to keep you out  
More to keep me in
