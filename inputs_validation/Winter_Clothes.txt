When our love was new  
Through springs first morning sun  
Wed run only beginning  
I never gave a thought  
That sun and seasons change  
Its strange so soon its the ending  
Let me get my overcoat  
Let me get my hat  
When Ill lose the warmth of you  
Ill need that  
Let me put my rain shoes on  
Ill need some of those  
When Ill leave the warmth of you  
I suppose Ill need my winter clothes  
Need my winter clothes  
I never will forget  
My summer sorceress  
Your dress light as the laughter  
And golden leaves that fell  
Like notes from a lovers song  
Gone wrong lost ever after  
Let me get my overcoat  
Ill need my scarf and gloves  
When Ill face the chill of night  
Without my love  
Let me put my rain shoes on  
Ill need some of those  
Ill bring the days of golden sun  
Took the clothes  
Need my winter clothes  
Need my winter clothes  
Need my winter clothes
