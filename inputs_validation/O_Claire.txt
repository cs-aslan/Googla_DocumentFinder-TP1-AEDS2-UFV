Bye bye love goodbye  
See you on the other side  
Bye bye love goodbye  
Ill see you on the other side  
  
Hurry on home to bed  
O Claire youre much younger  
Than Id ever hoped to be  
  
O Claire its so lonely when youre not there  
Anyone can take me where  
The places they werent there O Claire  
  
I hear your heart from here  
But now youre much stronger  
Than Id ever hoped to be  
  
I swear gone a place beyond compare  
So lonely when youre not there  
I can step to watch and stare O Claire  
  
Just between the two of us  
Something tween the two of us  
Is more than just the two of us  
Just between the two of us  
O my love goodbye  
O my love goodbye  
  
Hurry on home to bed  
Claire youre much stronger  
Than Id ever hoped to be  
  
O Claire the nights when youre not there  
Is more than I can bear  
Something only we can share O Claire  
  
Just between the two of us  
Something tween the two of us  
Is more than just the two of us  
Just between the two of us  
O my love goodbye  
O my love goodbye  
  
Bye bye love goodbye  
Ill see you on the other side  
Bye bye love goodbye  
See you on the other side  
Bye bye love goodbye  
  
Just between the two of us  
Something tween the two of us  
Is more than just the two of us  
Just between the two of us  
O my love goodbye  
O my love  
  
Bye bye love goodbye  
See you on the other side  
Bye bye love goodbye  
Ill see you on the other side
