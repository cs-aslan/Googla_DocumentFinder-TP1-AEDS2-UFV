Knocked out of my breath  
Since I fell for you  
Now Ive come down  
With the heartbreak blues  
Its gonna take a doctor  
Witha special degree  
I need a love doctor  
I need a love MD  
  
Ive been sick yall  
Ive been sick yall  
Bedridden  
Bedridden  
  
I need a prescription  
Just right for me  
A lot of bed rest  
And some company  
A whole lot of hugs  
A little sympathy  
I need a love doctor  
I need a love MD  
  
Ive been sick yall  
A love MD
