You live on your hill so high and so lonely  
You toss out your bread crumbs to those down below  
They think youre a king but believe me its only  
Because theyre too blind to know  
  
There once was a time when your money had meaning  
Your diamonds had glitter but now its all gone  
It poisoned your laughter and muffled your singing  
You cant even see that its wrong  
  
Chorus  
Your castle is dingy and dirty and dismal  
Your carpets are faded your walls are all gray  
Theres dust on your silver and cracks in your crystal  
All your young servants have drifted away  
  
So go back to your sadness go back to your sorrow  
And Ill make my bed on a hill neath the sky  
And lay here alistening till the sun comes tomorrow  
Counting the tears that you cry  
  
Chorus
