I was just the age of sixteen  
When I first went on the drive  
After six months hard labor  
At home I did arrive  
I courted with a pretty girl  
Twas her caused me to roam  
Now Im just a river driver  
And Im far away from home  
  
Chorus  
Ill eat when I am hungry  
And Ill drink when I am dry  
Get drunk whenever Im ready  
Get sober by and by  
And if this river dont drown me  
Its down Ill mean to roam  
For Im a river driver  
And Im far away from home  
  
Ill build a lonesome castle  
Upon some mountain high  
Where she can sit and view me  
As I go passing by  
Where she can sit and view me  
As I go marching on  
For Im a river driver  
And Im far away from home  
  
Chorus  
  
When I am old and feeble  
And in my sickness lie  
Just wrap me up in a blanket  
And lay me down to die  
Just get a little bluebird  
To sing for me alone  
For Im a river driver  
And Im far away from home  
  
Chorus x2  
  
For Im a river driver  
And Im far away from home
