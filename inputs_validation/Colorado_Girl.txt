Im goin out to Denver  
See if I cant find  
Im goin out to Denver  
See if I cant find  
That lovin Colorado girl of mine  
  
The promise in her smile  
Shames the mountains tall  
The promise in her smile  
Shames the mountains tall  
She bring the sun to shining  
Tell the rain to fall  
  
Its been a long time mama  
Since I heard you call my name  
Ah been a long time  
Since I heard you call my name  
I got to see my Colorado girl again  
  
Be there tomorrow  
Mama dont you cry  
Be there tomorrow  
Now mama dont you cry  
I got to kiss these  
Lonesome Texas blues goodbye  
  
Im goin out to to Denver  
See if I cant find  
Im goin out to to Denver  
See if I cant find  
That lovin Colorado girl of mine  
That lovin Colorado girl of mine
