Welcome to our monastery  
Please have a chair  
Good to see you monks  
So deep in prayer  
Once the prayings finished  
Your chores must be done  
The main rule of a good monks life is no fun  
  
We have to pray eight times a day  
Seven days a week  
And copy all these manuscripts  
In writing so antique  
Ill finish off this letter a  
Once Ive ploughed our field  
Milked the cows mucked the sows vegetables peeled  
  
Ill be doing that and praying too  
Very well gents Ill bid you adieu  
Advenium regnum tuum  
  
Okay brothers I think hes gone  
  
Now the bishops not around  
Throw off these religious gowns  
Hunky chunky funky monks  
Get down  
  
Its not all hymns and prayin  
Its not all work and no playin  
So lets start misbehavin  
And get with the funk  
  
We love to have a party  
Eat food that is hearty  
Lets get the boozin started  
Drunk like a monk  
Play that monky music funk boy  
  
Just wanted to check  
That during my absence  
Youre honouring your  
Mealtime vow of silence  
  
Althought we didnt oughter  
We liked to hunt and slaughter  
Dont need no bread and water  
Just funk funk funk  
  
Monastery is jumpin  
Party beat is thumpin  
Just lacks a certain somethin  
A funky nun  
Get in the party habit girlfriend  
  
Its true that life  
Is tough here  
But you obey the rules  
That is clear  
Thats why were a place  
Of great repute  
Whats this  
I see we have a new recruit  
Welcome to our monastery  
Whats your name  
  
She he cant talk  
And his name is Wayne  
Amen  
Ah men
