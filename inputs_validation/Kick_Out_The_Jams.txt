Kick Out the Jams motherfuckers  
Im gonna kick em out  
  
Well I feel pretty good  
And I guess that I could get crazy now baby  
Cause we all got in tune  
When the dressing room got hazy now baby  
  
I know how you want it child  
Hot sweet and tight  
The girls cant stand it  
When youre doing it right When theyre up on the stand  
And then they kick out the jams yes  
Kick out the jams I like to kick em out  
  
Yes Im startin to sweat  
You know my shirts all wet  
What a feelin  
And the sound that abounds and  
Resounds and rebounds off the ceiling  
You gotta have it baby  
You cant do without  
When you get the feelin  
Youve got the sounds above  
Put that mic in my hand  
And let me kick out the jams  
Yes kick out the jams got to kick em out  
  
So you got to get it up  
And then cant get enough  
No you cant get enough Miss Mackenzie  
Cause it gets in your brain  
It drives you insane leaping frenzy  
The  the faster you funk  
If you want to feed my rocket  
Till the morning comes  
Let me be who I am  
And let me kick out the jams  
Yes kick out the jams  
I done kick em out  
  
PS Kick OUt the Jams Motherfuckers peace sheena
