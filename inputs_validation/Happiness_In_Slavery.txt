Slave screams he thinks he knows what he wants  
Slave screams thinks he has something to say  
Slave screams he hears but doesnt want to listen  
Slave screams hes being beat into submission  
Dont open your eyes you wont like what you see  
The devils of truth steal the souls of the free  
Dont open your eyes take it from me  
I have found  
You can find  
Happiness is slavery  
Slave screams he spends his life learning conformity  
Slave screams he claims he has his own identity  
Slave screams hes going to cause the system to fall  
Slave screams but hes glad to be chained to that wall  
Dont open your eyes you wont like what you see  
The blind have been blessed with security  
Dont open your eyes take it from me  
I have found  
You can find  
Happiness is slavery  
I dont know what I am I dont know where Ive been  
Human junk just words and so much skin  
Stick my hands through the cage of this endless routine  
Just some flesh caught in this big broken machine
