Once again youre home alone  
Tears running from your eyes  
And Im on the outside  
Knowing that youre all I want  
But I cant do anything  
Im so helpless baby  
  
Everyday same old things  
So youre still feelin pain  
Never had real love before  
And it aint her fault  
  
She knows better but  
She cant help it  
Wanna tell her  
But would that be selfish  
How do you heal  
A heart that cant feel its broken  
His love is all she knows all she knows all she knows  
His love is all she knows all she knows all she knows  
  
Youve been livin this way so long  
You dont know the difference  
And its killing me  
Cause you can have so much more  
Im the one your looking for  
But you close your eyes on me  
So you still cant see  
  
Everyday same old things  
So youre still feelin pain  
Never had real love before  
And it aint her fault  
  
She knows better but  
She cant help it  
Wanna tell her  
But would that be selfish  
How do you heal  
A heart that cant feel its broken  
His love is all she knows all she knows all she knows  
His love is all she knows all she knows all she knows  
  
All she knows is the pain  
In the corner of an empty home  
Shes still comfortable  
I want her to know  
It can be better than this  
I cant pretend  
Wish we were more than friends  
  
Everyday same old things  
So youre still feelin pain  
Never had real love before  
And it aint her fault  
  
She knows better but  
She cant help it  
Wanna tell her  
But would that be selfish  
How do you heal  
A heart that cant feel its broken  
His love is all she knows all she knows all she knows  
His love is all she knows all she knows all she knows
