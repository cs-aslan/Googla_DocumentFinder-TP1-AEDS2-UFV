Verse  
I push pppush it I pppush it like Im in labor  
And hell ttteach me toteach me love my neighbor  
Just wwwait up Im processin all the data  
Processin all the data ppprocessin all the haters  
You was writin disses I was takin pictures  
Signin autographs for all of my bad bitches  
And in a nic of time it just dawned on me  
I am Nicki Minaj and its all on me  
But hey maybe Ill never win  
Maybe Im settlin  
Cant let the devil in Im a comic book heroin  
But when the wind blows Im so Marilyn Im so Marilyn  
Write it down take a picture bitches email that  
I came to save a thing called female rap  
But I hope my ninja powers  
Dont fuck around and offend you cowards  
You mad at me cus you think I got it easy  
If we was in the second grade then you would tease me  
But see you still a lil snotty nose hood rat  
I love Nicki scribbled all over you book bag  
I love you too I just wish ya mother wouldve hugged you too  
You know Nicki love the kids  
Yellow brick road lookin for the Wiz  
But when it rains it pours for real  
Def Jam said Im no Lauryn Hill  
Cant rap and sing on the same cd  
The public wont get it they got A D D  
See Nicki follow the rules  
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school  
Yeah follow the rules let me say my prayers and get ready for school  
  
Dear God I am only what you made me  
And I appreciate everything that you gave me  
But like I dont wanna do it no more  
Sort of lost sight of what Im doin it for  
Thought that I was doin somethin good for the game  
Until they all started throwin dirt on my name  
Tell Debbie I really really tried  
That I said Im sorry but I had to say goodbye  
Tell Fendi Ill never forget him  
And please tell Wayne Ill always be indebted  
Ill never forget it please tell Wayne Ill always be indebted
