Chorus  
Murder one of yall niggas  
Get to hurtin one of yall niggas  
Bitches snatch the shirt off one of yall niggas  
  
Kick dirt  
Color glocks splitters just listen theres UFO visitors  
Fly paintings remainin reclinin procommissioner  
One boot off he Rudolph know he hyped flew off  
Hibernatin dead in the makin earrake him gearrake him  
Technician murderer Wu hit the universe  
Our words is crush fingers icy slush ringers wants Mercedes bust  
Tip bottles Movado sailin in some Wu googles you follow  
Mail and jail letters sendin niggas lottos  
What made you murder my flow what made you rival my clothes  
What made you fuck it yo son these niggas gotta owe  
I think a lot of flows I flip exotic hoes  
We paintin pictures if its  I seen a lot of those  
Gettin fly with Ghost power just buy the boats  
Rsa your vision is exquisite daddy hide your scrolls  
Platonic chronic shows tonic prose  
Off the meter Panasonic know son line me a ho  
  
Devestatin shockwaves strikin the nation  
Newsflash warn the people assassination  
The hour of detonation pure untampered or mixed in any form  
In any form mixed untampered its pure  
Dissect each line of the rhyme  
Find my ingredients and nutrients  
Teach patience and obedience before movement  
Killer bee student enrollment  
Im out your control and expose if its synthetic  
Quote these plush degrees as I inject theres many at risk  
Slang therapist Shallah Rae  
Plus the people with magnificent wordplay  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey yo you know the half some get respect most we show the path  
They quoted tracks while we spoke math blowin fast  
Expose the craft first picks chosen in the draft  
I dont flash hoes love me cause I hold a stash  
Known to blast paramedics couldnt close the gash  
Floatin past in an alley with the oak dash  
Show the cash watch it blow in half its no fair  
They goin mad check their tape recorders and their notepads  
Crabs want to play me close and grab  
Cant believe you on the canvas Im just throwin jabs  
Where the powers you supposed to have hand in your soldier rag  
You posin bad show your ass son you wont last  
With heavy weights that elevate the whole mass  
Compose a smash rollin grass at Ghost lab  
  
drink to your new life iron flag brothers
