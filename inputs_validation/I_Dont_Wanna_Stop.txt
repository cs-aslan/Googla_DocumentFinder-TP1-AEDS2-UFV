I dont know what theyre talking about  
Im making my own decisions  
This thing that I found  
Aint gonna bring me down  
Im like a junkie without an addiction  
  
Mama dont cry  
I just wanna say hi  
Like playing with danger and fear  
Everybodys walking but nobodys talking  
It looks a lot better from here  
  
All my life Ive been over the top  
I dont know what Im doing  
All I know is I dont wanna stop  
All fired up Im gonna go till I drop  
You are the real reason  
Please dont make me I dont wanna stop  
  
Why dont they ever listen to me  
Its just a oneway conversation  
Nothing they say is gonna set me free  
Dont need no mental masturbation  
  
Too many religions and only one God  
I dont need another savior  
Dont try to change my mind  
You know Im one of a kind  
Aint gonna change my bad behavior  
  
Chorus x 2  
All my life Ive been over the top  
I dont know what Im doing  
All I know is I dont wanna stop  
All fired up Im gonna go till I drop  
Youre either in or in the way  
Dont make me I dont wanna stop  
  
Are you ever going to stop  
I dont wanna stop  
I dont wanna stop  
Are you ever going to stop  
I dont wanna stop  
I dont wanna stop  
  
Chorus x 2
