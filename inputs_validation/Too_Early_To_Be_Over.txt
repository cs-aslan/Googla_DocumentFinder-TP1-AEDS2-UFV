With another day another life slips away  
And floats above the crowd  
You can only stay ahead of time when time cooperates  
Instead of heading south  
Cards are dealt  
You play what you hold  
You cant tell me the storys been told  
  
Chorus   
Its too early to be over  
And its way past when  
It could be starting again  
Its too early to be over  
Good hearted Joe is the last one to know  
  
Run down run around biting my tongue  
Hardly my sad tale  
But the rolling in and steppin out  
Nothing but fun  
I finally had to bail  
Nothing worse than trying too hard  
This aint this fools first walk in the park  
  
Its too early to be over  
I dont feel a thing from the bone to the skin  
Its too early to be over  
Good hearted Joe is the last one to know  
  
Somewhere out there it all evens out  
So they would have you believe  
But that dont get me  
That wont set me free  
  
Its too early to be over  
And its way past when it could be starting over  
Its too early to be over  
Always the fave but I already gave  
  
Chorus
