All around my hat  
I will wear the green willow  
And all around my hat  
For a twelwe month and a day  
And if anyone should ask me  
The reason why Im wearing it  
Its all for my true love  
Whos far far away  
  
Fare the well cold winter  
And fare the well cold frost  
But nothing have I gain  
But my own true love Ive lost  
Ill sing and Ill be merry  
When occasion I do see  
Shes a false deluded young girl  
Let here go farewell she  
  
And all around my hat  
I will wear the green willow  
And all around my hat  
For a twelwe month and a day  
And if anyone should ask me  
The reason why Im wearing it  
Its all for my true love  
Whos far far away  
  
The other night she brought me  
A fine diamond ring but  
She tought to have deprive me  
Of a far better thing  
But I being careful  
As lovers ought to be  
Shes a false deluded young girl  
Let her go farewell she  
  
And all around my hat  
I will wear the green willow  
And all around my hat  
For a twelwe month and a day  
And if anyone should ask me  
The reason why Im wearing it  
Its all for my true love  
Whos far far away  
  
All around my hat  
I will wear the green willow  
And all around my hat  
For a twelwe month and a day  
And if anyone should ask me  
The reason why Im wearing it  
Its all for my true love  
Whos far far away
