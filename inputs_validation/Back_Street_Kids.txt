Im just another back street kid  
Rock n Roll music is the only thing I really dig  
Cant stop the music going round inside my head  
Im a rock n roll soldier gonna play it until Im dead  
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock n roll away from me  
  
Sitting in the back seat of a shiny limousine  
Living in a taxi cant remember where Ive been  
Playing my music sitting in my hotel room  
Writing about the stars and thinking about the hand of doom  
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock n roll away from me  
  
Living life comes easy if you know which way youre going  
Got to see yourself in others eyes surprised  
Living like I want to dont come easy but Im trying  
Sorting out whats true and what are lies its wise  
  
Brought up in a back street living with the salt of the land  
Seems that now my musics paying off my tax demands  
So listen to the music want to see you get so high  
Cause Im a back street rocker and I will be till the day I die  
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock n roll away from me
