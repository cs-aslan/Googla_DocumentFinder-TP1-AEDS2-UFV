You look so good when youre depressed  
Better even in your current state of undress  
Tears caressing me like rain  
And Im not even thinking I feel fine in your pain  
The coolest thing I ever saw  
You were sitting there smoking my cigarettes  
You were naked on the bare stone floor  
You looked at me to say dont guess  
I was only watching yes I love you more undressed  
Is it really such a sin  
Should I feel some kind of shame  
Will I truly go to hell  
Oh you never lock the bathroom door  
Should I be embarrassed when Ive seen a hundred times before  
How do married couples cope  
Should I say excuse me darling I dont know  
We could disconnect the telephone  
Just sit around and mess around  
And tell your ma we went to rome tennessee  
And Im not even drinking I feel fine its scary  
Is it really such a sin  
Should I feel some kind of shame  
Will I truly go to hell  
Oh well  
The coolest thing I ever saw  
You were sitting there smoking my cigarettes  
You were naked on the bare stone floor  
You looked at me to say dont guess  
I was only watching is it bad that I should love you best  
Undressed
