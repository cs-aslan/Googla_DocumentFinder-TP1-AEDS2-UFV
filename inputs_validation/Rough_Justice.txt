The gates have opened  
Now Im a free man  
My time is over  
I need a new plan  
But Ive had no loving  
For a year and a day  
My ladys waiting  
Got a taste for her wine  
Shes wearing money  
But none of its mine  
Shes been surviving  
While Ive been wasting away  
  
Chorus  
Back in my room  
It aint quite the same  
You cant hide it  
Im onto your game  
  
Rough justice theres no disguise  
And I can tell by  
The look in your eyes  
Rough justice Ive had my share  
Ive done my time  
But Im still running scared  
Rough justice  
Coming down on me  
Long arm of the law  
Never setting me free  
Rough justice I bide my time  
  
Back in action Im riding the crest  
And putting all that  
Ive learned to the test  
No complications  
Taking it day by day  
Freedom of movement  
Freedom of choice  
Free to be right back here  
With the boys  
Ready to listen  
But youve got nothing to say  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Rough justice
