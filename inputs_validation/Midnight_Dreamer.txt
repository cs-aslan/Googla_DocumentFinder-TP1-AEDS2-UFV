All alone through the countryside  
Clouds in my brain vision in my eyes  
Thoughts are on the wall  
Like oceons on the sand  
Midnight dreamer take me if you can  
You cant deny it seems so easy to do  
But women trade in black  
And now shes sinning on you  
Giving you my heart theres nothin you can do  
Midnight lover Im in love with you  
Shes my midnight lover wild and fancy free  
Standing in the shadows in the palace of my dreams  
Youre a pretty thing like fire from the sun  
Youve got to catch her while shes shining before the morning comes  
Could this be a dream  
Dream on dream on dream on
