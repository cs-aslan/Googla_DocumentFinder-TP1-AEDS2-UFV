Life we talk of death  
Each breath come closer to out  
Of this Im not afraid  
Though I dont know what its all about  
  
I dont know  
I dont know  
  
Decisions that we make  
The chances that we take  
Blindness we cant fake  
Thought I knew but now I know what its like  
  
To be alone  
I know  
  
I remember here  
Thought it was a dream  
I never thought Id come to this  
Living with the fear  
Now I know what it means  
I never thought itd end like this  
  
Falling with no end  
Into what Ive only done to me  
With messages to send  
Out of what Ive only done to me  
  
Falling with no  
Calling with no  
Crawling to the end  
  
I remember here  
Thought it was a dream  
I never thought Id come to this  
I remember here  
Now I know what it means  
I never thought itd end like this  
  
Falling with no end  
Into what Ive only done to me  
With messages to send  
Out of what Ive only done to me  
  
I remember here  
Thought it was a dream  
I never thought Id come to this  
Living with the fear  
Now I know what it means  
I never thought itd end like this  
  
Falling with no  
Calling with no  
Crawling to the end  
  
Falling with no  
Calling with no  
Crawling to the end  
  
I remember here  
Thought it was a dream  
I never thought Id come to this  
Living with the fear  
Now I know what it means  
I never thought itd end like this  
  
I remember here  
Thought it was a dream  
I never thought Id come to this  
Living with the fear  
Now I know what it means  
I never thought itd end like this  
  
I remember here
