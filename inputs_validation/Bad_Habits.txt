I seen you walking down the street with another man  
Girl youre really shocking  
I seen you walking down the street with another hand  
Held in your stockings  
  
Boys will be boys and girls will be trouble  
And Im a man of bad habits  
I seen you walking down the street with another man  
Girl I had to have it  
  
Bad habits  
Bad habits  
Bad habits  
  
You and I we should meet  
Yeah you and I we should get together  
Me and you and I should meet  
In the rain and stormy weather  
  
Bad habits  
Bad habits  
Bad habits  
  
No messing around  
Nows the time to start  
  
Boys will be boys and girls will be trouble  
And Im a man of bad habits  
I seen you walking down the street with another girl  
Man I had to have it  
  
I know it gets into your brain  
Sometimes it dribbles and goes in your veins  
I tell you this boys is the same  
This boys got bad habits  
  
You and I should meet  
You and I we should get together  
You and I you know we should meet  
Hey babe check it out the stormy weather  
  
Bad habits  
I got bad habits  
I got bad habits
