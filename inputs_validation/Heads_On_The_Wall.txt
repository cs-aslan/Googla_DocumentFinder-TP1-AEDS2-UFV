Im in a cold and lonely tomb  
Surrounded by darkness in my new found home  
Im not alone anymore alone anymore  
Im looking back at yesterday  
I do remember my escape and what I had to do  
Have to do dont you see dont you see  
  
Heads on the wall Im looking at  
Heads on the wall dead yet alive  
Heads on the wall  
Im looking at heads on the wall heads  
  
Did you know if you die in a graveyard  
The soul cant escape if you lose your head  
But it lives on in the brain in your brain  
Dont you see dont you see  
  
Heads on the wall Im looking at  
Heads on the wall dead yet alive  
Heads on the wall  
Im looking at heads on the wall  
  
Last night when I climbed the cemetery gate  
I saw a man digging in the ground  
Working the late shift it was the gravedigger  
Jeremiah had worked here for years  
Already had one foot in the grave  
With my help we got in the other  
I cant believe he wasnt stronger  
  
Mary the hooker was coming to church  
To let the reverend fill up her purse  
Jesse Bell may his soul rest in hell  
No one must find out no one must tell  
  
Heads on the wall Im looking at  
Heads on the wall dead yet alive  
Heads on the wall  
And theyre staring at me and me and me  
  
No one comes and leaves again  
Ive got to make sure no one knows where I am  
Especially that man I remember  
I cant get rid of those voices
