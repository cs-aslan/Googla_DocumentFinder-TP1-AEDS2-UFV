If I told you that Id never really cared  
And if I told you that Id never cried  
Youd know that I lied  
Youd know I lied  
And if I told you that Id found somebody new  
It wouldnt make it any easier  
And what he doesnt know  
Wont hurt at all  
  
You know just as well as I  
That hes a better man than I  
And I know you know  
  
Guess I never got around to telling you  
I guess that if I told you now  
Then Id have nothing to lose  
Well I think of you  
Cause if I told you that Id found another girl  
It wouldnt make it any easier  
And what he doesnt know  
Wont hurt at all  
  
You know just as well as I  
That hes a better man than I  
You know just as well as I  
You know just as well as I  
Hes a better man than I  
Hes a better man than I could ever be
