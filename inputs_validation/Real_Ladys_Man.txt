Oh the taste of wine and liquor and a womans tender kiss  
Sure paints the perfect picture thats so hard to resist  
Though the lure of the old night life has always tempted fools  
It cant compare with what you stand to lose  
  
Chorus  
Remember the promise you wear on your left hand  
Cheatins no companion for a real ladys man  
  
If only I had listened to my own words of advice  
And turned down the invitation in another womans eyes  
For the softness of a stranger I threw good love away  
Friend there aint no higher price to pay  
  
Chorus
