Play  
  
Playing with my sexuality  
Play with your body with your mind  
  
All you people staring at the wall  
Gonna make it easy easy for all  
  
When I say I dont dance Im mean  
Not like you  
When I say I dont dance I need  
Something new  
  
All you pretty babies staring at the boy  
Gonna tell you something you wont get no joy  
  
When I say I dont wanna dance Im mean  
Not like you  
When I say I dont dance I need  
Something new  
  
Wednesday night I sleep unfolded  
Thursday night another dream  
Friday night wy heart is pumping  
Saturday Im feeling mean  
  
Say it with your body  
Say it with your body with your mind  
Say it with you sexuality  
With your body with your mind
