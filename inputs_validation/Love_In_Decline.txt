Left one in the drizzling rain  
Found one on the morning plane  
Leaving out his wellknown line  
Bought her some gin  that did her in  
Now theyre making love behind the occupied sign  
  
Chorus  
Just a living example of love in decline  
Looking so hard and so little time  
Going ninety to nothing and flying stone blind  
Just a living example of love in decline  
  
Miami hotel disco bar  
He asked if shes a movie star  
Her eyes light and up  theyre going far  
No time for a room it happened to soon  
Now theyre making love in her rental car  
Just a living example of love in decline
