I was dancing when I was twelve  
I was dancing when I was twelve  
I was dancing when I wasoh  
I was dancing when I wasoh  
I danced myself out of the womb  
I danced myself out of the womb  
Is it strange to dance so soon  
Is it strange to dance so soon  
Is it wrong to understand  
The fear that dwells inside a man  
Whats it like to be a loon  
I liken it to a balloon  
Oh  
I danced myself into the tomb  
I danced myself into the tomb  
Is it strange to dance so soon  
Is it strange to dance so soon  
Is it wrong to understand  
The fear that dwells inside a man  
Whats it like to be a loon  
I liken it to a balloon  
Oh
