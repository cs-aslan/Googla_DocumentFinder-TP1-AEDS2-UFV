6 John  
  
Cuz I dont give a damn nigga damn you

Passed on generation to generation  
Grandmas old box of wild jewels

Her diamonds blue  
But yours is so blue  
Here lets make yours hers and  
Let me hold you up  
Like you at attention  
And give me gat attention  
And if theres anything you failed to mention Ive got bad intentions  
You dont want to end up missing with a stint  
Youd rather hand your riches  
Thats the smart thing to do  
  
Let me hold you up  
  
Chorus NeYo  
  
On your arm on your neck on your wrist I want it  
Yeah thats right all your ice and your cash I want it  
Hold you up and nigga I aint trynna front with you  
Please dont make me kill ya  
Just let me hold you up  
And that nigga you close to  
Im jacking both you  
The nine that Im holdin will stop you from livin  
Dont try to play me just give me it all and let me hold you up
