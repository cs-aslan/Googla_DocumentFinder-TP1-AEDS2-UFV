I saw an old lover today on the street  
She said Do you remember how we used to be  
On fire with that passion wed burn down those nights  
No I havent forgotten how we used to fight  
I finally got married and settled on down  
Yeah shes a preachers daughter in a sleepy little town  
Does she make you laugh since we said goodbye  
No she aint that funny but she never makes me cry  
She never makes me cry like you used to  
Theres nothing about her that reminds me of you  
I promise I dont see your face when I look in her eyes  
And she never makes me cry  
Does she make you beg for her love in the night  
No she aint that selfish and she never makes me cry  
She never makes me cry like you used to  
Theres nothing about her that reminds me of you  
I promise I dont see your face when I look in her eyes  
She never makes me wonder when shes coming home  
Theres something about her like Ive never known  
Its been nice to see you but now I must say goodbye  
She never makes me cry she never makes me cry no no  
She never makes me cry  
She never makes me cry
