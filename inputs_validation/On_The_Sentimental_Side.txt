If you wonder why Im near you  
Even though Ive been denied  
Im inclined to be a little  
On the sentimental side  
I suppose I should forget you  
If I had an ounce of pride  
But I guess I cant help being  
On the sentimental side  
I should act gay  
Laugh it off and say farewell  
Say it just didnt wear well  
But Im not that way  
Im in hopes youll think it over  
And perhaps be satisfied  
With a simple sort of person  
On the sentimental side  
  
I should act gay  
Laugh it off and say farewell  
Say it just didnt wear well  
But Im not that way  
Im in hopes youll think it over  
And perhaps be satisfied  
With a simple sort of person  
On the sentimental side
