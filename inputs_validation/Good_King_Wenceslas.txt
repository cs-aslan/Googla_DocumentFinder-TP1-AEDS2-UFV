Baljeet Good King Wenceslas looked out  
On the Feast of Stephen  
  
Buford Sorry Im late I was busy doin some rewrites  
Baljeet Rewrites  
Buford Ive highlighted your parts Now sing along  
  
Buford Santa Claus and all his elves  
Are making gifts for Buford  
Baljeet I dont think thats how it goes  
Buford Nobodys askin you nerd  
  
Baljeet Buford Youre completely disrespecting this classic song Youre  
Ignoring the historical context King Wenceslas was a great man You have  
No idea what this song is about  
Buford I know all about this song  
  
Buford The words were by an English guy  
The music Scandanavian  
Wenceslas was fivefootsix  
He kept his face unshaven  
Though just a duke throughout his life  
He always ruled so justly  
His kingly title was conferred  
Upon him posthumously  
  
Baljeet Well I stand corrected You seem to have a lot of information  
But if you know so much about it why do you not sing the original song  
Buford I like my version better Its about me  
  
Buford Buford should get lots of gifts  
Every Christmas season  
When I see presents just for me  
It always is so pleasin  
That is why I changed the words  
To make the song more edgy  
If you dont like the way I sing  
Youll get a Christmas wedgie
