Take this job and shove it  
I aint workin here no more  
My woman done left and took all of the reasons  
That I was workin for  
  
You better not try to stand in my way  
When Im walkin out the door  
Take this job and shove it  
I aint workin here no more  
  
Well Ive been working in this factory  
Pretty close to 15 years  
Ive seen some of my best friends women  
Drownin in a pool of tears  
  
Ive seen a lot of kinfolks dyin  
I had a lot of bills to pay  
Lord Id give the shirt right often my back  
If I had the guts to say say what  
  
Take this job and shove it  
I aint workin here no more  
My womans done left and took all of the reasons  
That I was workin for  
  
You better not try to stand in my way  
When Im walkin out the door  
Take this job and shove it  
I aint workin here no more  
  
The foreman is a regular SOB  
And the night boss hes a fool  
He got himself a brand new flattop haircut  
Lord he really thinks thats cool  
  
One of these days Im gonna blow my top  
And thats shockin hes gonna pay it  
Well I cant wait to see their faces  
When I get the nerve to say say what  
  
Take this job and shove it  
I aint workin here no more  
My woman done left and took all of the reasons  
That I was workin for  
  
You better not try to stand in my way  
When Im walkin out the door  
Take this job and shove it  
I aint workin here no more  
Take this job and shove it
