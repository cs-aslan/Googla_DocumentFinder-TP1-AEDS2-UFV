Even in the quietest moments  
I wish I knew what I had to do  
And even though the sun is shining  
Well I feel the rain here it comes again dear  
And even when you showed me  
My heart was out of tune  
For theres a shadow of doubt thats not letting me find you too soon  
The music that you gave me  
The language of my soul  
Oh Lord I want to be with you  
Wont you let me come in from the cold  
  
Dont you let the sun fade away  
Dont you let the sun fade away  
Dont you let the sun be leaving  
Wont you come to me soon  
  
And even though the stars are listening  
And the oceans deep I just go to sleep  
And then I create a silent movie  
You become the star is that what you are dear  
Your whisper tells a secret  
Your laughter brings me joy  
And a wonder of feeling Im natures own little boy  
But still the tears keep falling  
Theyre raining from the sky  
Well theres a lot of me got to go under before I get high  
  
Dont you let the sun disappear  
Dont you let the sun disappear  
Dont you let the sun be leaving  
No you cant be leaving my life  
Say that you wont be leaving my life  
Say that you wont be leaving my life  
Say wont you please stay wont you please  
Say wont you please stay wont you please  
Lord wont you come and get into my life  
Lord wont you come and get into my life  
Say wont you please stay wont you please  
Say wont you please stay wont you please  
Oh Lord dont go  
  
And even when the song is over  
Where have I been was it just a dream  
And though your door is always open  
Where do I begin may I please come in dear
