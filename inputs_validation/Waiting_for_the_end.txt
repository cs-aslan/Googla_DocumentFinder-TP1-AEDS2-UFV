This is not the end  
This is not the beginning  
Just a voice like a riot  
Rocking every revision  
But you listen to the tone  
And the violent rhythm  
And though the words sound steady  
Something emptys within em  
  
We say Yeah  
With fists flying up in the air  
Like were holding onto something  
Thats invisible there  
Cause were living at the mercy of  
The pain and the fear  
Until we get it forget it  
Let it all disappear  
  
Waiting for the end to come  
Wishing I had strength to stand  
This is not what I had planned  
Its out of my control  
  
Flying at the speed of light  
Thoughts were spinning in my head  
So many things were left unsaid  
Its hard to let you go  
  
Oh I know what it takes to move on  
I know how it feels to lie  
All I wanna do  
Is trade this life for something new  
Holding on to what I havent got  
  
Sitting in an empty room  
Trying to forget the past  
This was never meant to last  
I wish it wasnt so  
  
Oh I know what it takes to move on  
  
I know how it feels to lie  
All I wanna do  
Is trade this life for something new  
Holding on to what I havent got  
  
Yeah yeah  
What was left when that fire was gone  
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong  
All caught up in the eye of the storm  
And trying to figure out what its like moving on  
And I dont even know what kind of things Ive said  
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead  
So picking up the pieces now where to begin  
The hardest part of ending is starting again  
  
All I wanna do  
Is trade this life for something new  
Holding on to what I havent got  
  
This is not the end  
This is not the beginning  
Just a voice like a riot  
Rocking every revision  
But you listen to the tone  
And the violent rhythm  
Though the words sound steady  
Something emptys within em  
Holding on to what I havent got  
  
We say Yeah  
With fists flying up in the air  
Like were holding onto something  
Thats invisible there  
Cause were living at the mercy of  
The pain and the fear  
Until we get it forget it  
Let it all disappear  
Holding on to what I havent got
