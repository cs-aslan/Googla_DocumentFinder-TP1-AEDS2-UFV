If you saw you walking on a street and a  
black man were comin torward you  
what would you be feeling  
  
Just one single black man yeah  
I really dont fear that  
You know but if its a group Im talking from age thirt  
even thirteen even younger than  
thirteen Yes I will walk across the street  
  
Interviewer  
Well let me ask you this  
  
I dont want niggas soundin like me Ghostface Killah on Shark Niggas  
Biters  
I dont want niggas soundin like me knowhatImsayin x2  
  
Xzibit  
Yo we gettiin restless me and DOGs  
Never pretendin rather we sendin a very clear message  
Either you with me or against me punk hit em up  
Provide housin for these shrimp from the shells we dump  
Im makin em bounce other niggas fail to bump  
Til we takin advantage of inflicting irreversable damage  
Its the long awaited anticipated Likwit MC  
Bombin first cause I feel its better to give then receive  
You better believe  
Xzibit stays savage above the average  
When niggas try to switch turn bitch for the cabbage  
But see all that irrelevant its like tryin to turn a whore celibate  
I dance with the devil for the hell of it  
Burning down your lavish lanndscape on digital tape  
Cause everything you rhymin about is actually fake  
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate  
Thinkin you rankin top dollar but really counterfeit  
  
Hook  
  
Montageone  
Niggas we null and void I get swole like a keyloid  
To overload your system with rhymes for millenniums  
To shut down artists with beats the deep closure  
Battlin top rank for bank and exposure  
So open up your door to me Cause if its closed  
Im a brakin in with some pantyhose  
Over the mic  
So you dont know who I sound like  
Executing those who record and bite to sound tight  
Its not permitted by the right  
The Gustopo surprising these niggas like Benny Blanco  
Remember me man You thought I was a fan till I threw you in the back of a  
van  
Yo these Drop Squad delegates rhymes are delicate  
I spit on the mic to get these MCs pussys wet  
For those with plans to clone me thee original  
It cant be done Im digital digital  
  
Hook  
  
Xzibit  
Yo who want to come see the hard rock  
The non stop green block yo whole block receive speed knot  
You need not  
Get brave my bullets never graze  
They hit close to home separating flesh from bone  
So better get off on your own bitch  
Rollin chrome shit tryint to own shit  
I was molded after the best that the streets had to offer  
The author of my own destiny  
So I suggest you stop stressin me  
Ill find out when I pull my nine out and blow your mind out  
Play a deadly game with no fouls and no time outs  
Inhale large amounts of dojah forever ready like a soldier  
Im lock mode and shoot from the shoulder  
And burn down your lavish landscape digital tape  
Cause everything you rhyme about is actually fake  
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate  
Thinkin you rankin top dollar but really counterfeit  
  
Hook  
  
I dont want niggas soundin like me On no album
