I am weak but Thou art strong  
Jesus keep me from all wrong  
Ill be satisfied as long  
As I walk let me walk close to Thee  
  
Chorus  
Just a closer walk with Thee  
Grant it Jesus is my plea  
Daily walking close to Thee  
Let it be dear Lord let it be  
  
When my feeble life is oer  
Time for me shall be no more  
Guide me gently safely oer  
To Thy kingdoms shore to Thy shore  
  
When lifes sun sinks in the west  
Lord may I have done my best  
May I find sweet peace and rest  
In that happy home of the blessed  
  
Chorus
