My grandma was a wise old soul  
Took me by the hand not long ago  
Said Son whats your hurry boy slow it down  
Taste the wild honey listen to the sound  
Of the wind thats blowin through the trees  
Rivers flowin to the sea  
Yeah theyre all headin home just like you and me  
Lifes for livin child cant you see that  
  
These are the days we will remember  
And these are the times that wont come again  
The highest of flames become an ember  
And you gotta live em while you can  
  
These are the days we will remember Repeat x4  
  
So take em by the hand theyre yours and mine  
Take em by the hand and live your life  
Take em by the hand dont let em all fly by  
Cmon cmon now  
  
Oh days go by  
Yeah just like a hand out the window wavin in the wind as the cars go by  
Days go by
