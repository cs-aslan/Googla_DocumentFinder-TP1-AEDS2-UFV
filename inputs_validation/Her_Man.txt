Im gonna change my ways of doing things around here  
Im turning over a new leaf gonna get myself in gear  
Cause Ive got a woman whos better than most  
And Ive made a mess of her plans  
  
So startin today all Im gonna be is her man  
Ive been a wild catter and a go go getter  
Been an SOB right down to the letter  
Ive had misadventures I even got pictures  
  
Of even more than I can stand  
So startin today all I want a be is her man  
Im gonna give it all back cause all Ive done is take  
Ive put her on the back burner while I was out on the make  
  
But Ive got a woman whos good enough to give me  
A second chance again  
So starting today all Im gonna be is her man  
Ive been a wild catter and a go go getter  
  
Im a little bit late but Im wise enough  
Im taking her by the hand  
Startin today all I want a be is her man
