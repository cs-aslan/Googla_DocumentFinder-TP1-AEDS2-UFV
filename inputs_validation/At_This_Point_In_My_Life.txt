Done so many things wrong I dont know if I can do right  
Oh I Oh Ive  
Done so many things wrong I dont know if I can do right  
  
At this point in my life  
Ive done so many things wrong I dont know if I can do right  
If you put your trust in me I hope I wont let you down  
If you give me a chance Ill try  
  
You see its been a hard road the road Im traveling on  
And if I take your hand I might lead you down the path to ruin  
Ive had a hard life Im just saying it so youll understand  
That right now right now Im doing the best I can  
At this point in my life  
  
At this point in my life  
Although Ive mostly walked in the shadows  
Im still searching for the light  
Wont you put your faith in me  
We both know thats what matters  
If you give me a chance Ill try  
  
You see Ive been climbing stairs but mostly stumbling down  
Ive been reaching high always losing ground  
You see Ive been reaching high but always losing ground  
You see Ive conquered hills but I still have mountains to climb  
And right now right now Im doing the best I can  
At this point in my life  
  
Before we take a step  
Before we walk down that path  
Before I make any promises  
Before you have regrets  
Before we talk commitment  
Let me tell you of my past  
All Ive seen and all Ive done  
The things Id like to forget  
At this point in my life  
  
At this point in my life  
Id like to live as if only love mattered  
As if redemption was in sight  
As if the search to live honestly  
Is all that anyone needs  
No matter if you find it  
  
You see when Ive touched the sky  
The earths gravity has pulled me down  
But now Ive reconciled that in this world  
Birds and angels get the wings to fly  
If you can believe in this heart of mine  
If you can give it a try  
Then Ill reach inside and find and give you  
All the sweetness that I have  
At this point in my life  
At this point in my life
