You never leave her alone  
I can see you never learn  
When youre playing with fire  
You get your fingers burned  
There aint no use in crying  
Baby dont delay  
You can call your doctor  
Ill be there right away

That just cant be denied  
I will be your medicine man  
  
Now dont you ever worry  
If you feel the fever rise  
Youll never fool nobody  
When theres fire in your eyes  
There aint no use denying  
When you need it deep inside  
Youve got your witch doctor  
To keep you satisfied
