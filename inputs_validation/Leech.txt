Does it make you envy  
Does it make you proud  
To tuck the world into a paper bag  
This bodys state of Im OK youre not OK  
Yes men too could be on the rag  
  
Im over my head I need a pickmeup  
Its easy to get high when youre standing on our backs man  
Would anything ever be good enough for you  
Stand on your own hold your water if you can  
  
The rides over did you enjoy yourself  
The rides over fair thee well  
The rides over did you enjoy yourself  
The rides over fair thee well  
Not on my time  
  
It isnt fair to mention but it awes the crowd  
Your fictional plastic alibi  
So take another hit steal another line  
Did you ever meet a leech who was good at goodbyes  
  
When you were down I always picked you up  
Why didnt I recognize that everything was never fine  
Im kicking myself that I shared spit with you  
So fuck yourself  
And fuck this bleeding heart of mine  
  
The rides over did you enjoy yourself  
The rides over fair thee well  
The rides over did you enjoy yourself  
The rides over fair thee well  
Not on my time  
  
When you were down I always picked you up  
Why didnt I recognize that everything was never fine  
Im kicking myself that I shared spit with you  
So fuck yourself and fuck this bleeding heart of mine  
  
The rides over did you enjoy yourself  
The rides over fair thee well  
The rides over did you enjoy yourself  
The rides over fair thee well  
  
The rides over
