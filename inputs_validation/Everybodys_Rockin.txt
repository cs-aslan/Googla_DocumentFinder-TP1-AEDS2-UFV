When grandma and grandpa  
Get out on the floor  
They rock until they drop  
And then they rock some more  
Yeah everybodys rockin  
Well everybodys rockin  
Everybodys rockin  
Rockin to the dancin beat  
  
From the shakey city  
Down to New Orleans  
The Golden Gate  
To the Bronx and Queens  
Everybodys rockin  
Yeah everybodys rockin  
Well everybodys rockin  
Rockin to the dancin beat  
  
When Ronnie and Nancy  
Do the bop on the lawn  
Theyre rockin in the White House  
All night long  
Everybodys rockin  
Everybodys rockin  
Everybodys rockin  
Rockin their blues away  
  
Everybodys rockin  
Rockin their blues away  
Everybodys rockin  
Rockin all night and day  
  
Everybodys rockin  
Everybodys rockin  
Yeah everybodys rockin  
Everybodys rockin  
Everybodys rockin  
Rockin to the dancin beat  
Everybodys rockin  
Dancin to the rockin beat
