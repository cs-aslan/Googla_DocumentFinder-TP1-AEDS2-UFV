Lost in the city  
Deserted and cold  
Watching the cars passing by  
There all going places  
That we used to go  
And its driving me out of my mind  
  
Chorus  
And its making me blue  
Indelibly blue  
I cant erase the memories of me and you  
Indelibly blue  
  
They say when one love is ended  
Another is born  
Thats no consolation to me  
Just show me some sunlight  
A rose without thorns  
And maybe Ill start to believe  
  
Chorus  
  
Well just color me blue  
  
Oh all my life  
Ive waited for one love to make it alright  
But now I feel heartaches and tears  
Of a sad souvenirs that you left me  
Since you left me  
Ill just go on a day at a time  
Trying in vain to forget you  
But time and again you enter my mind  
Someday I swear I wont let you  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause baby Im blue  
  
Chorus  
  
So just color me blue
