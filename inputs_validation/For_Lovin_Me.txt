Thats what you get for lovin me thats what you get for lovin me  
Everything we had is gone if you can see thats what you get for lovin me  
Dont you shed a tear for me I aint the love you thought Id be  
Ive had a hundred just like you but dont be blue  
Ill have a thousand before Im through  
Thats what you get for lovin me  
 guitar   
There you go youre cryin again you should have known how things would end  
But someday when your poor heart is on the mend I just might pass this way
again  
Thats what you get for lovin me  
Thats what you get for lovin me
