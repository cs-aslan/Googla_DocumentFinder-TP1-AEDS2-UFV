Now if you want to hear some boogie like Im gonna play  
Its just an old piano and a knockout bass  
The drummers mans a cat they call Charlie McCoy  
You know remember that rubber legged boy  
Mama cookin chicken fried and bacon grease  
Come on along boys its just down the road apiece  
  
Well theres a place you really get your kicks  
Its open every night about twelve to six  
Now if you want to hear some boogie you can get your fill  
And shove and sting like an old steam drill  
Come on along you can lose your lead  
Down the road down the road down the road apiece  
  
Well theres a place you really get your kicks  
Its open every night about twelve to six  
Now if you want to hear some boogie you can get your fill  
And shove and sting like an old steam drill  
Come on along you can lose your lead  
Down the road down the road down the road apiece
