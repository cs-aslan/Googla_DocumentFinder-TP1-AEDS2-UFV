Sweet Lady Mary has to rest her poor head  
Wakes in the morning with her breakfast in bed  
I tried to help her but I did not know how  
I tried to love her but its all over now  
Nothing left to comfort me except a sunny day  
Steal away steal away  
  
Over the stones along the dusty old road  
With every footstep one more tale is told  
With every turning one more side to see  
Sweet Lady Marys seen the last of me  
A lesson is learnt Ill never come this way again  
Ill steal away steal away  
  
Her Spanish habits are so hard to forget  
The lady lied with every breath I accept  
Was a matter of time before my face did not fit  
I knew all along Id have to quit  
Anyway now I better not waste anymore of your time  
Ill steal away steal away  
  
I think Ill go back home and start all again  
Where the Gulf Stream waters tend to ease the pain  
And on a new day when Ive mended the wound  
Sweet Lady Marys gate I swear Ill be bound  
But before I sit down again and waste anymore of your time  
I better steal away steal away  
  
Oohhoo  
Steal awayay
