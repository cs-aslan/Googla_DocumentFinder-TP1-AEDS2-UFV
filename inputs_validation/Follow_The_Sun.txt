There was a time when I lived my life  
Thinking only of the things that would bring me down  
And all the while what I didnt know  
Is that I never learned to take the time to look around  
Theres a little good in everyone  
And sometimes it takes a little work to see the sun  
If you try you may find your life has just begun  
Dont you run  
Dont you run  
If youre feeling lost  
And you wanna be free  
And you feel like your world is tearing up at the seams  
Remember theres light  
If you wait till the dawn  
You may walk through the clouds  
But to carry on  
Youve got to follow the sun  
Listen baby  
This world may be crazy  
Sometimes youll feel like losing the game  
But theres always a reason to keep on believing  
Everyone is not the same  
But if you appreciate the things you have today  
You will find a way  
Woh  
If youre feeling lost  
And you wanna be free  
And you feel like your world is tearing up at the seams  
Remember theres light  
If you wait till the dawn  
You may walk through the clouds  
But to carry on  
Youve got to follow the sun
