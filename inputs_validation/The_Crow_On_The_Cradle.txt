The sheeps in the meadow  
The cows in the corn  
Now is the time for a child to be born  
Youll laugh at the moon and youll cry for the sun  
And if its a boy hell carry a gun  
Sang the crow on the cradle  
And if it should be that this babys a girl  
Never you mind if her hair doesnt curl  
With rings on her fingers dna bells on her toes  
A shadow above her wherever she goes  
Sang the crow on the cradle  
The crow on the cradle  
The black on the white  
Somebodys baby is born for a fight  
The crow on the cradle  
The white on the black  
Somebodys baby is not coming back  
Sang the crow on the cradle  
Bring me my gun and Ill shoot  
That bird dead  
Thats what your mother and  
Father once said  
A crow on the cradle what can we do  
This is the thing I must leave up to you  
Sang the crow on the cradle
