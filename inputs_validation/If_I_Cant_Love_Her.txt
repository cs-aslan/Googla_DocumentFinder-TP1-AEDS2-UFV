If I Cant Love Her  
  
Beast  
And in my twisted face  
Theres not the slightest trace  
Of anything that even hints of kindness  
And from my tortured shape  
No comfort no escape  
I see but deep within is utter blindness  
  
Hopeless  
As my dream dies  
As the time flies  
Love a lost illusion  
Helpless  
Unforgiven  
Cold and driven  
To this sad conclusion  
  
No beauty could move me  
No goodness improve me  
No power on earth if I cant love her  
No passion could reach me  
No lesson could teach me  
How I could have loved her and make her love me too  
If I cant love her then who  
  
Long ago I should have seen  
All the things I could have been  
Careless and unthinking I moved onward  
  
No pain could be deeper  
No life could be cheaper  
No point anymore if I cant love her  
No spirit could win me  
No hope left within me  
Hope I could have loved her and that shed set me free  
But its not to be  
If I cant love her  
Let the world be done with me
