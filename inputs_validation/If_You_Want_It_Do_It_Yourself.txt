Many years ago my dad said Sonny  
Lady luck may never come your way  
If its love you want or only money  
This is what my daddy used to say  
  
Well  
If you want it  
Oh  
  
Co out and get it  
Oh  
You gotta do it yourself  
  
You gotta do it yourself  
Well  
If you want it  
Oh  
  
Go out and get it  
Oh  
You gotta do it yourself  
  
You gotta do it yourself  
  
Waitin round for someone who can help you  
Someone who can help you find your way  
  
If you think theres no one  
You can turn to  
Theres someone just a looking glass away  
  
Well  
If you want it  
Oh  
  
Go out and get it  
Oh  
  
Wishin and ahopin for your fortune  
Prayin that youll see your lucky dayIf youre lookin for some inspiration  
This is what my daddy liked to say  
  
Well  
If you want it  
Oh  
  
Go out and get it  
Oh
