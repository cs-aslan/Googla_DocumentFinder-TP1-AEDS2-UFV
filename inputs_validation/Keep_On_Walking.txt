Well last night I couldnt sleep  
I got up and started walking  
Down to the end of my street  
And on into town  
Well I had no one to meet  
And I had no taste for talking  
Seems Im talking my whole life  
Its time I listen now  
  
Well I walk past the late night boys  
With their bottles in their doorways  
And I walk past the business men  
Sleeping like babies in their cars  
And I thought to myself oh son  
You may be lost in more ways than one  
But I have a feeling that its more fun  
Than knowing exactly where you are  
  
Like a stone carried on the river  
Like a boat sailing on the sea  
Well I keep on walking  
Oh I keep on walking  
Till I fine that old love  
Or that old love comes to finds me  
  
Well I walked into the morning  
And felt that warm sunlight forming on my shoulders  
Cause it hit me with no warning  
Like a summer sky storming in my lungs  
Aint it funny how the kids walk by  
Theyll do anything to make themselves look older  
While the women spend their money  
On anything that makes them look young  
  
Like a stone carried on the river  
Like a boat sailing on the sea  
Oh I keep on walking  
Oh I keep on walking  
Till I fine that old love  
Or that old love comes to finds me  
  
Oh lo no  
Oh oh oh no  
Oh lo oh  
Oh oh oh  
  
Well Im like a stone  
And Im carried on the river  
Like a boat sailing on the sea  
Oh well I keep on walking  
Oh well I keep on walking  
Till I fine that old love  
Or that old love comes to finds me
