So young so strong  
Ignorance is bliss  
Thin skin caught up again  
In a place like this  
  
Big people set the trap for you  
Using youknowwhat for brains  
Youre just another lab experiment  
And youre easy to replace  
  
Too much too soon  
Sensors overload  
Brought down chased out of town  
Another dangerous road  
  
Simply a problem of biology  
Its a choice you never make  
The scene is set and youre subjected to  
A lethal dose of growing pains  
  
Think it through  
Logic must be made for fools  
Leave them now  
And be a hasbeen who never was  
Theyll set you up with pains that grow
