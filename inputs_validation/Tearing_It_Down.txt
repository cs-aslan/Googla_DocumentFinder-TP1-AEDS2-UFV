I am taking a chance  
Walking with my laces loose  
Wrapped up taking the maze  
That everybodys running through  
Im sick of black tie  
Nickel and dime  
Were going through the roof  
  
Im not a wise man  
But I see the haze  
And this is what Im gonna do  
  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo whoo  
  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo whoo  
  
Theres a fine line  
You walk everyday  
Cause somebody told you to  
A white lie  
You cant erase  
Now youre gonna have to choose  
  
You know a blind man  
Wont show the way  
But he can tell you  
What its coming to  
  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo whoo  
Tearing it down  
  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni now  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni  
Ni ni ni now  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni now  
  
Im not a wise man  
But I see the haze  
And this is what Im gonna do  
  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo whoo
