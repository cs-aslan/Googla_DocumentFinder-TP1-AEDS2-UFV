You got the power you got the mind  
You got the skills Baby I aint lyin  
They way you walk the way you flirt  
Your baby talk could get a grown man hurt  
I might be wastin my time  
But I know Im losing my mind  
  
Shari Ann  
You dont have to try to make me blue  
Cause you know you can it comes so natural to you  
Shari Ann you dont have to play so hard to get  
Im just a man but honey Im the match you never met  
  
Do you understand what Im goin through  
Im in love with you  
Ill be your rock Ill be your rock n roll  
Ill be the serenade for your soul  
Youre nonstop strong comin on  
You can carry me  
Shari Ann
