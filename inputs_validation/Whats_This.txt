Whats this Whats this  
Theres color everywhere  
Whats this  
Theres white things in the air  
Whats this  
I cant believe my eyes  
I must be dreaming  
Wake up Jack this isnt fair  
Whats this  
  
Whats this Whats this  
Theres something very wrong  
Whats this  
Theres people singing songs  
  
Whats this  
The streets are lined with  
Little creatures laughing  
Everybody seems so happy  
Have I possibly gone daffy  
What is this  
Whats this  
  
Theres children throwing snowballs  
Instead of throwing heads  
Theyre busy building toys  
And absolutely no ones dead  
  
Theres frost on every window  
Oh I cant believe my eyes  
And in my bones I feel the warmth  
Thats coming from inside  
  
Oh look  
Whats this  
Theyre hanging mistletoe they kiss  
Why that looks so unique inspired  
Theyre gathering around to hear a story  
Roasting chestnuts on a fire  
Whats this  
Whats this  
  
In here theyve got a little tree how queer  
And who would ever think  
And why  
  
Theyre covering it with tiny little things  
Theyve got electric lights on strings  
And theres a smile on everyone  
So now correct me if Im wrong  
This looks like fun  
This looks like fun  
Oh could it be I got my wish  
Whats this  
  
Oh my what now  
The children are asleep  
But look theres nothing underneath  
No ghouls no witches here to scream and scare them  
Or ensnare them only little cozy things  
Secure them in their dreamland  
Whats this  
  
The monsters are all missing  
And the nightmares cant be found  
And in their place there seems to be  
Good feeling all around  
  
Instead of screams I swear  
I can hear music in the air  
The smell of cakes and pies  
Are absolutely everywhere  
  
The sights the sounds  
Theyre everywhere and all around  
Ive never felt this good before  
This empty place inside of me has been filling up  
I simply cannot get enough  
  
I want it oh I want it  
Oh I want it for my own  
Ive got to know  
Ive got to know  
What is this place that I have found  
What is this
