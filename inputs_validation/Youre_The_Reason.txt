Youre the reason I dont sleep at night  
I just lay here at night toss and I turn  
Lovin you so how my heart yearns  
Youre the reason I dont sleep at night  
Walkin the floor feelin so blue  
Smoke cigarettes and drink coffee too  
Youre the reason I dont sleep at night  
Im bettin youre not losin sleep over me  
But if Im wrong dont fail to call  
Come over and keep me company  
Sometimes I go for walk take a look at the moon  
Strum my guitar and sing out a tune  
Honey youre the reason I dont sleep at night
