The wretched desert takes its form  
The jackal proud and tight  
In search of you I feel my way  
Through slowest heaving night  
Whatever fear invents  
I swear it make no sense  
I reach out through the border fence  
Come down come talk to me  
  
In the swirling curling storm of desire  
Unuttered words hold fast  
With reptile tongue the lightning lashes  
Towers built to last  
Darkness creeps in like a thief  
And offers no relief  
Why are you shaking like a leaf  
Come on come talk to me  
  
Ah please talk to me  
Wont you please talk to me  
We can unlock this misery  
Come on come talk to me  
  
I did not come to steal  
This all is so unreal  
Cant you show me how you feel  
Come on come talk to me  
  
Come talk to me come talk to me  
  
The earthly power sucks shadowed milk  
From sleepy tears undone  
From nippled skin as smooth as silk  
The bugles blow as one  
You lie there with your eyes half closed  
Like theres no one there at all  
Theres a tension pulling on your face  
Come on come talk to me  
  
Wont you please talk to me  
If youd just talk to me  
Unblock this misery  
If youd only talk to me  
Dont you ever change your mind  
Now your futures so defined  
And you act so deaf so blind  
Come on come talk to me  
Come talk to me come talk to me  
  
I can imagine the moment  
Breaking out through the silence  
All the things that we both might say  
And the heart it will not be denied  
Til were both on the same damn side  
All the barriers blown away  
  
I said please talk to me  
Wont you please come talk to me  
Just like it used to be  
Come on come talk to me  
I did not come to steal  
This all is so unreal  
Can you show me how you feel now  
Come on come talk to me  
Come talk to me come talk to me  
  
I said please talk to me  
If youd just talk to me  
Unblock this misery  
If youd only talk to me  
Dont you ever change your mind  
Now your futures so defined  
And you act so deaf so blind  
Come on come talk to me  
Come talk to me come talk to me
