The dust has finally settled down  
The sun is shining on  
These pieces that are scattered all around  
This house was everything we knew  
Its where we kept our love  
And every single memory of me and you  
Every letter every note  
Every dress you never wore under your coat  
Thrown away  
  
Brick by brick  
We can build it from the floor  
If we hold onto each other  
Well be better than before  
And brick by brick  
We will get back to yesterday  
When I made your body shiver  
And when you took my breath away  
You took my breath away  
  
The sky has made it back to blue  
Everything thats left  
Is telling us the worst of it is through  
Home has never felt so right  
Theres nothing in the way  
Theres nothing in between us  
Knowing where were going is inside  
Every letter that I wrote  
Every dress you never wore under your coat  
Thrown away  
  
Brick by brick  
We can build it from the floor  
If we hold on to each other  
Well be better than before  
And brick by brick  
Well get back to yesterday  
When I made your body shiver  
And when you took my breath away  
  
All the pictures that weve taken  
And the songs that we have played  
That have all kept track and  
Followed back the love that we have made  
Now theyre spread out on the surface  
Where we can try to congregate  
Its not too late  
To believe that we can get it all again  
  
Brick by brick  
We can build it from the floor  
If we hold onto each other  
Well be better than before  
And brick by brick  
Well get back to yesterday  
When I made your body shiver  
And when you took my breath away  
You took my breath away  
  
Brick by brick  
Well get back to yesterday  
When I made your body shiver and  
When you took my breath away  
You took my breath away
