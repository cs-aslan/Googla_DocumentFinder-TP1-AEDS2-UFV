Oh oh oh  
She dont impress me not like she used to  
Everything that she dont do  
Thats what I want what I need  
Seeking rapidly thats when you sailed through  
Thats mean so way with you  
Everything that she wont do you do for me  
  
Say what you say were floating away away  
Baby I was downing in my sorrow  
Couldnt see tomorrow today then you came  
Say what you say say say were floating away away away  
Now I see the sun on the horizon  
Now I think that Ill be ok since you came yeah  
  
12 am she leaves she dont say where to  
Wont see her again till 12 noon and she dont smile like me  
Suddenly I see why she dont do what she used to  
She found someone new well baby me too so sorry  
  
Say what you say say say were floating away away away  
Baby I was downing in my sorrow  
Couldnt see tomorrow today then you came oh  
Say what you say say say were floating away away way  
Now I see the sun on the horizon  
Now I think that Ill be ok since you came  
  
Ohohoh  
  
Say what you say say say were floating away away away  
Baby I was downing in my sorrow  
Couldnt see tomorrow today then you came  
Say what you say say say were floating away away away  
Now I see the sun on the horizon  
Now I think that Ill be ok since you came  
  
Say what you say oh oh
