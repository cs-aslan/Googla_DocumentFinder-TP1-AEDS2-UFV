Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Its forever  
Its forever  
Its forever  
Its forever  
  
Baby no matter how long it be  
We never lose that chemistry  
And its the strongest thing  
Ive ever experienced  
So sorry what ever happened to empathy  
I know you motherfucker feel like we  
When youre messin with the one  
True lover that make you OOC  
  
Chorus  
Even though Ive been gone for a minute  
Its wrong I admit it  
Your loves so addictive that  
I get so OOC  
Out of control baby  
Although weve both moved on to another  
Still long for each other  
Its wrong but eternally  
I get so OOC  
And thats just the way it be  
  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Its forever  
Its forever  
Its forever  
Its forever  
  
Baby every time you touch me  
Still get that electricity  
And after all this time  
It dont even make no sense  
  
So scusa me te quiero mucho papi  
Je ne sais pas mais cest la vie  
When youre messin with the one  
True lover that make you OOC  
  
Chorus  
  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Its forever  
Its forever  
Its forever  
Its forever  
Its forever  
Its forever  
Its forever  
Its forever  
  
Youre out of control  
Im out of control  
Bounce on em just bounce on come on  
  
Chorus x2
