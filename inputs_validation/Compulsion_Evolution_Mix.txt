Charms in limited supply  
And refusing to stretch  
That indefinable nothing  
Somehow keeps pushing you  
Finding the right words  
Can be a problem  
How many times must it be said  
Theres no plan  
It had to happen  
Got to move on sometime  
And its about time  
By putting one foot in front on another  
And repeating the process  
Cross over the street  
Youre free to change your mind  
Strength through diversity  
Couldnt have put it more plainly  
Got to move on sometime  
Got to move on sometime  
Got to move on sometime  
Got to move on sometime  
Charms in limited supply  
Under threat of extinction  
That indefinable nothing  
Somehow motivates you  
Finding the right words  
Can be a problem  
How many times must it be said  
Theres no plan  
It had to happen  
Got to move on sometime  
And its about time  
By putting one foot in front on another  
And repeating the process  
Cross over the street  
Youre free to change your mind  
Strength through diversity  
Couldnt have put it more plainly  
Got to move on sometime
