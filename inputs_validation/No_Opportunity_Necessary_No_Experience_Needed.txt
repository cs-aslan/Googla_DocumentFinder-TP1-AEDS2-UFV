Step out in the night  
When youre lonely  
Listening for the sounds  
That your ears dont hear  
I know your cross is heavier  
With every step  
Every step  
But I know a man  
And hed walk miles for you  
  
Stop you stay where you are  
Take a look at yourself  
Take a good look at yourself  
Can tell your momma  
Shed only tell ya  
That she told you so  
The life youre leading  
She wont believe  
The riches of life  
We all know  
  
Dawn turns to day  
And the dawning  
Daytime nighttime  
And we still cant see  
Why must we wait until the morning light  
To wake up and be  
Wake up and be  
Wake up and be  
  
Step out in the night  
When youre lonely  
Listen for the sounds  
That your ears dont hear  
I know your cross is heavier  
With every step  
Every step  
But I know a man  
Whod walk miles for you  
  
Stop you stay where you are  
Take a look at yourself  
Take a good look at yourself  
Can tell your momma  
Shed only tell ya  
That she told you so  
The life youre leading  
She wont believe  
The riches of life  
We all know  
  
Can tell your momma  
Shed only tell ya  
That she told you so  
The life youre leading  
She wont believe  
The riches of life  
We all know
