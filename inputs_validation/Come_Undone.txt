Opened up my failure  
When you refused to go insane  
I felt you get excited  
When I whispered all the things you love to hate  
  
Like youre the one who kills  
Could kill me with a drug your weapon  
Lets pretend theres  
Nothing wrong with my direction  
  
Hate me  
Ill be your your loaded gun  
Burn me  
Waiting to come undone  
  
Ill set it up inside you  
To watch you burn  
Hate me  
Ill be the Ill be the end that you deserve  
  
Open lacerations  
A slower cut to feel your pain  
Heat the blood to boiling  
As it passes from your lips into your brain  
  
Cause youre the one who kills  
Could kill me with a drug your weapon  
Lets pretend that  
Im not dead its in your head  
  
Hate me  
Ill be your your loaded gun  
Burn me  
Waiting to come undone  
  
Ill set it up inside you  
To watch you burn  
Hate me  
Ill be the Ill be the end that you deserve  
Ill be the end that you deserve  
  
I can turn you on like fire  
Set fire deep inside you  
Eat you alive and watch you  
Come and let me up the sonisphere  
  
Ill be your  
Ill be your  
Ill be your  
Ill be the end that you deserve  
Ill be the end that you deserve  
  
Hate me  
Ill be your your loaded gun  
Burn me  
Waiting to come undone  
  
Ill set it up inside you  
To watch you burn  
Hate me  
Ill be the Ill be the end that you deserve  
Ill be the end that you deserve
