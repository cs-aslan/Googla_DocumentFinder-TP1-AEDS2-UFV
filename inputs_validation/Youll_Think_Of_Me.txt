I woke up early this morning around four am  
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate  
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep  
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake  
Ever since you found yourself in someone elses arms  
Ive been tryin my best to get along  
But thats okay  
Theres nothing left to say but  
  
Take your records take your freedom  
Take your memories I dont need em  
Take your space and take your reasons  
But youll think of me  
And take your cat and leave my sweater  
Cause we have nothing left to weather  
In fact Ill feel a whole lot better  
But youll think of me youll think of me  
  
I went out driving trying to clear my head  
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left  
I guess Im feeling just a little tired of this  
And all the baggage that seems to still exist  
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name  
Is not knowing what we could have been  
What we should have been  
So  
  
Take your records take your freedom  
Take your memories I dont need em  
Take your space and take your reasons  
But youll think of me  
And take your cat and leave my sweater  
Cause we have nothing left to weather  
In fact Ill feel a whole lot better  
But youll think of me  
  
Someday Im gonna run across your mind  
Dont worry Ill be fine  
Im gonna be alright  
While youre sleeping with your pride  
Wishin I could hold you tight  
Ill be over you  
And on with my life  
  
So take your records take your freedom  
Take your memories I dont need em  
And take your cat and leave my sweater  
Cause we have nothing left to weather  
In fact Ill feel a whole lot better  
But youll think of me  
  
So take your records take your freedom  
Take your memories I dont need em  
Take your space and all your reasons  
But youll think of me  
And take your cat and leave my sweater  
Cause we got nothing left to weather  
In fact Ill feel a whole lot better  
But youll think of me youll think of me yeah  
  
And youre gonna think of me  
Oh someday baby someday
