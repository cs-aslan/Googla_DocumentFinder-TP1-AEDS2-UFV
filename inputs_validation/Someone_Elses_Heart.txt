I got nosy and I read her letters  
I read her diary its the same story and nothing better  
The words remind me of someone elses heart  
Has gone and left a mark  
And the pop music plays  
On the local radio  
Theres people on the streets but no one that I know  
And like my heart is now  
I know not where they go  
  
Same words different meaning  
Same heart different feeling  
So much for him so much for her cause thats past  
Now I know about that someone elses heart  
  
She got nosy and read my letters too  
And my notebook surprised to find that  
Love is not so new  
So we both took  
Someone elses heart  
And walked it through the dark  
  
A feeling so rich  
I turned around to laugh  
We had both indulged in each others past  
To find out that our love  
Was true enough to last
