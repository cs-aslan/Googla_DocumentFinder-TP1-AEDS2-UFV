I take off time to time  
With those crazy friends of mine  
Head out on steel horses  
With wheels and we ride  
  
We burn up that road to old Mexico  
Blend in with the desert  
Just we amigos  
And we roll  
  
Cowboys like us sure do have fun  
Racin the wind chasin the sun  
Take the long way around back to square one  
Today were just outlaws out on the run  
Therell be no regrets no worries and such  
For cowboys like us  
  
We talk about livin babies and women  
All that weve lost and all weve been givin  
We sing about true love lie about things we aint done  
Drink one more cold one come mornin get up  
And we roll  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Cowboys like us
