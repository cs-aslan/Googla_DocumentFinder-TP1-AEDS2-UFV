Baby it wont take long to forget you  
Time it passes fast  
Itll all be over in a minute  
Youll be in the past  
  
You can lose the love of a lifetime  
In a single roll  
You can gain a fortune in an instant  
Or you can lose your soul  
  
Chorus  
And it wont take long to forget ya  
You know Im never wrong  
Itll all be over in a minute  
And it wont take long  
  
And it wont take long to forgive ya  
But its hard to forget  
Cause it seems like its yesterday  
The day that we first met  
  
When you give me a smoldering look and  
Put out your cigarette  
And I saw your sultry look  
You wore a pale blue dress  
  
Chorus  
  
Life is short one look and its over  
Comes as quite a shock  
All I got is some memories  
Stuck in an old shoebox  
  
And it wont take long to forget ya  
You know Im never wrong  
Itll all be over by Christmas  
No it wont take long  
  
It wont take long
