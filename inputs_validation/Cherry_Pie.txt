Well swingin on the front porch swingin on the lawn  
Swingin where we want cause there aint nobody home  
Swingin to the left and swingin to the right  
If I think about baseball Ill swing all night yeah  
  
Swingin in the living room swingin in the kitchen  
Most folks dont cause theyre too busy bitchin  
Swingin in there cause she wanted me to feed her  
So I mixed up the batter and she licked the beater  
  
I scream you scream we all scream for her  
Dont even try cause you cant ignore her  
  
Shes my cherry pie  
Cool drink of water such a sweet surprise  
Tastes so good make a grown man cry  
Sweet cherry pie oh yeah  
  
Shes my cherry pie  
Put a smile on your face ten miles wide  
Looks so good bring a tear to you eye  
Sweet cherry pie yeah  
  
Swingin to the drums swingin to guitar  
Swingin to the bass in the back of my car  
Aint got money aint got no gas  
But well bet where were goin if we swing real fast  
  
Swingin in the bathroom swingin on the floor  
Swingin so hard we forgot to lock the door  
In walks her daddy standin six foot four  
He said you aint gonna swing with my daughter no more
