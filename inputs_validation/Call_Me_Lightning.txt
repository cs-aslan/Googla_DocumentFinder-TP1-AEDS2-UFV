See that girl whos smiling so brightly  
Well I reckon shes cool and I reckon rightly  
Shes good looking and I aint frightened  
Im gonna show you why they call me lightning  
  
Hey little girl whos dancing so lightly  
My XKE is shining so brightly  
The noose around us is slowly tightening  
Im gonna show you why they call me lightning  
  
Hey little girl whos dancing so lightly  
My XKE is shining so brightly  
The noose around us is slowly tightening  
Im gonna show you why they call me lightning

Call me lightning Im as fast as can be  
No you cant catch me no you cant catch me
