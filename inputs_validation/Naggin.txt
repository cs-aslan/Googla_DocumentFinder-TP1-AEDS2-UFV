Every now and then you get mad  
Sometime I make you sad  
Make you want to say kiss my ass  
Im tired of listenin to you naggin  
Chorus repeat 2X  
She talking to me like Im dumb  
I should have known should have known  
Should have left that bitch alone  
Now Im stuck with naggin  
Verse 1  
This is for then niggaz who be fuckin with them feelings  
And you get your heart caught up in the mix  
Cause your love fucks whats up her dress and never paid attention  
Cause you didnt think the girl would start tripping  
Shawty flip the scripted  
Start saying all type of shit out of her lips  
And let me tell you what I cant stand  
When a women play the role of a man  
Talking to a nigga like you got to hold his hand  
Treat me like a sped like he lack to understand  
I know you know I aint gone go for the short jacking all the time  
Talking to me out of line broad truly you done lost your mind  
You gone fuck round and get my some time  
Every now and then you get mad  
Sometime I make you sad  
Make you want to say kiss my ass  
Im tired of listening to your naggin  
Chorus  
Verse 2  
A lil more grip a lil less lip  
Before I pack my bag on you ass and dip  
And a point of no return and you made it that way  
Buy the shit that you say every motherfuckin day  
Hope you paying attention cause I got to mention  
Dissin me in front of your friends  
Trying to get a lil laugh in your crack in  
Then I want to woop his ass then  
Hide behind your fake ass grin with your fake ass friend  
Used to them fake ass men  
Really aint no man but you like how he pretend  
Im going to keeping sipping my Hen and smoking my herbs  
And Im going to need a lot of grill cause of your nagging girl  
The way you talking absurd gettin on my nerves  
All in my ear about to make me hit the curve  
Every now and then you get mad  
Sometime I make you sad  
Make you want to say kiss my ass  
Im tired of listening to your naggin  
Chorus  
Verse 3  
One day I got shot by Cupid  
This was when this relationship went stupid  
We was talking on the phone too long  
Now her ass isnt home  
Tellin me you out with your friends  
Find out later on you with your other men  
You aint nothing but a dividend  
Say you suck and fuck but you aint gettin nothin  
Thats a damn shame it ended like this  
And I aint got love for you bitch  
Shoo fly don bother me  
Will I get back with her probably  
Then I thought about it I wont  
Do I really want you I dont  
The headache I really dont want  
So Im going to leave her alone  
Cause I can do bad on my own thats why she gone  
Every now and then you get mad  
Sometime I make you sad  
Make you want to say kiss my ass  
Im tired listenin to your naggin  
Chorus  
Now Im stuck with naggin
