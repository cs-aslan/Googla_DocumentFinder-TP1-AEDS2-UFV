Look out here comes tomorrow  
Thats when Ill have to choose  
How I wish I could borrow  
Someone elses shoes  
  
Mary oh what a sweet girl  
Lips like strawberry pie  
Sandra the long hair and pig tails  
Cant make up my mind  
I see all kinds of sorrow  
Wish I loved only one  
Look out here comes tomorrow  
Oh how I wish  
Tomorrow would never come  
  
Told them both that I loved them  
Said it and it was true  
But I cant have both of them  
Dont know what to do  
  
I see all kinds of sorrow  
Wish I loved only one  
Look out here comes tomorrow  
Oh how I wish  
Tomorrow would never come  
  
Instrumental  
  
I see all kinds of sorrow  
Wish I loved only one  
Look out here comes tomorrow  
Oh how I wish  
Tomorrow would never come
