I guess I need to say Im sorry  
I didnt mean to make a fool of myself over you  
I only wanted just to love you  
But now that were through I cant get over you  
I didnt mean to write a love song  
I didnt mean to share these feeling I have in my heart  
I told myself I could forget you  
Now I know thats not true I cant get over you  
And as I walk down through the halls  
I see your pictures hanging on the walls those memories  
For all the thing that weve been through  
My heart can still feel me and you  
Sweet memories  
After the pain of losing you  
After the heartache I know its true  
Cause when I saw you I still can say  
Im never gonna love anybody else the way I love you today  
I guess I need to say Im sorry  
I didnt mean to make a fool of myself over you  
I only want just to love you  
But now that were through I cant get over you  
I cant get over you  
I cant get over you  
Noooo  
No nooo  
Know my heart is breaking baby  
Cant get you out of my mind  
Tried so hard to love you  
Ooooh baby  
Now you gone now you gone you gone away  
Got my heart in my hand  
You and me baby  
We got a thing going on  
Ooooh baby
