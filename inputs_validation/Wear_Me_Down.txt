Every time I come here  
Im not sure what to say  
I know it should be easy  
But it never seems that way  
  
You you make me feel  
Like no one ever will  
So why why do you bore me  
Until my heart is still  
  
Chorus  
You you wear me down  
My defenses are gone now  
And I cant fight  
You you wear me down  
My defenses are gone now  
And I cant fight  
  
I cant say I love you easily  
But you wouldnt want me to  
So Id rather just say nothing  
And leave it up to you  
  
Then its easy to forget  
Youre just as small as me  
Then its easy to forget  
Youre just as foolish as me  
  
Chorus  
  
You you make me feel  
Like no one ever will  
So why why do you bore me  
Until my heart is still  
  
Chorus
