I might walk a lil funny but my walk is me  
I might stutter when I talk but I say what I see  
I dont agree with every other lil thing thats proven  
I do a lot of things that I shouldnt be doin  
Ill ruin everything you mighta had in mind  
Im a consistent belligerent solidified find  
Rhinestone freak suburban star  
I aint got no money and I got no car  
I might make par if it dont take much  
See I dont ride very far cause I ride on luck  
I stay pretty stuck in a rut like I should  
And I do it for the love of everything thats still good  
  
Chorus x2  
I dont know why I come here  
But I know Ill never leave  
Its the only place I want to be yea yea yea  
  
Im a long way gone but I aint short lived  
I got deep deep pockets that leak like a civ  
I give 110 throughout the course of a night  
And if I dont go home then I did things right  
Id like to settle down but I aint that guy  
cause everything I ever did I always did on the fly  
I like to ride the wave til the tide dont swell  
I dont like cocaine but I like the smell  
I dwell in the place you might see unfit  
But there aint nothin you can ever say to make me give a shit  
I stay pretty stuck in a rut like I should  
And do it for the love of everything thats still good  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Id like to say that I dont do them bars  
But my street called straight dont stretch too far uh huh  
Im on the move goin nowhere fast  
And you can tell the whole world they can kiss my ass  
Ill take a pass be the last in line  
And if it takes 10 years then Ima be just fine ah  
I saw the signs in the grass aint green  
I found love at the bottom of a bottle of Beam  
See comin clean just seemed so jaded  
And bein underrated is underrated but I dont hate it  
I stay stuck in a rut like I should  
You know I do it for the love of everything thats still good  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I dont know why I come here  
But I know Ill never leave  
I dont know why I come here  
But I know Ill never leave  
I dont know why I come here  
But I know Ill never leave  
Its the only place I want to be yea yea yea  
Its the only place I want to be yea yea yea
