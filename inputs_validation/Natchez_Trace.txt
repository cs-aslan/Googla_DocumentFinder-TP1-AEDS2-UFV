Oh ho  
He rode into Virginia  
Rollin thunder ridin high  
I was servin table  
Waitin for that ride  
My arms around his body  
Well we rode a thousand miles  
He taught me how to love  
He taught me how to fly oh ho my  
Hungry together  
Racin the weather  
Into the Natchez Trace  
Warmin and feedin him  
All the way to Cumberland oh ho yes  
And I had his child in Memphis  
And we watched him ride away  
And now you know what a girl like me  
Is doin here today  
Im sorry mister you cant stay  
Hungry together  
Racin the weather  
Into the Natchez Trace  
Warmin and feedin him  
All the way to Cumberland oh ho yes  
And when the piper gets to play  
Somebodys got to pay  
And now you know what a girl like me  
Is doin here today  
Oh Im sorry mister you cant stay  
Im sorry mister you cant stay  
Hungry together  
Racin the weather  
Into the Natchez Trace  
Warmin and feedin him  
All the way to Cumberland oh  
When the piper gets to play  
Somebodys got to pay  
And now you know what a girl like me  
Is doin here today  
Oh Im sorry mister you cant stay
