Weve been waiting so long  
Weve been waiting so long oh  
Weve been waiting for the sun to rise and shine  
Shining still to give us the will  
  
Can you hear me the sound of my voice  
I am here to tell you I have made my choice  
Ive been listening to whats been going down  
Theres just too much talk and gossip going round  
  
You may think that Im a fool but I know the answer  
Words become a tool anyone can use them  
Take the golden rule as the best example  
Eyes that have seen will know what I mean  
  
Hold that line baby hold that line  
Get up boys and hit em one more time  
We may be losing now but we cant stop trying  
So hold that line baby hold that line  
  
If you dont know what to do about a world of trouble  
You can pull it through if you need to and if  
You believe its true it will surely happen  
  
Shining still to give us the will  
Weve been waiting so long waiting so long  
Been waiting so long waiting so long  
  
Shining still to give us the will  
Bright as the day to show us the way  
Somehow someday  
We need just one victory and were on our way  
  
Weve been prayin for it all day  
And were fightin for it all night  
To give us just one victory it will be all right  
We may feel about to fall but we go down fighting  
  
You will hear the call if you only listen  
Underneath it all we are here together  
Shining still to give us the will  
Now bright as the day to show us the way  
  
Hold that line baby hold that line  
Get up boys and hit em one more time  
We may be losing now but we cant stop trying  
So hold that line baby hold that line  
  
Hold that line baby hold that line  
Get up boys and hit em one more time  
We may be losing now but we cant stop trying  
So hold that line baby hold that line  
  
Hold that line baby hold that line  
Get up boys and hit em one more time  
We may be losing now but we cant stop trying  
So hold that line baby hold that line  
  
Hold that line baby hold that line  
Get up boys and hit em one more time  
We may be losing now but we cant stop trying  
So hold that line baby hold that line
