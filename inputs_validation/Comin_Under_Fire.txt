Your kind of woman gotta heart of stone  
But watch it break when I get you alone  
Take a chance come lay down with me  
Oh I wanna make it  
  
Slow and steady never lost the race  
Dont stop runnin Im a fool for the chase  
Play the game surrender to me  
Baby I dont wanna fake it  
  
Is it any wonder you got me comin under fire  
Comin like thunder you know you make me walk the wire  
  
Its so easy to put on a show  
Your body says yes but you wont let it go  
But my passion it wont slip away  
  
You got me Im cornered my back to the wall  
No bed of roses aint no bed at all  
Im walkin the wire I stumble and fall  
I got the message but I aint gonna crawl
