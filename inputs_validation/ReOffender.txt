Keeping up appearances  
Keeping up with the Jones  
Fooling my selfish heart  
Going through the motions  
  
But Im fooling myself  
Im fooling myself  
Cause you say you love me  
And then you do it again  
  
You do it again  
You say your sorrys  
And then you do it again  
You do it again  
  
Everybody thinks youre well  
Everybody thinks Im ill  
Watching me fall apart  
Falling under your spell  
  
But youre fooling yourself  
Your fooling yourself  
Cause you say you love me  
And then you do it again  
  
You do it again  
You say your sorrys  
And then you do it again  
You do it again and again and again and again and again  
  
But youre fooling yourself  
Youre fooling yourself  
Cause you say you love me  
And then you do it again  
  
You do it again  
You say your sorrys  
Then you do it again  
  
You do it again  
You say you love me  
And then you do it again  
  
You do it again  
You say your sorrys  
And then you do it again  
You do it again and again and again and again and again
