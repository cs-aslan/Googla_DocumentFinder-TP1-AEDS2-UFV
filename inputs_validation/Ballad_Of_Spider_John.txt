Spider John is my name friend  
Im in between freights and I sure would be obliged  
If youd share your company  
I know this may sound strange to you  
But if you wait til the song is sung and the storys told  
You might come to understand  
Why Im old and bent and devils been runnin out of time  
When I long ago held a royal flush in my hand  
  
Oh I was a super market fool I was a rollthebank a  
stool pigeon  
Robbing my hometown  
I thought Id lost the blues yes I thought Id paid my dues  
I thought Id found the life to suit my style  
  
But here I sit ol Spider John  
The robber man  
Long tall and handsome  
Yes ol Spider John with the loaded hand  
Taking ransom  
  
Then one day I met Diamond Lil  
She was the sweetest thing I declare  
That the summer breeze ever blown my way  
But lady she had no idea my illustrious occupation  
She thought I was a saint not a sinner gone astray  
But you see that word got around and Lily left town  
Never saw her again  
Tossin and turnin causin my heart to grieve  
  
Oh I was a super market fool I was rollthebank stool pigeon  
Robbing my hometown  
I thought Id lost my blues thought Id paid my dues  
I thought Id found the life to suit my style  
But here I sit ol Spider John  
The robber man  
Long tall and handsome  
Yes ol Spider John with the loaded hand  
Taking ransom  
  
That is all my story  
Been these thirty years since I took to the road  
Find my precious jewel one  
If you see my Lily wont you give her my regards  
Tell her ol Spider got tangled  
In the black web that he spun  
  
You can tell her that ol Spider got tangled  
In the black web that he spun
