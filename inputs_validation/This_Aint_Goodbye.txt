You and I were friends from outer space  
Afraid to let go  
The only two who understood this place  
And as far as we know  
We were way before our time  
As bold as we were blind  
Just another perfect mistake  
Another bridge to take  
On the way of letting go  
  
This aint goodbye  
It is just the way love goes  
But when the words arent warm enough  
To keep away the cold oh no  
This aint good bye  
Its not where our story ends  
But I know you cant be mine  
Not the way you always been  
As long as weve got time  
Then this aint goodbye  
Oh no this aint goodbye  
  
We were stars up in the sunlit sky  
No one else could see  
Neither of else ever thought to ever ask why  
It wasnt meant to be  
Maybe we were way too high  
To ever understand  
Baby we were victims of all all the foolish plans  
We began to divide  
  
But this aint goodbye  
This is just the way love goes  
But wheres the woman now to keep way the cold oh no  
This aint goodbye  
Its not where our story ends  
But I know you cant be mine  
Just like the way youve always been  
As long as we got time  
This aint good bye  
Oh no this aint good bye  
Oh oh oh no this aint goodbye  
No na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na  
Na na na this aint goodbye  
  
You and I were friends from outer space  
Afraid to let go  
The only two who understood this place  
And as far as we know  
This aint goodbye  
Oh no this aint goodbye  
This aint goodbye  
Oh no this aint goodbye  
This aint goodbye  
Its just the way love goes  
But when the words arent warm enought to keep away the cold oh no  
This aint goodbye  
This isnt where the story ends  
But I know you cant be mine  
Like the way youve always been  
Oh no dont say it  
No na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na  
Na na na dont say good bye
