Verse 1  
My life is a movie and everyones watching  
So lets get to the good part and past all the nonsense  
  
PreChorus  
Sometimes its hard to do the right thing  
When the pressures coming down like lightning  
Its like they want me to be perfect  
When they dont even know that Im hurting  
  
Chorus  
Cause lifes not easy Im not made out of steel  
Dont forget that Im human dont forget that Im real  
Act like you know me but you never will  
Theres one thing that I know for sure  
Ill show you  
Ill show you  
Ill show you  
Ill show you

Got to see what it feels like no matter what they say  
  
PreChorus  
Sometimes its hard to do the right thing  
When the pressures coming down like lightning  
Its like they want me to be perfect  
When they dont even know that Im hurting  
  
Chorus  
Cause lifes not easy Im not made out of steel  
Dont forget that Im human dont forget that Im real  
Act like you know me but you never will  
Theres one thing that I know for sure
