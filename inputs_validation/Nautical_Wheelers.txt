Nautical wheelers who call themselves sailors  
Play fiddle tunes under the stars  
Petticoats rustle working shoes scuffle  
Hustle on down to the bars  
  
Where the jukebox is blastin  
And the liquor is flowing  
An occasional bottle of wine  
Thats cause everyone here is just more than  
Contented to be living and dying in three quarter time  
  
Chorus  
And Its dance with me dance with me  
Nautical wheelers  
Take me to stars that you know  
Come on and dance with me  
Nautical wheelers  
I want so badly to go  
  
Well the left foot itll follow where the  
Right foot has traveled down to the  
Sidewalks unglued  
And into the street of my city so neat  
Where nobody cares what you do  
And Sonjas just grinnin  
And Phil is ecstatic and  
Mason has jumped in the sea  
While Im hangin on to a line  
From my sailboat oh  
Nautical Wheelers save me  
  
Chorus  
  
Well the sunrisell bring on the  
Sleep thats escaped us and  
Everyones off to their bed  
Therell be huggin and sqeezin  
A little pleasin and teasin  
And rubbin of each others head  
So wont you dream on comrades  
Seems nothing affects you  
Nothing no reason nor rhyme  
Thats cause everyone here is just more than  
Contented to be living and dying in three quarter time
