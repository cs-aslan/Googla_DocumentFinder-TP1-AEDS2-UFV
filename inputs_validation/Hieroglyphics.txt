Settle down class

Your grade one pyramid selling  
Yeah the time has come  
For me to drum  
Some facts into you about spelling  
  
Oh it seems to me

So buck up boys  
As we master the joys  
Of the lovely hieroglyphics  
  
Everyone needs their abc

You know how to sing dohrayme  
Easy to spell its Hand eyethingy owl

Youll pass with ease  
And find its a breeze  
The rules are scientific  
Dont have to be smart  
All you do is start  
With simple phonetic glyphics  
  
Next you get two letters a set  
More things called logographic  
Finally third the form of a word  
Determinitives Horrific

To go and ask your mummy for aid
