Here among the daffodils  
Underneath the coffee spills  
The dandelions decide to take a bit of your sunlight  
You think theres nothing beautiful  
Its simply being beautiful  
But everything you do is full of everything I love  
And you keep me fascinated  
Get it out and let me in  
While Im not for burnin out Im fadin away  
Somewhere underneath this sea of me  
There lies some poetry  
That said the perfect way ring inside your ear for days  
And underneath some April shower  
Grows the perfect kind of flower  
I dont want perfection  
All I want is your reflection  
And I dont need perfection  
All I need is you  
Cause you keep me fascinated  
Get it out and let me in  
While Im not for burning out Im fadin away  
Every petal over you  
Like a metal over you shines  
Every petal over you  
Like a metal over you shines  
Youuuuu keep me fascinated  
Get it out and let me in  
While Im not not for burnin out Im fadin  
Youuuu keep me fascinated  
Get it out and let me in  
While Im not for burnin out Im fadin away
