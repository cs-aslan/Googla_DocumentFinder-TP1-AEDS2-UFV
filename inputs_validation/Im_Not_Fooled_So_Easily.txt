Ive been listening to what you said  
And wondering if it could be true  
If its as bad as you say out there  
Ill leave the going out to you  
  
Statistics prove its not too bright  
To walk the darker streets at night  
Or to talk to people you dont know  
My worlds become a horror show  
  
Theres a murder in my living room  
My child is watching avidly  
Should I venture out tonight  
Tomorrow hell be watching me  
  
You pay your money take your choice  
But every channel plays the same  
The audience hears his masters voice  
Keeps him scared and keeps him tame  
  
Im not believing all I see  
Fabrications on TV  
Distort the news feed us your views  
Im not fooled so easily
