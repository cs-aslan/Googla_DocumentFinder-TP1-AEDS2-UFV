She was a wide eyed girl  
In a purple dress  
She could have been good  
She could have been the best  
Shy little girl  
When it came to the test  
Wow oh  
  
She was a cut above the rest  
She was a wide eyed girl  
With teased up hair  
She could have had money  
But she didnt care  
She was looking for you daddy  
  
Never there  
Looking for you daddy oh yea yea  
  
Wide eyed girl  
  
She was a wide eyed girl  
Of a tender age  
Just moving out of her sensitive phase  
She said  
I love you baby its for always  
And I dont care what the teacher says  
When she walked out  
Through the streets of Rome  
All of the Italians wanna take her home  
All the brown little babies  
With the slicked back hair  
Sayin Prima amore wow  
  
Im sayin something  
Are ya listening to me  
Dont you walk away when Im  
Communicating with you  
Shes goin clickin clackin  
Down the road in them high heeled shoes
