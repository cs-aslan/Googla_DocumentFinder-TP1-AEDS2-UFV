What becomes of little boys  
Who dreams are larger than life has ever shown them they should be  
What becomes of little boys  
Whose goals are bigger than anything in there reality  
What happens to young men  
Disappointed once again when they find out there not suppose to grow  
Do their lives become a lie  
Should they wither up and die  
When they find out they deserve more than they know  
  
And its hard to be confused  
When you find out you been used as a sacrifice for other peoples gain  
And no matter what they say its the same thing everyday  
And no one seems concerned about your pain  
  
What becomes of little boys  
Who make a little too much noise  
When their dreams have flown way beyond the clouds  
Would you rather see them silent  
Or would you rather see them violent  
Cause they never had a reason to be proud  
  
What becomes of little boys  
What becomes of little boys  
What becomes of little boys  
What becomes of little boys
