Didnt I make all your dreams come true  
Didnt they work the way you wanted it too  
Didnt I do what I promised to you  
I understand its just love love  
So dont give upon love love love  
Dont give upon love  
  
Losing you is so hard for me  
Cause loving you came so easily  
But we see things so differently  
I understand its just love  
  
Ill do what I can to carry on  
Cause Ive loved you before  
I can not love you more  
Its just love love love
