Sleepless nightsdrenched in sweat  
A lust for lifeendless death  
  
Were dancing in the fire  
Were lost in the Flame  
Were lost in the Fire  
Nothing stays the same  
  
INTO THE FIRE  
INTO THE FIRE  
  
Day to nightnight to day  
Lost in dreamsthat fade away  
  
Into the fire  
Were dancing in the flame  
Were lost in the fire  
Well nothing stays the same  
  
INTO THE FIRE  
INTO THE FIRE  
  
In the nightalone and darkdeep within the source  
Tourtured feel the flames of Hell rising to the cause  
  
Onbetwothreefour  
  
All my lifedrenched in pain  
All my needsall the same  
  
Were dancing in the fire  
Were lost in the falme  
Dancing in the fire  
Well nothing stays the same  
  
INTO THE FIRE  
INTO THE FIRE  
INTO THE FIRE  
INTO THE FIRE  
INTO THE FIRE
