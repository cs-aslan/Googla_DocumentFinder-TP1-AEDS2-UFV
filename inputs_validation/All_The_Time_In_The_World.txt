Theres still a long way to go  
And the nights are closing in  
But if Id travelled any faster babe  
Lord knows where I might have been  
  
Right from those early days  
I put my faith in the axle not the wheels  
Like old Zenos toytus  
with Achilles snapping at my heels  
  
Dont worry  
Theres no hurry  
Here we are  
With all the time in the world  
  
I could have been a highflying dealer  
But I have no desire for speed  
I could have been a wild receiver  
But Ive got everything I need  
  
And so I watch the world  
Go racing by tearing up the street  
I lay back in the long grass  
Take it easy and rest my feet  
  
Dont worry  
You know theres no hurry  
Here we are  
With all the time in the world  
  
Noone ever held me back  
You know that noone ever put me in chains  
Noone ever saw me racing ahead  
Noone had to tug on my reins  
  
As everybody knows  
I may be slow but I never quit  
Sometimes on a good day I sit and think  
Sometimes I just sit  
  
Dont worry  
Relax theres no hurry  
Here we are  
With all the time in the world
