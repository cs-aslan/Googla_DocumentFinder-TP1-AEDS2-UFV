Its six Monday morning shes back into her routine  
Kicks off the covers and thinks about last nights dream  
Shower and coffee she heads for the train  
Thinkin how every days the same  
Theres gotta be more than a life on her own  
All that she wants is a man to come home to  
  
Chorus  
Shes lookin for someone to love her  
And stay forever true  
Just somebody who she can believe in  
And say they need her too  
Shes lookin for someone to hold her  
Until the light of day  
Somebody she can make future plans with  
And know hes here to stay  
  
Late in the evening she is dreamin in black and white  
An old love story she wishes portrayed her life  
No one would know what goes on in her mind  
Thinkin its only a matter of time  
Til someday she finds what shes lookin for  
And her shipll come sailin into her shore  
  
Chorus  
  
Shes lookin for someone to love her Oh someone to love her  
And stay forever true Oh no  
Just somebody who she can believe in  
And say they need her too Someone who needs her too  
Shes lookin for someone to hold her  
Until the light of day Oh until the light of day  
Somebody she can make future plans with  
And know hes here to stay
