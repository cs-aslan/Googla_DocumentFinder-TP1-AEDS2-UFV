It fits perfect  
  
Better watch out sucka now I got ya where I want ya  
Onslaught comin and Im packin in my lunch a  
Buncha missle launchers n a buncha contra  
Banvan full of ganja now come on ja  
Man stop Man said Marshall OhmyGod ya  
Doin the chacha and the cucaracha with a quadra  
Polegic boogyin down to Frank Sinatra  
Lindsey to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya  
Whod a knew the pewd a do to me what its done  
Such sinasism when it isnt in my system  
Bluntigmatism betta spliff up to my lips son  
So much on my hands I gotta give my kids a fistbump  
Christopher Reeves swimmin in my swim trunks  
Mista help mes what he said to me and then sunk  
Women skinnin them and cuttin them up in chunks  
In clumps the woman with cocoabutter skin once  
  
Chorus  
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill  
Buffalo Bill BuffaBuffalo Bill  
Skin em up hem em sew em up in those kilts  
Up in those kilts uppaup in those kilts  
Man you dont want to go up in those hills  
Up in those hills uppaup in those hills  
You better beware stay clear of Buffalo Bill  
Buffalo Bill BuffaBuffalo Bill  
  
Always you can see him lurkin in the hallways  
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawlspace  
How the hell did he fit em all into such a small place  
Hide em in the wall well how long will the drywall take  
Well fuck it then Ive got nothin but time Ill wait  
Until it dries for the moment I guess youre all safe  
After I sand it and buff it I guess that Ill paint  
My chainsaws outta gas my regular saw aint  
Now here I come again damn stomach rumblin  
You can even hear the evil spirits comin from within  
Someones in the back of my damn house rummagin  
Its a girl she looks pretty thin but I want her skin  
Been on the hunt again when will it ever end  
Evelyn why you tryin to fight You will never win  
Severin legs arms damn there goes another limb  
Pull the lever then trap door death is evident  
  
Chorus  
  
Now what ya know about Buffalo Bill  
Nothin so chill  
Fuckin hoe ya better fuckin hold still  
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket dont spill  
Cut em gut em n just get to stuffin those girls  
ManI think she had enough of those pills  
So take that thing away to come back later just to clutch in those steel  
Blades baby when I cut ya dont squeal  
I hate the loud noises I fuckin told you  
I keep hearin voices like Wouldnt ya like to go an get your butcher knife  
And push it right through her while ya put your shishkebab skewers  
Into her barbaquer Would ya do to her  
What ya usually do to a girl whos skins newer  
In a world of sindoer this is turnin into a  
Torment tournament of sorts Christmas ornaments you are  
Ill be sure to Ginsue ya til theres no more skin to ya  
Booya who ya think your fuckin with  
Duck because here he comes again  
  
Chorus
