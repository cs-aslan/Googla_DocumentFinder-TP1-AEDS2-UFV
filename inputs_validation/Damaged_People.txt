Were damaged people  
Drawn together  
By subtleties that we are not aware of  
Disturbed souls  
Playing out forever  
These games that we once thought we would be scared of  
  
When youre in my arms  
The world makes sense  
There is no pretense  
And youre crying  
When youre by my side  
There is no defense  
I forget to sense Im dying  
  
Were damaged people  
Praying for something  
That doesnt come from somewhere deep inside us  
Depraved souls  
Trusting in the one thing  
The one thing that this life has not denied us  
  
When I feel the warmth of your very soul  
I forget Im cold  
And crying  
When your lips touch mine  
And I lose control  
I forget Im old  
And dying
