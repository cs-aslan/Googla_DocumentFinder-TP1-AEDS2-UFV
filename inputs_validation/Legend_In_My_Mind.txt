Youre a memory of love Ive been unable to leave behind  
All for the hurt that dont ease up the way I hope it would givin time  
It slowly been so long Im not surprised to find that youre a legend in my
mind  
Youre a picture of yesterday and the shadow that hides the sun  
Lonely words that still echo when the echo should be gone  
Youre the livin part of me the only part it leaves behind  
And youre a legend in my mind  
If I had the way to close every doors  
That you ever open wide and I walk through with you  
I could fuss the world on the back and carry away and never come back to you  
I wish that I could close my eyes and see you gone Im not blind Im not blind  
And youre a legend in my mind  
I wish that I could close my eyes
