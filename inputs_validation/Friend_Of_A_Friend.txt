I heard it from a friend of a friend  
Youre livin out in LA now  
Got a studio apartment couple blocks off the beach  
Doing yoga in the evenings you love the kids you teach  
  
I heard it from a friend of a friend  
You met somebody in a coffee shop  
Youve been goin out now for goin on ten months  
You already met his family things are heatin up  
  
Dont you believe anything you hear  
When someone tells you I still ask about you  
After all these years  
No matter what they say its just not true  
I dont spend all my days and all my nights  
Just missin you  
  
I heard it from a friend of a friend  
You looked amazing in that long white gown  
With flowers in your hair barefoot in the sand  
Your daddy almost broke down when he gave away your hand  
  
But dont you believe anything you hear  
When someone tells you I still ask about you  
After all these years  
No matter what they say its just not true  
I dont spend all my days and all my nights  
Just missin you  
  
I heard it from a friend of a friend  
He didnt mean it when he took those vows  
Youve been stayin with your mama a couple weeks now  
Been asking everybody about me  
  
I heard it from a friend of a friend
