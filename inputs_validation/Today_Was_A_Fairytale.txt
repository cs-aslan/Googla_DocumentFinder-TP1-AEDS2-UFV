Today was a fairytale  
You were the prince  
I used to be a damsel in distress  
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Today was a fairytale  
I wore a dress  
You wore a dark gray tshirt  
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess  
Today was a fairytale  
Time slows down whenever youre around  
  
But can you feel this magic in the air  
It must have been the way you kissed me  
Fell in love when I saw you standing there  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Today was a fairytale  
Youve got a smile that takes me to another planet  
Every move you make everything you say is right  
Today was a fairytale  
Today was a fairytale  
All that I can say is now its getting so much clearer  
Nothin made sense til the time I saw your face  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Time slows down whenever youre around  
Yeah yeah  
  
But can you feel this magic in the air  
It must have been the way you kissed me  
Fell in love when I saw you standing there  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Time slows down whenever youre around  
I can feel my heart  
Its beating in my chest  
Did you feel it  
I cant put this down  
  
But can you feel this magic in the air  
It must have been the way you kissed me  
Fell in love when I saw you standing there  
It must have been the way  
But can you feel this magic in the air  
It must have been the way you kissed me  
Fell in love when I saw you standing there  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Oh oh yeah yeah oh  
Today was a fairytale
