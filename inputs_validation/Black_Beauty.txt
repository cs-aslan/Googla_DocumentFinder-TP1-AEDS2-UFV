I paint my nails black  
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown  
Cause you like your women spanish dark strong and proud  
I paint the sky black  
You said if you could have your way  
Youd make it nighttime all today  
So itd suit the mood with your song  
  
Oh what can I do  
Nothing my sparrow blue  
Oh what can I do  
Life is beautiful  
But you dont have a clue  
Sun and ocean blue  
Their magnificence it dont make sense to you  
  
Black beauty  
Oh x2  
  
I paint the house black  
My wedding dress black leather too  
You have no room for light  
Love is lost on you  
I keep my lips red  
They seem like cherries in the spring  
Darling you cant let everything seem so dark blue  
  
But oh what can I do  
Nothing my sparrow blue  
Oh what can I do  
Life is beautiful  
But you dont have a clue  
Sun and ocean blue  
Their magnificence it dont make sense to you  
  
Oh x5  
Black beauty baby x2  
  
Oh what can I do  
Life is beautiful  
But you dont have clue  
Sun and ocean blue  
Their magnificence it dont make sense to you  
  
Black beauty  
Oh x4
