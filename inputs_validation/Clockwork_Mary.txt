Jesse to Congregation Welcome my friends  
To Paradise  
I know sorrows you hide  
Closer to my light  
Are you sad maam  
  
Jesse to Mother Do I know your face  
Mother Mine  
Oh mamma where you gone  
Now you come to  
Claim me your son  
Im the broken piece of your life  
Oh and mama whyd you come  
Fall before me say im your one  
Oh you gave but taken my life  
  
Was I born in your sin  
Or Marys lie  
Cause I know all that you hide  
Come closer am I blind  
Oh to your madness  
Here in your naked grace  
Mother why  
Oh mama where you gone  
Now you come to  
Claim me your son  
Im the broken piece of your life  
Oh and mama whyd you come  
Fall before me say Im your one  
Oh you gave but taken my life  
  
Ill kill the beast  
So to free my soul  
And smash the tears  
That never let me go  
Oh if theres a smile you see  
Its only the clockwork  
Orange thats in me  
  
I curse the darkness  
Impassioned plea  
And tear the heart out  
And watch me bleed  
Ill sacrifice my blood for free  
To satisfy the vengeance in me  
  
Oh all I need was someone  
To love me  
Oh all I needed was one  
Theres no one who cares
