A yes yes yall  
Its too fresh yall  
A little bboy blue  
You know its too beucou  
  
Ive been from New York to Cali  
Spent two days in the valley  
And I think Im bout to lose my mind  
And if I think bout it one more time  
  
Im a blow my stack  
See ya out the back  
Give me some room that I can breathe in  
Now Im a start weavin  
  
Spells like a wizard  
King of the lizard  
My mojos risin like my nature should  
Not everybody can relate to hood  
  
But I used to roll with high frequency  
Had a habit of juvenile delinquency  
If yall could see all the things I did  
When I was a kid ya might flip ya lid  
  
Cause when I was the age of one  
My father gave me my very first gun  
When I was the age of two  
I was pullin out records with the SD Crew  
  
And when I was the age of three  
I had all the maddest fishes swimmin after me  
And when I was the age of four  
I was bustin out shows with the rhymes galore  
See  
  
Day to the night  
Night to the day  
Up around where I stay  
We do things this way  
  
You got to watch how you act  
And watch what you say  
Cause their aint no stallin  
When the death come callin  
  
Day to the night  
Night to the day  
Up around where I stay  
We do things this way  
  
You got to watch how you act  
And watch what you say  
Cause their aint no stallin  
When the death come callin  
  
The man that lives by the pistol  
Dies by the smokin gun  
Gun  
I think I hear a steam whistle  
Lord when my train gonna come  
  
The man that lives by the pistol  
Dies by the smokin gun  
Gun  
I think I hear a steam whistle  
Lord when my train gonna come  
  
Yo all you duns packin  
Fightin for ones  
Its time to get these hons  
Start raisin some sons  
  
Plant your seed in some fertile soil  
And watch me start bubblin  
Like Im bout to boil  
Like Olive Oil love Popeye  
  
Just wont stoppa I got to keep rockin  
Ticks keep tockin time keeps slippin  
My mind keeps trippin  
Im in the road less traveled sure got lotta stones  
  
I say day to the night  
Night to the day  
Up around where I stay  
We do things this way  
  
You got to watch how you act  
And watch what you say  
Cause their aint no stallin  
When the death come callin  
  
I say day to the night  
Night to the day  
Up around where I stay  
We do things this way  
  
You got to watch how you act  
And watch what you say  
Cause their aint no stallin  
When the death come callin  
  
When the death come callin  
Watch me break it down  
When the death come callin  
Watch me break it down  
  
Theres a red house yonder  
Just over the hill  
With my name carved  
Into the window sill  
  
I think Im gonna burn it down  
Yeah I think Im gonna burn it down  
Thats what me and my old woman used to say  
We used to lie in bed and make love all day  
  
Now I think Im gonna burn it down  
Yeah I think Im gonna burn it down  
Yeah I think Im gonna burn it down to the ground  
  
The man that lives by the pistol  
Dies by the smokin gun  
I think I hear a steam whistle  
Lord when my train gonna come  
  
The man that lives by the pistol  
Dies by the smokin gun  
I think I hear a steam whistle  
Lord when my train gonna come
