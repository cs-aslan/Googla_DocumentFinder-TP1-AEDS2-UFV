Another year has passed me by  
Still I look a myself and cry  
What kind of man have I become  
All of the years Ive spent in search of myself  
And Im still in the dark  
Cause I cant seem to find the light alone  
  
Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness  
Im a lonely soldier off to war  
Sent away to die never quite knowing why  
Sometimes it makes no sense at all  
  
Ten Thousand people look my way  
But they cant see the way that I feel  
Nobody even cares to try  
I spend my life and sell my soul on the road  
And Im still in the dark  
Cause I cant seem to find the light alone  
  
Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness  
Im a lonely sailor lost at sea  
Drifting with the tide  
Never quite knowing why  
Sometimes it makes no sense at all  
  
Im alive  
Looking for love Im a man with emotion  
And my hearts on fire  
Im dying of thirst in the middle of the ocean  
Im alive
