Were bobbing on the surface  
and the shadow glides below  
They say she feels my heartbeat  
Oh but how Ill never know  
  
That its the ocean flowing in our veins  
Oh that its the salt thats in our tears  
Oh cause we could have come so very far  
Oh in at least as many years  
  
Take the highway through the Great Divide  
Take the highway through the Great Divide  
  
Im building you a pyramid  
With limestone blocks so large  
I drag them from the mountain top  
Youll need a two car garage  
  
And its the ocean flowing in our veins  
OhThat its the salt thats in our tears  
OhCause we could have come so very far  
OhIn at least as many years  
  
Take the highway through the Great Divide  
Take the highway through the Great Divide  
  
Cause its the ocean flowing in our veins  
OhThat its the salt thats in our tears  
OhCause we could have come so very far  
OhIn at least as many years  
  
Take the highway through the Great Divide
