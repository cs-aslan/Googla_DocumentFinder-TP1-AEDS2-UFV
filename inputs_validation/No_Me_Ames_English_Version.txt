Tell me why are you crying  
Because Im happy  
And why are you so choked up  
From loneliness  
And why are you squeezing my hand  
So tightly  
And your thoughts seem to be wandering  
I love you so much  
Why  
Dont be so hardheaded  
Stop doubting me  
Although in the future theres a large sky  
Im not afraid  
I want to love you  
Dont love me because you think Im different  
You dont think its right  
For us to spend this time together  
Dont love me because I know what a lie it would be  
If you dont think I deserve your love  
Dont love me  
Im going to stay another day  
Dont love me because Im lost  
Because I change the world  
Because its my destiny  
Because I cant change  
We are a mirror  
And you are my reflection  
Dont love me  
To be dying in a war of regret and sad thoughts  
Dont love me  
Because in this world  
This great love deserves to soar through the blue sky  
I dont know what to say  
Thats the truth  
If people want to want to hurt us they will  
If you and I part now  
They dont matter  
But in this world  
Dont leave me  
Dont leave me  
Dont leave me  
Dont listen when I say I dont love you  
Dont love me  
Stop breaking my heart with these I dont love yous  
Dont love me  
Because my heart is breaking  
That is useless  
I will always love you  
Dont love me  
You have suffered enough  
My heart has turned cold like a million winters  
Dont love me  
To forget about your gray days  
I want you to always love me  
You and I are changing  
One with the other  
And always together  
This love is like the sun  
That comes out after a storm  
Like two comets in the same galaxy  
Dont love me  
Dont love me  
Dont love me  
Dont love me dont love me dont love me
