Is it that time again  
Closin time closin in  
Are they turnin out the lights Must I go home  
Cause her memory  
Is hauntingly  
Waiting there to see Im not alone  
I know I just cant stand another lonely night  
This man is going out out of his mind  
Since she left me behind  
Since she left me behind  
  
Am I the last one here  
Please just one more beer  
And Ill be on my way back to the blues  
Back down lonely street  
To a house thats peace  
Im nothing but a line of bad news  
I know I just cant stand another lonely night  
This man is going out out of his mind  
Since she left me behind  
Since she left me behind  
  
I know I just cant stand another lonely night  
This man is going out out of his mind  
Since she left me behind  
Since she left me behind
