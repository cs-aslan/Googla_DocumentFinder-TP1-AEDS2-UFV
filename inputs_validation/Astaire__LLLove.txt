Flirting with disaster  
Youre the one Im after  
Think I found my destiny  
Luxury and danger  
Rapture me my stranger  
Hold me close dont let me be  
  
I could fly on the wings of my heart  
Deep inside Ive been falling apart  
LLLove Theres a magic in you  
And Ill be under your spell LLLove  
  
Crezy hazy feeling  
Youre the thief Im stealing  
Locked you up and lost the key  
Flying on the wings  
Flying on the wings  
Flying on the wings of my heart  
  
I could fly on the wings of my heart  
Deep inside Ive been falling apart  
LLLove Theres a magic in you  
And Ill be under your spell LLLove  
  
Need your touch its what Im after  
Fatal kiss your embrace  
You got me baby Youve got me baby  
Fatal kiss your embrace  
  
I could fly on the wings of my heart  
Deep inside Ive been falling apart  
LLLove Theres a magic in you  
And Ill be under your spell  
I could fly on the wings of my heart  
Deep inside Ive been falling apart  
LLLove Theres a magic in you  
And Ill be under your spell LLlove  
LLLove LLLove LLLove
