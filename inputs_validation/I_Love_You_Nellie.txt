Standing in the moonlight by the old garden gate  
Nellie my darlin I know you will wait  
Wait for me dearest he said in tears  
Then Ill be your sweetheart through all the long years  
I love you Nellie yes Ill be true  
All these long years have been just for you  
And believe me Nellie when Im far away  
Ill not forget you Ill be with you someday  
Early next morning at the break of day  
He was to journey so far away  
Drawing her nearer his promised bride  
By the pale moonlight these words he replied  
I love you Nellie yes Ill be true  
All these long years have been just for you  
And believe me Nellie when Im far away  
Ill not forget you Ill be with you someday
