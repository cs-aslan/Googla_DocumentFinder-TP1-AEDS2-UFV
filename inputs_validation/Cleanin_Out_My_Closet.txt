Wheres my snare  
I have no snare in my headphones  
There you go yeah yo yo  
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against  
I have Ive been protested and demonstrated against  
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times  
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin kid thats behind  
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin  
Tempers flaring from parents just blow em off and keep goin  
Not takin nothin from no one give em hell long as Im breathin  
Keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evening  
Leave em with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth  
See they can trigger me but they never figure me out  
Look at me now I bet ya probably sick of me now  
Aint you mama Im a make you look so ridiculous now  
  
Chorus x2  
I said Im sorry mama  
I never meant to hurt you  
I never meant to make you cry  
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet  
  
I got some skeletons in my closet and  
I dont know if no one knows it  
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it  
Im a expose it Ill take you back to 73  
Before I ever had a multiplatinum sellin CD  
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months  
My fagot father must have had his panties up in a bunch  
Cause he split I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye  
No I dont on second thought I just fuckin wished he would die  
I look at Hailie and I couldnt picture leavin her side  
Even if I hated Kim I grit my teeth and I  
Try to make it work with her at least for Hailies sake  
I maybe made some mistakes but Im only human  
But Im man enough to face them today  
What I did was stupid no doubt it was dumb  
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun  
Cause Id a killed them shit I woulda shot Kim and him both  
This my life Id like to welcome yall to The Eminem Show  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Now I would never dis my own mama  
Just to get recognition  
Take a second to listen who you think this record is dissin  
But put yourself in my position just try to envision  
Witnessin yo mama poppin prescription pills in the kitchen  
Bitchin that someones always goin through her purse and shits missin  
Goin through public housing systems victim of Munchhausens syndrome  
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasnt  
Til I grew up now I blew up  
It makes you sick to your stomach doesnt it  
Wasnt it the reason you made that CD for me Ma  
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma  
Well guess what your gettin older now and  
Its cold when your lonely and Nathans growin up so quick  
Hes gonna know that your phony  
And Hailies gettin so big now you should see her shes beautiful  
But youll never see her she wont even be at your funeral  
See what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong  
Bitch do your song  
Keep tellin yourself that you was a mom  
But how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get  
You selfish bitch I hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit  
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me  
Well guess what I am dead dead to you as can be  
  
Chorus x2
