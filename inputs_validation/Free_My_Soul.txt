I took your name you took my number  
Look me up if youre in my town  
You made a friend be sure of that  
Let me know if youre free come down  
Youre making plansthings youll do  
Said Ill be someone Im telling you  
  
Im gonna leave this town play me some rocknroll  
Im gonna find myself Im gonna free my soul  
  
We took a walk out in the grey  
You didnt speak but had much to say  
Dont talk too loud walls have ears  
Criticise and youll disappear  
A souvenir from where youve gone  
A pair of jeans or some chewing gum  
  
Im gonna leave this town play me some rocknroll  
Im gonna find myself Im gonna free my soul  
They built the wall until they had something to hide  
To keep me out or is it to keep you inside  
  
Im gonna free me
