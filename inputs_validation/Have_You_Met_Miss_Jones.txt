Have you met Miss Jones  
Someone said as we shook hands  
She was just Miss Jones to me  
And then I said Miss Jones  
  
Youre a girl who understands  
Im a man who must be free  
And all at once I lost my breath  
And all at once was scared to death  
  
And all at once I owned the earth and sky  
But now Ive met Miss Jones  
And well keep on meeting till we die  
Miss Jones and I  
  
And all at once I lost my breath  
And all at once was scared to death  
And all at once I owned the earth and sky  
And now Ive met Miss Jones  
  
And well keep on meeting till we die  
Miss Jones and I  
Miss Jones and I  
Miss Jones and I
