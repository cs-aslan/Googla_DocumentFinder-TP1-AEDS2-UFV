If some guy tells you I dont care  
And tells you lies while Im not there  
Dont talk to him  
If he tells you Im untrue  
Then darling here what you must do  
Dont talk to him  
And if he tells you Ive been seen  
Walking round with Sue and Jean  
Hes lying again lying again  
Do anything that you want to  
But darling this I beg of you  
Dont talk to him  
  
If you hear the words he has to say  
Hell break your heart  
Let your love for me prove strong  
While we are far apart  
  
So just remember whatd I say  
And Trust in me while Im away for Ill be true  
And just remember my true love is  
Brighter than the moon above for only you  
And if this guy should try to say  
My love for you is only plain  
Nearly a wind nearly a wind  
Just close your eyes and count to ten  
And think of me again  
But dont you talk to him  
  
And if this guy should try to say  
My love for you is only plain  
Merely a whim Merely a whim  
Just close your eyes and count to ten  
And think of me again  
But dont you talk to him  
  
If you hear the words he has to say  
Hell break your heart  
Let your love for me prove strong  
While we are far apart  
  
So just remember whatd I say  
Trust in me while Im away for Ill be true  
And just remember my true love is  
Brighter than the moon above for only you  
And if this guy should try to say  
My love for you is only plain  
Merely a whim Merely a whim  
Just close your eyes count to ten  
And think of me again  
But dont you talk to him
