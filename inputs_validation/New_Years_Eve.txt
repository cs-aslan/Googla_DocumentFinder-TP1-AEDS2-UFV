Everybody Partys on a New Years Eve  
Waitin for the countdown  
Make a lot of promises they never keep  
Party with the lights on  
  
Standing still dressed to kill holding a glass of champagne  
Everyone having fun tryin to get out of there brain  
  
Everybody partys on a New Years Eve  
Party with the lights on

Everythings alright with meParty on New Years Eve  
Tell me what you see The peak of the Holiday Season  
Everythings alright with me Bringin in the New Year

Everythings alright with me Bringin in the New Year  
  
Everybody parties on a New Years Eve  
Waitin for the countdown  
Everybody lookin at the big tv talkin at the same time
