Sometimes I will then again I think I wont  
Sometimes I will then again I think I wont  
Sometimes I do then again I think I dont  
  
Well I looked at my watch it was 921  
We was at a rocknroll dance having nothing but fun  
  
Chorus  
And we rolled reelin and a rockin  
We was reelin and a rockin  
Rollin till the break of dawn  
  
Well I looked at my watch it was 932  
Theres nothing I would rather do than dance with you  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I looked at my watch it was 943  
And everytime I spinned she would spin with me  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I looked at my watch it was 954  
I said  Dance ballerina girl go go go  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I looked at my watch it was 1005  
Man I didnt know if I was dead or alive  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I looked at my watch it was 1026  
But Im gonna keep on dancing toll I get my kicks  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I looked at my watch it was 1028  
I gotta get my kicks before it get too late  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I looked at my watch it was 1029  
I had to hold her hand she was still holding mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I looked at my watch and to my surprise  
I was dancing with a woman that was twice my size  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I looked at my watch and it was time to go  
The bandleader said  We aint playing no more   
  
Chorus
