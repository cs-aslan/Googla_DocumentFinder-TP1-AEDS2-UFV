You been robbed  
You been used  
You been crucified and  
You been abused  
You been sacrificed and  
Now youre confused  
Aint it the truth  
  
You got a hole in your head  
And a cold empty spot  
In your big brass bed  
When youre mad at the world and  
You feel like youre losing control  
All you need to get by is  
A little bit o soul  
  
When youve lost in the flood  
And you feel like you been  
Kicked through the mud  
You know they still  
Havent found the drug  
To pick us up  
  
Feeling down misunderstood  
You know these times  
They aint looking so good  
When youre mad at the world and  
You feel like youre losing control  
What we all need to get by is  
A little o soul  
  
Whoa oh  
Little bit of soul  
What we all need  
To survive  
Is just  
A little bit o soul  
  
Everyones complaining  
Nothing but frustration  
The king has pissed in  
Your pot of gold  
It aint entertaining spending  
So much time in the hole  
Send down  
A little bit o soul  
  
When youre mad at the world  
And you feel like  
Youre losing control  
What we all need  
To get by is just  
A little bit o soul  
  
Whoa oh little bit o soul  
  
Whoa oh little bit o soul  
  
Whoa oh little bit o soul
