Draw the line  
Dont want to waste my time  
On an unresponsive  
Kid like you  
Who made the effort  
You devil in disguise  
You just keep on trying  
To win affection with your smile  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
Youre looking for  
In the love that youre looking for  
Say youd never leave me  
But babe I cant believe  
In the love that  
Youre looking for  
  
Danger signs  
Opened up the eyes  
Of an unsuspecting  
Fool like me  
What about an effort  
What about tonight  
Whats the use in trying  
When nothings going right  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
Youre looking for  
Tears they dont come easy  
And babe I cant believe  
In the love that  
Youre looking for  
The kind love you never felt before  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
Youre looking for  
In the love that youre looking for  
Say youd never leave me  
But babe I cant believe  
In the love that  
Youre looking for  
  
Cant you see  
That youre turning me  
Into a cold cold  
Kid like you  
Forget the effort  
Now youre not mine  
No more use in smiling  
Its time to say goodbye  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
Youre looking for  
Tears they dont come easy  
And babe I cant believe  
In the love that  
Youre looking for  
The kind love you never felt before  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
Youre looking for  
In the love that youre looking for  
Say youd never leave me  
But babe I cant believe  
In the love that  
Youre looking for  
  
Say youd never leave me  
Tears they dont come easy  
Baby please dont leave me  
Baby in the love that youre looking for  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
Youre looking for  
In the love that youre looking for  
Say youd never leave me  
But babe I cant believe  
In the love that  
Youre looking for  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
Youre looking for  
Tears they dont come easy  
And babe I cant believe  
In the love that  
Youre looking for  
The kind love you never felt before
