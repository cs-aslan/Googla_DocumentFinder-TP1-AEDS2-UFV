Motor  
  
Still cant believe it cant stand to leave it  
But I know the rules  
We were doomed babe too much too soon babe  
Acting like fools  
  
Tried to fly and climbed too high  
We saw it all we had to fall  
But I swear its true was all for you  
I swear its true was all for you  
  
Making love all the time  
Never let the day go by or a night  
Sweet music in the dark  
You always found the spark to light my light  
  
Chorus
