Jillys on smack and she wont be comin back  
No she wont be comin back for the holidays  
Jillys on smack and she wont be comin back  
No she wont be comin back for the holidays  
  
Jilly left home  
Went to pick her own bone  
She made her own  
In the marketplace  
  
Now Jillys on smack and she wont be comin back  
No she wont be comin back  
For these holidays  
  
Now Jillys on smack and she wont be comin back  
No she wont be comin back  
For the holidays  
  
Jilly had a smile  
That spanned over a mile  
She left him standing in the aisles  
Of the big parade  
  
Jilly always phoned her mother  
Emailed daily to her brother  
Til she took a junkie lover  
And began to fade  
  
Now Jillys on smack and she wont be comin back  
No she wont be comin back  
For the holidays  
  
Jillys on smack and she wont be comin back  
No she wont be comin back  
For the holidays  
  
Jillys on smack and she wont be comin back  
No she wont be comin back  
For them holidays
