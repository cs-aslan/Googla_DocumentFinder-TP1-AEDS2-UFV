Can We Get Back To Love Again  
  
I cant cry no more  
Girl my eyes are empty  
Cant think of nothing but you  
You are the reason I wake up in the morning  
Lately Im sleeping till two  
  
Sometimes I swear that you are lying here beside me  
I reach for you girl and youre not there  
Still got the smell of your body on the pillow  
Still finding strings of your hair  
  
Tell me can we try baby  
Can we get back to love again  
Seems like Im losing my best friend  
Can you rescue me from the rain  
And be my sunshine again  
Can I make it up to you  
I promise that Ill do anything for us  
Cause baby I love you  
I mean it I need you  
Lets go back to love again  
  
I dont wanna go on without you baby  
Dont wanna hurt anymore  
Aint nothing right and my world is going crazy  
Aint nothing left to live for  
  
And I try but I  
Cant stop loving you wishing you were here  
Baby you are my life  
I just want my baby girl  
  
So can we get back to love again  
Seems like Im losing my best friend  
Can you rescue me from the rain  
And be my sunshine again  
Can I make it up to you  
I promise that Ill do anything for us  
Cause baby I love you  
I mean it I need you  
Lets get back to love again  
  
Give me one more night to change your mind  
And girl I swear tonight will be the night Im gonna take you there  
I have to risk my last chance girl  
I dont care if I die trying to get you back baby  
I love you you are my lady  
Ill be there daily weekly  
  
Can we get back to love again  
Seems like Im losing my best friend  
Can you rescue me from the rain  
And be my sunshine again  
Can I make it up to you  
I promise that Ill do anything for us  
Cause baby I love you  
I mean it I need you  
Lets get back to love again

Seems like Im losing my best friend  
Can you rescue me from the rain  
And be my sunshine again  
Can I make it up to you  
I promise that Ill do anything for us  
Cause baby I love you
