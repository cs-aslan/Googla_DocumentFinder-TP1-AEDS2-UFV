Speak  
Youre speaking words  
But all I ever heard  
Is white noise from weird boys  
  
Space  
Youre spacing out  
By the way  
Whats that face about  
Its so weird  
Its so weird  
  
You dont know me  
You dont own me  
Youre just poassing through my life  
Youre a stranger  
With bad behavior  
Youre so weird Im terrified  
  
Back lounge  
A chain smoking Charlie Brown  
Youre busted up  
And broken down  
So youre so low rent  
Youre texting vegan sex again  
Its so weird  
Its so weird  
  
You dont know me  
You dont own me  
Youre just passing through my life  
Youre a stranger  
With bad behavior  
Youre so weird Im terrified  
  
Slowly faintly  
Slowly faintly  
Slowly faintly  
Slowly faintly  
  
You dont know me  
You dont own me  
Youre just passing through my life  
Youre a stranger  
With bad behavior  
Youre so weird Im terrified
