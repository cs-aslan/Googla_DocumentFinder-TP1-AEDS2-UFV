You have the technology  
You are in control you know all the angles  
Forget your trigonometry  
Please release my soul please undo this tangle  
You have the power remote control  
One look from you and my blood runs cold  
Youve put my heart on hold freeze frame  
Youve put my heart on hold freeze frame  
Youve put my heart on hold  
  
You had compatibility  
Youre not giving in youre not user friendly  
Theres every possibility  
We can make a spark with the right connection  
I need your wiring diagram  
I need to break into your programme  
Youve put my heart on hold freeze frame  
Youve put my heart on hold freeze frame  
Youve put my heart on hold  
  
You know the terminology  
You leave me behind I could use some training  
Equipment is top quality  
Ill supply the base you supply the software  
Its done by numbers or so they say  
So one plus one equals two today  
Youve put my heart on hold freeze frame  
Youve put my heart on hold freeze frame  
Youve put my heart on hold freeze frame  
Youve put my heart on hold freeze frame  
Youve put my heart on hold freeze frame  
Youve put my heart on hold freeze frame  
Youve put my heart on hold freeze frame  
Youve put my heart on hold
