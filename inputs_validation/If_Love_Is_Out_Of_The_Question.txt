You bought me flowers and you sold me a line  
You gave me compliments and too much wine  
Ive played that game I know all the moves  
  
You show emotion but you hide what you feel  
You play the innocent but Ive watched you steal  
I rest my case you stand accused  
  
But I must confess I was quite impressed  
You seduced me with your easy charm  
And I must admit I could fall for it  
  
But if love is out the question  
Theres no point to this affection  
I gotta have more than ecstasy  
Make me believe  
Im all youll ever need  
Cause if love is out the question  
Put a little heart in your intention  
I gotta have more than ecstasy  
Make me believe  
Im all youll ever need  
  
You talk in circles when I need a straight line  
Youve got your principles and Ive got mine  
We all need commitment thats all I ask  
Is that a crime  
  
And I must confess I was quite impressed  
I was losing to your winning ways  
But I must resist theres no point to this  
  
But if love is out the question  
Theres no point to this affection  
I gotta have more than ecstasy  
Make me believe  
Im all youll ever need  
  
Cause if love is out the quesion I just gotta stop  
Little point to this affection I just want to stop  
It makes no sense to carry on like this  
If theres nothing between us you dont know  
what youll miss  
  
No love  
Theres no love  
Baby its true  
Theres no love  
  
But if love is out the question  
Theres no point to this affection  
Cause if love is out the question  
Put a little heart in your intention
