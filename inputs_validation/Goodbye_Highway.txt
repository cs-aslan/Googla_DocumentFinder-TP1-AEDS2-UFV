In this world of lost horizons  
Where your dreams burn fast  
But your nights go slower  
Ever find that youre compromising  
All your hopes and fears  
Just to get to know her  
  
So you take a walk down the goodbye highway  
The hello goodbye way  
Its a long long road  
Ever take a stroll down the goodbye highway  
The some other time way  
Try to ease your load  
  
She was never one for social graces  
And hangin out with the midnight faces  
Wore me out  
I guess the thoughts of the nights alone  
Or the time waiting for the telephone  
Removed the doubt  
  
So we took a ride down the goodbye highway  
The hello goodbye way  
Its the longest road  
Soon youre fighting over the yours or my way  
The do or die ways  
The only way you know  
  
So you stand up for the things that youre losing  
Out on but its all so confusing  
You hold on but it slips right through your hands  
Guess its so long with a change of direction  
Goodbye gotta make my connection  
Solo as you head on out the door forever more  
  
So you take a walk down the goodbye highway  
The hello goodbye way  
Its a one way road  
Ever find yourself down the goodbye highway  
The some other time way  
Nowhere left to go nowhere left to go
