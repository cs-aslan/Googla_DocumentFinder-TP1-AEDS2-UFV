I never felt like this with someone I never knew I could feel this way at all  
Predestination by appointment storybook realities are coming true  
I was scared you look so helpless the lust was dressed in good disguise  
  
I took you on to meet my mother  
Just like me she fell straight in love with you  
You took me to your own apartment was it me or does the night do things to
you  
You read from Venus and Adonis so honey how could I resist  
  
Cmon baby weve got tonight no one loses when two tigers fights  
I lift you up never let you down  
Ill be the jester babe and youll be the crown  
Were instinctively impulsive were animals  
  
A body like yours should be arrested honey I should be locked up in a cage  
We are flesh we are carnal cut oh we are human  
Oh babe got these eyes we cant contend  
Smoke alarm is going off again I guess Im gonna have to cool you down  
  
Say come on baby weve got tonight no one loses when two tigers fight  
Youll be fire Ill be the ice so come on baby melt me ooh so nice  
Instinctively impulsive were animals  
  
Some girls may turn me up but only you baby turn me on  
When we touch its so explosive it seems my lifes been leading to this  
  
Say come on baby weve got tonight no one loses when two tigers fight  
Youll be fire Ill be the ice so come on baby melt me ooh so nice  
Is it rhythm is it magic were animals  
Ooh baby were animals
