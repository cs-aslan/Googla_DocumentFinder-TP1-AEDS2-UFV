In the front row at the Melt Show  
I fell in love with you and that was three weeks ago  
We fooled around you let me have it for free  
Yeah it worked out out real nice  
I showed you how to and you showed me paradise  
Now youre killing time and its killing me  
Oh and is this more than some old summer fling  
Oh this thing we have will it mean anything  
Oh when October rolls around will you sober up and let me down  
Will you sober up and let me  
Out in schoolyard out the back door  
I used to love it but I dont believe in school no more  
You dont learn anything youre just waitin around  
With your big brains and your know how  
If theres was a reason youd have figured it out by now  
A little gettin somes good while youre waitin around  
Oh is this more than some old summer fling  
This thing we have will it mean anything  
Oh when October rolls around will you sober up and let me down  
Will you sober up and let me  
Now my bad dream is my best friend  
You were here last night but now youre gone again  
Im getting tired of you getting tired of me  
Oh is this more than some old summer fling  
This thing we have will it mean anything  
Oh when October rolls around will you sober up and let me down  
Will you sober up and let me down  
Will you sober up and let me
