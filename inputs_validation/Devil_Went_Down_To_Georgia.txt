Its been ten long years since  
The devil laid his fiddle at Johnnys feet  
And it burned inside his mind  
The way he suffered that defeat  
  
In the darkest pits of hell  
The devil hatched an evil plan  
To tempt the fiddle player for  
Hes just a mortal man  
  
The sin of pride the devil  
Cried is what will do you in  
I thought we had this settled  
Im the best theres ever been  
  
Johnny did you ever know  
That time keeps marching on  
The coldest hour is the one  
Comes just before the dawn  
  
The devils back in Georgia  
Will you stand up to the test  
Or will you let the  
Devil be the best  
  
In truth I havent played much  
Since the baby came in June  
But give me half a minute an  
Ill get this fiddle back in tune  
  
The devil grabbed the golden  
Fiddle out of Johnnys hand and said  
Though Im the fiddle player  
Underground and I walk upon the land  
  
Yall just better be just turnin  
Back if you want this boy to win  
Cos practice is the only cure for  
The predicament hes in  
  
Now devil it would be a sin  
For you to get my bow  
You go on back to hell and to  
The wood shed I will go  
  
Johnny are you practicing or  
Will your hands grow cold  
The devil walks the land and  
Plays a fiddle made of gold  
  
Can you hear the babe a crying  
Will he ever know  
The devil wants  
His daddys very soul  
  
Before we play I want to thank you  
For letting Gods own Word ring true  
He said You cant be trusted  
Yes but what you gonna do  
  
Well you get your fiddle devil if  
You think that you can win  
Cos I beat you once you old dog  
And I can whip your butt again  
  
John Browns green the devil is red  
Mamas little baby loves shortnymph bread  
The devils dream is that he can win  
But Johnny is the best thats ever been
