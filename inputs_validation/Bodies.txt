She was a girl from Birmingham  
She just had an abortion  
She was a case of insanity  
Her name was Pauline  
  
She lived in a tree  
She wasnt out when he killed her baby  
She sent the letters from the country  
She was an animal  
  
She was a bloody disgrace  
Bodies Im not an animal Repeat x 2  
Dragged on a table in a factory  
Illegitimate place to be  
  
In a package in a lavatory  
Die little baby screaming  
Bodies Im not an animal  
Im not an animal  
  
Its an abortion  
Bodies Im not an animal  
Mummy Im not an animal

Fuck this and fuck that  
Fuck it all and fuck her fucking brat  
She dont want to baby that looks like that  
I dont want to baby that looks like that  
Bodies Im not an animal Repeat x 3  
  
Mummy Im not an animal

Mummy Im not an animal Repeat x 3
