When the feeling isnt right  
They say you see it in a lovers eye  
But Im wide awake tonight  
N Im looking for a reason why  
It doesnt show  
Still somehow I know  
Tell me that it just aint so  
Say I made the whole thing up  
It must be imagination  
Why cant I forget it  
God youd think Id know better  
It must be imagination  
Gone completely out of my mind  
It must be imagination  
Tearin me apart  
N breakin my heart  
You can say what is real  
You can tell me if Im in a dream  
Cause I know what I feel  
But I dont know what to believe  
Turn on the night light  
Even if it takes us all night  
I gotta be sure by daylight  
If Ive made this whole thing up  
It must be imagination  
Tell me if Im right  
Cause its changing my life  
It must be imagination  
Everybody knows  
There aint no way to fight it  
It must be imagination  
Breakin my heart  
N tearing me apart  
If Im only dreamin  
Then Im cryin in my sleep  
You should be shakin me  
Why aint you wakin me up  
It must be imagination  
God I must be losin my mind  
It must be imagination  
Does anybody know  
Is there anyway to fight it  
It must be imagination  
All in my mind all in my mind  
It must be imagination  
If you wanna go I just got to know  
It must be imagination  
Ooh tell me whats the problem  
Why you wanna go on breakin my heart
