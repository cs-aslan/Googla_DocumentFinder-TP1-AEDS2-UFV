I wish youd known me when I was alive I was a funny feller  
The crowd would hoot and holler for more  
I wore a drunks red nose for applause  
Oh yes I was a comical priest  
With a joke for the flock and a hand up your fleece  
Drooling the drink and the lipstick and greasepaint  
Down the cardboard front of my dirty dogcollar  
  
Chorus  
Now Im dead now Im dead now Im dead  
Now Im dead now Im dead  
And Im going on to meet my reward  
I was scared I was scared I was scared I was scared  
He might of never heard Gods Comic  
  
So there he was on a waterbed  
Drinking a cola of a mystery brand  
Reading an airport novelette listening to Andrew LloydWebbers Requiem  
He said before it had really begun I prefer the one about my son  
Ive been wading through all this unbelievable  
Junk and wondering if I should have given  
The world to the monkeys  
  
Chorus  
  
Im going to take a little trip down Paradises endless shores  
They say that travel broadens the mind til you cant get your head out of
doors  
  
Im sitting here on the top of the world  
I hang around in the longest night  
Until each beast has gone bed and then I say  
God bless and turn out the light  
While you lie in the dark afraid to breathe and you beg and you promise  
And you bargain and you plead  
Sometimes you confuse me with Santa Claus  
Its the big white beard I suppose  
Im going up to the pole where you folks die of cold  
I might be gone for a while if you need me  
  
Now Im dead now Im dead now Im dead  
Now Im dead now Im dead and youre all  
Going on to meet your reward  
  
Are you scared Are you scared Are you scared  
Are you scared  
You might have never heard but Gods comic
