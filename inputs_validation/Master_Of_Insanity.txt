Look all around  
Cant you open your eyes  
Voices are calling  
  
Killing rain falling down from the sky  
Crying with nightmare tears  
  
Out on the street  
Youll see blood on the ground  
Cities are burning  
  
Feeling the pain cutting right to your soul  
Goodbye now  
Youre caught in his spell  
  
Your freedom is gone  
Hes taken everything  
You ever had  
But if youre strong youll survive  
Youve got to hold on  
Open your eyes  
  
Chorus  
Behind the lies you will see  
The master of insanity  
Under the mask there will be  
The master of insanity  
  
Innocent minds  
Theyre the victims of shame  
Staring in sorrow  
  
Promises lying there  
Broken and crushed  
Confusionjust disappear  
  
What can you give  
To be left all alone  
When theres nothing at all  
  
Your freedom is gone  
Hes taken everything  
You ever had  
But if youre strong youll survive  
Youve got to hold on  
Open your eyes  
  
Chorus  
  
Behind the lies you will find  
Hes trying to get inside you  
Just open your eyes and you will see  
The master of insanity  
  
Chorus  
  
Between the lies you will find  
that hes trying to get inside you  
Out of the night into your mind  
Hes always right beside you  
  
Yeah between the lies you will see  
The master of insanity  
Open your eyes or you will be  
The master of insanity
