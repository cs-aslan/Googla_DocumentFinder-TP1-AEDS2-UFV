Cardboard boxes on the floor  
They contain memories and so much more  
Black and white photographs  
Faded now but I remember how we laughed  
  
Theres nothing left for me to do  
Ive an empty house full of you  
  
Pour myself a glass of wine  
Let it breathe but I dont give it too much time  
Take another and set it down  
I kid myself theres nobody else around  
  
Theres nothing left for me to do  
Ive an empty glass full of you  
  
But let me tell you baby  
I cant fight the feeling  
I never stopped believing  
You were coming back to me  
  
I hear footsteps by the door  
Could it be theres nothing else that I want more  
There you stand in front of me  
I see your face my heart has wings you set me free  
  
Theres nothing left for me to do  
Now my empty heart is full of you  
  
But let me tell you baby  
I cant fight the feeling  
I never stopped believing  
You were coming back to me  
Let me tell you darling  
Never did I doubt you  
I cant live without you  
Its so good youre back with me
