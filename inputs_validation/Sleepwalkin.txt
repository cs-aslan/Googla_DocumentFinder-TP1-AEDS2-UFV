Someone sucked me late last evening  
And it was time to make a change  
And I wonder am I too late am I too far a strange  
For what I have been doin for all of these years  
Sleepwalkin sleepwalkin sleeeeeepwalkin  
Sleepwalkin sleepwalkin sleeeeeepwalkin  
I have so few good memories  
Somethings terribly wrong as a singer singing badly  
As he tries to sing the wrong song  
Look what I have been doing all of these years  
Sleepwalkin sleepwalkin sleeeeeepwalkin  
Sleepwalkin sleepwalkin sleeeeeepwalkin  
Something moving in the light  
Something spoke to me and said Go go go go  
Somethings moving in the house show something to show  
For what Ive been doing for all of these years  
Sleepwalkin sleepwalkin sleeeeeepwalkin  
Sleepwalkin sleepwalkin sleeeeeepwalkin  
Someone sucked me late last evening  
And it was time to make a change  
And I wonder am I too late am I too far a strange  
For what I have been doin for all of these years  
Sleepwalkin sleepwalkin sleeeeeepwalkin  
Sleepwalkin sleepwalkin sleeeeeepwalkin  
Sleepwalkin sleepwalkin sleeeeeepwalkin  
Sleepwalkin sleepwalkin sleeeeeepwalkin  
Sleepwalkin sleepwalkin sleeeeeepwalkin  
Sleepwalkin sleepwalkin sleeeeeepwalkin
