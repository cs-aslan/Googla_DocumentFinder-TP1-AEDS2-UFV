Go fly a kite and tie your troubles to the tail  
Theyll be blown away by a merry gale  
Go fly a kite and toss your worries to the wind  
And they wont come back theyll be too chagrined  
Go on make friends with the sky  
Have a talk with the sun  
Its the bright way to live if youll pardon the pun  
Go fly a kite and youll imagine youre a king  
Cause youve got your world on a piece of string
