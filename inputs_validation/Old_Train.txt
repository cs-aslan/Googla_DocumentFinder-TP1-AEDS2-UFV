Old Train I can hear your whistle blow  
And I want to be jumping on again  
Old Train Ive been everywhere you go  
And I know what lies beyond each bend  
  
Old Train each time you pass  
Youre older than the last  
And it seems Im too old for running  
I hear your rusty wheels grate against the rails  
They cry with every mile  
And I think Ill stay awhile  
  
Old Train I grow weary at the miles  
And I miss the freedom that was mine  
Old Train just to think about those times  
Ill smile when youre highballing by  
  
Old Train each time you pass  
Youre older than the last  
And it seems Im too old for running  
I hear your rusty wheels grate against the rails  
They cry with every mile  
And I think Ill stay awhile
