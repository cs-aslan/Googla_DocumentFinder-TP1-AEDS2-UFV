Theres a boy lost his way looking for someone to play  
Theres a girl in the window tears rolling down her face  
Were only lost children trying to find a friend  
Trying to find our way back home  
  
We dont know where to go so Ill just get lost with you  
Well never fall apart cause we fit together right we fit together right  
These dark clouds over me rain down and roll away  
Well never fall apart cause we fit together like  
Two pieces of a broken heart  
  
I know where we could go and never feel let down again  
We could build sandcastles Ill be the queen youll be my king  
Were only lost children trying to find a friend  
Trying to find our way back home  
  
We dont know where to go so Ill just get lost with you  
Well never fall apart cause we fit together right we fit together right  
These dark clouds over me rain down and roll away  
Well never fall apart cause we fit together like  
Two pieces of a broken heart  
  
Now I can lay my head down and fall asleep  
Oh but I dont have to fall asleep to see my dreams  
Cause right there in front of me right there in front of me  
Theres a boy lost his way looking for someone to play  
  
We dont know where to go so Ill just get lost with you  
Well never fall apart cause we fit together right we fit together right  
These dark clouds over me rain down and roll away  
Well never fall apart cause we fit together like  
We fit together like  
Two pieces of a broken heart  
  
Theres a boy lost his way looking for someone to play
