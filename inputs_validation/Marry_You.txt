Its the sugar so sweet  
Kind Id like to meet you at midnight  
And tell no one else about it  
  
Im gonna make you mine  
Cause I know weve got the time  
Now and then baby  
Hey I want you to know  
  
I want to marry you  
Isnt that what you want too  
I want to marry you  
Isnt that what you want too  
  
Come on in the back of the 57  
Let me show you the way the way to heaven  
Youre looking so sweet yes you are  
Im sure that youve got some heat  
  
Ive got you on my mind  
You know youve got my time  
Now and then baby  
Hey I want you to know  
  
I want to marry you  
Isnt that what you want too  
I want to marry you  
Isnt that what you want too  
  
Im falling in love with you  
You make all my dreams come true  
Im falling in love with you  
  
I want to marry you  
Isnt that what you want too  
I want to marry you  
Isnt that what you want too  
  
I want to marry you  
Isnt that what you want too  
I want to marry you  
Isnt that what you want too
