Women be wise keep your mouth shut dont advertise your man  
Dont sit around gossiping explaining what your good man really can do  
Some women nowadays Lord they aint no good  
They will laugh in your face Then try to steal your man from you  
Women be wise keep your mouth shut dont advertise your man  
Your best girlfriend she might be a highbrow she changes clothes 3 times a
day  
What do you think shes doing now while youre so far away  
Shes loving your man in your own damn bed  
You better call for the doctor mama try to investigate your head  
Women be wise keep your mouth shut dont advertise your man  
Women be wise keep your mouth shut dont advertise your man  
Dont sit around girl telling all your secrets  
Telling all those good things he really can do  
If you talk about your baby you tell me hes so fine  
Lord honey I just might sneek up and try to make him mine  
Women be wise keep your mouth shut dont advertise your man  
Dont be no fool dont advertise your man baby dont do it
