Ive got a mule and her name is Sal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
Shes a good old worker and a good old pal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
We hauld some barges in our day  
Filled with lumber coal and hay  
We know every inch of the way  
From Albany to Bufallo  
  
Low bridge evrybody down  
Low bridge were coming to a town  
Youll always know your neighbour  
And youll always know your pal  
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal  
  
Wed better look around for a job old gal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
You can bet your life Ill never part Sal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
  
Get up mule here comes a lock  
Well make Rome bout six oclock  
One more trip and well go  
Right back home to Buffalo  
  
Low bridge evrybody down  
Low bridge were coming to a town  
Youll always know your neighbour  
And youll always know your pal  
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal  
  
Where would I be if I lost my pal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
Id like to see a mule as good as my Sal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
  
A friend of mine once got her sore  
Now hes got a broken jaw  
Cause she let fly with an iron toe  
And kicked him back to Bufallo  
  
Low bridge evrybody down  
Low bridge were coming to a town  
Youll always know your neighbour  
And youll always know your pal  
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal  
  
Low bridge evrybody down  
Low bridge were coming to a town  
Youll always know your neighbour  
And youll always know your pal  
If ya made your livin on the Erie Canal  
  
Low bridge evrybody down  
Low bridge were coming to a town
