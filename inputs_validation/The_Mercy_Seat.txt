It began when they come took me from my home  
And put me in Death Row  
Of which I am nearly wholly innocent you know  
And Ill say it again  
I am not afraid to die  
  
I began to warm and chill  
To objects and their fields  
A ragged cup a twisted mop  
The face of Jesus in my soup  
Those sinister dinner meals  
The meal trolleys wicked wheels  
A hooked bone rising from my food  
All things either good or ungood  
  
And the mercy seat is waiting  
And I think my head is burning  
And in a way Im yearning  
To be done with all this measuring of truth  
An eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth  
And anyway I told the truth  
And Im not afraid to die  
  
Interpret signs and catalogue  
A blackened tooth a scarlet fog  
The walls are bad Black Bottom kind  
They are sick breath at my hind  
They are sick breath at my hind  
They are sick breath at my hind  
They are sick breath gathering at my hind  
  
I hear stories from the chamber  
How Christ was born into a manger  
And like some ragged stranger  
Died upon the cross  
And might I say it seems so fitting in its way  
He was a carpenter by trade  
Or at least thats what Im told  
  
Like my good hand I  
Tattooed EVIL across its brothers fist  
That filthy five They did nothing to challenge or resist  
  
In Heaven His throne is made of gold  
The ark of his Testament is stowed  
A throne from which Im told  
All history does unfold  
Down here its made of wood and wire  
And my body is on fire  
And God is never far away  
  
Into the mercy seat I climb  
My head is shaved my head is wired  
And like a moth that tries  
To enter the bright eye  
I go shuffling out of life  
Just to hide in death awhile  
And anyway I never lied  
  
My killhand is called EVIL  
Wears a wedding band thats GOOD  
Tis a longsuffering shackle  
Collaring all that rebel blood  
  
And the mercy seat is waiting  
And I think my head is burning  
And in a way Im yearning  
To be done with all this measuring of truth  
An eye for an eye  
And a tooth for a tooth  
And anyway I told the truth  
And Im not afraid to die  
  
And the mercy seat is burning  
And I think my head is glowing  
And in a way Im hoping  
To be done with all this weighing up of truth  
An eye for an eye  
And a tooth for a tooth  
And Ive got nothing left to lose  
And Im not afraid to die  
  
And the mercy seat is glowing  
And I think my head is smoking  
And in a way Im hoping  
To be done with all this looks of disbelief  
An eye for an eye  
And a tooth for a tooth  
And anyway there was no proof  
Nor a motive why  
  
And the mercy seat is smoking  
And I think my head is melting  
And in a way Im helping  
To be done with all this twisted of the truth  
A lie for a lie  
And a truth for a truth  
And Ive got nothing left to lose  
And Im not afraid to die  
  
And the mercy seat is melting  
And I think my blood is boiling  
And in a way Im spoiling  
All the fun with all this truth and consequence  
An eye for an eye  
And a truth for a truth  
And anyway I told the truth  
And Im not afraid to die  
  
And the mercy seat is waiting  
And I think my head is burning  
And in a way Im yearning  
To be done with all this measuring of proof  
A life for a life  
And a truth for a truth  
And anyway there was no proof  
But Im not afraid to tell a lie  
  
And the mercy seat is waiting  
And I think my head is burning  
And in a way Im yearning  
To be done with all this measuring of truth  
An eye for an eye  
And a truth for a truth  
And anyway I told the truth  
But Im afraid I told a lie
