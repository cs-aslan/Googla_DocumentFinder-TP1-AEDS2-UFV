Never been very good at the things that I should do better  
And Ive tied very hard just to see if I could forget ya  
But never ever could we get back together  
I doubt it somehow doubt it yes I do  
  
Did you think that I would be so good that it wouldnt matter  
And did you feel at the time that the weight of the time is greater  
Its magic magic everything else has had it  
Its magic magic everything that you do  
Ive had it magic had that magical feeling  
  
Just call me and you know Ill be there  
Dont worry me you know Ill be there  
No matter if its day or night you  
Why worry if I say Ill be there  
  
Did it all looking back at the road maybe lacked some measure  
Could it be could it be you and me wanted just the pleasure my pleasure  
  
But magic magic everything else has had it  
Its magic magic everything that you do  
Ive had it magic had that magical feeling  
  
Just call me and you know Ill be there  
Dont worry me you know Ill be there  
Wont matter if its day or night you  
Why worry if I say Ill be there  
  
Right or wrong its still the same  
Its a winorloseit game  
  
Never been very good at the things that I should do better  
Could it be could it be you and me wanted just the pleasure my pleasure  
  
But magic magic everything else has had it  
Its magic magic everything that you do  
Ive had it magic had that magical feeling  
Magic oh its magic everything else has had it  
Its magic magic everything that you do  
Ive had it magic had that magical feeling  
Magic oh its magic everything else has had it
