Other people come and go  
They try to make it through  
I have to smile and tell them no  
Cause I only care for you  
I only care for you  
Yes you are my sweet sweet Jamaica  
Country mama brown country girl  
When you touch me I I feel so tall  
If you let me down boy Id be so small  
Yes you are my sweet Jamaica  
Country mama brown country girl  
  
Everybody needs a friend  
To brighten up their world  
I know youll never let me down  
Cause youre not that kind of girl no no no  
  
I want to see you round every turn  
Youre my world far as Im concerned  
Got no time to runabout  
Just Want to spend my life out with you only you  
Yes you are my sweet sweet Jamaica  
Country mama brown country girl  
Oh yes you are  
Sweet Jamaica oh brown country girl ooh
