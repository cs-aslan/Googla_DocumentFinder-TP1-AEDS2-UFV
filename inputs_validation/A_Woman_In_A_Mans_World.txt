Its a losing game I play  
In a dog eat dog show biz town  
Ive got a dream of my own  
And I carry my own weight  
But still they try to drag me down  
  
Chorus  
Im a woman in a mans world  
Im a woman in a mans world  
  
So Im fool enough to say  
That a womans place is in the home  
Working twice as hard  
For the same reward as any man yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
For my very own  
Itll make me strong if I dont give in  
Cause the harder the fight  
Oh the sweeter the prize Im sure to win
