May Day  
Cut down to size again  
What then  
When less is more my friend  
Ill change  
Let me start again  
Disguise  
Its too weird to explain  
  
Why Ill  
Always call your name  
Adieu with you  
I could be anything  
That I want to be  
Whirlwind  
Wildfire and driving rain  
Wheels spin  
Bowl me over hurricane  
Whirlwind  
Crack your cheeks and blow  
  
Me Far  
So far  
How far  
Is Shangrila from here  
And is it this way  
There she blows  
Tear me down tornado  
Whirlpool  
Drag me to the deeps below  
Whirlwind  
Will a wildcat strike be tame  
  
Earthquake  
Shake me to my feet again  
Its crosswords go you near  
A fatal clue I fear  
This case is closed  
Elementally my dear  
Beware  
Whirlwind
