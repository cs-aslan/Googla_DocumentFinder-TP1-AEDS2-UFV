Ive been roaming around  
I was looking down at all I see  
Painted faces fill the places I cant reach  
  
You know that I could use somebody yeah  
You know that I could use somebody yeahyeahyeah  
  
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak  
Countless lovers undercover of the streets  
  
You know that I could use somebody yeah  
You know that I could use somebody yeahyeah  
  
Someone like you  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Off in the night while you live it up Im off to sleep  
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat  
  
I hope its going to make you notice  
I hope its going to make you notice  
  
Someone like me
