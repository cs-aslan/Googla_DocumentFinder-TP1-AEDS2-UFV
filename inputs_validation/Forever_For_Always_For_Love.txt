I sing this song  
To remind myself that  
There was a time when I  
Didnt have no one  
Didnt have no love  
Do you remember  
The love that we once had  
Well if I had the chance to love you again  
I would make your heart forget I was ever bad  
If we forgive the past  
I know this time love would last  
Forever for always for love  
  
Im not coming home anymore  
Does it matter  
Well if I had the chance to hold you again  
I would fill your heart with joy  
And make you know that Im the only one for you  
Lets throw the bad memories out  
And make this the first day of our  
Forever for always for love  
  
Id be a fool to ever change  
If she said she loves the way I am  
Id be a fool to ever change  
If she said she loves the way I am  
Its gonna be starting here starting now  
Forever for always for love
