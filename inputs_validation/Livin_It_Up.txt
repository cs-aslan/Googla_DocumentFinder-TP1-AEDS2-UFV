He took one last look  
Tossed that address book  
His odyssey had begun  
No time to see sights  
Ran all the red lights  
Burned all his bridges  
Now its love on the run  
  
Chorus  
Livin it up  
Is takin all of his time  
But he aint givin it up  
It suits his temperament fine  
  
Up on the bandstand plays for a few fans  
Workin for minimum wage  
He sees her lookin his brain is cookin  
She takes her seat of the foot of the stage  
  
Chorus  
Livin it up  
Its takin all of his time  
But he aint givin it up  
It suits his temperament fine  
  
Yeah he loves livin it up  
And takin all of hes time  
But he aint givin it up  
It never crosses his mind  
  
Didnt say much had a soft touch  
Knew what felt good in her man  
He was the same way they split the next day  
Sang all the way through the Yucatan  
  
Chorus  
Livin it up  
Its takin all of our taime  
But we aint givin it up  
It never crosses our mind  
No no no hes just livin it up  
And takin all of his time  
But he aint givin her up  
She suits his temperament fine  
Yeah shes just livin it up  
And takin all of his time
