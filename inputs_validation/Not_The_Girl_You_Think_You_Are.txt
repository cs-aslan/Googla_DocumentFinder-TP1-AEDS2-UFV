Youre not the girl you think you are no no  
Theyre not his shoes under your bed yeah yeah  
Hell take you places in his car  
That you wont forget no  
  
All the people that you know yeah  
Will turn their heads as you go by  
But youll be hard to recognise  
With the top down and the wind blowing blowing  
  
He wont deceive you but tell you the truth  
Woman hell be no trouble  
  
He wont write you letters full of excuses  
Cmon I believe you have one in a million  
  
Youre not the girl you think you are yeah  
Theres someone standing in your place  
The bathroom mirror makes you look tall  
But its all in your head in your head  
  
He wont deceive you hell tell you the truth  
Woman hell be no trouble  
  
He wont write you letters full of excuses  
Cmon I believe you have one in a million  
  
He wont deceive you but tell you the truth  
Cmon I believe you have one  
Youre not the girl you think you are  
Cmon I believe you have one  
Youre not the girl you think you are  
Cmon I believe you have one  
Youre not the girl you think you are
