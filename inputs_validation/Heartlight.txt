I like the love  
And I like the peaceful  
I wish everyone I know could  
Stand in the heartlight  
I hold the hand  
I walk with the teacher  
We welcome in the mornin  
Singing together  
Can you feel the love thats in my heart  
Can you see the flame we got to start  
Burnin like a beacon in the night  
Oh welcome to heartlight  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh welcome to heartlight  
Im like the rain  
Cause I like your thunder  
I know weve learned to live together  
Here in the heartlight  
Stand in the dark  
Oh oh and Ill light a candle  
And then well dance it in the moonlight  
Until the sunrise  
Can you feel the love thats in my heart  
Cant you see the flame weve got to start  
Burnin like a beacon in the night  
Oh welcome to heartlight  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh welcome to heartlight  
Can you feel the love thats in my heart  
Cant you see the flame weve got to start  
Burnin like a beacon in the night  
Oh welcome to heartlight  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Welcome to heartlight  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light  
Oh ooh heart of light
