Where in the world did you go  
Without a clue without a word  
What on earth did I do wrong  
You wont believe how much I hurt  
I cant believe the mess were in  
My sense of humor wearing thin  
Gets away with murder every day  
Cant you hear me wont you make it go away  
  
Enough to taste of bitterness  
Hits me in the face someone elses wish  
Here I lay awake alone  
Just wishing youd come home  
  
You leave me desolate and torn  
Go and fight in someone elses war  
And so you put us both to shame  
Dont come near me  
Dont you make it go away  
  
I cant believe the mess were in  
My sense of humor wearing thin  
No ones getting younger anyway  
Cant you hear me wont you make it go away  
  
I cant believe the mess were in  
My sense of humor wearing thin  
Gets away with murder every other day  
Can you hear me wont you make it go away  
  
Wont you make it go away  
Wont you make it go away
