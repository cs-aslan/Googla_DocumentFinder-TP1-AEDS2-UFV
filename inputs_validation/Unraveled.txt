instrumental intro  
Yes she will be beautiful  
And you will be vain  
When the honeymoon is over  
She will suck out your brain  
Give me back my life  
Give me back my call  
Simply set me free  
Stop banging my head on the wall  
  
Put a black hat on me  
Take out a voodoo bone  
And the scars across my ceiling  
They paint a picture to the great unknown  
Im coming unraveled  
Spinning out of control  
Becoming unstable  
Its taking its toll  
And the lamps keeps sliding  
Across the kitchen floor  
And theres something to remember  
Is this the life of a crosscut saw  
And Im coming unraveled  
Spinning out of control  
Im becoming unstable  
Im still paying the toll  
Great expectations will have a glitch  
Searching for power may kill the bitch  
Theater of pain  
Love or lust in vain  
Unraveled again  
Give me back my life  
Give me back my call  
Simply set me free  
Stop banging my head on the wall  
She will be beautiful  
And you will be vain  
When the honeymoon is over  
She will suck out your brain  
Im coming unraveled  
Spinning out of control  
Im becoming unstable  
And I cant I cant let go  
instrumental  
Coming unraveled  
Spinning out of control  
Becoming unstable  
Nobody nobody knows  
Im coming unraveled  
Spinning out of control  
Becoming unstable  
I cant I cant let go  
instrumental and vocals fade out
