How does it feel to be  
One of the beautiful people  
Now that you know who you are  
What do you want to be  
And have you traveled very far  
Far as the eye can see  
  
How does it feel to be  
One of the beautiful people  
How often have you been there  
Often enough to know  
What did you see when you were there  
Nothing that doesnt show  
  
Baby youre a rich man  
Baby youre a rich man  
Baby youre a rich man too  
You keep all your money in a big brown bag  
Inside a zoo what a thing to do  
Baby youre a rich man  
Baby youre a rich man  
Baby youre a rich man too  
  
How does it feel to be  
One of the beautiful people  
Tuned to a natural E  
Happy to be that way  
Now that youve found another key  
What are you going to play  
  
Baby youre a rich man  
Baby youre a rich man  
Baby youre a rich man too  
You keep all your money in a big brown bag  
Inside a zoo what a thing to do  
Baby youre a rich man  
Baby youre a rich man  
Baby youre a rich man too
