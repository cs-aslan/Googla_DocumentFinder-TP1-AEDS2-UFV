Monday morning nine AM  
I missed my bus I mustve overslept again  
Phoned up work told em I cant go on  
Since she left this house is not a home I know  
  
Shes not coming back  
Shes not coming back  
Shes not coming back  
Shes not coming back  
  
All my friends they keep coming around  
Well they can dress me up but I wont paint the town  
Noone elsell do the things shed do  
All my fun is up because I know this time for sure  
Shes not coming back  
  
Didnt have a reason  
Had to be free  
Told me she was leaving  
  
Shes not coming back to me  
Monday evenings used to be so easy rolling  
Staying home with her  
Now this room is like a prison  
  
Cant go nowhere Im nothing without her  
Shes not coming back  
No shes not coming back  
Oh shes not coming back  no more  
No more no more  
  
Tuesday morning and its not that bad  
Well Im smiling now thinking of all the fun we had  
And if I see her this is what I will say  
Well thanks for asking but as you see Im OK  
Shes not coming back  
  
Didnt have a reason  
Had to be free  
Told me she was leaving  
  
Shes not coming back  
Oh shes not coming back  
No shes not coming back  
No shes not coming back  
No shes not coming back to me  
  
Didnt have a reason  
She wanted to be free  
She told me she was leaving  
She was leaving me
