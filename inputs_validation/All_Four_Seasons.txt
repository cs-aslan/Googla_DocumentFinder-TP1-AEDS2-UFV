With her smile as sweet as a warm wind in summer  
Shes got me flying like a bird in a bright June sky  
And then just when she thinks that Ive got her number  
Brings me down to the ground with her wintry eye  
Thats my baby  
She can be all four seasons in one day  
  
And when the nighttime comes with no interference  
To our warm summer love with all its charms  
But like a thoroughbred horse she can turn on a sixpence  
And I find that Im back in Mistress Winters arms  
Thats my baby  
She can be all four seasons in one day  
  
How will I know  
How can I tell  
Which side of the bed she takes when the day begins  
She can be kind  
She can be cruel  
Shes got me guessing like a game show fool  
  
She can change her mind like she changes her sweaters  
From one minute to the next its hard to tell  
She blows hot and cold just like stormy weather  
Shes my gift from the Lord or a fiend from hell  
Thats my baby  
She can be all four seasons in one day  
  
Watching the weathermans been no good at all  
Winter spring summer Im bound for a fall  
There are no long term predictions for my baby  
She can be all four seasons in one day  
  
How will I know  
How can I tell  
Which side of the bed she takes when the day begins  
She can be kind  
She can be cruel  
Shes got me guessing like a game show fool  
  
If its a sunny day I take my umbrella  
Just in case the raindrops start to fall  
You could say that Im just a cautious fellow  
I dont want to be caught in a sudden squall  
Thats my baby  
She can be all four seasons in one day  
Thats my baby  
She can be all four seasons in one day
