Help me out I need it  
I dont feel like loving you no more  
I dont feel like loving you no more  
  
Help me out I need it  
I dont feel like touching her no more  
Help me out I need it  
I said I dont feel like touching her no more  
Well how did it happen  
I spent two long years in a strange strange land  
Well how did it happen  
Id do anything just to be your man  
  
Youre not going anywhere without me  
These trials dont prepare the air of love  
Youre not telling anyone about me  
And you shake and you bleed while I sing my song  
  
I dont feel like I dont feel like  
I dont feel like loving you  
I dont feel like I dont feel like  
I dont feel like loving you  
  
All the different places  
Ringing out like a shotgun in my head  
All the pretty faces  
Ringing out well I just cant go to bed  
Well how did it happen  
  
I spent two long years in a strange strange land  
Well how did it happen  
Id do anything just to be your man  
Id do anything just to be your man  
  
Youre not going anywhere without me  
These trials dont prepare the air of love  
Youre not telling anyone about me  
And you shake and you bleed while I sing my song  
  
I dont feel like touching you  
I dont feel like touching you  
I dont feel like touching you  
I dont feel like touching you  
You cant tell anyone about me  
  
Youre not going anywhere without me  
Help me out I need it  
You cant tell anyone about me  
Help me out I need it  
  
I dont feel like I dont feel like  
I dont feel like loving you  
I dont feel like I dont feel like  
I dont feel like loving you
