Dearest constellation heaven surroundin you  
Stay there soft and blue  
Virginia Moon Ill wait for you tonight  
Sweetest invitation breaking the day in two  
Feelin like I do Virginia moon Ill wait for you tonight  
  
And now our shades become shadows in your light  
In the morning wind were through and tomorrow rescues you  
I will say goodnight  
  
Secret fascination whisper a quiet tune  
Hear me callin you Virginia moon Ill wait for you tonight  
  
And now our shapes become shadows in your light  
In the morning when were through and tomorrow rescues you  
I will say goodnight  
  
Virginia Moon Ill wait for you tonight  
  
And now our shapes become shadows in your light  
In the morning when were through and tomorrow rescues you  
I will say goodnight  
  
I will say goodnight
