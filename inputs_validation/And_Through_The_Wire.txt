And through the wire I hear your voice  
And through the wire I touch the power  
And through the wire I see your face  
Its through the wire  
  
Friday night youre staying at home I want you  
Im tickling and clicking a metronome I want you  
Prowling the waterholeI wait for the kill I want you  
Pressures buildingoverspill I want you  
  
And through the wire You are secure  
And through the wire We can talk  
And through the wire We can walk  
Its through the wire  
  
Watchmaker steadies his delicate hand I want you  
For barbecue parties on blood red sands I want you  
Caught in the struggle tight on the rod I want you  
Bring out the devil to bring out the god I want you  
  
And through the wire I hear your voice  
And through the wire I touch the power  
And through the wire I see your face  
Its through the wire  
  
Driving round the city rings  
Staring at the shape of things  
I talk in pictures not in words  
Overloaded with everything we said  
be careful where you tread  
Watch the wire  
  
And through the wire You are secure  
And through the wire We can talk  
And through the wire We can walk  
And through the wire Were clinging like leeches  
And through the wire We push out tailormade speeches  
And through the wire We get so strange across the border  
We get so strange across the border
