From rustlers rhapsody soundtrack warner bros 1985  
Ill drink a cold one with you and laugh the night away  
cause I ride hard when Im working and I work hard when I play  
But any misconception oughta stop before it starts  
Ill be leaving in the morning girl  
I break horses not hearts  
  
Ive broken records in the roundup where Ive broke a bone or two  
But I wont ride away tomorrow and leave a broken heart with you  
Tonight cant last forever soon Ill be long gone from these parts  
You wont hate me when its over  
I break horses not hearts  
  
Your smile is so inviting and youre tender to a touch  
And youre walking on the edge cause youre tempting me too much  
When your home is in the saddle boots dont fit beneath the bed  
So when the sun comes up tomorrow Ill be riding on instead  
  
Chorus  
Ive broken records in the roundup      
You wont hate me when its over  
I break horses not hearts  
I break horses not hearts
