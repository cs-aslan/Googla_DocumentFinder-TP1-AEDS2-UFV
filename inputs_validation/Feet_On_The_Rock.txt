Well I wanna talk to you for a minute  
About an old man I met  
He saidBoy you look in trouble  
And I bet your lifes a mess  
He said I used to have the same problem too  
I was way out of control  
You know the only thing that set it right for me  
Was a little good old rock and roll  
Chorus 1  
I put my feet on the rock  
And my name on the roll  
When its called up yonder  
I wont worry bout my soul  
I know my home is waiting  
And its something to behold  
I put my feet on the rock  
And my name on the roll  
Verse 2  
Id never heard the gosple  
Spread like that before  
I guess the message comes in many ways  
Those simple words of wisdom  
Can open heavens door  
So every time I get the chance I say  
Chorus 2  
Come on put your feet on the rock  
And your name on the roll  
When its called up yonder  
You wont worry bout your soul  
You know your home is waiting  
And its something to behold  
So put your feet on the rock  
And your name on the roll  
Repeat
