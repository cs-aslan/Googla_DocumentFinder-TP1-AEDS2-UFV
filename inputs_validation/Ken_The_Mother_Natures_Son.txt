Youve lived on beans and rice  
And fell for Jesus Christ  
And if your pants are nice  
Mother natures son  
Never made sense until you begun  
To play the kids for fun  
  
Maybe start a TV show  
A service in dayglo  
Watch your ethics grow  
  
Mother natures kid  
Just keep the money hid  
As if you never did sell  
  
Mother natures son  
Never made sense until you begun  
To play the kids for fun  
  
Youve never tasted hell  
cause Judas signed you well  
And if the story sells  
  
Mother natures kid  
Just keep the money hid  
As if you never did sell  
  
Mother natures son  
Never made sense until you begun  
To play the kids for fun
