First the high then the low  
Im getting eromantic vertigo  
In the rain then the drought  
Oh thats what loving you is all about  
  
Fly fly into this night  
Oh and rectify my dreams  
I I love you more than life  
Though seldom Im serene  
Feel the cold in the heat  
Im questioning my blind fidelity  
Love is sweet love is tart  
Loving yous a crime when were apart  
  
Fly fly into this night  
Oh and steal my fantasies  
I I love you more than life  
Though seldom Im at peace
