So many people tried to help me on my way  
So little time and theres so much left to say  
Theres no explainin all the things Ive been through  
  
Chorus  
But I finally found my to you  
I finally found my way to you  
  
Now the day is ending and the night begins to fall  
Sometimes I wondered if Id make it back at all  
I gave up everything I had and never knew  
  
Chorus  
  
Remember how we used to hide away  
Wed share the secrets of or souls  
Turned down the lights and dance the night away  
Wed dance the night away  
Wed dance the night away  
Wed dance the night away  
Remember how we used to hide away  
Wed dance the night away  
Wed dance the night away  
And now Ill hold you like I never have before  
Ill let you go just long enough to lock that door  
The words I whisper come so late and over due  
  
Chorus
