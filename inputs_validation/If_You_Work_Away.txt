If you walked away from me today  
I am sure that who you were going to  
Would feel the way as I do  
Baby its you who fills up my life  
  
And if you walked away from me today  
It wouldnt change a thing  
Id still be singin celebration of you  
Baby you do you fill up my life  
  
You my lifetil now  
No ones been able to show me how  
To fill my life like you  
You are the woman who taught me to  
And if you walked away from me today  
Never to retur Until the journey that you made had ended  
I know you planned it just to fill up my life  
You my lifenow I know what it feels like to overflow  
Until my life is through  
All Im here foris here for youjust for you  
Only for you
