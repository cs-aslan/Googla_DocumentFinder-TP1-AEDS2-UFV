Only buy this if youre lonely  
Only listen if youre blue  
If you are married and you are happy  
This song is not to do with you  
  
If youre listening at your work place  
Feeling small amongst the men  
Do not sing this to your workmates  
This song is not to do with them  
But if youre sitting on a barstool  
Wondering what on earth to do  
Dont let them tell you noone cares  
This songs one especially for you  
  
If you are listening on your radio  
Smiling while you drive along  
Tune the band into another  
Because this song is not your song  
  
If youre working as a DJ  
Leave this record in its sleeve  
Cause this ones not for general airplay  
This songs for the day she leaves  
  
If youve bought this and youre sinking  
And I think that you know who  
It matters not the mouth thats singing  
This songs one especially for you  
  
So this goes out to the lonely  
So this goes out to the sad  
And it goes out to the only  
One you felt you ever had  
  
If youre there in total darkness  
With a letter in your hand  
Do not bother with the letter  
lust listen to the band  
  
So only buy this if youre lonely
