I feel so blue after all that weve been through   
You always had it made but still you betrayed   
And I see into your heart and it looks like  
Theres no water in the well  
You tied me down to just one love  
Making out that you were true  
Your fire makes me cry my tears will never dry  
Now theres no doubt in my mind it looks like  
Theres no water in the well  
If you let the river flow oh god just let me know  
Your turn will come and it looks like  
Theres no water in the well
