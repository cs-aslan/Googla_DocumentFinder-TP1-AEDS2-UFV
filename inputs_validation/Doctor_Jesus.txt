You know Ive got so many problems  
And lately Ive been feelin kinda down  
I hear youre the one I should talk to  
I hear youre the best healer around  
  
Chorus  
Doctor Jesus will you help me  
Make me better make me whole  
Doctor Jesus Lord I need you  
To mend my heart and save my soul  
  
Theres so many out there who need you  
Do you think you could work me in  
You see Im in the worst of conditions  
But mostly I just need me a friend  
  
Chorus
