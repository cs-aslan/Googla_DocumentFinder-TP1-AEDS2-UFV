Caroline says  
as she gets up off the floor  
Why is it that you beat me  
it isnt any fun  
  
Caroline says  
as she makes up her eyes  
You ought to learn more about yourself  
think more than just I  
  
But shes not afraid to die  
all her friends call her Alaska  
When she takes speed they laugh and ask her  
  
What is in her mind  
what is in her mind  
  
Caroline says  
as she gets up from the floor  
You can hit me all you want to  
but I dont love you anymore  
  
Caroline says  
while biting her lip  
Life is meant to be more than this  
and this is a bum trip  
  
But shes not afraid to die  
all her friends call her Alaska  
When she takes speed they laugh and ask her  
  
What is in her mind  
what is in her mind  
  
She put her fist through the window pane  
It was such a funny feeling  
  
Its so cold in Alaska  
its so cold in Alaska  
Its so cold in Alaska
