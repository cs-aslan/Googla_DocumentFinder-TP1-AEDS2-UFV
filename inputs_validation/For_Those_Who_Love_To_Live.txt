Up jumped Jack on the railroad track  
Said Ive got to get out of town  
Its been really nice knowing you  
Hope to see you around  
  
Oh the boy he could boogie  
Oh the boy can kick a ball  
But the boy he got hung up  
Smooching in the stalls  
  
Youve got to give a little love  
To those who love to live  
Youve got to take a little hate  
From those who have to wait  
  
Up jumped John putting his trousers on  
Saying Ive got to get out of here  
Hear your lovers footsteps  
Theyre coming to near for me my dear  
  
Oh the boy he could boogie  
Oh the boy can kick a ball  
But the boy he got hung up  
Making love against the wall  
  
Youve got to give a little love  
To those who love to live  
Youve got to take a little hate  
From those who have to wait
