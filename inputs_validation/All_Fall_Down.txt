ZRo  
Its like tears doesnt matter to you its like you laughed at my pain  
Put me in a position to pick up a pistol and Ill blast in the game  
Im going crazy being murdered by the hands of cancer  
Auntie asked if I wanted to die but couldnt understand my answer  
See its fucked up when you loving they dont love you in return  
Fuck around and wait till you get on your feet and slug you till it burn  
Niggas is flies yeah they over rise but I hide in the dark  
Cause where the fuck was these niggas at when I resided in parks  
Bitch I slept on the bench ten feet away from the bullet proof fence  
But at least I aint have to pay no rent  
Im thinking of espree damn near positive that you regret me  
But I pray to God youll never forget me remember me  
I represented for the both of us how could you love me  
And not trust me somewhere hated now theres no more us plus  
Sammy Lee it was a tragedy your boo was found dead  
Heres my shoulder for you my nigga rest your head  
  
Chorus  2x  
This is where they all fall down  
Putting burners to they brain till it bang  
Theres no way for the real to maintain  
This is where they all fall down  
Pay your dues cause you owe  
When its your time Godll give you the go  
  
Den Den  
I sit back and put my thoughts on paper and rhymes  
Tripping on the situations that Im facing in life  
All this shifeness around me but I still prevail  
Get caught some shit we done together and Im making your bail  
Cut your tail while you fall down homie  
Plus Im in the kitchen cooking so your family wont come hold me  
Fuck that phony shit that these fake niggas on  
I get that pony bitch then I get that hustle on  
Staying strong like ammonia as I bleed the block  
Leaving that bitch swollen up like I beat the cops  
Going rock for rock breaking down every zone  
95 hundred woofing where these niggas be strong  
Staying alone to my own with my baby and wife  
Plus Im keeping the bread a nine cause Im guarding my life  
Aint no slipping in my game doing a dance to make it rain  
Put a pistol to your head and ease your pain  
  
Chorus  2x  
  
ZRo  
I feel like I invented pain might go any minute mayn starting a bit of  
robbery  
Homicide and lean on they destiny in an attempt to get the pain  
Constant strain here we go again another day in the life  
If Im blessed can I just get one successful day in my life  
My life is the prime example of a good nigga gon wrong  
And I trust no one plus Im not friendly so leave me alone  
See I dont need a click of yes men when I walk the block  
My retaliation is only when I chalk the block  
I stay in a sweet leaf each time I meditate on how to live  
Nothing but negative everywhere I turn aint no more positive  
Nothing but drama cause drama makes the world go round  
But pretty soon itll make the world go down  
Just get a weapon of situation if you starving then you hungry right now  
I cant wait a whole pay period I need money right now  
So when I bleed the block Im not gon bleed a lot just enough to keep  
The bills paid and enough to keep some fiddles in a pot  
  
Chorus  2x
