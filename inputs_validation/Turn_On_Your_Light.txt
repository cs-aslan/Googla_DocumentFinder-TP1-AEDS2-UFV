Why do I have to wait so long  
Before you come into my life again  
Seems as though forever until  
I can be here by your side till then  
  
I think you feel the same way too  
You know you make my dreams come true  
If youll just turn on your light  
Let me see it shining through the night  
  
When Im far away from here  
Ill hold all the memories so clear  
If I only have the choice  
I would stay so let me hear your voice  
  
I think you feel the same way too  
You know you make my dreams come true  
If youll just turn on your light  
Let me see it shining through the night
