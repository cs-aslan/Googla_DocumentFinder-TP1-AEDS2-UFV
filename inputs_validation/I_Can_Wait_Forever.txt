When you say I miss the things you do  
I just want to get back close again to you  
But for now your voice is near enough  
How I miss you and I miss you love  
And though all the days that pass me by so slow  
all the emptiness inside me flows all around  
and theres no way out  
Im just thinkin so much of you  
There was never any doubt  
  
I can wait forever if you say youll be there too  
I can wait forever if you will  
I know its worth it all to spend my life alone with you  
  
When it looked as though my life was wrong  
You took my love and gave it somewhere to belong  
Ill be here when hope is out of sight  
I just wish that I was next to you tonight  
And oh Ill be reaching for you even though  
Youll be somewhere else my love  
Well go like a bird on its way back home  
I could never let you go  
And I just want you to know  
  
I can wait forever if you say youll be there too  
I can wait forever if you will  
I know its worth it all to spend my life alone with you  
  
Where are you now  
along with the thoughts we share  
Keep them strong somehow  
And you know Ill always be there  
  
I can wait forever if you say youll be there too  
I can wait forever if you will  
I know its worth it all to spend my life alone with you
