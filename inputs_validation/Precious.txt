I like the way you cross the street cause your precious  
Moving through the Cleveland heat how precious  
Taking rides and all the kicks was so precious  
But you know I was shittin bricks cause Im precious  
  
Made me want to made me want to you made me make it  
Oh youre so mean  
  
East 55th and Euclid avenue was real precious  
Hotel sterling coming into view how precious  
Its a pity that you bruised my hip cause Im precious  
You shouldnt let your manners slip youre too precious  
  
Made me want to made me want to you made me make it  
Oh youre so mean  
  
We went around and round and round and round and round the Shoreway  
We was gonna do it do it do it on the pavement  
Oh maybe maybe Im gonna have a baby  
We was a duet oh we do it all night  
  
I was feeling kind of ethereal cause Im precious  
I had my eye on your imperial youre so precious  
Now Howard the duck and Mr Stress both stayed  
Trapped in a world that they never made  
But not me baby Im too precious  
Fuck off  
  
Made me want to made me want to you made me make it  
Oh youre so mean
