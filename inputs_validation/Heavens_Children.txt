United I get tired of speaking  
What if youre a lonely boy  
What if youre broken man  
What if youre just tired of speaking  
  
I live with my heartache you bet that I do  
Im sad and Im shaken Im empty and so blue  
Magical function I gave it all to you  
They say theyll never let you down  
  
United we stand so tall  
They say theyll never let you down  
United we fall  
  
What if youre a lonely boy  
What if youre a broken man  
What if youre just tired of speaking  
What if youre alone at night  
What if were all heavens children  
  
I grew up in darkness my enemies few  
I gave you my life it was easy for you  
No explanation this boy has grown up too  
They say theyll never let you down  
  
United we stand so tall  
They say theyll never let you down  
United we fall  
I believe the world should always be our standing ground  
  
And I believe the world should hold us close  
And spin this great big world around  
Dont be scared at night alone  
And spin this great big world around  
  
What if youre a lonely boy  
What if youre a broken man  
What if youre just tired of speaking  
What if they break hearts for you  
And I will never let go  
What if youre intent is true  
No matter how we control  
What if youre just tired of crying  
I will never let go no matter how we control  
Heavens children  
  
I was young but still I knew  
People were just frightened too  
I would talk they would not hear me  
  
What if youre a lonely boy  
What if youre a broken man  
What if youre just tired of speaking  
  
I have been a lonely boy  
I have been a broken man  
I am here and still Im crying
