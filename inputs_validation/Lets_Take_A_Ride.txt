Hop in the car and go with me  
You dont have to pack everything  
Dont you want to feel the breeze  
And forget everything baby  
  
Hop in the car and go with me  
You dont have to pack everything  
Dont you want to feel the breeze  
And forget everything baby  
  
Got laid off at your job today  
Youve been working at this place for years  
And though you were underpaid  
Mami that place isnt worth your tears  
Oh oh  
  
I know that life is hard on you  
And you cant seem to find out why  
Ill explain just grab your coat girl  
And just join me on this ride  
  
Lets take a ride on the country side  
Lets just get away  
We can spend the night till the morning light  
Lets just get away  
  
Girl youre the best  
You could be  
An angel among society  
But you get crushed  
From what you see  
You try to hard to help and thats enough for me  
Woo  
  
Try to change what you can  
And accept all the things you cannot  
Dont stress yourself baby  
I know you want to fly away from the world  
But for now with the time weve got  
  
Lets take a ride on the country side  
Lets just get away  
We can spend the night till the morning light  
Lets just get away  
  
Lets take a ride on the country side  
Lets just get away  
Lets just get away  
We can spend the night till the morning light  
Lets just get away  
Lets just get away  
  
Maybe if you consider us just riding  
That once you feel like a winner  
No more crying  
And baby I know just what you need  
I know  
To let your hair down so that you feel free yea  
Hair yea yea yea  
  
It hurts me to watch you see it through  
It hurts me baby  
Girl youre so confused  
Lets get away  
And I know what to do  
  
Lets take a ride on the country side  
Lets just get away  
Lets just get away  
Lets go girl  
We can spend the night till the morning light  
Night  
Lets just get away  
Lets just get away  
  
Lets take a ride  
Hop in the car and go with me  
You dont have to pack everything  
Dont you want to feel the breeze  
And forget everything baby  
Lets take a ride  
Hop in the car and go with me  
You dont have to pack everything  
Dont you want to feel the breeze  
And forget everything baby  
  
Lets take a ride  
Lets go girl  
Lets go girl
