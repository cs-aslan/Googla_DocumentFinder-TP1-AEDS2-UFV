Why put this sadness inside of me  
Why be so matteroffact  
Why put this one bit of hope in me  
You sold me out and thats that  
  
I hope that youre having fun with me  
Theres not much left to attack  
I hope that youre nearly done with me  
You sold me out and thats that  
  
All sold out Id never seen  
A mind so tangled a girl so strangled  
All sold out well I felt so green  
It was just like that  
I was put down flat  
I was sold out just like that  
Oh baby  
  
All sold out Id never seen  
A mind so tangled a girl so strangled  
All sold out well I felt so green  
It was just like that  
I was put down flat  
I was sold out just like that  
  
I missed the point of you doing it  
Your mind has just jumped the track  
I took a bit different view of it  
You sold me out and thats that  
  
Hey hey thats that
