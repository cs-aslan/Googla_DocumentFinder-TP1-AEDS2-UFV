I dont know  
I dont know  
The dream was everything  
  
I dont know  
I dont know  
If its all falling down  
I lose connection as they let me down  
  
What you gonna think  
What you gonna do  
What you gonna say  
Are you gonna scream Oh no  
What you gonna think  
What you gonna do  
What you gonna say  
I just dont like this thing at all  
Strange charm  
  
Let the boys out  
Let the boys out  
And let the fun begin  
  
Let the boys out  
Let the boys out  
And let the night come in  
  
We dont like it  
We dont like it  
Were from the factory and weve come to play  
Let the boys out  
  
You push too hard  
You push too hard  
Come closer and talk to me  
  
You push too hard  
You push too hard  
Dyou get the picture now  
  
You wont like it  
You wont like it  
We get impatient as the time runs out  
Let the boys out
