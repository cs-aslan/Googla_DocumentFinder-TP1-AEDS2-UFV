Just say that Im a friend of yours and maybe they wont get wise  
And if they see us together Ill brush the dream from my eyes  
Ill tell my heart it mustnt seem the song of remember when  
  
Just say that Im a friend of yours that you happen to meet again  
Ill tell my heart that it mustnt seem the song of remember when  
Just say that Im a friend of yours that you happen to meet again
