I want to tell you all a story about a Harper valley widowed wife  
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper valley junior high  
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didnt even stop to play  
And she said mom I got a note here from the Harper valley PTA  
  
Well the note said MrsJohnson youre wearing your dresses way too high  
And its reported youve been drinking and runnin around with men and going
wild  
And we dot believe you ought to be a bringing up your little girl this way  
And it was signed by the secretary Harper valley PTA  
  
Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon  
And they were sure surprised when Mrs Johnson wore her miniskirt into the
room  
And as she walked up to the blackboard I still can recall the words she had
to say  
She said Id like to address this meeting of the Harper valley PTA  
  
well theres Bobby Taylor sitting there and seven times hes asked me for a
date  
And Mrs Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever hes away  
And Mr Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town  
And shouldnt widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled
completely down  
  
Well Mr Harper couldnt be here cause he stayed too long at Kellys Bar
again  
And if you smell Shirley Thompsons breath youll find shes had a little nip
of gin  
And then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother Im not fit  
Well this is just a little hatin place and youre all Harper valley
hypocrites  
  
No I wouldnt put you on because it really did it happened just this way  
The day my momma socked it to the Harper valley PTA
