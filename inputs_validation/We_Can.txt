Theyll try to stop the dream were dreamin  
But they cant stop us from believing  
They will fill your head with doubt  
But that wont stop us now  
So let them say we cant do it  
Put up a road block  
Well just run right through it cause  
  
Chorus  
We can do the impossible  
We have the power in our hands  
And we wont stop cause weve got  
To make a difference in this life  
With one voice one heart two hands we can  
  
They say the odds are stacked against us  
But that cant hold us back we will be relentless  
Theres a voice theyre gonna hear  
A voice so loud and clear  
So let them say we cant do it give us a mountain and were gonna move it
cause  
  
Chorus  
  
Were gonna make a change today make a change today  
Because weve got the faith it takes  
To win this race so let them say we cant do it  
Put up a road block  
And well just run right through it cause  
  
Chorus  
  
I can oh I can  
Do the impossible do the impossible  
I have the power in my hands and I wont stop  
Cause Ive got to make a difference in this life  
With my one voice one heart two hands we can
