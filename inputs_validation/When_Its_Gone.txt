I want to stand upon a rock and watch the river flow  
With the blue sky above me and the valley down below  
I want to hold my head up high and listen to the wind  
Cause when its gone it wont be back again  
  
I want to sing the kind of songs that my dad sang to me  
And try to be the man he hoped that I would be  
He said you only get one chance youd better do the best you can  
Cause when its gone it wont be back again  
  
I want to wear my Sunday coat and hold your hand in mine  
And hear you say youll love me until the end of time  
I want to find forever in every moment that we spend  
Cause when its gone it wont be back again  
  
I want to wear my Sunday coat  
And hold your hand in mine  
And hear you say youll love me  
Until the end of time  
  
I want to stand upon a rock like I did when I was young  
And hold you close beside me and watch our children run  
Cause you only get one chance to listen to th wind  
And when its gone it wont be back again  
We only get one chance so listen to the wind  
Cause when its gone it wont be back again
