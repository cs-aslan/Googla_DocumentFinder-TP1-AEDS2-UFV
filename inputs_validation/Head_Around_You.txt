Deep inside your soul theres a hole you dont wanna see  
Every single day what you say makes no sense to me  
Even though I try I cant get my head around you  
  
Somewhere in the night theres a light in front of me  
Heaven up above with the show abandons me  
Even though I try I fall in the river of you  
Youve managed to bring me down too  
  
All youre faking Get Up Get Up Get Up Get Up  
Shows youre aching Get Up Get Up Get Up  
  
Every single day what you say makes no sense to me  
Lettin you inside isnt right dont mess with me  
I never really know whats really going on inside you  
I cant get my head around you  
  
All youre feeling Get Up Get Up Get Up Get Up  
Shows youre breathing Get Up Get Up Get Up  
  
Deep inside your soul theres a hole you dont wanna see  
Covering it up like a cut with the likes of me  
You know Ive really tried I cant do anymore about you  
  
The cuts getting deeper Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh  
The hills getting steeper Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh  
  
I guess Ill never know whats really going on inside you  
I cant get my head around you  
I cant get my head around you  
I cant get my head around you  
I cant get my head around you
