Hey Headmaster whats the matter with you  
Whyre you always so serious why so blue  
All the kids in the school have seen you  
Being patient with the boys who fool you  
When you used to hit them with your ruler  
So independent too  
Hey Headmaster whats the matter with you  
  
Theres a crisis rumored in the school  
The boys have cut their hair short to look cool  
Examination time is drawing near  
Disintegration of the football team  
No one seems to want to play for real  
In classroom club or pool  
Hey Headmaster whatre you gonna do  
  
Theres an invitation in the post  
To a reading party on the coast  
Pack your bags up you old bibliophile  
Get together with your friends who will  
Give you time to think and time to kill  
With independent hosts  
Hey Headmaster arent you gonna go  
Hey Headmaster arent you gonna go
