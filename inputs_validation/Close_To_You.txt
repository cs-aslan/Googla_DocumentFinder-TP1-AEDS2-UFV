Verse 1  
Nothing but a tear thats all for breakfast  
Watching you pretend youre unaffected  
Youre pulling our connections expecting me to let you go  
But I wont  
  
PreChorus  
No you dont need my protection  
But Im in love cant blame me for checking  
I look in your direction hoping that the message goes  
  
Chorus  
Somewhere close to you  
Close to you  
Like so close if they heard you you wouldnt find out  
Just say now Im coming right now to be close to you  
  
Verse 2  
Said you let it go you kept it  
Working hard to perfect it  
Now your fear is reckless and its out of your control  
Would you let it go  
  
PreChorus  
No you dont need my protection  
But Im in love cant blame me for checking  
I look in your direction hoping that the message goes  
  
Chorus  
Somewhere close to you  
Close to you  
Like so close if they heard you you wouldnt find out  
If you let me Id be there by now  
Close to you
