Got no place to go  
But theres a girl waiting for me down in Mexico  
She got a bottle of tequila a bottle of gin  
And if I bring a little music I could fit right in  
  
We got airplane rides  
We got California drowning out the window side  
Weve got big black cars  
And we got stories how we slept with all the  
Movie stars  
  
I may take a holiday in Spain  
Leave my wings behind me  
Drink my worries down the drain  
And fly away to somewhere new  
  
Hop on my choochoo  
Ill be your engine driver in a bunny suit  
If you dress me up in pink and white  
We may be just a little fuzzy bout it later tonight  
  
Shes my angel  
Shes a little better than the one that used to be with me  
Cause she liked to scream at me  
Man its a miracle that shes not living up in a tree  
  
I may take a holiday in Spain  
Leave my wings behind me  
Drive this little girl insane  
And fly away to someone new  
  
Everybodys gone  
They left the television screaming that the radios on  
Someone stole my shoes  
But theres a couple of bananas  
And a bottle of booze  
  
Oh well happy new years baby  
We could probably fix it if we clean it up all day  
Or we could simply pack our bags  
And catch a plane to Barcelona cause this citys a drag  
  
I may take a holiday in Spain  
Leave my wings behind me  
Flush my worries down the drain  
And fly away to somewhere new  
  
Take a holiday in Spain  
Leave my wings behind me  
Drive this little girl insane  
Fly away to someone new  
Fly away to someone new  
Fly away to someone new
