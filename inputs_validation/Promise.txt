Since this is what you wanted  
Then Ill just walk away  
Youll have your time to think of all the things and what you need  
While Im gone and away  
Is this really what you wanted  
Then I will let you go  
Ill be keeping all my fears  
Though Im drowning in my tears  
With a thought  
Of a life without you  
Chorus  
But if someday youll need a friend  
I promise I wont let you down  
Ill be there for you  
Right there beside you  
I promise  
Is this really what you needed  
Then I will say goodbye  
All the memories that weve shared  
Will be running in my head  
Ill be thinking about you  
Just thinking about you  
Repeat Chorus  
Bridge  
Coz if one day things dont feel so right  
I am someone you can call  
If you feel youve no one to turn to Im here  
Coz if this is what you needed  
I wont let you see me cry  
And all my sleepless nights  
Ill be waiting for your call  
Ill be dreaming about you  
Just dreaming about you  
Repeat Chorus 2x
