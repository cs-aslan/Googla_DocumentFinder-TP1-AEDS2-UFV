I once used to think in my innocent youth  
And I once was as innocent as you  
That someone some day might come my way  
And then I should know whats best to do  
And if hed got money and seemed a nice chap  
And his workday shirts were white as snow  
And if he knew how to treat a girl with due respect  
Id have to tell him No  
Thats where you must keep your head screwed on and insist on  
Going slow  
Sure the moon will shine throughout the night  
Sure the boat is on the river tied up tight  
Thats as far as things can go  
Oh you cant lie back you must stay cold at heart  
Oh you must not let your feelings show  
Oh the moment you feel it might start  
Oh then your only answers No  
The first one that came was a man of Kent  
And all that a man ought to be  
The second one owned three ships down at Wopping  
And the third was crazy about me  
And as theyd got money and all seemed nice chaps  
And their workday shirts were white as snow  
And as they knew how to treat a girl with due respect  
Each time I told them No  
Thats when I used to get my head screwed on and I chose to take  
It slow  
Sure the moon could shine throughout the night  
Sure the boat was on the river tied up tight  
Thats as far as things could go  
Oh you cant lie back you must stay cold at heart  
Oh you must not let your feelings show  
Oh the moment you feel it might start  
Oh then your only answers No  
But then one day and the day was blue  
Came a man who didnt ask at all  
And he went and hung his hat on the nail of my little attic  
And what happened I cant recall  
And as hed got no money and was not a nice chap  
And his Sunday shirts were not like snow  
And as hed no idea of treating a girl with due respect  
I could not tell him No  
Thats the day my head was not screwed on and to hell with going  
Slow  
Oh the moon could shine so clear and bright  
Oh the boat kept drifting downstream that night  
That was how it simply had to go  
Oh you cant lie back you must stay cold at heart  
In the end youll have to let your feelings show  
Oh the moment you know it might start  
And theres no time for saying No
