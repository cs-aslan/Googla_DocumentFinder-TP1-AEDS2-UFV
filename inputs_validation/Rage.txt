Lets face the music  I think that its time  
Whats the use when the future looks so unkind  
Life and death  the choice we make  
Revolution  the line in my mind takes  
Win or lose hey what do you say  
Got to change change change change  
Check it out and see  there could be a better lifestyle  
My hopes are big as the sky  
My dreams are wider than wide  
One day well be absolutely crueltyfree  
Rage  
March on unleash the spirit  
Rise above all fear into the light  
Its a world affair  dont waste a minute  
Let the heart decide its time to care  
What is this sad fascination  
To rip off anothers skin  
Shame shame shame  
Fancy people in furcoat  what a pitiful sight  
Leather is dead  its not so nice  
Rage  
March on unleash the spirit  
Rise above all fear into the light  
Its a world affair  dont waste a minute  
Let the heart decide its time to care  
Stop think before you chew  
Dont eat a creature that wont eat you  
Food for everyone  
Lets all eat  its so much fun  
Let that chicken be a cow is not a factory  
Fast food slaughter  a criminal waste  
Weve got to tune ourselves into a new morality  
Make some improvement on the human race  
Rage each time I turn around  
Rage it tears my heart apart  
Rage each time I see the blood  
Hey now sentimental feelings are just not good enough  
March on unleash the spirit  
Rise above all fear its time to care  
March on unleash the spirit  
Rise above all fear into the light  
Its a world affair  dont waste a minute  
Let the heart decide its time to care  
March on unleash the spirit  
Rise above all fear its time to care
