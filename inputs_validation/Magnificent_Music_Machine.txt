Hes got nothing but talent and time on his hands  
He loves his music hangs out with his band  
Hes got bighit ambitions and number one dreams  
Hes a highrollin a magnificent music machine  
He hit town with nothing but his old guitar  
With visions of grandeur and being a star  
He writes them and sings them like youve never seen  
Hes a highrollin a magnificent music machine  
Well sometimes hes dejected and sometimes hes afraid  
But he knows what hes in for til his dues are paid  
Sometimes theyre fat girls and sometimes theyre lean  
Hes a highrollin a magnificent music machine
