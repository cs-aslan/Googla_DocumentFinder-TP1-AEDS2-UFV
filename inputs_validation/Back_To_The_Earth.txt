Whenever my head starts to hurt  
Before it goes from bad to feeling worst  
I turn off my phone I get down low  
And I put my hands in the dirt  
I try to stop the world from moving so fast  
Tryna get a grip on where Im at  
To simplify this daisy life  
And get my feet in the grass  
  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back to work  
  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
  
The only explanation for our rise  
Must be that everybody wants to get it high  
And move on up to a deluxe apartment in the sky  
Well the higher we go the taller we grow  
We lose sight of our land below  
When you can have your place up in outer space  
Cause my home is where my food is grown  
  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back to work  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back to work  
Im going back to the Earth  
  
We are animals  
We are animals  
We are wild  
We are wild  
Starting with emotions at the bottom of the ocean  
Now were swinging from the tops of the trees  
Oh we are animals  
We are animals  
We are wild  
We are wild  
And well truly be forgiven when we start getting back  
To living with the land in harmony  
  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back to work  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back to work  
Im going back to the Earth  
Two more times around  
  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
  
One more time around the World  
  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back to work  
Im going back to the Earth  
Im going back
