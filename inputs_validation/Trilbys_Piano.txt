Your mother loves her brother  
But her brother loves his lover  
And his lover is my cover  
My one and only other  my angel  
  
My angel Trilby  
Who said I will be  
What I should still be  
Genius would fill me  she loves Hymie  
  
Only one Hymie  
No one else on earth could ever blind me  like this  
Or even find me  such bliss  
If you were gone  
Youd still be here  
  
Only one Hymie  
Why cant they see that life excites me  
This boy ignites me  
His family fights me  
But hes still here  
  
Only one Hymie
