Some girls play the game  
They all walk and talk  
And they dress the same  
Nothin new to say  
Dont they realize  
That its so easy to see  
Right though there disguise  
Makes me wonder why  
When the whole worlds turnin left  
Its when Im goin right  
I need someone to let me be  
Just who I am inside  
  
Cause a girl like me  
Is just a lil different from all the rest  
And a girl likes me  
Never settles for second best  
Could it be a boy like you  
That would give me anything  
If I asked him to  
To take all my dreams  
And make them true  
Show me all the reasons that you  
Ought to be with a girl like me  
Just like me  
  
Possibility  
Got me trippin  
Thinkin of what could be  
Between you and me  
Still I need to know  
Should I keep this feelin  
Or let it go  
I cant wait no more  
So nows the time  
To speak your mind  
And show me what you feel  
So tell me if you  
Want to take a chance  
On something real  
  
Cause a girl like me  
Is just a lil different from all the rest  
And a girl likes me  
Never settles for second best  
Could it be a boy like you  
That would give me anything  
If I asked him to  
To take all my dreams  
And make them true  
Show me all the reasons that you  
Ought to be with a girl like me  
Just like me  
  
Mirror mirror on the wall  
Catch me now before I fall  
I wish I may I wish I might  
Find the answer here tonight
