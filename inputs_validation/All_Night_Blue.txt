Youve got a life somewhere without me  
Ive gone on without you  
It hasnt been easy getting used to  
Being lonely and tonight is an all night blue  
And I wonder how you look and who looks at you  
In your nightgown  
I can almost feel your body  
Your warm and loving body when I lay down  
Chorus  
Its an all night blue  
Remembering you  
Its an all night blue  
Wondering whos loving you  all night  
Well it hurts me to see that youre  
Happy without me cause I still need you  
I just drank up my heart  
Set it empty on the table cause I  
Aint got nothing better to do  
Still I wonder how you look and  
Who looks at you every morning  
I can still feel your warm breath  
You kissing me on the chest  
Im just dreaming  
Chorus
