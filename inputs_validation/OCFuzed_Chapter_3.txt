Which contains most violence to the O C Fuzed minds  
With the transitional rhymes  
Thatll bring physiological karma causin drama  
To you and your fuckin baby momma  
It slides like this  
  
Dont test me with your gay attitude  
Cuz nigga I aint feelin it  
Who the fuck do you assume your fuckin wit  
Manifest discovered the GEOareGE  
Bootleg crips and bloods trying to pull me down with gravity  
But what ya dont know is that I be fuckin yall spinal cord  
Out wit the radius frequency  
I hold a 5 0 desert eagle and the homie a double edged samuri sword  
Is what we be strapalin an  
Lame ass gangs is what we be slashalin and clapalin

Makin yo momma give us deep throat  
1 stroke she chokes  
Causin you to suffer a heightened awareness  
Outlaws around the corner writing you in our hit list  
Gomez Assasin obliterating all you bitches wit mad fists  
Handle the basic which need you to face it  
At dark when you be sleepin  
Thats when swoon be creepin  
Tearin off your arm like an alley cat  
Hangin you from the back so take that as a personal fact  
If it werent for fag ass laws  
The silent assasins be fuckin murderin yo foos  
Swoon be readin the 4 20 biblical verse  
Causing havoc on natures earth  
The only ones bringing killin to ya first  
Sparkin the bowl to burn  
50 caskets for you tables are turned  
Gibs burst into pieces  
Charged with WEED  
As a result to your death

So toon later for chapter four  
If your yearning for fuckin more
