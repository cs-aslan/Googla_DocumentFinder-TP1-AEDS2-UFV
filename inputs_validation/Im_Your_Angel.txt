Celine  
No mountains too high for you to climb  
All you have to do is have some climbing faith oh yeah  
No rivers too wide for you to make it across  
All you have to do is believe it when you pray  
  
R Kelly  
And then you will see the morning will come  
And every day will be bright as the sun  
All of your fears cast them on me  
I just want you to see  
  
Both  
1  Ill be your cloud up in the sky  
Ill be your shoulder when you cry  
I hear your voices when you call me  
I am your angel  
  
And when all hope is gone Im here  
No matter how far you are Im near  
It makes no difference who you are  
I am your angel  
Im your angel  
  
R Kelly  
I saw your teardrops and I heard you cry  
All you need is time  
Seek me and you shall find  
You have everything and youre still lonely  
It dont have to be this way  
Let me show you a better day  
  
Celine  
And then you will see the morning will come  
And all of your days will be bright as the sun  
So all of your fears just cast them on me  
How can I make you see  
  
Repeat 1  
  
R  And when its time to face the storm  
Celine Ill be right by your side  
R  Grace will keep us safe and warm  
Celine And I know we will survive  
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near  
R  The end is drawing near  
Celine Dont you dare give up the fight  
R  Oh no  
Celine Just put your trust beyond the skies  
  
Repeat 1 until fade
