As the snow is gently falling hang the mistletoe you said  
A Christmas to remember lay ahead  
Dont forget to mail the packages and the cards there in the hall  
Remember last years tree was just too small  
  
Its time again to pull out all the ornaments the train  
The kitchen towels with Santa the lights and candy cane  
Inside each box of treasure from the Christmas thats gone by  
And each one will remind us how they fly  
  
Please remember please remember  
Please remember please remember  
All the Christmases gone by  
Please remember please remember  
Please remember please remember  
All those Christmases gone by  
  
In the kitchen you make cookies taste the sugar star you said  
The Christmas to remember lay ahead  
Should we put out all the reindeer or just Rudolph standing tall  
It was you who had to have him at the mall  
  
Its time again to pull out all the ornaments the train  
The kitchen towels with Santa the lights and candy cane  
Inside each box of treasure from the Christmas thats gone by  
And each one will remind us how they fly  
  
Please remember please remember  
Please remember please remember  
All the Christmases gone by  
Please remember please remember  
Please remember please remember  
All those Christmases gone by  
  
Oh please remember please remember  
Please remember please remember  
All the Christmases gone by  
Please remember please remember  
Please remember please remember  
All the Christmases gone by
