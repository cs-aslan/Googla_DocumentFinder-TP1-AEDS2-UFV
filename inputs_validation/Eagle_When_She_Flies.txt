Dolly Parton  
  
Shes been there God knows shes been there  
She has seen and done it all  
Shes a woman she know how to  
Dish it out or take it all  
Her hearts as soft as feathers  
Still she weathers stormy skies  
And shes a sparrow when shes broken  
But shes an eagle when she flies  
  
A kaleidoscope of colors  
You can toss her around and round  
You can keep her in you vision  
But youll never keep her down  
Shes a lover shes a mother  
Shes a friend and shes a wife  
And shes a sparrow when shes broken  
But shes an eagle when she flies  
  
Gentle as the sweet magnolia  
Strong as steel her faith and pride  
Shes an everlasting shoulder  
Shes the leaning post of life  
She hurts deep and when she weeps  
Shes just as fragile as a child  
And shes a sparrow when shes broken  
But shes an eagle when she flies  
  
Shes a sparrow when shes broken  
But shes an eagle when she flies  
Oh bless her Lord  
Shes an eagle when she flies
