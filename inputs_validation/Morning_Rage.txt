Something burns inside me man  
Cant explain wont understand  
Anger rage and war crime  
Fear fate and lullabies  
  
I wake up I wake up  
I wake up I wake up  
  
Something burns inside me man  
Wont explain cant understand  
Seeking truth for someones eyes  
Crowded lows and lonely highs  
  
I wake up I wake up  
I wake up I wake up  
  
What was it all about  
Somethings turned me inside out  
So I put myself around  
Cause you pull me in then turn me out  
  
What was it all about  
Somethings turned me inside out  
So I put myself around  
Cause you pull me in then turn me out  
  
Something burns inside me man  
Dont explain wont understand  
Darling please dont walk away  
Frozen hearts dont like to say  
  
I wake up I wake up  
I wake up I wake up  
I wake up I wake up  
I wake up I wake up  
  
What was it all about  
Somethings turned me inside out  
So I put myself around  
Cause you pull me in then turn me out  
  
What was it all about  
Somethings turned me inside out  
So I put myself around  
Cause you pull me in then turn me out  
  
Nothing lasts forever man  
Nothing lasts forever and  
Nothing lasts forever man  
Nothing lasts forever and  
  
I wake up I wake up  
I wake up I wake up  
I wake up I wake up  
I wake up I wake up
