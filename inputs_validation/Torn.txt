I thought I saw a man brought to life  
He was warm he came around like  
He was dignified  
He showed me what it was to cry  
Well you couldnt be that man I adored  
You dont seem to know dont seem to care  
What your heart is for  
No I dont know him anymore  
  
Theres nothin where we used to lie  
Conversation has run dry  
Thats whats going on  
Nothings fine  
  
Im torn  
Im all out of faith  
This is how I feel  
Im cold and Im shamed  
Lying naked on the floor  
Illusion never changed  
Into something real  
Im wide awake  
And I can see the perfect sky is torn  
Youre a little late  
Im already torn  
  
So I guess the fortune tellers right  
I should have seen just what was there  
And not some holy light  
But you crawled beneath my veins  
And now I dont care  
I have no luck  
I dont miss it all that much  
Theres just so many things  
That I cant touch  
  
Im torn  
Im all out of faith  
This is how I feel  
Im cold and Im shamed  
Lying naked on the floor  
Illusion never changed  
Into something real  
Im wide awake  
And I can see the perfect sky is torn  
Youre a little late  
Im already torn  
  
Theres nothing where he used to lie  
My inspiration has run dry  
Thats what is goin on  
Nothins right  
  
Im torn  
Im all out of faith  
This is how I feel  
Im cold and I am shamed  
Lying naked on the floor  
Illusion never changed  
Into something real  
Im wide awake  
And I can see the perfect sky is torn  
Youre a little late  
Im already torn
