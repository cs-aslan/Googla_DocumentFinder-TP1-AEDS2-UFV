Nobody told me  
Every moment without you would seem so long  
I get so lonely  
And the nights have been so cold since youve been gone  
Did I go and make believe the way you touched me  
Was it real or just a game my mind was playing tell me  
  
Chorus  
Was it the flame of love  
Or was it just my imagination  
Was it the flame of love  
Or an act of desperation  
  
Its amazing  
How a love could feel so good then fade away  
And replacing you with someone else is a game my heart wont play  
Cause I know Ill never feel the heat thats in your soul  
But I cant remember how I lost complete control  
Tell me  
  
Chorus  
  
How could I know youd ever go  
Taking my dreams away with you  
You lead me along  
You did me wrong  
I cant go on now baby
