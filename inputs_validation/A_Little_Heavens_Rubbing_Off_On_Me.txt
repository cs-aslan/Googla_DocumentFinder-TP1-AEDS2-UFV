I used to like making love and then gettin up and never havin to explain  
Ive always been free I never could see me dragin no ball and chain  
I like running around and being tied down never was my cup of tea  
But since Ive been holding an angel a little heavens rubbing off on me  
And Im beginning to like just sittin and holding hands  
Looking into her eyes Im thinking bout future plans  
And then I get the feelin that the life that Id been leadin  
Aint all its cracked up to be  
Since Ive been holding an angel a little heavens rubbing off on me  
  
I used like to spend the night sittin on an old barstool  
Drinking wine and killing time with all over those other fools  
But since you took my hand I think I understand it aint the way it out to be  
Since Ive been holding an angel a little heavens rubbing off on me  
And Im beginning to like  
Since Ive been holding an angel a little heavens rubbing off on me
