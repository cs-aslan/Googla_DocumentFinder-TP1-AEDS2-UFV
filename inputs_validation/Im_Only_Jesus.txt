Bobbys got a duster 79  
Bottle of Jack and a fortyfive  
Points it at his head  
And he starts to cry  
To proud to ask me to save his life  
  
Billys in a limo  
On the upper east side  
Playing Russian Roulette  
With the long white line  
His wife gets a call at three am  
Saying billy aint never coming home again  
  
She asks me why  
  
And I said  
I sure wish youd believe  
That everybodys free  
And Ill help you if you ask me to  
I gave every star a name  
The sunshine and the rain  
But I cant decide the road you choose  
Thats up to you  
Im only Jesus  
  
Johnny had a good job  
Rackin it in  
Caviar parties  
With his well to do friends  
Something was missing  
From his perfect little life  
He through in the towel  
And he called me one night  
  
Betty was an orphan  
Like so many kids  
They taught her in school  
That I didnt exist  
She had every reason not to talk to me  
But every night before bed  
She got down on her knees  
Just to tell me hi  
  
And I said  
Im sure glad you believe  
Cause everybodys free  
And Ill help you if you ask me to  
I gave every star a name  
The sun shine and the rain  
But I cant decide the road you choose  
Thats up to you  
Im only Jesus  
  
Hey your all the same to me  
Everybodys free  
And Ill help you if you ask me to  
I gave every star a name  
The sun shine and the rain  
But I cant decide the road you choose  
Thats up to you  
Im only Jesus  
  
Im only Jesus  
Im only Jesus  
  
Gotta have Jesus to see the light  
Gotta have Jesus to hold you tight  
Gotta have Jesus to talk to me  
I gotta have Jesus to set me free
