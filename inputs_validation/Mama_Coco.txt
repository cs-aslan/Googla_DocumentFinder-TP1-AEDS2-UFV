Mama coco hey youre lookin heavy  
Mama coco ho youre lookin good  
Mama coco yes Ive been getting hungry  
  
Mama coco feed me woman food  
I dont have fancy shacks or multicolored cadillacs  
But I have three months of loneliness  
So mama have a drink relax  
Mama mama so glad to have you here  
  
I love you mama coco  
Mama coco such anticipation  
Mama coco mam youre blowin my mind  
Mama coco Im just a male caucasian  
Mama coco Im virgin to your kind  
  
Now dont get paranoid  
I aint a horny little mongoloid  
All I wanna have is a little bit of love and joy  
  
Mama mama so glad to have you here  
I love you mama coco  
Mama mama so glad to have you here  
I love you mama coco
