I met you on somebodys island  
You thought you had known me before  
I brought you a crate of papaya  
They waited all night by your door  
You probably wouldnt remember  
I probably couldnt forget  
Jungle love in the surf in the pouring rain  
Everythings better when wet  
  
Jungle love its drivin me mad  
Its makin me crazy  
Jungle love its drivin me mad  
Its makin me crazy  
  
But lately you live in the jungle  
I never see you alone  
But we need some definite answers  
So I thought I would write you a poem  
The question to everyones answer  
Is usually asked from within  
But the patterns of the rain  
And the truth they contain  
Have written my life on your skin  
  
Jungle love its drivin me mad  
Its makin me crazy  
Jungle love its drivin me mad  
Its makin me crazy  
  
You treat me like I was your ocean  
You swim in my blood when its warm  
My cycles of circular motion  
Protect you and keep you from harm  
You live in a world of illusion  
Where everythings peaches and cream  
We all face a scarlet conclusion  
But we spend our time in a dream  
  
Jungle love its drivin me mad  
Its makin me crazy  
Jungle love its drivin me mad  
Its makin me crazy  
  
Jungle love its drivin me mad  
Its makin me crazy  
Jungle love its drivin me mad  
Its makin me crazy
