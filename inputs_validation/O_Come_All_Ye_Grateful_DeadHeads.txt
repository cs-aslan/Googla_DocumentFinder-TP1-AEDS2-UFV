Oh come all ye Grateful  
Deadheads to the concert  
Oh come Grateful Deadheads  
And camp in the street  
Bring rolling papers  
Dont forget your sleeping bags  
Oh come get us some floor seats  
We followed them for four weeks  
Oh come get us some floor seats  
To see the Lord  
  
Come all ye hippies  
Throwbacks to the 60s  
Paint flowers on your van  
And dont wash your feet  
Wear your bellbottoms  
And your tiedyed tshirts  
Oh come let us adore them  
We quit our day jobs for them  
Oh come let us adore them  
Garcias the Lord
