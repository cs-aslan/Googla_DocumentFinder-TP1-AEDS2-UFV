Ill always love you the same old way  
No matter what may come between  
Just send me a smile  
Once in a lonely while  
Tell me youll wait for me  
  
How can I forget you starry eyes  
You hair when its lit by the moonlit skies  
Just keep that smile in you  
Til I come home to you  
Tell me youll wait for me  
  
Youre the one youre the one  
Whom I love and care so much for  
But now til it ends Ill just wish to be near  
Caressing you dear  
  
Ill always dream of dreams with you  
Those things we meant to say and do  
Keep them a glow  
Someday well make them so  
And tell me youll wait for me  
  
Ill always dream of dreams with you  
Those things we meant to say and do  
Keep them a glow  
Someday well make them so  
Tell me youll wait for me
