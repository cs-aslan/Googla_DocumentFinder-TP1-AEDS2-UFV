Say I dont mind  
What you do to me  
If you waste my time  
Then its meant to be  
I called your number Yes I did  
Like you told me to  
  
Chorus  
Like a puppet on a string  
Im gon dance and Im gon sing  
I will do most anything  
If you promise me da bang bang bang  
  
Dont want to lie  
I just want to do it  
But some other guy Baby  
Has beat me to it  
If youre in love Well  
Were to of a kind Yes we are  
What good is your body baby  
Without your mind Not much  
  
Chorus  
Hit me niggas  
  
So heres the story  
Im here for you  
Without the boring  
Without the cool  
When you try to fake it Baby  
And you want to get through You know what Im talkin about  
  
Chorus  
  
Bang bang bang  
Yeah Ooh
