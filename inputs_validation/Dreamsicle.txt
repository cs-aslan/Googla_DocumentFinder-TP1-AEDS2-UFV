Let me tell you now he sips he quips  
Dreams a lot about sailing ships  
Wants to throw it all away  
Wants to have it back someday  
  
Loves fool Sears tool  
Wants to win that football pool  
Spend it on some real good grass  
Disappearing oh so fast  
  
Tell my story pain and glory guess my occupation  
Free and easy warm and breezy  
Overnight sensation  
  
I got house pets Lear jets  
Tryin to learn about bassinets  
Oh Miss Piggy dance with me  
Let me take you to the sea  
  
Dreamsicle big dill pickle  
High school honeys sure were fickle  
Ill be damned country ham takes me back to Alabama  
  
Wont you tell my story pain and glory guess my occupation  
Free and easy warm and breezy  
Overnight sensation  
  
Let me tell you now he sips he quips  
Dreams a lot about sailing ships  
Ill be damned country ham takes me back to Alabama  
Ill be damned country ham takes me back to Alabama
