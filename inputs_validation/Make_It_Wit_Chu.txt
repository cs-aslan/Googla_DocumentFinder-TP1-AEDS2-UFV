You wanna know if I know why  
I cant say that I do  
Dont understand the you or I  
Or how one becomes two  
I just cant recall what started it off  
Or how to begin again  
I aint here to break ya  
Just see how far it will bend  
Again and again again and again  
  
I wanna make it  
I wanna make it wit chu  
Anytime anywhere  
I wanna make it  
Again and again  
I wanna make it wit chu  
  
Sometimes the same is different  
But mostly its the same  
These mysteries of life  
That just aint my thing  
If I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon Id be untrue  
The only thing I know for sure  
Is what I wont do  
Anytime anywhere and I said  
  
I wanna make it  
Again and again  
I wanna make it wit chu  
Anytime anywhere  
I wanna make it  
Again and again  
I wanna make it wit chu  
I wanna make it  
Anytime anywhere  
I wanna make it wit chu  
Yeah  
I wanna make it  
I wanna make it wit chu  
  
I wanna make it  
Again and again  
I wanna make it wit chu  
I wanna make it  
Anytime anywhere  
I wanna make it wit chu  
I wanna make it  
Again and again  
I wanna make it wit chu  
Again and again and again and again  
I wanna make it
