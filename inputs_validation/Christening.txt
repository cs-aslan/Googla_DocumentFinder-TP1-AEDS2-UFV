Yes yes theres a new world dawning  
Get dressed quit dreaming youre falling  
Take notes and Ill tell you when you got it right  
No no you can leave your attitude  
Youre the only one it seems to matter to Count votes and youll see it in a  
Brand new light  
Why cant you be a man about it  
Let me turn you into someone new  
Im screaming in a fan  
I doubt that any of my words will make it through  
This is your christening  
Find out what you been missing and  
I promise itll make you fell better  
This is your christening  
The audience is listening  
Baby baby were a perfect pairing  
Walk in the room and they cant stop staring  
Ive gotten used to it Ive gotten used to you  
Youll never never land another like me  
I think youre clever please dont try to fight me  
Take notes and Ill tell you when you got it right  
Why cant you be a man about it  
Let me turn you onto something new  
Im screaming in a fan  
I doubt that any of my words will make it through  
This is your christening  
Find out what you been missing and  
I promise itll make you fell better  
This is your christening  
The audience is listening  
This is your christening  
Find out what you been missing and  
I promise itll make you fell better  
This is your christening  
The audience is listening  
Why cant you be a man about it  
Theres a new world dawning  
Were swimming in a painted fountain  
Theres a new world dawning  
This is your christening  
Find out what you been missing and  
I promise itll make you fell better  
This is your christening  
The audience is listening
