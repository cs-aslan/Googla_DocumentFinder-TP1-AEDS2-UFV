Im carrying a torch for you  
Im carrying a torch  
You know how much it costs  
To keep carrying a torch  
  
Flame of love it burens so bright  
That is my desire  
Keep on liftin me liftin me up  
Higher and higher  
  
Youre the keeper of the flame  
Girl you burn so bright  
Baby why dont we reconnect  
Move into the light  
  
Ive been going to and fro on this  
And Im still carrying a torch  
You must know how much its worth  
But Im carrying a torch  
  
Baby youre the keeper of the flame  
And you burn so bright  
Why why why why why why  
Why dont we reconnect  
And move on further into the light  
  
Ive been calling you on the phone  
Cause Im carrying a torch  
I cant do it all on my own  
Cause Im carrying a torch  
  
Im carrying a torch for you baby  
Im carrying a torch  
You know how much its worth  
When Im carrying a torch  
  
Im carrying a torch for you baby  
Im carrying a torch  
You know how much its worth  
When Im carrying a torch
