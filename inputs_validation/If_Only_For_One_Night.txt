Let me hold you tight if only for one night  
Let me keep you near to ease away your fear  
It would be so nice  
If only for one night  
I wont tell a soul  
No one has to know  
If you want to be totally discreet  
Ill be at your side  
If only for one night  
If only for one night  
Your eyes say things I never hear from you  
My knees are shaking too  
But Im willing willing to go through  
I must be crazy  
Standing in this space  
Well Im feeling no disgrace for asking  
Let me take you home  
To keep you safe and warm  
Till the early dawn warms up  
To the sun it would be so nice  
If only for one night
