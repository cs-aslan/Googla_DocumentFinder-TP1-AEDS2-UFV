Ive got a bad disease  
But from my brain is where I bleed  
Insanity it seems  
Has got me by my soul to squeeze  
  
Well all the love from thee  
With all the dying trees I scream  
The angels in my dreams yeah  
Have turned to demons of greed thats mean  
  
Chorus  
Where I go I just dont know  
I got to got to gotta take it slow  
When I find my piece of mind  
Im gonna give you some of my good time  
  
Today love smiled on me  
It took away my pain say please  
All that you had to free  
You gotta let it be oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh so polite indeed  
Well I got everything I need  
Oh make my days a breeze  
And take away my self destruction  
  
Its bitter baby  
And its very sweet  
Im on a rollercoaster  
but Im on my feet  
Take me to the river  
Let me on your shore  
Ill be coming back baby  
Ill be coming back for more  
  
Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone  
Badi bada bazumba crunga cong gone bad  
  
I could not forget  
But I will not endeavor  
Simple pleasures arent as special  
But I wont regret it never  
  
Chorus  
  
Where I go I just dont know  
I might end up somewhere in Mexico  
When I find my piece of mind  
Im gonna keep you for the end of time
