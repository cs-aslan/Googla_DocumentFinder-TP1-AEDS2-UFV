Hey everyday of the week  
Im in a different city  
If I stay too long  
The people try to pull me down  
  
They talk about me like a dog  
Talk about the clothes I wear  
But they dont realize  
Theyre the ones whos square  
  
Yeah and thats why  
You cant hold me down  
I dont want to be tied down  
I gotta move on hey  
  
Stone free do what I please  
Stone free to ride the breeze  
Stone free baby I cant stay  
I got to got to get away  
Yeah turn me loose baby  
  
Listen here baby  
Women here a women there  
Try to keep me in a plastic cage  
But they dont realize  
That its so easy to break break

Sometimes I can feel my heart  
Kinda gettin hot  
Thats when I gotta move  
Before I get caught  
You gotta understand

You cant hold me down  
I dont want to be tied down
