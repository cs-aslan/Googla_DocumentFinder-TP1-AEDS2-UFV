Oh lullaby of birdland  
Thats what I always hear  
When you sigh  
Never in my wordland could there be ways to reveal  
in a phrase how I feel  
  
Have you ever heard two turtle doves  
Bill and coo when they love  
Thats the kind of magic music we make with our lips  
When we kiss  
  
And theres a weepy old willow  
He really knows how to cry  
Thats how Id cry in my pillow  
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye  
  
Lullaby of birdland whisper low  
Kiss me sweet and well go  
Flying high in birdland high in the sky up above  
All because were in love  
  
Lullaby Lullaby  
  
Have you ever heard two turtle doves  
Bill and coo when they love  
Thats the kind of magic music we make with our lips  
When we kiss  
  
And theres a weepy old willow  
He really knows how to cry  
Thats how Id cry in my pillow  
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye  
  
Lullaby of birdland whisper low  
Kiss me sweet and well go  
Flying high in birdland high in the sky up above  
All because were in love
