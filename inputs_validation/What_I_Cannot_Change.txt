I know what makes me comfortable  
And I know what makes me tick  
And I when I need to get my way  
I know how to pour it on thick  
  
Cream and sugar in my coffee  
Right away when I wake  
I face a day and pray to God  
I wont make the same mistakes  
  
Chorus  
All the rest is out of my hands  
I will learn to let go what I cannot change  
I will learn to forgive what I cannot change  
I will learn to love what I cannot change  
But I will change yeah I will change  
Whatever I whatever I can  
  
Yeah I dont know my father  
Or my mother well enough  
It seems like every time we talk  
We cant get passed the little stuff  
The pain is selfinflicted  
I know its not good for me health  
Yeah but its easier to please the world  
Then it is to please myself  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I know I cant care about how everyone else really feels  
I have enough hurt of my own to heal  
  
I will learn to let go what I cannot change  
I will learn to forgive what I cannot change  
I will learn to let go what I cannot change  
I will learn to forgive what I cannot change  
I will learn to love what I cannot change  
But I will change yeah I will change  
Whatever I whatever I can
