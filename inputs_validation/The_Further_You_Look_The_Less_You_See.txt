Many a man has gone away  
Many a man has gone astray  
Searching for the treasures of a love thats true  
Im hoping that my treasure can be you  
Cause I believe I believe  
  
The further you look  
Show love now  
The less you see  
Im hoping youd be the treasure meant for me  
  
Ive seen men carry their hopes from town to town  
Trying to track lost treasures down  
Some find true love before their hopes are gone  
Others lose hope and they have to yes now  move on  
And I can hear them say as they go down  
  
The further you look  
You better know that  
The less you see  
So Im hoping youd be the treasure meant for me  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
Travel traveling on  
Wondering if theyve done something wrong  
Moving on becoming a rover  
But if youll be mine my searching is all over because now  
  
The further you look  
Show love now  
The less you see  
Im hoping youll be the treasure meant for me  
  
And I know I know I know  
The further you look  
the less youre gonna see  
so Im hoping youd be the treasure meant for me  
  
And I believe I believe right now  
The further you look  
the less youre gonna see  
so Im hoping youll be the treasure meant for me
