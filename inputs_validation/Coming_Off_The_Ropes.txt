Im coming off the ropes  
Hes going down  
He thinks Im beat  
Im coming off the ropes yea  
This aint no retreat  
He thinks Im going down  
For sure my head is spinning round  
When I straighten up  
But Im going to knock him off his feet  
Wow suckerpunch  
  
Im coming off the ropes  
Hes going down  
Yes Im coming off the ropes  
  
Im coming off the ropes  
He made me angry now  
I only need to straighten up  
Im going to show him how  
I can hear someone count to ten  
Seems like a lifetime  
But Ill tell you when  
I know Im safe down here  
So till then must have been  
A lucky swing  
Two years ago  
I would have not let him in  
  
Im coming off the ropes  
Hes going down
