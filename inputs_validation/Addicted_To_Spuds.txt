Potato skins potato cakes  
Hash browns and instant flakes  
Baked or boiled or french fried  
Theres no kind you havent tried  
  
You planned a trip to Idaho  
Just to watch potatoes grow  
I understand how you must feel  
I cant deny theyve got appeal  
  
Whoah  
You like them whether they are plain or theyre stuffed oh yeah  
Better face the facts it seems you cant get enough  
You know youre gonna have to face it  
Youre addicted to spuds  
  
Your greasy hands your salty lips  
Looks like you found the chips  
Your belly aches your teeth grind  
Some tator tots would blow your mind  
  
And you dont mind if theyre not cooked  
You need your fix I guess youre hooked  
And late at night you always dream  
Of bacon bits and sour cream  
  
Whoah you like them even if theyre lumpy or tough oh yeah  
Whee Its pretty obvoius to me you cant get enough  
You know youre gonna have to face it  
Youre addicted to spuds

Another case of spud abuse  
What can I say what can I do  
Potato bug has got me too Wahoo

Whee Ive often seen then whipped but they just cant be beat  
Now Im gonna have to face it
