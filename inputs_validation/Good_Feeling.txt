Ive got a good feeling  
Like I know how Im feeling  
Scraping me off the ceiling  
Back to that good feeling  
Now I find it hard living  
Wasting our time giving  
When will we all give in  
Into that good feeling  
Now I got a good feelin  
Like I know how Im feelin  
Scrappin me off the ceiling  
Back to that good feeling  
  
You picked a time a very fine time  
To look at me youd see that I was fine  
Youre happy too just towing on your line  
But youre afraid of what youll find behind  
  
In twenty years from now Ill be the same  
And youll be changing all the letters  
In your maiden name  
Ah youre thikin that were one  
But well never be the same  
  
cause I got a good feeling  
That I know Im not missing  
Anything youre giving  
Isnt worth this good feeling
