The record man saiddont let it go to your headIm gonna make you a star  
If youve got ituse itbut dont abuse itgave me money from an old fruit jar  
To exercise my delightI went out that night and shook the town the way I knew  
How  
So mama please dont worry about meIm nearly famous now  
Six months later Im a cool operatorand I know my way around  
The record man sighedhe really triedbut he couldnt get it off the ground  
But that dont bother me now cause Ive got a friend whos gotta friend who  
Really knows how  
So mama please dont worry about meIm nearly famous now  
Still hanging onstill hanging onhang on  
I met this real live walkingselfstyledselfassuredslow talking bore  
I thought Id play him alonggive him a songto keep the doom dust away from  
My door  
But I didnt do what he wanted me tobut it didnt seem to matter somehow  
So mama please dont worry about meIm nearly famous now  
Still hanging onstill hanging onhang on  
Six months later Im a part time waiterbut that didnt last long  
I stretched and squeezed at words Id never heard to write a song  
And when it finally cameit sounded the same as a tune Id heard before  
Somehow  
But mama please dont worry about meIm nearly famous now  
Still hanging onstill hanging on
