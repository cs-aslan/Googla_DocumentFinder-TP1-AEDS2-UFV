They say Ruby youre like a dream  
Not always what you seem  
And though my heart may break when I awake  
Let it be so  
I only know Ruby its you  
  
They say Ruby youre like a song  
You dont know right from wrong  
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me  
But from the start who stole my heart  
Ruby its you  
I hear your voice and I must come to you  
I have no choice what else can I do  
  
They say Ruby youre like a flame  
Into my life you came  
And though I should beware  
Still I dont care you thrill me so
