Well the battle is already won  
And the race has already been run  
Its been done you just have to claim the victory  
And the future is already made  
The foundation was totally laid  
When he paid the bloody price for you and me  
  
Oh my friend have you heard the story  
What my Jesus has done  
We will share His triumphant glory  
For the battle is already won  
  
When the sign of the end shall appear  
Fill the sky with a message so clear  
All will hear the beloved calling of our Lord  
Every tongue will confess to His Name  
All his children and angels proclaim  
Hes the same for now for now for now and every more  
He dont change  
  
Oh my friend wont you join the chorus  
Singing praise to the son  
From the day that he laid his life down for us  
The battle was already won  
  
Raise your banners high  
Praises fill the sky  
Mountains tremble and fall  
Hallelujah sing glory to the King  
Lord creator of all  
  
Well the battle is already won  
And the race has already be run  
Its all been done you just gotta claim the victory  
And the future is already made  
The foundation was totally laid  
When he paid the ugly bloody price for you and me  
  
Oh my friend have you heard the story  
What my Jesus has done  
Well return in triumphant glory  
For the battle its already won
