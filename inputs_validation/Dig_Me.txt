its here I sit and rust amid this ruin and rancor like tire irons  
toothy grills and car parts before methe acid rain floods my  
floorboard burns my pores and rots my upholstry once I was  
worshipped polished magnificently now I lay in decay by the dirty  
angry bay  
  
Im ready to leave  
I want to get out of here  
Im ready to ride away  
I dont want to die in here  
Im ready to ride  
  
mmy skin is metallic now no longer an elegant powder blue my body  
unhinged and sleeping in the jungle of motor block manifolds and metal  
relics what was deluxe becomes debris I never questioned loyalty  
but this dead end demolishes the dream of an open highway  
  
dig mebut dontbury me
