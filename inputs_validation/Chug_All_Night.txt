You scare me a bit  
But thats all right  
You know when I want you  
Most every night  
  
And Ive been meaning to tell  
You baby that it makes no sense  
Still Im finally convinced  
Yeah yeah  
  
I believe we could chug all night  
I believe we could hug all night  
The band is loose and the groove  
Is right youre so much woman I  
  
Believe we could chug all night  
On the day that I die well  
I just might scream  
If Im alive in the morning  
  
Ill be alive in a dream  
You better listen to me baby  
Cause you know that Im hung on you  
Till Im blind and black and blue  
  
No one else will do  
I do believe we chug all night  
I believe we could hug all night  
The band is loose and the groove is right  
  
Youre so much woman I believe  
We could chug all night  
No woman ever do what you do  
High on a pleasure wheel  
  
No devil ever cast a voodoo  
So long and dark and real  
Were gonna do a little chugging  
Were gonna do a little hugging  
  
The band is loose and the groove is right  
Im wired for sound  
Are you wired for light  
And youre so much woman  
  
I believe we could chug all night  
I said a yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Woo its only midnight baby  
Come on and do it to me
