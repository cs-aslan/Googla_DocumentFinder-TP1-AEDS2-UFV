Car door slams its been a long day at work  
Im out on the freeway and Im wondering if its all worth  
The price that I pay sometimes it doesnt seem fair  
I pull into the drive and youre standing there  
And you look at me  
And give me that comeherebaby smile  
Its all gonna be alright  
You take my hand  
You pull me close and you hold me tight  
  
Chorus  
And its the sweet love that you give to me  
That makes me believe we can make it through anything  
Cause when it all comes down  
And Im feeling like Ill never last  
I just lean on you cause baby  
Youre my better half  
  
They say behind every man is a good woman  
But I think thats a lie  
Cause when it comes to you Id rather have you by my side  
You dont know how much I count you to help me  
When Ive given everything I got and I just feel like giving in  
And you look at me  
And give me that comeherebaby smile  
Its all gonna be alright  
You take my hand  
Yeah you pull me close and you hold me tight  
  
And its the sweet love that you give to me  
That makes me believe we can make it through anything  
Cause when it all comes down  
And Im feeling like Ill never last  
I just lean on you cause baby  
Youre my better half  
  
Well you take my hand  
Yeah you pull me close and I understand  
  
Its the sweet love that you give to me  
That makes me believe that we can make it through anything  
  
Oh baby its the sweet love that you give to me  
That makes me believe we can make it through anything  
Cause when it all comes down  
And Im feeling like Ill never last  
I just lean on you cause baby  
Youre my better half  
  
Oh oh baby youre my better half  
Oh hey baby youre my better half
