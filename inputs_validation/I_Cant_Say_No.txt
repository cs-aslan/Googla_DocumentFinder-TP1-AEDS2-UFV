Here I am there you are  
If you ask me to walk a thousand miles  
Just to be where you are  
I cant say no if you ask me  
If I had a dime its yours as well as mine  
Id keep the penny you know I would  
And gladly give you the nine  
I cant say no if you ask me  
If you told me tonight to get up  
Pack my bags lets go away  
I wouldnt even care what my mommy  
What my daddy might have to say  
Cause I cant say no if you ask me  
No youre too beautiful to be to be  
No you mean everything to me  
No and thats why I thats why I thats why I  
I cant say no if you ask me  
Sometimes I get so angry with him  
I walk around and I pout all day  
And then he kisses me and asks me do I love him  
In a sweet soft sexy kind of way  
I cant say no if he asks me  
Ooh no I cant say no if he asks me  
I cant say no if you ask me  
I cant say no if you ask me  
I cant say no if you ask me
