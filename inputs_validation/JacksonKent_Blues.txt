I was down in Nashville just payin my dues  
Headed for Ohio when I read the news  
Bout the people demonstrating gainst the Presidents views  
Four were shot down by the National Guard troops  
Just like Uncle Sam I put on my fighting shoes  
School shot down cause theres no more to lose  
Now were headed to DC two by twos  
Cause those low down profound killin four blues  
Lookin for my Congressman to make it well known  
But the politicians already wont answer his telephone  
Making in his office while theyre shooting kids down at home  
Worried about the voters but he wont be worried long  
Silent majority still glued to the tube  
Say CIA aint lookin FBI come unglued  
Shot some more in Jackson just to show the world what they can do  
While were marching to DC cause theres too much to do  
Give peace a chance  
Give peace a chance  
Theres no turnin back my friend  
Theres no turnin back  
When the President said that the tear gas is gone  
The armys pulled out leavin blood on the ground  
The streets are empty and the cryings died down  
You can be President if no ones around  
Just like Kow Kow youve heard it before  
Get back gangster dont you open that door  
Space Cowboys back to tell you the score  
Nothing any good is gonna come from a war  
Got those low down profound killin four blues  
Give peace a chance  
Give peace a chance  
Give peace a chance
