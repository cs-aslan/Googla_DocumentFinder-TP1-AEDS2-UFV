1971  
I have watched as the sun went down  
I have crashed as the room spun around  
Now shes gone she cant be found  
And Im down where Ive been before  
Sat and watched as she bolts out the door  
Cant explain why the womans sore  
Its gonna rain some more  
Chorus  
Somebody told me the last word they heard her say was england  
Somebody said that she mentioned the airline and the fare  
Now I wonder ifs shes there  
cause she took every cent of mine  
Paid it all to the pan am line  
Though shes gone I hope shes fine  
Fly love of mine  
Chorus  
Somebody told me the last word they heard her say was england  
Somebody said that she mentioned the airline and the fare  
Now I wonder ifs shes there  
So tallyho  
Jolly good show  
My womans gone to england
