Keep that candle burnin bright mama  
Ill be kind of late tonight mama  
Theres a yellow moon above me mama  
Shinin on the one I love mama  
  
Chorus  
Burn that candle night and day  
Burn that candle honey light our way  
Keep that doorway open wide  
Until we come slowly strollin side by side  
  
While that candles shinin high mama  
Ill be with my sugar pie mama  
Well be comin home you know and mama  
Lookin for that candle glowin mama  
  
Chorus  
  
After we have had the wedding mama  
To that candle well be headin mama  
So before were winin and dinin mama  
Keep that candle light ashinin mama  
  
Chorus x 2
