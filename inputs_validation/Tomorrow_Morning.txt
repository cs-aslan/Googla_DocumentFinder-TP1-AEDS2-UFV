Lonely lost every part of me  
Maybe outstayed my company  
Walking in to sad scenes  
Hold me tight and say goodbye  
Ive seen behind tomorrows sky  
You be my missing alibi  
Bone me over backwards  
Turn around and change my mind  
Cause Ive been thinking  
About our world tonight  
Slowly sinking into my appetite  
Tomorrow morning  
Are you a friend of mine  
I swear youve left me open  
Nowhere to hide this moment  
Overcrowded daydreams  
Were lost or so it seems  
Cause Ive been thinking  
About our world tonight  
Slowly sinking into my appetite  
Tomorrow morning  
Are you a friend of mine  
Cause Ive been thinking  
About our world tonight  
Slowly sinking into my appetite  
Tomorrow morning  
Are you a friend of mine
