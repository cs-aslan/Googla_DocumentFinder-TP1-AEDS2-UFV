Got a pot belly  
Its not too big  
Gets in my way  
When Im driving my rig  
  
Driving this country  
In a big old rig  
Things Ive seen  
Mean a lot  
  
Friend has a pickup  
Drives his kid to school  
Then he takes his wife  
To beauty school  
  
Now shes doin nails  
Gonna get a job  
Got a good teacher  
  
Theres a fork in the road ahead  
I dont which way Im gonna turn  
Theres a fork in the road ahead  
  
About this year  
We salute the troops  
Theyre all still there  
In a fucking war  
Its no good  
Whose idea was that  
  
Ive got hope  
But you cant eat hope  
Im not done  
Not giving up  
Not cashing in  
Too late  
  
Theres a bailout coming but its not for me  
Its for all those creeps watching tickers on TV  
Theres a bailout coming but its not for me  
  
Im a big rock star  
My sales have tanked  
But I still got you  
Thanks

Sounds like shit  
  
Keep on bloggin  
Til the power goes out  
Your batterys dead  
Twist and shout  
  
On the radio  
Those were the days  
Bring em back  
  
Theres a bailout coming but its not for you  
Its for all those creeps hiding what they do  
Theres a bailout coming but its not for you  
Bailout coming but its not for you  
  
Got my flat screen  
Got it repod now  
They picked it up  
Left a hole in the wall  
Last Saturday  
Missed the Raiders game  
  
Theres a bailout coming but its not for you  
Theres a bailout coming but its not for you  
Its for all those creeps hiding what they do
