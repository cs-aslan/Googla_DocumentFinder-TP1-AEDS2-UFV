Nothing will ever be the same  
All of the promises we made seem hollow  
But there are still streets in this town  
Marked with your shadow  
  
So if you see me look surprised  
If you dont then pass me by  
And I may even brush your sleeve  
As you turn to leave  
  
Now its hard to act like strangers  
When we used to be so strong  
Everything is changing  
And most of it is wrong  
What do we know of anything  
Two fools of some renown  
Either side of the same town  
  
Somewhere theres a light  
I can sense it  
Oh though I may fall back again  
Although its a fight  
I know I must remain  
  
Now its hard to keep ignoring  
Someone you recognize  
And if I seem contented  
Its only my disguise  
What do we know of anything  
Two fools of some renown  
Either side of the same town
