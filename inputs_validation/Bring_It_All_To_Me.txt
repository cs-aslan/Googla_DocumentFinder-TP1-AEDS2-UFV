There you are  
Looking as fine as can be  
In your fancy car  
I can see you looking at me  
What you want to do  
Are you just going to sit there and stare Baby talk to me  
Tell me whats on your mind Baby Ohhh  
  
Chorus  
Oh Baby bring it all to me Bring it all  
But i dont need no fancy cars or diamond rings Baby I dont need No  
Oh Baby bring it all to me Bring it all  
Baby your time your love your space your energy ohhh
