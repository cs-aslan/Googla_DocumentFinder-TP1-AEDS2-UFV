Dont worry about a thing  
Cause every little thing gonna be alright  
Singing Dont worry about a thing  
Cause every little thing gonna be alright  
  
Rise up this mornin  
Smiled with the risin sun  
Three little birds  
Pitch by my doorstep  
Singin sweet songs  
Of melodies pure and true  
Saying This is my message to you  
  
Singing Dont worry bout a thing  
Cause every little thing gonna be alright  
Singing Dont worry dont worry bout a thing  
Cause every little thing gonna be alright  
  
Rise up this mornin  
Smile to the risin sun  
Three little birds  
Pitch by my doorstep  
Singin sweet songs  
Of melodies pure and true  
Sayin This is my message to you  
  
Singin Dont worry about a thing worry about a thing oh  
Every little thing gonna be alright Dont worry  
Singin Dont worry about a thing I wont worry  
Cause every little thing gonna be alright  
  
Singin Dont worry about a thing  
Cause every little thing gonna be alright I wont worry  
Singin Dont worry about a thing

Singin Dont worry about a thing oh no
