I had somebodysomebody who loved me  
Someone so good to me  
You were my angel you were my heaven  
But i was too blind to see  
  
I let you slip away i guess i never knew  
I had the world with you   
Id be there still be there in your arms  
If not for my careless heart  
Youd still be loving me  
If not for my careless heart  
Youd still be mine  
I wouldnt have this hurt inside  
I wouldnt have this tears to cry  
If not for my careless heart  
If not for my careless heart  
  
I had my chancesi took advantage  
I took it all too far  
So now youre gone and im all alone  
Alone with my lonely heart  
I let it fall aparti didnt care enough  
I lost your precious love  
Youd be herestill be here in my arms  
  
If not for my careless heart  
Youd still be loving me  
If not for my careless heart  
Youd still be mine  
I wouldnt have this hurt inside  
I wouldnt have this tears to cry  
If not for my careless heart  
If not for my careless heart  
Yous still be mine  
  
Id be loving you id be holding you  
Id be loving you  
If not for my careless heart  
I wouldnt have this hurt inside  
I wouldnt have this tears to cry  
If not for my careless heart  
If not for my careless heart  
  
If not for my careless heart  
Youd still be loving me  
If not for my careless heart  
Youd still be mine  
I wouldnt have this hurt inside  
I wouldnt have this tears to cry  
If not for my careless heart  
If not for my careless heart  
If not for my careless heart  
Youd still be loving me  
Youd be loving me  
Youd still be mine
