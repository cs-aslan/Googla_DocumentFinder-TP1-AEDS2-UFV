Beautiful flyaway  
Somewhere like Holy Days  
Wonder what brought me down to earth  
Havent I always been here  
Lets have another nibble  
Later I think Ill disappear into the bishops mall  
And take a look at what we offer  
DDT poisoning me changing my relativity  
Whats it going to be  
  
Da da da da dda  
Later I think Ill disappear into another room  
And take a look inside the till  
Lovely days human ways journeys that take us to the end  
Ah  
  
Havent we always been here  
Sharing one love and one fear  
Some day youll know that life is really really all about you  
So come and look inside  
Youll be surprised to find  
Later I think Ill disappear into another womb  
And take a look inside the mens room  
Havent I given you everything that I could give  
Where do you live  
Ah  
  
You are the only censor  
If you dont like what I say you have a choice  
You can turn me off  
  
You are the only censor  
If you dont like what I say you have a choice  
You can turn me off
