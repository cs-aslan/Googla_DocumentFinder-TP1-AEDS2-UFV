Walk down that lonesome road  
All by yourself  
Dont turn your head  
Back over your shoulder  
And only stop to rest yourself  
When the silver moon  
Is shining high above the trees  
  
If I had stopped to listen once or twice  
If I had closed my mouth and opened my eyes  
If I had cooled my head and warmed my heart  
Id not be on this road tonight  
  
Carry on  
  
Never mind feeling sorry for yourself  
It doesnt save you from your troubled mind  
  
Walk down that lonesome road  
All by yourself  
Dont turn your head  
Back over your shoulder  
And only stop to rest yourself  
When the silver moon  
Is shining high above the trees
