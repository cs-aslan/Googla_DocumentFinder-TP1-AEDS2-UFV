Im sitting in the supermarket  
On the disposable shelf  
Im kinda like a sandwich  
I kinda need some help  
Most people they pass me up  
Some stop and buy  
But when they take me home  
They never look in my eye  
  
The supermarket shelf is a lie  
I know we saw  
The guy from the record company  
Makes me wanna die  
  
Everybody sells and everybody buys  
People who dont like that get blood in the eye  
Everybody sells and everybody buys  
People who dont like that get blood  
Get blood in the eye  
  
Im proud of the corporate logo  
Written on my box  
It says that Im ok  
For the company stock  
What I am I do not own  
I dont know who does  
Maybe any some institution  
With no flesh flesh or blood  
  
The supermarket shelf is a lie  
I know we saw  
The guy from the record company  
Makes me wanna die  
  
Everybody sells and everybody buys  
People who dont like that get blood in the eye  
Everybody sells and everybody buys  
People who dont like that get blood  
Get blood in the eye  
  
Everybody sells and everybody buys  
Everybody sells and everybody buys  
Everybody sells and everybody buys  
Everybody sells and everybody buys
