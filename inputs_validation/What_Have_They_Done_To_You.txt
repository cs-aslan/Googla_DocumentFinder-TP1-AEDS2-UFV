There must be something out there  
There must be something real  
Well this mysterys a nightmare  
And I dont know what to feel  
Well I heard you had a hell of a time there  
I guess it chilled you down to the bone  
If theres one thing I can tell you  
Itll never leave you less than alone  
  
In spite of everything you told me  
In spite of everything Ive heard  
Theres nothing here that I call holy  
Not a solitary word  
Could you tell me what its like on the outside  
Were you really lost and out of control  
Were you reaching for your freedom  
When the gatekeeper called for the toll  
  
Ohoh what have they done to you  
Where where have you gone  
Ohoh I want to run to you  
In spite of what youre saying  
I still cant let you go  
  
Well they say you witnessed some kind of lefe there  
Was it something real or nothing at all  
Or is your imagination all thats there to catch you  
If you start to fall  
  
Ohoh what have they done to you  
Where where have you gone  
Ohoh I want to run to you  
In spite of what youre saying  
I still cant let you go  
  
Ohoh what have they done to you  
Where where have you gone  
Ohoh I want to run to you  
In spite of what youre saying  
I still cant let you go  
  
What have they done to you
