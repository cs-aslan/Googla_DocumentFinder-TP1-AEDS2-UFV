Its just the sun thats shinin in your eyes  
Its just the moon that is the suns disguise  
Just the sky with clouds a blowin by  
The sun and the moon and the sky and you and I  
  
Its just the rain thats rollin down my cheek  
Its just the wind that makes me hear you speak  
Its just the song that anyone can sing  
The rain and the wind and the song and the love you bring  
  
Its just the world that gonna break your heart  
Its just the past thats tearin us apart  
Its just the time we have so little of  
The world and the past and the time that we fell in love  
  
Its just the sun thats shinin in your eyes  
Its just the moon that is the suns disguise  
Its just the sky with clouds a blowin by  
The sun and the moon and the sky and you and I
