Verse 1  
Look  
Momma hit my phone and said raps no good  
Better than her telling me the checks no good  
Now they wanna act like I do no good  
Funny cause I really did more than I should  
I made a decision last night that I would die for it  
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it  
Cant get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it  
You know 40 wants peace but Im down to cut ties for it  
And I cant sleep these days unless I take one  
If they dont have a story these days theyll make one  
Life is always on man I never get a break from it  
Doesnt matter where I go I can never get away from it  
They give me loyalty and I dont gotta pay for it  
Same way breads gotta break for it  
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now  
And I turn the six upside down its a nine now  
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
