Well I saw fireworks from the freeway  
And behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away  
Cause you were born on the fourth of july freedom ring  
Now something on the surface it stings  
I said something on the surface  
Well it kind of makes me nervous  
Who says that you deserve this  
And what kind of god would serve this  
We will cure this dirty old disease  
Well if youve got the poison Ive got the remedy  
  
The remedy is the experience  
This is a dangerous liaison  
I say the comedy is that its serious  
This is a strange enough new play on words  
I say the tragedy is how youre gonna spend  
The rest of your nights with the light on  
So shine the light on all of your friends  
When it all amounts to nothing in the end  
  
I wont worry my life away  
I wont worry my life away  
  
Well I heard two men talking on the radio  
In a cross fire kind of reality show  
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack  
They were counting down the ways to stab  
The brother in the be right back after this  
The unavoidable kiss where the minty fresh  
Death breath is sure to outlast this catastrophy  
Dance with me because if youve got the poison  
Ive got the remedy  
  
The remedy is the experience  
This is a dangerous liaison  
I say the comedy is that its serious  
This is a strange enough new play on words  
I say the tragedy is how youre gonna spend  
The rest of your nights with the light on  
So shine the light on all of your friends  
When it all amounts to nothing in the end  
  
I wont worry my life away  
I wont worry my life away  
  
When I fall in love I take my time  
Theres no need to hurry when Im making up my mind  
You can turn off the sun but Im still gonna shine and Ill tell you why  
  
Because  
  
The remedy is the experience  
This is a dangerous liaison  
I say the comedy is that its serious  
This is a strange enough new play on words  
I say the tragedy is how youre gonna spend  
The rest of your nights with the light on  
So shine the light on all of your friends  
When it all amounts to nothing in the end  
  
I wont worry my life away  
I wont worry my life away  
I wont and I wont and I wont
