I cant seem to make you mine  
I cant seem to make you mine  
Youre flyin around like a bee  
Hurtin everything you see  
I tried everything I know  
To make you wanna love me so  
The only thing you do  
Is try to put the hurt on me  
  
Cant you see what youre doin to me  
You fill my heart with a misery  
With every breath and step I take  
Im more in love with you  
  
I cant go on like this  
A little bit of love not one kiss  
I gotta have your love everyday  
A love thats real that will stay  
I cant seem to make you mine  
I cant seem to make you mine  
I cant seem to make you mine  
I cant seem to make you mine  
Cant you see what youre doin to me  
You fill my heart with a misery  
With every breath and step I take  
Im more in love with you  
  
I cant seem to make you mine  
I cant seem to make you mine  
Come back baby to me  
In my misery  
I give you love not any day  
Never ever go away  
I cant seem to make you mine  
I cant seem to make you mine
