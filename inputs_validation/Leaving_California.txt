Verse 1  
You got in so late its Sunday morning  
Said that you were leaving letting go of us  
Where did we go wrong  
And now you say youre leaving California  
Gotta head back east and wanna leave tonight  
Pack your things and go  
  
Prehook  
But if you run away  
I wont be alright  
  
Hook  
Even if the sun crashes into us  
I wont let go I wont let go  
And I can be your light stay with me tonight  
I wont let go I wont let go

Pick up all the pieces fight to hold on  
Put them back together do it all for love  
Never let it go

Wipe all of your tears and look you in the eyes  
Baby please dont go  
  
Prehook  
But if you run away  
I wont be alright

Even if the sun crashes into us  
I wont let go I wont let go  
And I can be your light stay with me tonight  
I wont let go I wont let go
