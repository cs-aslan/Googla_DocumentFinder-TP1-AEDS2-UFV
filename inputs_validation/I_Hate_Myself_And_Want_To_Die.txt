Runny nose and runny yolk  
Even if you have a cold still  
You can cough on me again  
I still havent had my fulfill  
  
In the someday whats that sound  
  
Broken heart and broken bones  
Think about some capsules of horse pills  
One more quirky cliched phrase  
Youre the one I wanna refill  
  
In the someday whats that sound  
  
Most people dont realize  
That two large pieces of coral  
Painted brown and attached to his skull  
With common wood screws can make a child look like a deer
