Hawk and sparrow  
Hope and fear  
Rainbow and arrow  
Laughter and tear  
  
I should run for my life  
But i stay still  
I should scream till im sore  
But i dont  
I should lay down my life  
And i will  
But for this  
For this i wont  
  
I feel sorry for those whove lost their compassion  
I feel sorry for those who still can but dont  
I would lay down my life for my child  
But for them  
For them i wont  
  
Hawk and sparrow  
Hope and fear  
Rainbow and arrow  
Laughter and tear  
  
Motema eleli pinzoli ya maura  
Bokabuani ya molino ekobebisa mokili  
Soki po na koboma bato naboyi  
Ngai na kokoka te oh  
  
translation  
My heart is crying tears of sorrow  
When the soul is divided all our worlds are broken  
But if it comes to taking human life i refuse  
Not menot ever  
  
Hawk and sparrow  
Hope and fear  
Rainbow and arrow  
Laughter and tear
