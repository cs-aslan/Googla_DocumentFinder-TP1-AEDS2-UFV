I cried when you left me I nearly died  
You had just been along for the ride  
But now the show is over  
Im glad cause you always made me so sad  
I thought I was going to go mad  
When you just ran for cover  
Now Im going away to be on my own  
And I will forget all the things that youve done  
cause you broke my heart in 17 places  
Shepherds bush was only one  
  
You say you wont walk out on me anymore  
But I remember you said that before  
And you wont get a chance now  
Were through  
So theres one thing Ive gotta do  
Im gonna go out with somebody new  
And find some true romance now  
So dont expect me to be hanging around  
When you get fed up with the other girls in town  
cause you broke my heart in 17 places  
Shepherds bush was only one  
  
Theres no point in us making any more dates  
Why dont you play football with some of your mates  
If I stay in london Ill just want to cry  
So Im leaving baby this is my final goodbye  
this is my final goodbye  
  
Now Im going away to be on my own  
And I will forget all the things that youve done  
cause you broke my heart in 17 places  
Shepherds bush was only one  
You broke my heart in 17 places  
Shepherds bush was only one only one  
Only one only one only one only one  
Only one
