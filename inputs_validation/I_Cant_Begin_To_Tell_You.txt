I cant begin to tell you  
How much you mean to me  
My world would end if ever we were through  
I cant begin to tell you  
  
How happy I would be  
If I could speak my mind like others do  
I make such pretty speeches  
Whenever were apart  
  
But when your near  
The words I choose  
Refuse to leave my heart  
So take the sweetest phrases  
  
The world has ever known  
And make believe  
Ive said them all to you
