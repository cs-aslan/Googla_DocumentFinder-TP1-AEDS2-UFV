Mary Mary where you goin to  
Mary Mary can I go too  
This one thing I will vow ya  
Id rather die than to live without ya  
Mary Mary where you goin to  
  
Mary Mary tell me truly  
What did I do to make you leave me  
Whatever it was I didnt mean to  
You know I never would try and hurt ya  
Mary Mary where you goin to  
  
What more Mary can I do  
To prove my love is truly yours  
Ive done more now than a clearthinkin man would do  
  
Mary Mary its not over  
Where you go I will follow  
Till I win your love again  
And walk beside you  
But until then  
Mary Mary where you goin to  
  
Mary Mary where you goin to  
Mary where you goin to  
Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary where you goin to
