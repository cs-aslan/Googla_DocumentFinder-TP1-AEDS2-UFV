Ridin top the floodway on a Friday night  
The landscapes a fine and natral sight  
Just cruisin slow through the dark of night  
With Precious and Grace evrythings all right  
  
Good God Almighty we was goin down slow  
Yeah if we knew just where we had to go  
Cryin just a flyin down a put out road  
With Precious and Grace in my flathead Ford  
  
So if youre out rollin late some night  
Yeah and you need that supernatural delight Im talkin to you brother  
I know somebodys theys just out of sight  
Get with Precious and Grace they gonna treat you right
