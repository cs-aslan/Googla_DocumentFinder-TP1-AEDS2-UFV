Sonnys out strolling ambling slowly washed in  
Amber street lights a Mexican wind blows in  
Takin a hold of Angelinas hair and her halo  
Motors running muffling the sound of the street talk  
  
A big deals goin down in another hot night  
In a cold town got yourself a hot night in a cold town  
  
Johnnys got spare change in his pocket a ring and a watch  
To hock for a sweet ride a one way ticket hidden in his shoe  
These last few hours he says hell spend with you  
Hes leavin home without a trace no forwarding address  
  
Hell never have to face another hot night in a cold town  
Got yourself a hot night in a cold town  
  
Well the losers and the groovers  
And the corner boys are hangin around  
Runnin in and out of doorways up and down  
The stairways stray dogs headed for the pound  
  
In another hot night in a cold town got you  
Got yourself a hot night in a cold cold town cold town  
Its just another hot night in a cold town  
Such a cold town
