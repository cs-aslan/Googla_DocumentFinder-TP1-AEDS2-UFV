When a spirit is broken  
Why go on  
When theres nothing to say  
And a love just a token  
It was strong  
Now its fading away  
  
Ah but Im free as a bird  
As I walk right out that door  
You have my word  
I wont bother you no more  
Yes Im doing alright  
As I face the lonely night  
  
And our love it was over  
Long ago  
But we just didnt say  
And the years they have fallen  
One by one  
How they drifted away  
  
But now Im free as a bird  
As I walk out that door  
You have my word  
I wont bother you no more  
Yes Im feeling OK  
As I face the brand new day  
As I face the brand new day  
  
You know Im free as a bird  
As I walk right out that door  
You have my word  
I wont bother you no more  
Yes Im doing alright  
As I face the lonely night  
As I face the lonely night  
  
No more sorrows will I find  
Ive got tomorrow on my side  
No more teardrops will I cry  
Left my teardrops way behind  
No more sorrows will I find  
Ive got tomorrow on my side  
No more teardrops will I cry  
Left my teardrops way behind  
No more heartaches bother me  
Dont wear my heartaches on my sleeve  
  
Its gonna be a brand new story  
Whats the use of former glory  
Its better not to do if you cant do right  
Its time to get to celebrating  
After all the years of waiting  
Im gonna have a ball if it takes all night
