Better than words  
But more than a feeling  
Crazy in love  
Dancing on the ceiling  
  
Every time we touch  
Im all shook up  
You make me wanna  
How deep is your love  
God only knows baby  
  
Woo  
I dont know how else to sum it up  
Cause words aint good enough ow  
Theres no way I can explain your love no  
I dont know how else to sum it up  
Cause words aint good enough ow  
I cant explain your love no  
Its better than words  
Better than words  
  
Better than words  
You drive me crazy  
Someone like you  
Always be my baby  
  
Best I ever had  
Hips dont lie

One more night  
Irreplaceable yeah crazy crazy

Cause words aint good enough ow  
Theres no way I can explain your love no  
I dont know how else to sum it up

Everyone tries They try  
To see what it feels like Feels like
