Theres a place Ive been lookin for  
That took me in and out of buildings  
Behind windows walls and doors  
And I thought I found it  
Couple times even settled down  
And Id hang around just long enough  
To find my way back out  
I know now the place that I was trying to reach  
Was you right here in front of me  
  
Chorus  
And I wouldnt change a thing  
Id walk right back through the rain  
Back to every broken heart  
On the day that it was breakin  
And Id relive all the years  
And be thankful for the tears  
Ive cried with every stumbled step  
That led to you and got me here right here  
  
Its amazing what I let my heart go through  
To get me where it got me  
In this moment here with you  
And it passed me by  
God knows how many times  
I was so caught up in holding  
What I never thought Id find  
I know now theres a million roads  
I had to take  
To get me in your arms that way  
  
Chorus  
  
In a love I never thought Id get to get to here  
And if thats the road  
God made me take to be with you  
  
Chorus  
  
And Id relive all the years  
And be thankful for all the tears  
Ive cried with every stumbled step  
That led to you and got me here right here  
Oh baby ohh  
Oh got me here
