I had no advantage over you  
There was troubles and I had em too  
Just cause youre so strung out  
Dont mean it cant work out  
  
Bababanana this aint Havana  
Do you like bananas bababananas  
  
Say youre a victim of society  
You ask them for your mercy  
Just like the cats in the garbage cans  
Whens their time coming man  
  
You better offer some resistance  
You better give up on my insistence  
Things happen overnight  
You dont give up without a fight  
  
Bababanana this aint Havana  
Do you like bananas bababananas  
  
You say youre poor and uneducated  
You aint gotta chance cause youre hated  
Youre on your way to lifes promotion  
You hinder it with emotion  
  
Bababanana this aint Havana  
Do you like bananas bababananas
