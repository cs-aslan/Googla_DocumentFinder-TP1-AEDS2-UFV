I knew from the first night I met you  
Something just wasnt quite right  
Loving like an innocent stranger  
But somethin was just out of sight  
  
How could I know that you abused me  
Fill out some plan of your own  
I couldnt know youd abuse me  
Leave me here hurt and alone  
  
If it wasnt for you Id be happy  
If it wasnt for lies youd be true  
I know that you could be just like you should  
If it wasnt for bad youd be good  
  
I only saw what I wanted to see  
You were a dream in my mind  
Ill never know how you really could be  
It didnt take long for me to find  
  
I guess that its my fault for seeing  
Only what I wanted to see  
I couldnt know you were being  
A player just acting for me  
  
If it wasnt for you Id be happy  
If it wasnt for lies youd be true  
I know you could be just like you should  
If it wasnt for bad youd be good  
  
I knew from the first night I met you  
Something just wasnt quite right  
Loving like an innocent stranger  
But something was just out of sight  
  
If it wasnt for you Id be happy  
If it wasnt for lies youd be true  
I know you could be just like you should  
If it wasnt for bad youd be good  
If it wasnt for bad youd be good
