If you aint reggae for itfunk out  
Noone knocking at your door  
Overpowered by funk Funk out  
  
Combative repetitive  
Dont life just funk you out  
Asinine stupefying  
Can the clone line dry you out  
  
Part of the swarming mass Funk out  
Slugged by the new increase  
Scared of the human bomb  
Overpowered by funk Funk out  
  
Buy dog food  
Rogue elephants  
Tarzan on a ticker tape  
Breakfast serials  
You know you cant escape  
  
Overpowered by funk  
Dont you love our Western ways  
Car crashed by funk  
Dont you love our Western ways  
  
Benny Goodman trial by jury  
A phone boxfull of books  
Dustcarts and sunrise  
Noone gets off the hooks car crashed  
Food for the hungry millions Funk out  
Home for the floating people  
Skin for the napalm victim  
Overdrunk on power  
Funk out  
  
The final game will be solitaire  
Overdrunk on powerfunk out  
  
Picture frame tickets here  
For the graffiti train  
People at home show you care  
Dont try  
Fry me in your shockin chairs  
Funk power over and out  
  
This is a message from Futura  
Dont prophesize the future  
I liven up the culture  
Because Im deadly as a vulture  
I paint on civilization  
Its environmentally wack  
So presenting my attack  
Ill brighten up your shack  
Im down by law  
Thats a fact  
Just give me a wall  
Any building dull or tall  
I spray clandestine night subway  
I cover red purple on top of grey  
Hey no slashing cause it aint the way  
The TA blew forty mil they say  
We thew down by night  
They scrubbed it off by day  
OK tourists
