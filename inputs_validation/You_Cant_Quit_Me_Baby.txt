Its a mistake but who knows  
Followed you home crawled in your window  
This life is a trip when youre psycho in love  
And I know  
  
Followed your friends you were not there  
Slashed and I cut I bled in the sink  
Heard what you said and youre laughing maybe  
Slashed and I cut and I do it for you  
I want you to notice when Im not around  
Wherever you are  
  
Youre solid gold  
Ill see you in hell  
Youre solid gold  
Ill see you in hell  
Youre solid gold  
Ill see you in hell  
Youre solid gold  
Ill see you in hell
