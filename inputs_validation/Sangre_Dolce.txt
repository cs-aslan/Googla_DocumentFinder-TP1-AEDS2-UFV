The soft winds of Buenos Aires  
Once blew into her room  
Now all she can do is kneel and pray  
Sangre dolce  
Sangre dolce  
  
Shes lost in the streets  
Lost in her thoughts  
Shes lost in the smiles of the baby all day  
Shes new in New York dressed up like a doll  
But broken like clay  
Sangre dolce  
Sangre dolce  
  
She cries when underneath the crystal moon  
She hears a sultry Spanish song  
But coming from that neighborhood saloon  
It sounds all wrong  
  
Puts the child in the stroller  
And walks through the park  
What a beautiful baby you have  
The women all say  
Thank you she says pretending its hers  
Her own is so far away  
  
Sangre dolce  
Sangre dolce  
Sangre dolce
