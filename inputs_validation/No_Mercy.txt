You say youre always right and Im wrong  
You tell me I am weak and you are strong  
Always tried so hard  
Now youve gone too far  
Ill give all or nothing now to play my cards  
You pretend its for fun  
In the end when its done  
You might say its a game  
But I will show no mercy  
You talk so much but you dont have a clue  
You lie so much you even think its true  
Now Im in the lead  
Want to see you bleed  
Say goodbye I am forever in control  
You must learn oh so well  
You shall burn in my hell  
You might say its a game  
I will show no mercy  
And now its said and done its all completed  
You think youve won you know you are defeated  
Now its all so clear  
Im your greatest fear  
You have lived a lie be prepared to die  
You must learn oh so well  
You shall burn in my hell  
You might say its a game  
I will show no mercy
