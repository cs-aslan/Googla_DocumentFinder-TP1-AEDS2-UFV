Dragged up raised tough  
Born a mistake  
Learned fast the golden rule  
Never give just take  
Did no favors gave no quarter  
You all know the story bout  
The lambs Broadway slaughter  
  
Turning a new leaf  
Turning a new leaf  
Turning a new leaf  
  
Street wise cats eyes  
Show business smile  
Lookin for todays mark  
On the golden mile  
Book wise movie eyed  
So cool dudes  
Aint gonna do no talking  
When they find out they been used  
  
Turning a new leaf  
Turning a new leaf  
Turning a new leaf  
  
Got to make some time  
Go through the changes  
My whole life needs some rearrangin  
  
Self styled reject  
Ambitious wisher  
Also ran life style  
Guaranteed user like a  
Campaign promise from a three time loser  
Got to make my move soon  
Because beggars cant be choosers  
So Im  
  
Turning a new leaf  
Turning a new leaf  
Turning a new leaf
