I dont know what I want so dont ask me  
Cause Im still trying to figure it out  
Dont know whats down this road  
Im just walking  
Trying to see through the rain coming down  
Even though Im not the only one who feels  
The way I do  
  
Chorus  
Im alone on my own  
And thats all I know  
Ill be strong Ill be wrong  
Oh but life goes on  
Oh Im just a girl  
Trying to find a place in this world  
  
Got the radio on my old blue jeans  
And Im wearing my heart on my sleeve  
Feeling lucky today got the sunshine  
Could you tell me what more do I need  
And tomorrows just a mystery oh yeah  
But thats okay  
  
Chorus  
  
Maybe Im just a girl on a mission  
But Im ready to fly  
  
Im alone on my own  
And thats all I know  
Oh Ill be strong Ill be wrong  
Oh but life goes on  
Oh Im alone on my own  
And thats all I know  
Oh Im just a girl  
Trying to find a place in this world  
  
Oh Im just a girl  
Oh Im just a girl oh oh  
Oh Im just a girl
