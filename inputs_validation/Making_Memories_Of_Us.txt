Im gonna be here for you baby  
Ill be a man of my word  
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard  
I wanna sleep with you forever  
And I wanna die in your arms  
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm  
  
And Im gonna love you like nobody loves you  
And Ill earn your trust making memories of us  
  
I wanna honor your mother  
And I wanna learn from your pa  
I wanna steal your attention like a bad outlaw  
I wanna stand out in a crowd for you  
A man among men  
I wanna make your world better than its ever been  
  
And Im gonna love you like nobody loves you  
And Ill earn your trust making memories of us  
  
Well follow the rainbow  
Wherever the four winds blow  
And therell be a new day  
Comin your way  
  
Im gonna be here for you from now on  
This you know somehow  
Youve been stretched to the limits but its alright now  
And Im gonna make you a promise  
If theres life after this  
Im gonna be there to meet you with a warm wet kiss  
  
And Im gonna love you like nobody loves you  
And Ill earn your trust making memories of us  
Im gonna love you like nobody loves you  
And Ill win your trust making memories of us
