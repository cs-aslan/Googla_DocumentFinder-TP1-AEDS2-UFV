How lucky can one guy be  
I kissed her and she kissed me  
Like the fella once said  
Aint that a kick in the head  
The room was completely black  
I hugged her and she hugged back  
Like the sailor said quote  
Aint that a hole in the boat  
  
My head keeps spinnin  
I go to sleep and keep grinnin  
If this is just the beginnin  
my life is gonna be beeyooteeful  
  
Ive sunshine enough to spread  
its just like the fella said  
Tell me quick aint love a kick in the head  
  
Like the fella once said

My head keeps spinnin  
I go to sleep and keep grinnin  
If this is just the beginnin  
my life is gonna be beeyooteeful  
  
Shes tellin me well be wed  
shes picked out a kingsize bed  
I couldnt feel any better or Id be sick  
Tell me quick oh aint love a kick  
Tell me quick aint love a kick in the head
