Hold a light  
Friend of mine  
Sing a song  
Soldier on  
  
Shine a light  
For me tonight  
Dont be long  
Soldier on  
  
Whose to say  
That you were right  
And I was wrong  
Soldier on  
  
Come the day  
Come the night  
Ill be gone  
Soldier on  
  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on
