Im more than just an option

Refuse to be forgotten

And I feel it taking over  
  
I better find your lovin  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin  
I better find your heart  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothings gonna tear us apart  
  
Im more than just a number  
hey hey hey  
I doubt youll find another  
hey hey hey  
So every single summer  
hey hey hey  
Ill be the one that you remember  
  
I better find your lovin  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin

And get what you been missing

Too many times Ive been wrong  
I guess being right takes too long  
Im done waiting theres nothing left to do  
But give all I have to you and  
I better find your lovin  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothings gonna tear us apart  
  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothings gonna tear us apart
