Im needing a better resistance  
Shading either side  
I really wish I could reset rewind  
Someone has clawed out my eyes  
Cant identify  
I really wish I could reset rewind  
You know its never the way we planned it  
I really wish we could reset rewind  
  
Im planning a revolution inside my head  
Im planning a revolution when I prevail  
I call for annihilation  
Describe the sunlight so I can feel its burn  
If only I could give up with this plan  
  
I dont know what they told you  
But this place is not what you think  
Reset Rewind  
  
Living inside a hole they put me underground  
Where they can never find me unless they dig me out  
  
I search for the answers cause this is the end  
I search for the answers  
  
God Its caving in on me  
I feel it watching  
But no one seems to care anymore  
Empty I think of a way out  
Cause when I breathe in theres no relief  
  
I cant believe this I cant believe this  
My mind is starting to turn on me  
  
Ive been living inside a hole they kept me underground  
Where they can never find me unless they dig me out  
Ive been living inside a hole  
Where they can never find me unless they dig me out
