No one told me about her  
The way she lied  
Well no one told me about her  
How many people cried  
  
Well its too late to say youre sorry  
How would I know why should I care  
Please dont bother trying to find her  
Shes not there oh oh oh  
  
Nobody told me about her  
What could I do  
Well nobody told me about her  
Though they all knew  
  
Well its too late to say youre sorry  
How would I know why should I care  
Please dont bother trying to find her  
Shes not there  
  
Well let me tell you about the way she looked  
The way she acted the color of her hair  
Her voice is soft and cool  
Her eyes are clear and bright  
But shes not there
