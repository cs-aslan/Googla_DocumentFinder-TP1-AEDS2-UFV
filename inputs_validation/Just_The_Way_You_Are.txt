Oh her eyes her eyes  
Make the stars look like theyre not shining  
Her hair her hair  
Falls perfectly without her trying  
  
Shes so beautiful  
And I tell her every day

When I compliment her  
She wont believe me

Sad to think she dont see what I see  
But every time she asks me do I look okay  
I say  
  
When I see your face face  
Theres not a thing that I would change  
Cause girl youre amazing amazing  
Just the way you are  
And when you smile smile  
The whole world stops and stares for awhile  
Cause girl youre amazing amazing  
Just the way you are

I could kiss them all day if shed let me  
Her laugh her laugh

Shes so beautiful  
And I tell her everyday
