Brother brother brother  
No matter whos right and who is wrong  
Just want you to know my loves still strong  
I wrote you a prayer with this song  
  
Brothrt older brother  
You told me you broke up with your wife  
Theres been so much suffering in your life  
Thanks to the grace from above your humbled heart is alive  
  
Oh I pray for you cause some day  
All loved ones die  
Yes I pray that were rejoined in the afterlife  
  
Brother brother brother  
Your baby boy has hes mothers eyes  
With the love of you both hell be strong and wise  
Once his muscles are grown youll be running side by side  
  
Brother younger brother you and your fiancee are one  
Im sure the fruits of your love will be passed on  
To the beautiful children still to come  
  
Oh I pray for you cause someday  
All loved ones die  
Yes Ill pray that were rejoined in the afterlife  
  
Father father father  
Oh I love you with all my heart  
Youve done an amazing part  
All the angels will come when youre ready to depart  
  
Sisters all my sisters  
I didnt forget you dont get me wrong  
Ill express my love for each single one  
In the future to come exclusive song  
  
But in the mean time
