Guns that cross the street  
You never know who you might meet  
Whos in disguise  
Ooh as you blow a storm  
Theres no one there to keep you warm  
Its no surprise theres something in my eyes  
  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
And dreams are made of emotion  
  
Dance with the counterfeit  
The plastic smiles and micro heat  
Ill meet you there Ill meet you there  
Run to the edge of town  
Where Hollywood lay its footprints down  
Monroe was there but do you really care  
  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
And dreams are made of emotion  
  
Cry its a miracle  
Cry its a miracle  
Cry its a miracle  
Cry its a miracle  
  
Guns that cross the street  
You never know who you might meet  
Whos in disguise whos in disguise  
Ooh as you blow a storm  
Theres no one there to keep you warm  
Its no surprise theres something in my eyes  
  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
Its a miracle  
And dreams are made of emotion
