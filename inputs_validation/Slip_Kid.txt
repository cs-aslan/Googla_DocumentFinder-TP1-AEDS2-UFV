One two three four five six seven eight   
  
Ive got my clipboard text books  
Lead me to the station  
Yeah Im off to the civil war  
Ive got my kit bag my heavy boots  
Im runnin in the rain  
Gonna run till my feet are raw  
  
Slip kid slip kid second generation  
And Im a soldier at thirteen  
Slip kid slip kid realization  
Theres no easy way to be free  
No easy way to be free  
  
Its a hard hard world  
  
I left my doctors prescription bungalow behind me  
I left the door ajar  
I left my vacuum flask  
Full of hot tea and sugar  
Left the keys right in my car  
  
Slip kid slip kid second generation  
Only half way up the tree  
Slip kid slip kid Im a relation  
Im a soldier at sixtythree  
No easy way to be free  
  
Slip kid slip kid  
  
Keep away old man you wont fool me  
You and your history wont rule me  
You might have been a fighter but admit you failed  
Im not affected by your blackmail  
You wont blackmail me  
  
Ive got my clipboard text books
