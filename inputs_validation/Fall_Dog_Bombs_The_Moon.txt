Hope little girl  
Come blow me away  
I dont care much  
I win anyway  
Just a dog  
  
Im God damn rich  
An exploding man  
When I talk in the night  
Theres oil on my hands  
What a dog  
  
Fall dog is cruel and smart  
Smart time breaks the heart  
Fall dog bombs the moon  
  
Devil in a market place  
Devil in your bleeding face  
Fall dog bombs the moon  
What a dog  
  
Theres always a moron  
Someone to hate  
A corporate tie  
A wig and a date  
Just a dog  
  
These blackest of years  
That have no sound  
No shape no depth  
No underground  
What a dog  
  
Fall dog is cruel and smart  
Smart time breaks the heart  
Fall dog bombs the moon  
  
A devil in a market place  
A devil in your bleeding face  
Fall dog bombs the moon  
What a dog
