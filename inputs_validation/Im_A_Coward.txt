I aint afraid of no lions  
I aint afraid of no grizzly bear  
I got in a wrestlin match with old king kong  
He didnt even muss my hair  
Theres just one thing in the whole wide world  
That make me doubt my stuff  
  
Im a coward when it comes to love  
  
Now bring down old hulk hogan  
King kong bundy too  
Bring down old big mike tyson  
Ill show them what a real man can do  
They say the tougher get goin  
Now baby thats when the goin get tough  
  
But Im a coward when it comes to love  
Im a coward when it comes to love  
Im a coward when it comes to love  
  
You can bring on a different sexy girl  
At every night of the week  
Buddy thats okay  
But I start tremblin my knees get weak  
Whenever I hear her say  
do you love me baby   
do you love me baby   
do you love me baby   
  
I got a muscle of iron  
I got another muscle made of steel  
But when we start kissin n huggin  
You may be the bravest man in the whole wide world  
But buddy that aint enough  
  
Im a coward when it comes to love  
Im a coward when it comes to love  
Im a coward when it comes to love
