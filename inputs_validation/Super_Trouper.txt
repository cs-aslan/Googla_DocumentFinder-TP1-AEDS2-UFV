I was a young man when I died  
I was a flash I was full of pride  
I gave it all I gave my soul I was so strong  
I felt the truth I felt the pain in every song  
  
How well you know me  
Youve seen me cry  
Im just a shadow  
In a rock and roll sky  
  
I was living in a rock and roll sky  
I was a king heavy on the style  
Super trouper yes I know you well making me shine  
I couldnt see what you did to me  
I was so blind  
  
How well you know me  
Youve seen me cry  
Im just a shadow  
In a rock and roll sky  
  
I wanna be like I was before  
But this time Im gonna know the score  
I need a home I can leave behind knowing youre there  
Super trouper I can see you now return your stare  
  
How well you know me  
Youve seen me cry  
Im just a shadow  
In a rock and roll sky
