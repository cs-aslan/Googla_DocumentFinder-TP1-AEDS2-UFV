Who will rise   
It would be so nice to hear you say  
Thank you for the good times  
Before the good times fly away  
Your eyes  
Are telling lies  
Some of the stories on the way  
But its so nice  
But dont let the good times fly away  
  
I drink to every sucker standing here  
Among the few who try and cheat the years  
Theres always one of us whos blown away  
Or strapped and stopped for breath along the way

I drink to every sucker standing here  
Among the few who try and cheat the years  
Theres always one of us whos blown away  
Or stopped and strapped for cash along the way  
  
Who will rise  
It would be so nice to hear you say  
Thank you for the good times  
Before the good times fly away
