A trap to fall  
Fall into easy  
Believe in what you look like outside  
A stain you cant remove  
A stain that keeps you from that place  
Where youre probably have much left to prove  
Come down dont fall over your ego  
Dont mind your friends  
They just want to go where the fun goes down  
Yeah you want to go up upup up  
Hip hip hooray for you  
Now your the one that everyone talks about  
The attention your not getting it makes you so upset  
So take me down  
To the place where you can look your best  
Better than anyone else around  
A stain you cant remove  
A stain that keeps you from that place  
Where youve probably have much less to prove  
Once you tried  
Once you tried  
Tried to get it right  
But you couldnt figure out what it takes  
To be liked  
Youre grown up  
And now youve gone back  
To find a way to get along its just an act  
You can wipe that smile  
Now youre the one that everyone talks about  
Take time take it easy  
I know you work so hard  
But your advantage is your beauty  
And thats beautiful  
Take time take it easy  
I know you work so hard  
But you know what your advantage is  
And thats beautiful  
And thats beautiful  
And thats beauty
