Back in 1899 when everyone was singing auld lang syne  
A century took a long long time for every boy and girl  
Now theres only one thing that Id like to know  
Where did the 20th century go  
Id swear it was here just a minute ago  
All over this world  
  
Chorus  
And now the 20th century is almost over  
Almost over almost over  
The 20th century is almost over  
All over this world  
All over this world all over this world  
The 20th century is almost over all over this world  
  
Does anyone remember the great depression  
I read all about it in true confession  
Im sorry I was late for the recording session  
But somebody put me on hold  
Has anybody seen my linoleum floors  
Petroleum jelly and two world wars  
They got stuck in the revolving doors  
All over this world  
And now  
  
The winters getting colder summers getting hotter  
Wishin wells wishin for another drop of water  
And mother earths blushin cause somebody caught her  
Makin love to the man in the moon  
Tell me how you gonna keep em down on the farm  
Now that outer space has lost its charm  
Somebody set off a burglar alarm  
And not a moment too soon  
Because  
  
Old father time has got his toes a tappin  
Standing in the window grumblin and a rappin  
Everybodys waiting for something to happen  
Tell me if it happens to you  
The judgment day is getting nearer  
There it is in the rear view mirror  
If you duck down I could see a little clearer  
All over this world  
And now
