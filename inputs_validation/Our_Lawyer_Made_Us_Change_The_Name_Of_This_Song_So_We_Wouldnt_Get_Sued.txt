Brothers and sisters put this record down  
Take my advice cause we are bad news  
We will leave you high and dry  
Its not worth the hearing youll lose  
  
Its just past 8 and Im feeling young and reckless  
The ribbon on my wrist says Do not open before Christmas  
  
Were only liars but were the best were the best  
Were only good for the latest trends  
Were only good cause you can have almost famous friends  
Besides weve got such good fashion sense  
  
Brothers and sisters yeah put these words down  
Into your notebook spit lines like these  
Were friends when youre on your knees  
Make them dance like we were shooting their feet  
  
Its just past 8 and Im feeling young and reckless  
The ribbon on my wrist says Do not open before Christmas  
  
Were only liars but were the best were the best  
Were only good for the latest trends  
Were only good cause you can have almost famous friends  
Besides weve got such good fashion sense  
  
Were only liars but were the best  
Were only good for the latest trends  
  
Were only liars but were the best  
Were only good for the latest trends  
Were only good cause you can have almost famous friends  
Besides weve got such good fashion sense
