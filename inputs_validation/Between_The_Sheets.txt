Laying next to me  
Sharing our love between the sheets  
  
Oh baby I feel your love surrounding me  
Oh baby making love between the sheets  
  
Oh girl let me hold you tight  
And you know Ill make you feel alright  
Oh baby girl just cling to me and let your mind be free  
While making love between the sheets  
  
Oh girl I love you all night long  
And I know you felt it coming on  
Oh darling just taste my world  
Oh you taste so sweet  
Sharing our love between the sheets  
  
Oh baby I feel your love surrounding me  
Oh baby making love between the sheets
