When I was a kid I had a rocking horse  
Rocking to and fro high and low  
Where wed go no oned know  
  
Thousands of tin soldiers were at my command  
Dressed in red dressed in blue  
Each command always followed through  
  
But now its not that way at all  
No its not that way at all  
  
Now Ive changed and I have aged  
Left here with just memories  
How I wish to be young again  
  
But its not that way at all  
No its not that way at all  
  
No its not that way at all  
No its not that way at all  
No its not that way at all  
No its not that way at all  
  
When I was a kid I had a rocking horse  
Rocking to and fro high and low  
Where wed go no oned know  
  
But its not that way at all  
No its not that way at all
