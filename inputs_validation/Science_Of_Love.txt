Chemistry look what youve done to me  
Chemistry brought me near gravity  
Chemistry look what youve done to me  
  
Youve called me up  
My heart is pounding  
Cant bear to breath  
Ive Just got over you  
  
What do you want  
You like a broken record  
Spinnin in my head  
Why cant you let me be  
  
I dont understand  
What it is about you  
The more you reject me  
The more I want from you  
  
Youre always on my mind  
Always have been always will be  
I think about you all the time  
I dont want to youre a habit  
  
And Im running and running and  
Running and running away from you  
Every time when you call  
I come undone cant escape from you  
  
Is it the science of Love  
Is it the science of Love  
Its the science of Love  
Its the science of Love  
  
Im thinking to fight it  
To get away from you  
Something always pulled me  
Right back to you  
  
I dont understand  
What it is about you  
The more you reject me  
The more I want from you  
  
Youre always on my mind  
Always have been always will be  
I think about you all the time  
I dont want to youre a habit  
  
And Im running and running  
and running and running away from you  
Every time when you call  
I come undone cant escape from you  
  
Is it the science of Love  
Is it the science of Love  
I wanna be with you but Im so afraid  
My hearts not ready cause Im still in pain  
Im feeling my love is out of control  
I wanna give up but I cant let go  
  
Youre always on my mind  
Always have been always will be  
I think about you all the time  
I dont want to youre a habit  
  
And Im running and running and  
Running and running away from you  
Every time when you call I come undone cant escape from you  
Is it the science of Love  
Is it the science of Love  
Its the science of Love  
Its the science of Love  
Love is Science
