Everybody chokes  
When they see someone cut down in their prime  
It may not show when you look at me  
But I know Im in mine  
Im potent baby Im potent  
Dangerous to the naked eye  
Rest your head on this bed of mothers pride  
And find out why  
  
Dont you want to take me home  
Dont you want to take me home  
  
Chorus  
Give me a sense of purpose  
A real sense of purpose now  
Give me a sense of purpose  
A real sense of purpose now  
  
Bully boys dont bother me  
I purse my lips and they run away  
Guys like you who are gentle and true  
Dont come around here everyday  
Im potent baby Im potent  
Just one swig of me would get most guys smashed  
But a drop of yours makes me stagger and swerve  
I guess Im outclassed  
  
Everybody chokes  
When they see someone cut down in their prime  
Take this plea to your heart  
Lift me in mine  
  
Dont you want to take me home  
Dont you want to take me home  
  
Chorus x 2
