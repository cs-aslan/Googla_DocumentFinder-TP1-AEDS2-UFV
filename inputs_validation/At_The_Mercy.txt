At the mercy at the mercy  
At the mercy of a busy road  
Who can handle such a heavy load  
  
At the mercy At the mercy  
At the mercy of a busy day  
We can think of nothing more to say  
  
If you show me love I wont refuse  
I know youd never make me choose  
Between the love Ive got and the love Id lose  
  
Sometimes Id rather run and hide  
Then stay and face the fear inside  
  
At the mercy at the mercy  
At the mercy of a busy day  
Who can bear to turn their head away  
  
At the mercy at the mercy  
At the mercy of a busy road  
We can watch the universe explode  
  
If you take me up I wont say no  
I guess youd rather see me grow  
Into a better man than the one you know  
  
Sometimes my head is hanging low  
Its time to get on with the show  
  
At the mercy at the mercy  
At the mercy of a busy day  
I can think of nothing more to say
