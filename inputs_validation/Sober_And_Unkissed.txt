Like a new winters coat  
Im wearing your last embrace  
Like a cold quenching glass of water  
I hold a clear picture of your face  
  
When are you coming around  
Oh when are you coming around  
Cause soon Ill be cold and thirsty  
  
Im hearing your last telephone call  
Ringing louder and clearer than  
The rest  
I hear your invitation to see it all  
Better written I am smitten no  
Protest  
  
So when are you coming around  
Oh when are you coming around  
Cause soon Ill be bored and lonely  
  
Im tasting the last glass of your wine  
The sweet taste linger left on lips  
Im tasting your sweet kisses with mine  
The sweet taste lingers left on lips  
  
So when are you coming around  
Oh when are you coming around  
Cause soon Ill be sober and unkissed
