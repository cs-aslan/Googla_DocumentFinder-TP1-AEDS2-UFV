I fed the children  
And I kissed them goodnight  
You fed the jukebox  
Till they turn out the lights  
I bought the bacon  
While you bought the booze  
Ive sacrificed more than youll ever lose  
  
Needing new clothes with the money you spent  
On barbills and motels and women you met  
But I stood the heartache that you put me through  
Ive sacrificed more than youll ever lose  
  
I gave up so much  
And now Im giving up you  
Its too late to make up for  
The love that you used  
  
Ive had enough  
I dont want you around  
Dont look at me  
Like I let you down  
You say Im to blame  
But whos fooling who  
Ive sacrificed more than youll ever lose  
Yeah I sacrificed more than youll ever lose
