I sit by the telephone  
Waiting for you to call me  
And when Im alone in the night  
The blues start to fall on me  
Baby Im waiting for you  
And all thats on my mind  
Is what Im gonna do  
  
My friends say Im crazy  
And Im wasting my time on you  
Im breaking the rules  
And Im way out of line its true  
Baby one night with you  
And theyd be goin crazy too  
  
Im getting ready for love  
Brand new start  
Heres my heart  
Im getting ready for love  
I can feel  
This time its real  
  
All I keep thinkin about  
Is the way that you do to me  
Baby the wonder of you  
Has made the wonderful come true  
  
Im getting ready for love  
Brand new start  
Heres my heart  
Im getting ready for love  
I can feel  
This time its real  
  
Im under your spell  
Of that Im sure  
You can tell  
  
Sailin along on a breeze  
Ooh Im flying  
Ooh Im skying  
  
Im getting ready for love  
Brand new start  
Heres my heart  
Im getting ready for love  
I can feel  
This time its real  
  
Im getting ready for love  
Yes I am  
Yes I am  
Im getting ready for love
