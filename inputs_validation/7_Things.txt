Sha sha sha  
  
I probably shouldnt say this  
But at times I get so scared  
When I think about the previous  
Relationship we shared  
It was awesome but we lost it  
Its not possible for me not to care  
And now were standing in the rain  
But nothings ever gonna change until you hear  
My dear  
  
The seven things I hate about you  
The seven things I hate about you  
Oh you  
Youre vain your games youre insecure  
You love me you like her  
You made me laugh you made me cry I dont know which side to buy  
Your friends theyre jerks and when you act like them just know it hurts  
I wanna be with the one I know  
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do  
You make me love you  
  
Its awkward and its silent  
As I wait for you to say  
But what I need to hear now your sincere apology  
When you mean it Ill believe it If you text it Ill delete it  
Lets be clear  
Oh Im not coming back  
Youre taking seven steps here  
  
The seven things I hate about you  
Youre vain your games youre insecure  
You love me you like her  
You made me laugh you made me cry I dont know which side to buy  
Your friends theyre jerks and when you act like them just know it hurts  
I wanna be with the one I know  
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do  
You make me love you  
  
Compared to all the great things  
That would take too long to write  
I probably should mention  
The seven that I like  
  
The seven things I like about you  
Your hair your eyes your old Levis  
When we kiss Im hypnotized  
You made me laugh you made me cry but I guess thats both that Ill have to
buy  
Your hand in mine when were intertwined everythings alright  
I wanna be with the one I know  
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do  
You make me love you  
  
Sha sha you do oh
