I dont care if you wreck my car or shave off all my hair  
You can go and run your vacuum during my favorite show  
And Ill let you call up folks in Europe you dont even know  
Anything you want babe if it makes you happy  
But Im begging you down on my bended knees  
Oh honey please dont wear those shoes  
You can spend my money you can waste my time  
Baby I dont mind but please dont wear those shoes  
Dont wear those shoes  
Its alright you can play your twisted sister every night  
I suppose you can lick the middles out of my oreos  
Or start laughing while youre drinking milk so it comes out your nose  
And you know that Id do anything to please you  
But Im begging you down on my bended knees  
Oh honey please dont wear those shoes  
You can spit in my face in youre so inclined  
Baby I dont mind but please dont wear those shoes  
Oh no dont wear those shoes  
I said oh no oh no oh no please dont wear those  
Use my razor to shave your legs or eat crackers in bed  
Stomp the poodle til its flat  
You can even shove a sixinch railroad spike through my head  
I can learn to live with that  
But now Im begging you down on my bended knees  
Oh honey please dont wear those shoes  
You can whip me beat me rob me blind  
Baby I dont mind but please dont wear those  
I said oh no oh no oh no dont wear those shoes  
I said oh no oh no oh no dont wear those shoes  
You can scratch up my records you can drink my booze  
But baby please dont wear those shoes  
You can make me an offer I cant refuse  
But darling please dont wear those shoes  
You can play your bongos while Im trying to snooze  
But honey please dont wear those shoes  
You can expose yourself on the six o clock news  
But please please dont wear those shoes  
I said oh no oh no oh no dont wear those shoes  
I said oh no oh no oh no dont wear those shoe  
I said oh no oh no oh no dont wear those shoes  
I said oh no oh no oh no dont wear those shoe  
I said oh no oh no oh no dont wear those shoes  
I said oh no oh no oh no dont wear those shoe
