Go and speak to your niece do this do that  
Kiss your aunt on the cheek  
Dont talk back now run along  
Its gone eight say goodnight  
Thats the way that its done  
Boy and girl girl and boy  
This is how you do it and  
Who am I to reason why  
Wear a shirt wear a tie  
You look smart in a suit  
Use your fork in the left  
Straighten up shoulders back  
This is the way that its done
