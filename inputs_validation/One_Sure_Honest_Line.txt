I made a living writing lovers dream words  
I found the notes to hang them on  
I fround a way to play with the meaning of things  
And I came up with a couple good songs  
And so I oughta have an easy answer  
I oughta have some pretty things to say  
But I havent found the combination  
Thatll make you change your mind and wanna stay  
So I wish I had one sure honest line to say over and over again  
Sung in tune and time to a melody pure  
One clear everpresent pulse in the pocket  
And Im on the radio so youll know that I am yours  
Listen to the laughter of the children  
She scratched on the back of a bill  
As we climbed past the road to the schoolhouse  
On the burnt crust browning pan hill  
To where they dont take sad for an answer  
A place at the corner of your heart  
Where music meets with memories  
So you can recognize the feeling from the start  
How I wish I had one sure honest line to say over and over again  
Sung in tune and time to a melody pure  
One clear everpresent pulse in the pocket  
Im on the radio so youll know that I am yours  
Theyll put us on the radio so youll know that I am yours
