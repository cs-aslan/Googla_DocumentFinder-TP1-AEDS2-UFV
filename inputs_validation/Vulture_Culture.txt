Somehow you made it in the big wide world  
And youre absolutely home and dry  
You got away from a one horse town  
And the only way out was to fly  
  
You heard a lot about an easy street  
And it seems like the place to be  
You heard some talk about a slippery slope  
But you think it cant happen to me  
  
Vulture culture  
Use it or you lose it  
Vulture culture  
Choose it or refuse it  
Hollywood is calling wont you join the dance  
Moving onto Wall Street why not take a chance  
Its a vulture culture  
Never lend a loser a hand  
Just a vulture culture  
Living off the fat of the land  
  
Nowhere to turn around and catch your breath  
Its all relatively trouble free  
No need to bother with the bottom line  
Or a money back guarantee  
  
You sign a deal thats been etched in stone  
Its absolutely cut and dry  
Thats when they got you in the danger zone  
And the only way out is to die  
  
Vulture culture  
Use it or you lose it  
Vulture culture  
Choose it or refuse it  
Hollywood is waiting striking up the band  
Everyone on Wall Street shakes you by the hand  
Such a vulture culture  
Never lend a loser a hand  
Just a vulture culture  
Living off the fat of the land  
  
Use it or you lose it  
Choose it or refuse it  
Hollywoods a no go not a second chance  
Nobody on Wall Street gives a second glance  
Its a vulture culture  
Moving to the beat of the band  
Its a vulture culture  
Never lend a loser a hand  
Its just a vulture culture  
Living off the fat of the land
