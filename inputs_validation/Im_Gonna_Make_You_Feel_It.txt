Every day I get the feeling  
When you move on down the street  
Wondering when Ill be your lover  
And youll make my dream complete  
  
The way you walk is so inviting  
That I quiver and I shake  
The way you move it makes me wonder  
How much more can I take  
  
Im gonna make you feel it  
Basically thats what I say  
Im gonna make you feel it  
Cause you want it just that way  
  
Every time that were together  
My head starts to rock and roll  
I get this strange electric feeling  
That I simply cant control  
  
Im gonna make you feel it  
Basically thats what I say  
Im gonna make you feel it  
Cause you want it just that way  
  
Im gonna make you feel it  
Im gonna make you feel it  
Im gonna make you feel it
