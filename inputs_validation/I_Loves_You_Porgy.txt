I loves you Porgy  
Dont let him take me  
Dont let him handle me  
And drive me mad  
If you can keep me I wants to stay here  
With you forever and Id be glad  
I loves you Porgy  
Dont let him take me  
Dont let him handle me  
With his hot hand  
If you can keep me I wants to stay here  
With you forever  
I got my man  
  
Someday I know hes comin back  
To call me  
Hes gonna handle me and hold me so  
Its gonna be like dyin Porgy  
Deep inside me  
But when he calls I know I have to go  
  
Porgy Is your woman now  
I is I is  
And I aint never goin nowhere  
Less you shares the fun  
Want no wrinkle on your brow  
No how  
Because the sorrow of the past is all  
Done done  
My Porgy  
Now the real happiness is just begun  
Theres no wrinkle on my brow  
No how  
And I aint goin  
You hear me saying if you aint goin  
With you Im stayin  
  
Porgy Is yo woman now  
Is yours forever  
Mornin time and evenin time  
And summer time and winter time  
Mmm  
Oh my Porgy  
My man Porgy  
From this minute Im tellin you  
I keep this vow  
Porgy Is yo woman now
