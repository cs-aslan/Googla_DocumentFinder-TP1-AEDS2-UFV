I lie alone and thinking  
How could this ever happen  
Is it real am I dreaming  
And when your hearts been burnt  
How can someone learn to get over their fears  
You told me I should be strong  
Im trying I feel I cant go on  
You left me here on my own  
  
Without a reason for living  
A chance for forgiving  
A time to make it ok  
And now Im stuck with the vision  
Of my indecision  
Taking it all away  
From me  
  
With all the time your taking  
Slowly my hearts been breakin  
Youve been fine Ive been bleeding  
Ill have to wait my turn  
Your respect ill earn  
No more joking or teasing  
  
You told me I should be strong  
Im trying I feel I cant go on  
You left me here on my own  
Without a reason 4 living  
A chance for forgiving  
A time to make it okay  
And now Im stuck with the vision  
Of my indecision  
Taking it all away  
From me  
  
A thousand times before  
Ive been almost sure  
This time i need to know  
Ive spent all my life  
Chasing all my dreams  
Im not letting this go  
  
Without a reason for living  
A chance for forgiving  
A time to make it okay  
And now Im stuck with the vision  
Of my indecision  
Taking it all away  
From me
