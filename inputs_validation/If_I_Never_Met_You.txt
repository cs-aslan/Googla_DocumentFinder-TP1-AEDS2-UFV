If I never met you  
If I never saw your face  
This world this world would be a colder place I bet  
If wed never met  
If I never met you  
If I never knew your love  
My life my life might be a sad song of regret  
If wed never met  
But we said one hello  
And look at how the world begins to spin  
Look at how the shadows disappear  
Now that you are here  
If I never met you  
If I never felt your kiss  
My days my nights would not be filled like this its true  
I dont know who Id love  
I dont know what Id do if I never met you  
Just look at how the shadows disappear  
Now that you are here  
If I never met you  
If I never felt your kiss  
My days my nights would be filled like this its true  
I dont know who Id love  
I dont know what Id do  
If I never met you  
I dont know who Id love  
I dont know what Id do  
If I never met you  
we must be loving right  
Some folks got nothin but troubles  
So little joy in their lives  
But wherever we go  
Happiness follows  
We must be lovin right  
It might be the way I adore you  
Or the way that you hold me tight  
I dont know the reason  
But Im believin  
We must be lovin right  
All of our friends say  
Love fades away with time  
But I know theyre wrong  
Cause theyve never known  
A love like yours and mine  
So if the whole world goes crazy  
Let everyone else fuss and fight  
When alls said and done  
Well be the lucky ones  
We must be lovin right  
Some folks got nothin but troubles  
Oh so little joy in their lives  
But wherever we go  
Happiness follows  
We must be lovin right  
We must be lovin right
