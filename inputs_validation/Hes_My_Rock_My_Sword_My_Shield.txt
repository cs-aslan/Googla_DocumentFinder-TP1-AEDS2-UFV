Hes my rock my sword my shield  
Hes my wheel in the middle of the field  
Hes the lily of the valley  
Hes the bright and morning star  
Makes no difference what you say  
Im goin on my knees and pray  
Im gonna wait right here for Jesus  
Till he comes  
  
Cause Jesus is mine  
I am forgiven  
Im holdin his hand  
Im goin to heaven  
Cause I found a wonderful savior  
Who blesses me forever  
Im his and thank God  
He is mine  
  
Hes my rock my sword my shield  
Hes my wheel in the middle of the field  
Hes the lily of the valley  
Hes the bright and morning star  
Makes no difference what you say  
Im goin on my knees and pray  
Im gonna wait right here for Jesus  
Till he comes  
  
Hes my rock my sword my shield  
Hes my wheel in the middle of the field  
Hes the lily of the valley  
Hes the bright and morning star  
Makes no difference what you say  
Im goin on my knees and pray  
Im gonna wait right here for Jesus  
Till he comes  
  
Im gonna wait right here for Jesus  
Till he comes
