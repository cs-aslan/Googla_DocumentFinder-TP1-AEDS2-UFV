I gave the girls the eye  
Ive given lust a try  
Im just an average guy  
From the neck on down  
I used to have my fun  
When all was said and done  
I only wanted someone  
From the neck on down  
Maybe its one too many mornings after  
Maybe Im sick of my own nervous laughter  
  
Now Im looking for heaven  
From the neck on up  
For a perfect eleven  
From the neck on up  
  
I was a typical man  
I had a master plan  
I thought that heaven began  
From the waist on down  
And I had always said  
That I could use my head  
But I was thinking instead  
From the waist on down  
Maybe its one too many frozen shoulders or  
Maybe I havent noticed getting older  
  
Trapped in a dream  
Something has to change in this endless stream  
Of ships that pass in the night  
Is this what I want out of life  
I want to know what this game is about  
I want someone to try and figure me out  
  
I cant determine why  
But Im a different guy  
Your modus operandi  
Turned me inside out  
Its not that I dont care  
About your fine hardware  
But youve got something else there  
I cant figure out  
Maybe I just cant finish what Ive started or  
Maybe its simply that Ive been outsmarted  
  
Now Ive found my heaven  
From the neck on up  
Youre a perfect eleven  
From the neck on up
