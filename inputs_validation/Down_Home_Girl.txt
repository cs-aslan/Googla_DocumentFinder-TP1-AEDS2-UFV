Lord I swear the perfume you wear  
Is made out of turnip greens  
And every time that I kiss you girl  
It tastes like pork and beans  
Even though youre wearin them  
Citified high heels  
I can tell by your giant steps  
That youve been walkin through cotton fields  
Oh youre some down home girl  
Your shoes are green your dress is red  
And your wiggy head is powder blue  
But underneath all of that mess  
Well youre still the same old messy you  
Youre sittin there in that fancy chair  
Just drinkin champagne like a movie star  
When ya oughta be sittin on a sidewalk  
Drinkin white lightnin  
Out of a jelly jar  
Oh youre some down home girl  
Dimples in your pretty cheeks  
And dimples in your knees  
You walk by and baby I  
Can smell magnolia trees  
You tell me youre from New York baby  
But I know youre from way down South  
I can hear a Mississippi mama  
Evey time you open up your mouth  
Oh youre some down home girl  
Oh youre some down home girl
