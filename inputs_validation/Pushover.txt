So you told all the boys that you were gonna take me out  
  
Ya even ya even had the nerve to make a bet a yes you did  
That I I would give in all of my love you would win  
But you havent you havent won it yet  
You took me for a pushover  
Oh you thought I was a pushover  
Whoa Im not a pushover  
You thought my love was easy to get  
  
All of the girls think youre fine  
They even call ya Romeo  
Ya got em yeah you got em runnin to and fro  
Yes ya have  
But I dont want a one night thrill  
I want a love thats for real  
And I can tell by your line yours is not the lasting kind  
  
You took me for a pushover  
Oh you thought I was a pushover  
Whoa Im not a pushover  
You thought that you could change my mind  
Your temptin lips mmm hmm your way hair oh yeah  
Your pretty eyes with that ahhh come hither stare  
It makes me weak and I I start to bend  
And then I stop and think again  
No no no no no dont let yourself go  
  
I hate to spoil your reputation  
I want true love not an imitation  
And Im hip to every word in your conversation  
  
Who took me for a pushover  
Whoa Im not a pushover  
Whoa you thought I was a pushover  
Whoa you cant push me over  
Nobody is gonna push me over  
Oh youre not man enough to push me over
