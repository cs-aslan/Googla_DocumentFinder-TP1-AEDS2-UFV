Heeheeheeheeheeheeheehee  
Everyone come see the greatest show  
Gather up all Juggalos and roll  
Everyone come see the greatest show  
Gather up all trugalopes and roll  
  
Ah yeah Dum Diddy Dum  
Get your ass out the way cause here we come  
And wes bringin this spectacle into ya town  
We got creep shows freak shows Wicked Clowns  
Most people dont like these Oddities  
Most people would love to have a shot at these  
If you think you too good for us sideshow freaks let me know  
And Im gonna whip smack your cheeks Come on  
  
Chorus 2X  
Everyone come see the greatest show  
Unlike anything that you know  
Come and be down wit the clowns  
The big Oddity freak shows in town  
  
Im a sideshow looney watch me get nuts  
I do backflips out in fronta mad trucks  
And in high school the chicks always gave us probs  
cause I was nine feet tall and my boys a cyclops  
  
I can swim sharkfilled waters  
  
Yeah well I can chew nails up and spit out quarters  
Go cryin for your daddy whats that gonna do  
When hes just as shook as you you little snoot  
  
Chorus 2X  
  
Everyone come see the greatest show  
Gather up all Juggalos and roll  
Everyone come see the greatest show  
Gather up all Juggalos and roll  
  
Where you goin richy boy  
Whats the matter son  
Just because were a little different you gotta run  
Im an Oddity  
Youre lookin odd at me  
But then I gotta be  
And theres a lotta me  
Wes a little bit twisted I gladly admit it  
I can unscrew my head off and shoot hoop with it  
And you cant so you gotta label us weird  
Even though your mamas got a beard What  
  
Chorus
