Verse 1  
Mama stood on the front porch ringin her hands  
Watched the tail lights fadin on his black tranzam  
With her precious little baby taking off inside  
Staring at him with stars in her eyes  
She tried to tell her but the girl might as well have been deaf  
She wasnt gonna listen to a word she said  
Chorus  
Dont go down Maggie Creek Road  
With a boy lookin like that  
Hell tell ya thangs that you wanna hear  
And theyll be no turnin back  
Theres an oak tree down by the lake  
In the shade where the wild flowers grow  
Whatll happen only heaven knows  
So dont go down Maggie Creek Road  
at the enddont go down Maggie Creek Road  
Verse 2  
Was a still black night as dark is cold  
Nobody heard her when she said no  
She kicked and screamed and got free somehow  
Tore her dress on the door when he pushed her out  
She walked 13 miles on the gravel road  
With tears in her eyes 20 years ago  
chorus  
Verse 3  
Somehow mamas always know  
Cause they shoulda been home an hour ago  
When she pulled up it was just going down  
She turned her headlights off didnt make a sound  
She heard her baby crying no but he wouldnt stop  
Her heart went cold and her blood ran hot  
With a pistol in her hand she opened his door  
You dont wanna see mama go to war  
chorus
