Jose Mari Chan  
When my work is through at the end of the day  
Theres nothing else that Id rather do  
Than to be with you at the end of the day  
To be right by your side makes me feel brand new  
Cause youre my girl my woman my friend  
And thats how its gonna be till the end  
Loving you is what I live for  
And I cant ask for anything more  
Youre my woman my girl and my friend  
Rolled into one  
  
Janet Basco  
Youre my man and Im at the prime of my life  
To you I give myself all my heart

Ill never let a thing come to break us apart  
Cause Im your girl your woman your friend  
And thats how its gonna be till the end
