Azazel is beside you and hes playing the game  
Demons are inside you and theyre making their play  
Watching and theyre hiding as they wait for the time  
For a devil to get ready and take over your mind  
  
You and only god would know what could be done  
You and only god will know I am the only one  
You and only god would know what could be done  
You and only god will know I am the chosen one  
  
Could it be its the end of our world  
All the things that we cherish and love  
Nothing left but to face this all on my own  
Cause I am the chosen one  
  
Could it be its the end of our world  
All the things that we cherish and love  
Nothing left but to face this all on my own  
Cause I am the chosen one  
  
Beaten fallen angel but Ive risen again  
And the power is inside me Ive decided to pray  
As I wait for Armageddon and its coming my way  
Its an honour to be chosen and I wait for the day  
  
You and only god would know what could be done  
You and only god will know I am the only one  
You and only god would know what could be done  
You and only god will know that I am the chosen one  
  
Could it be its the end of my world  
All the things that we cherish and love  
Nothing left but to face all this on my own  
Cause I am the chosen one  
  
Could it be its the end of our world  
All the things that we cherish and love  
Nothing left but to face this all on my own  
Cause I am the chosen one  
  
Could it be its the end of our world  
All the things that we cherish and love  
Nothing left but to face this all on my own  
Cause I am the chosen one  
  
Could it be its the end of our world  
All the things that we cherish and love  
Nothing left but to face this all on my own  
Cause I am the chosen one
