This generation of believers that you and me are a part of we are responsible
for this generation of souls all over the world were responsible for them
were responsible to pray daily for t  
Eds of ministries around the world and ask god how about me not sending my
money this time how about me going its so easy to write checks its so
easy but god cant cash out of state checks in heaven he needs you  
  
Open your eyes to the world all around you open your eyes open your eyes  
This world is much more than the things that surround you  
You must arise and open your eyes  
Sometimes were too busy to share but jesus wants to care to care  
  
Open your arms to the naked and shivering open your arms open your arms  
We need a little less taking a whole lot more giving  
Were so safe and warm we can open our arms  
And love a little bit stronger and pray a little bit longer longer  
  
Jesus says when we love someone in his name were loving him  
Jesus says when we touch someone in his name were touching him  
And weve got to show them the light weve got to pour out our lives  
  
Open your hearts to the ones who are desperate open your hearts open your
hearts  
They may never repay you but their souls are worth it  
The life you impart when you open your heart  
Jesus loves all men the same  
So weve got to go out in his name  
  
Jesus says when we touch someone in his name were touching him  
Jesus says when we love someone in his name were loving him  
Jesus says when we feed someone in his name were feeding him  
And Jesus says when we reach someone in his name  
He feels he says its all for him  
Its all for him  
  
Open your eyes to the world all around you open your eyes open your eyes  
This world is much more than the things that surround you  
Jesus loves all men the same so weve got to go out in his name  
Jesus says jesus says jesus says its him  
Jesus says when we love someone in his name were loving him
