Its just a look and it makes the boys quiver  
Yes its just the look and now they remember  
Had they forgotten  what this all means  
I think they want to forget  
And they hope that this time  
  
Chorus  
I wont look Ive got other things to do now  
I forgot what it was Ive got to get to work now  
And they set an example for us I see it  
It can happen to me too  
And it didnt make any difference to us But I  
Forgot the trouble thats the trouble  
Forgot the trouble thats the trouble  
Forgot the trouble thats the trouble  
Forgot the trouble thats the trouble  
With our love  
With our love  
With our love  
They hear the words such as Youre really special  
And they cant face the feeling  
And they cant really tell  
I look out the window  
And I I call that education  
And I See all my friends standing out there  
And I I call that education sophistication  
  
Chorus  
  
Had the forgottenwhat this all means  
Things come and go and I see em  
And I wont be neglected not this time
