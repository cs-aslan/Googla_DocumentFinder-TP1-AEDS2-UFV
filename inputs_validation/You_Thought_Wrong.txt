I see how youre tryin to weasel  
Your way in and boy I know how  
You maneuver with your  
Your confusion  
  
You tell me that Im your only  
And how bad that you want me  
Then why are you so shady  
If Im supposed to be your lady  
  
Why should I believe anything you say  
And how could you shame me that way  
Tell me where whered you get the nerve  
To even think Id do you could play me for  
  
Chorus  
You thought we didnt know  
You thought we were in the dark  
But boy your covers blown  
Cause we both know now oh no  
You thought you had us both  
At your beckon call  
But now whos the joke  
And look whos laughing now  
  
Now youre trying to use us  
Against one another but it wont work  
I see right through your game boy  
And I know exactly where the blame falls  
  
You you try to deny all your actions  
For once in your life be a real man  
At least give me the proper respect of the truth  
I already know you did it  
  
Why should I believe anything you say  
And how could you treat me that way  
Whered you get the nerve to even think that you  
You could play me boy  
  
Chorus  
  
Now I see right through you baby  
You try to tell me you want me  
Cant you just get it through your thick head  
Cause I have seen this game before and  
Now Im showing you the door so  
Shut your mouth Im night tryin to hear your lies again  
  
Sorry you couldnt be a better man  
  
Chorus
