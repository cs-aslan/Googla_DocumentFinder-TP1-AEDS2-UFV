Just like a leaf thats just been rained on  
Something of a cloud above a soonawaking sun  
And I see the day has just begun  
Feeling windblown reeling  
I have grown out of my time  
  
And like a circle casting shadows  
Rolling over growing clover fields so far below  
And I see Ive just begun to grow  
Climbing spinning rhyming  
I am pinning down my time  
  
And like a river flowing seaward  
Bounding down surrounding things that have puzzled me before  
And I see the everopen door  
Flirting pure love certainly  
Im sure of what I know  
  
Just like a leaf thats just been rained on  
Something of a cloud above a soonawaking sun  
And I see the day has just begun  
Feeling windblown reeling  
I have grown out of my time
