Verse 1  
Different inflection when you say my name  
Kiss me but your kiss dont taste the same  
Is it real or am I going out of my mind  
Curious bout the company that you keep  
Cause I hear you talking bout her in your sleep  
And now youve got me talking bout her in mine  
  
PreChorus 1  
Ooh and I bet she has it all  
Bet shes beautiful like you like you  
And I bet shes got that touch  
Makes you fall in love like you like you  
  
Chorus  
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest  
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips  
Maybe I should be more like her  
Maybe I should be more like her  
I can taste her lipstick its like Im kissing her too  
And shes perfect  
And shes perfect  
  
Verse 2  
How does she touch you Can I try it too  
I know youre twisted but baby Im twisted too  
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind  
  
PreChorus 2  
With the smell of her perfume  
I could love her too like you like you  
And I can almost hear her laugh  
Curving on her back for you for you  
  
Chorus  
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest  
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips  
Maybe I should be more like her  
Maybe I should be more like her  
I can taste her lipstick its like Im kissing her too  
And shes perfect  
  
Bridge  
I can see her body rushing into you  
Crashing on your skin  
Burning within burning so deep deep  
On your skin skin next to me  
Shes crashing on your skin  
Settling in burning so deep deep  
On your skin skin while you sleep uh  
  
Chorus  
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest  
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips  
Maybe I should be more like her  
Maybe I should be more like her  
I can taste her lipstick its like Im kissing her too  
And shes perfect
