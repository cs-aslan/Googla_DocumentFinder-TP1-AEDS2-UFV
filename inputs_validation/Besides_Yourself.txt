Besides Yourself  
Before I let you all go  
Before I pull you from this show  
Before I wave to you  
Id like to say to you  
I wish you never to be alone  
  
Chorus  
Besides yourself what can you say  
Millions apart and miles away  
Besides yourself what do you need  
Some feel no pain while others bleed  
  
So if youre going to save my words  
Make sure its this time you deserve  
Before I walk away  
I know your every day  
Will play before you on its own  
  
Chorus  
  
And Im not saying Im not saying any wrong by you  
And Im not saying Im not talking my time for you  
  
Chorus
