Goin to a party  
Meet me out after school  
Well we go to a place  
Where the jive is really cool  
And if the band stops a playin  
Theres a jukebox in the hall  
  
Well put your blue dress on  
And your folks all gone  
Youll sure give the guys a ball  
  
Chorus  
Get that real guitar boy shakin  
Im a California man  
Dance right on till the floors are breakin  
Im a California man  
  
Well I cross my mamma so bad  
And this a womans just a making me mad  
So I dont care if your legs start aching  
Im a California man  
Oh my Im a California man  
  
Oh my legs start to shiver  
When I hear you call my name  
Well my knees keep a knocking  
And my bow ties bustin out  
  
An when we take off fine  
An my jeans are way down low  
When I waggle my hips  
Its making me feel like a king of rock n roll  
  
Chorus
