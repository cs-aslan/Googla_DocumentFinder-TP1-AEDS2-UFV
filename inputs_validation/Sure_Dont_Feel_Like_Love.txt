I registered to vote today  
Felt like a fool  
Had to do it anyway  
Down at the high school  
Thing about the second line  
You know felt like a fool  
People say it all the time  
Even when its true  
So whos that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe  
Whos that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe  
Cause it sure dont feel like love  
  
A tear drop consists of electrolytes and salt  
The chemistry of crying is not concerned with blame or fault  
So whos that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe  
Whos that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe  
Cause it sure dont feel like love  
How does it feel  
Feels like a threat  
A voice in your head that youd rather forget  
No joke no joke  
You get sick from that unspoken  
Sure dont feel like love  
No joke no joke  
Some chicken and a corn muffin well that feels more like love  
  
Yay Boo  
Yay Boo  
  
Wrong again wrong again  
Maybe Im wrong again  
Wrong again  
Maybe Im wrong again  
Wrong again  
I could be wrong again  
I remember once in August 1993  
I was wrong and I could be wrong again  
I remember one of my best friends turned enemy  
So I was wrong and I could be wrong again  
I remember once in a loadout down in Birmingham  
Yeah but that didnt feel like love  
Sure dont feel like sure dont feel like sure dont feel like love  
Sure dont feel like sure dont feel like sure dont feel like love  
It sure Dont feel  
Like love
