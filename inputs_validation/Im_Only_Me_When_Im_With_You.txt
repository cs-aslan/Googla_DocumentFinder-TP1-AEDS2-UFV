Friday night beneath the stars  
In a field behind your yard  
You and I are paintin pictures in the sky  
And sometimes we dont say a thing  
Just listen to the crickets sing  
Everything I need is right here by my side  
And I know everything about you  
I dont wanna live without you  
  
Chorus  
Im only up when youre not down  
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground  
Its like no matter what I do  
Well you drive me crazy half the time  
The other half Im only trying to  
Let you know that what I feel is true  
And Im only me when Im with you  
  
Just a small town boy and girl  
Livin in a crazy world  
Tryin to figure out what is and isnt true  
And I dont try to hide my tears  
The secrets are my deepest fears  
Through it all nobody gets me like you do  
And you know everything about me  
You say that you cant live without me  
  
Chorus  
  
When Im with anybody else its so hard to be myself  
Only you can tell  
  
That Im only up when youre not down  
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground  
Its like no matter what I do  
Well you drive me crazy half the time  
The other half Im only trying  
To let you know that what I feel is true  
  
And Im only me  
When I wanna be  
Well Im only me when Im with you  
With you  
Uh huh yeah
