Explosive you feel the impact hit your face  
What makes you think Ill let you survive  
You want a war Im the front line  
Unbroken  
  
This aint about me  
Im better than youll ever be  
You dont concern me  
I know youll never get to me  
You want a shot  
I can take your best bring it on  
Get ready for the pain  
Cause this where its going down  
  
War zone  
This is where its going down  
War zone  
When you walk in my world  
  
Madness is coming your way  
As long as my heart still beats  
I can guarantee you  
Madness is coming your way  
  
Survival here is thrust upon you  
Fuel the fire bring another victim  
Take your lesson in Supremacy  
Cause Im the one who stands alone at the summit  
  
This aint about me  
Im better than youll ever be  
You dont concern me  
You know youll never get to me  
You want a shot  
I can take your best bring it on  
Get ready for the pain  
Cause this is where its going down  
  
I am the wall you can never climb  
I am the pain that you feel inside  
I bring it all let the show begin  
I am the War you can never win  
  
War zone  
This is where its going down  
War zone  
When you walk in my world  
  
Madness is coming your way  
As long as my heart still beats  
I can guarantee you  
Madness is coming your way
