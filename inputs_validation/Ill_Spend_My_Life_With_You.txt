People come and people go  
Movin fast and movin slow  
Im in a crowd yet Im all alone  
The road is long the road is rough  
I do believe Ive had enough  
Im gonna turn around and head for home  
  
And I hope youre there  
And you still care  
And if you do  
Ill spend my life with you  
  
Ive had all the time I need  
To rearrange my mind and lead  
The life I thought I wanted yesterday  
I played a game that couldnt last  
And now some memries from the past  
Have turned my thoughts around a different way  
  
And girl I find  
Youre still on my mind  
And if you want me to  
Ill spend my life with you  
  
And girl I find  
Youre still on my mind  
And if you want me to  
Ill spend my life with you
