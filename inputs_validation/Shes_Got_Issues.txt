Im seeing this girl and she just might be out of her mind  
Well shes got baggage and its all the emotional kind  
She talks about closure and that validation bit  
I dont mean to be insensitive but I really hate that shit  
  
Oh man shes got issues  
And Im gonna pay  
She thinks shes the victim  
Yeah  
  
Now I know shell feel abandoned  
If I dont stay over late  
And I know shes afraid to commit  
But its only our second date  
  
Oh man shes got issues  
And Im gonna pay  
She thinks shes the victim  
But she takes it all out on me  
  
I dont know why youre messed up  
I dont know why your whole life is a chore  
Just do me a favor  
And check your baggage at the door  
  
Now she talks about her ex nonstop but I dont mind  
But when she calls out his name in bed  
Thats where I draw the line  
You told me a hundred times how your father left and hes gone  
But I wish you wouldnt call me daddy  
When were gettin it on  
  
Oh man shes got issues  
And Im gonna pay  
Shes playing the victim  
And taking it all out on me  
My god shes got issues  
And Im gonna pay  
  
If you think Im controlling  
Then why do you follow me around  
If youre not codependent  
Then why do you let others drag you down  
  
I dont know why youre messed up  
I dont know why your whole life is a chore  
Just do me a favor  
And check your baggage at the door
