I am an opera singer  
i stand on painted tape  
It tells me where Im going  
And where to throw my cape  
I call my costars brother  
I call my costars name  
I play both good and evil parts  
I sing to Verdis grave  
  
And every single morning  
By 10 am Im dressed  
My rehearsals last for hours and hours  
With diligence I have been blessed  
Some people they call me monster  
Some people they call me saint  
My talent feeds my darker side  
Yet noone will complain  
  
I am an opera singer  
I sing in foreign lands  
Ive sung for Kings in Europe  
And Emperors in Japan  
  
And after each performance  
People stand around and wait  
Just to tell me that they loved my voice  
Just to tell me that Im great  
I am an opera singer  
I will sing when youre all dead  
I sing the mountains crumbling apart  
I sing what cant be said  
  
I am an opera singer  
I sing in foreign lands  
Most people seem to know my name  
Or at least know who I am
