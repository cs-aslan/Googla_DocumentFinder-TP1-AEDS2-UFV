When I was one till I was three  
My mom and dad took care of me  
Now Im four and the worlds alive  
And I just cant wait until Im five  
  
I just cant wait until Im five  
  
When I am six there is a rule  
Kids like me all start to school  
Somewhere between seven and eight  
Ill start to grow and I just cant wait  
  
Ill start to grow and I just cant wait  
  
Nine is weird as it can be  
My brothers nine and he picks on me  
But I just cant wait until Im ten  
Ill be completely grown by then  
  
Ill be completely grown by then
