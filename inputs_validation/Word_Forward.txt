Goodbye Jimmy farewell youth  
Must be on my way I have had enough of you  
Was a young man proud and true  
Just a simple boy with nothing else to lose  
Years that Ive wasted these I owe yous  
Theyre just fucking words  
This is life or death  
Its time to clear the air you better save your breath  
Say have you heard  
Say have you heard  
The poison in my heart and the voices in my head  
Years that Ive waited these I owe yous  
I meant every word for word for word forward  
Word for word for word forward  
Word for word for word forward  
Word for word for word forward  
But its only words  
I meant every word  
Theyre just fucking words  
Word for word for word forward  
Word for word for word forward  
Word for word for word forward  
Word for word for word forward  
Word for word for word forward
