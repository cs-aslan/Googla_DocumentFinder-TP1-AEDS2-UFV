Hey bride of mine  
I love you  
So whyd you find another  
Who would make  
Love with you  
  
Death do us part  
Might be true  
Before the doctor asks me  
What did I do  
What did I do  
  
Hey heres a crime  
If youve got time  
Ill tell you just what Ill do  
Can you keep a secret secret  
  
Hey bow down low  
Does it go  
When your friends dont even know  
You think Im innocent  
  
Im just an arrogant boy  
Now youve found me out  
Im just an arrogant boy  
Im the last one around  
How did I get myself  
Into this secret  
Into a secret  
  
Hey is it real  
Want to feel  
Dark regret for what youve done  
Can you keep a secret secret  
  
Hey bow down low  
Does it go  
When your friends dont even know  
You think Im innocent  
  
Im just an arrogant boy  
Now youve found me out  
Im just an arrogant boy  
Im the last one around  
How did I get myself  
Into this secret  
Into a secret  
  
What did I do  
What did I do  
  
Hey bow down low  
Does it go  
When your friends dont even know  
You think Im innocent  
  
Im just an arrogant boy  
Now youve found me out  
Im just an arrogant boy  
Im the last one around  
Im not the only one  
That can hear you  
That can hear you whisper  
I should have know  
To never trust you  
Now Im sinking deeper  
Why did I get myself  
Into a secret  
Into a secret  
Why did I get myself  
Into a secret  
Into a secret
