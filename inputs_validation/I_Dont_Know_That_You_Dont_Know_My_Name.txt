Love is all around I want you to see it from here  
Love is just a sound I want you to hear it from here  
I dont know that you dont know my name  
But its all around us just the same  
I dont know that you dont know my name  
You dont know that I dont know your name  
  
Love is all around I want you to live it from here  
Love is just a sound I want to sing it for here  
I dont know that you dont know my name  
But its all around us just the same  
I dont know that you dont know my name  
You dont know that I dont know your name  
  
Peace is all around I want you to need it from here  
Peace is just a sound I want you to hear it from fear  
I dont know that you dont know my name  
But its all around us just the same  
I dont know that you dont know my name  
You dont know that I dont know your name
