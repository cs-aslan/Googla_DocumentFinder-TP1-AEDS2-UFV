Since the time we met never shall forget  
The magic feeling when I look in your eyes  
Every now and then I see you again  
But the words never come out right  
Ive always been painfully shy  
I hide what I feel inside  
Tonight I  
Never let you get away  
Open my heart  
Invite you in to stay  
I need you  
More than words can say  
And I hope you feel the same  
Gonna make you mine Ill make you mine  
Youve captured my heart  
And I wont take no for an answer  
Gonna make you mine Ill make you mine  
Hope that theres a chance baby  
That we can get together  
Cause I  
Gonna make you mine  
Gonna make you see  
Gonna make you mine  
You were meant for me  
Gonna make you mine  
I wanna love you endlessly  
Many times before I would just ignore  
Love when it came around and knocked on my door  
Keeping to myself trusting no one else  
Ive put my heart out of reach on a shelf  
With you I cant pass up this chance  
For a once in a lifetime romance  
Cause after all  
Someone said it very plain  
When it comes to love  
No pain no gain  
I think Ill  
Take a chance on you  
And you know I play to win  
Im gonna make you mine Ill make you mine  
Youve captured my heart  
And I wont take no for an answer  
Gonna make you mine Ill make you mine  
Hope that theres a chance honey  
That we can get together  
Cause I  
Gonna make you mine  
Gonna make you see
