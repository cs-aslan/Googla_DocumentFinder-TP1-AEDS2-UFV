Living in a world where the flesh is cheap  
Body touches body but its only skin deep  
I can hold you in my arms every time that you weep  
But weve lost that emotional flow  
Living on a planet full of emptiness  
With maximum exposure full of sleaziness  
But the make up on your face cant disguise loneliness  
Where designer feelings are in vogue what do they know  
  
Darlin Darlin how do I get close to you when Im  
Trying trying my heart is reaching out to you  
How do I get close to you  
In this world without feeling  
Where words have no meaning  
If I were lying lying  
Id have more chance of reaching you but Im  
Crying crying but I cant get my message through  
How do I get close to you  
  
Get close to the sinners trying hard to repent  
Get close to the homeless wasters and the innocent  
Get close to the souls ignored and forgotten by the  
Establishment  
People get afraid to touch in case it rubs off on them  
Gotta get close yeah people gotta stay close close  
People gotta stay close  
  
Though we seem together its breaking my heart  
This world is full of barriers that keep us apart  
Keep it superficial before feelings can start  
In a world thats all glitter and glow what do they know  
  
Darlin darlin I cant communicate to you without  
Crying crying I cant get a message through  
How do I get close to you  
How can I get close  
How can I get close  
Darlin darlin how do I get close to you when youre  
surviving surviving in a world thats making us confused  
Guess Im afraid of losing you  
In this world without feeling  
Somehow we gotta stay close
