Gotta talk to you baby  
Talk to you now  
Maybe its too late  
Youre slamming the door  
Youre walking out  
  
Chorus  
I got a feeling  
Feelings dont lie  
Dont let the words escape me now  
Escape me now  
Escape me now  
  
Gotta talk to you baby  
Talk to you now  
Say it isnt too late  
Youll see me again  
Well work it out  
  
Chorus  
  
Gotta talk to you baby  
Talk to you now  
Say it isnt too soon  
Youll see me again  
Well sort it out  
  
Chorus
