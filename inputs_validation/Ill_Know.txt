Ill know when my love comes along  
Ill know then and there  
Ill know at the sight of his face  
How I care how I care how I care  
And Ill stop and Ill stare and Ill know  
Long before we can speak  
Ill know in my heart  
I will know and I wont ever ask  
Am I right am I wise am I smart  
But I but Ill stop and Ill stare  
At that face in the throng  
Yes Ill know when my love comes along  
That hell stand before my eyes one day  
I wont need a second glance his way  
Ill know when my love comes along  
Ill know then and there  
Ill know at the sight of his face  
How I care how I care how I care  
And Ill stop and Ill stare at that face in the throng  
Yes Ill know when my love comes along
