Now you told me on a Sunday that it wasnt gonna work  
I tried to cry myself to sleep cause it was supposed to hurt  
We sat next to the fire as the flame was burning out  
I knew what you were thinkin before youd say it aloud  
  
Dont say youre sorry cause Im not even breaking  
Youre not worth the time that this is taking  
  
I knew better than to let you break my heart  
This soul youll never see again wont be showing scars  
You still love her I can see it in your eyes  
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie  
  
Every time you lie  
Every time you lie  
  
I woke up the next morning with a smile on my face  
And a long list of gentlemen happy to take your place  
Less trashier much classier then who you prove to be  
How longs it gonna take before you see that shes no me oh no  
  
I knew better than to let you break my heart  
This soul youll never see again wont be showing scars oh no no  
You still love her I can see it in your eyes  
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie  
  
At night awake  
I wont be sleeping til morning breaks  
Thats the price you pay for your mistakes  
Goodbye to dreaming  
  
So dont say youre sorry cause Im not gonna listen  
  
I knew better than to let you break my heart  
This soul youll never see again wont be showing scars oh no no  
You still love her I can see it in your eyes  
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie  
  
Every time you lie  
Dont say youre sorry  
Every time you lie  
Dont say youre sorry  
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie
