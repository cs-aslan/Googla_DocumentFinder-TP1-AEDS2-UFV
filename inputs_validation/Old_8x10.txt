Well know it aint much  
But its all that I have since shes gone  
One black and white memry  
Of the only love Ive ever known  
One moment in time  
When we were together  
A page from the past  
To haunt me forever  
A constant reminder that hearts heal much slower than bones  
Chorus  
Now my whole worlds in one 8x10  
With 4 metal walls holding it in  
Through one plate glass window  
neath a blanket of dust  
Stands an 8x10 picture of us  
I wish Id have told her what I felt inside  
Back when her sweet love was growing like wine  
I wish shed come back and love me again  
The way that she loved me in that old 8x10  
Now the silence I deafning  
As the date turns to dark  
Her presence gets stronger with each beat of my heart  
I pretned that shes here  
And weve made a new start  
And for a moment  
Shes back in my arms  
Chorus  
Theres an 8x10 picture of us
