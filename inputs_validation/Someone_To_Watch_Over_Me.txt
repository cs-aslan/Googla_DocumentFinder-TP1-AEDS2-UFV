Theres a somebody Im longing to see  
I hope that she turns out to be  
Someone wholl watch over me  
  
Im a little lamb whos lost in the wood  
I know I could always be good  
To one wholl watch over me  
  
Although I may not be the man  
Some girls think of as handsome  
But to her heart  
I carry the key  
  
Wont you tell her please to put on some speed  
Follow my lead oh how I need  
Someone to watch over me  
  
Im a little lamb whos lost in the wood  
I know I could always be good  
To one wholl watch over me  
  
Although I may not be the man  
Some girls think of as handsome  
But to her heart  
I carry the key  
  
And this world would be like heaven if shed  
Follow my lead oh how I need  
Someone to watch over me  
Someone to watch over me
