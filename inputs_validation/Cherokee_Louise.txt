Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel  
In the Broadway bridge  
Were crawling on our knees  
Weve got flashlights and batteries  
Weve got cold cuts from the fridge  
  
Last year about this time  
We used to climb up in the branches  
Just to sway there in some breeze  
Now the cops on the street  
They want Cherokee Louise  
  
People like to talk  
Tongues are waggin over fences  
Waggin over phones  
All their doors are locked  
God she cant even come to our house  
But I know where shell go  
  
To the place where you can stand  
And press your hands like it was bubble bath  
In dust piled high as me  
Down under the street  
My friend  
Poor Cherokee Louise  
  
Ever since we turned 13  
Its like a minefield  
Walking to the door  
Going out you get the 3rd degree  
And comin in you get the 3rd world war  
  
Tuesday after school  
We put our pennies on the rails  
And when the train went by  
We were jumpin round like fools  
Goin Look no heads or tails  
Goin Look my lucky prize  
  
She runs home to her foster dad  
He opens up a zipper  
And he yanks her to her knees  
Oh please be hereplease  
My friend  
Poor Cherokee Louise  
  
Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel  
In the Broadway bridge  
Were crawling on our knees  
Weve got Archie and Silver Screen  
I know where she is  
  
The place where you can stand  
And press your hand like it was bubblebath  
In dust piled high as me  
Down under the street  
My friend  
Poor Cherokee Louise  
Oh Cherokee Louise
