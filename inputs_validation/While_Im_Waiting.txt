I left my message on your number  
In hopes that you might call  
Riding high on good intentions  
Still hanging on the wall  
Although my words were never all too  
Clear its understood  
Its never too late to say in other ways  
Something in our lives well rearrange  
More than just your call on holiday  
Ring me up dont bring me down  
Dont let me hear you wont  
Come through tonight  
Ring me up dont bring me down  
You know this lonely heart stands by me  
While Im waiting  
Remembering how it came together  
The meaning in your eyes  
Now words fall out like perfect strangers  
We both apologize  
In all this time I thought I knew you  
And over looked somehow the reasons why  
You kept inside  
Ring me up dont bring me down  
Dont let me hear you wont  
Come through tonight  
This lonely heart stands by me  
While Im waiting  
Ring me up dont bring me down  
Dont let me hear you wont  
Come through tonight  
Ring me up dont bring me down  
Heres hoping the days gone by well see again  
This lonely heart stands by and Im still waiting  
Ooh still waiting  
Ooh still waiting
