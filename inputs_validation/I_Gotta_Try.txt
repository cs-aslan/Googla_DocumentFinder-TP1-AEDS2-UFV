Maybe its true what they say about it  
Maybe we cant make the ends meet  
Maybe well all have to do without it  
Maybe this worlds just incomplete  
Still we all look for truth in our lives  
Searching from different sides  
If its so hard living in a desperate world  
But we all do the best that we can  
Some people dream a change  
Some will remain the same  
All of us live their lives  
Under the gun  
Some see the road as clear  
Some say the end is here  
They say its a hopeless fight  
But I say I gotta try  
Maybe theres too much to think about  
Maybe there just aint nothing left to say  
But if our times really running out  
Then this is no time to run away  
Cause were destined to look for truth in this life  
Blinded by tearful eyes  
If its no use trying in a desperate world  
Then tell me why was I born  
Some people see a change  
Some will remain the same  
All of us live their lives  
Under the gun  
Some see the road as clear  
Some say the end is here  
They say its a hopeless fight  
But I say I gotta try  
Lonely living so lonely  
Is it too late  
To turn it all around  
Some people dream a change  
Some will remain the same  
All of us live their lives  
Under the gun  
Some see the road as clear  
Some say the end is here  
They say its a hopeless fight  
But I say I gotta try  
I gotta change  
The world just remains the same  
All of us live our lives  
Under the gun  
Someones sleeping  
Someones giving up  
Someones trying  
Someones crying out  
Still we live under the gun
