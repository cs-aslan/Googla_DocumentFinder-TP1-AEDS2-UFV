I never found out why you walked away  
And never said goodbye  
But now that I see you  
Im torn inside but Ive still got my pride  
  
I understand that some things are better left unsaid  
Im afraid of the truth  
But what can I do if I still want you  
  
If we could start over again  
I know if we try our love could be stronger  
If we could start over again  
Im sure we oh  
Wed never have to let go  
  
For so many years now  
Ive held inside things I meant to say  
But faced with the past now I realize  
I cant let that stand in our way  
  
I never knew that a love so strong would never fade  
But what can we do  
If I still want you  
And you want me too  
  
How can we walk away  
From something that was once so strong  
Have we the strength to say were wrong
