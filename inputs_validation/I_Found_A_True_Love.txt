I found a true love I swear by the stars above  
I know shes mine mine all mine  
I found a true love I call her Magnolia  
I know shes mine mine all mine  
One more one more thing

And that makes her mine mine all mine  
Shes got the kind of thing about her

And ah shes mine mine all mine

Ah she placed my feet yall oh yeah  
Placed em on solid ground  
And I can shout about her yeah  
And shes mine mine mine
