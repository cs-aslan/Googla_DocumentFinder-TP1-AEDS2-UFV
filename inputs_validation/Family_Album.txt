On Sunday after church thered always be a picnic  
Thered be kinfolks callin until dawn  
Me Id play the guitar and my Uncle Merle would sing  
And grandpa hed play that fiddle all night long  
Now the women folk they would work out in the kitchen  
You could smell that food for miles and miles around  
Paw he was prayin my brother Jack would bring him down some moonshine  
Just sos that he could warsh those viddle down  
As soon as all the kids got tired of playin horseshoes  
Mama shed call me over to her side  
You know shed say Id like to take some pictures  
You could see her face light up with pride  
And then shed bring out that worn out family album  
Its faded pictures some with corners torn  
Shed laugh and poin and tell me funny stories  
And look shed say why thats the day that you were born  
And Id sit and reminisce each picture with her  
And Id listen to her laughter and her sighs  
But underneath I knew how much Id hurt her  
For Id put teardrops in my mamas eyes  
  
In my mamas eyes Ive never done a wrong thing  
I was still a baby in my mamas eyes  
That old family album shell keep on her night stand  
Right next to the Bible until the day she dies  
  
Through all those years in prison she stuck by me  
And she came to visit anytime she could  
Well I remember at my trial when she testified she loved me  
And she told the judge Id always been so good  
Then later through the fame she watched me blossom  
From just a local country singer to a great big star  
She listened to all my records for the hidden meanings  
And she came to hear me sing in all those dim lit bars  
And she read all the things they wrote about me  
But she knew deep in her heart that it was lies  
No she dont hide her head in shame when someone says my name  
Youll find no teardrops in my mamas eyes  
In my mamas eyes  
Right next to the Bible until the day she dies
