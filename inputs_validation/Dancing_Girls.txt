I dont need a doctor I dont need a priest  
I dont need no superstitious cures for my release  
Im flesh an blood skin an bone  
A little petticoat company cant get me stoned  
  
So just gimme the night  
Skin it back to the bone  
Turn on the spotlight  
  
Cmon bring on the dancing girls  
Bring on the dancing girls  
Bring on the dancing girls  
You can dance dance  
Dance for me  
Dance for your daddy all night  
  
I got a one track notion on a feminine squeeze  
A sackful of love an a mindful of fantasies  
A midnight rider on a stallion steam  
I got an old mans weakness hanging on a young mans dream  
  
So just gimme the night  
Skin it back to the bone  
Turn on the spotlight  
  
Cmon bring on the dancing girls  
Bring on the dancing girls  
Bring on the dancing girls  
You can dance dance  
Dance for me  
Dance for your daddy all night  
  
So just gimme the night  
Skin it back to the bone  
Turn on the spotlight  
  
Cmon bring on the dancing girls  
Bring on the dancing girls
