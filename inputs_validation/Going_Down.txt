Dawn sings in the garden  
Phone sings in the hall  
This boys dead from two days life  
Resurrected by the call  
Penny here weve got to come  
So come on round to me  
Theres so much penny lying here  
To touch taste and tease  
Ring a ding ding ding Im going down  
Im coming round  
Pennys place her crummy room  
Her dansette crackles to Jimis tune  
I dont care I taste Ambre Solaire  
Her neck her thighs her lips her hair  
Ring a ding ding ding Im going down  
Im coming around  
  
All thoughts of sleep desert me  
There is no time  
Thirty minutes brings me round to her number nine  
  
Yeah she looks like a painting  
Jackson Pollocks Number Five  
Come into the forest and taste the trees  
The sun starts shining and Im hard to please  
Ring a ding ding ding Im going down  
Im coming around  
  
All thoughts of sleep desert me  
There is no time  
Thirty minutes brings me round to her number nine  
  
To look down on the clouds  
You dont need to fly  
Ive never flown in a plane  
Ill live until I die
