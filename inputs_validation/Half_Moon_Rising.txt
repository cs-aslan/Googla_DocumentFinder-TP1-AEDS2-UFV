Theres a house somewhere I know wheres the fires burning all night long  
Theres a swing outside on the porch where I feel like Ill  
Rock away the dusk until the dawn  
And even though the wind may be howlin  
The stars are bright and they push me on and on  
  
Theres a half moon risin in the south eastern skies  
Theres a cold wind blowing across the great divide  
And the stars they guide my way across the night  
Theres a half moon rising  
Its pushin me on to another mountain top  
Push me on no no Ill never stop push me on home  
Theres a half moon rising in the south eastern skies tonight  
  
Now the shoes on my feet those soles broken down  
And my coat is tattered and worn  
And the hunger in my belly and the fever in my head  
Will vanish ere my first glimpse of home  
And even though the rain may now be fallin  
The passion is deep and pushes me on  
  
Theres a half moon risin in the south eastern skies  
Theres a cold wind blowing across the great divide  
And the stars they guide my way across the night  
Theres a half moon rising  
Its pushin me on to another mountain top  
Push me on no no Ill never stop push me on home  
Theres a half moon rising in the south eastern skies tonight  
  
Theres a still at dawn like the sound of your loves breath  
As she lies sleeping  
Down below me now in the valley  
Is the only piece on earth that I ever want to know  
And her lips are as soft as I remember  
She alone has brought me back on home  
  
Theres a half moon risin in the south eastern skies  
Theres a cold wind blowing across the great divide  
And the stars they guide my way across the night  
Theres a half moon rising  
Its pushin me on to another mountain top  
Push me on no no Ill never stop push me on home  
Theres a half moon rising in the south eastern skies tonight
