Dont like goodbyes tears or sighs  
Im not too good at leavin time  
I got no taste for grievin time no no not me  
Youve been my near ones always my dear ones  
I never thought that I would find  
Another love a different kind but it came to be  
Well if you think Im tellin you lies  
Go try your luck and look into her eyes  
But remember you must remember shes mine  
And my world overhead has a clear new shine  
Dont want to leave you sorry to grieve you  
Its travelin time and I must move on  
Found the girl to lean upon  
And if I could arrange it  
Would I care to change it Not me
