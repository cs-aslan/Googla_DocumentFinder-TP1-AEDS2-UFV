The child without a name grew up to be the hand  
To watch you to shield you or kill on demand  
The choice hed made he could not comprehend  
His blood a grim secret they had to command  
  
Hes torn between his honor and the true love of his life  
He prayed for both but was denied  
  
So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed  
Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind  
So many years have past who are the noble and the wise  
Will all our sins be justified  
  
The curse of his powers tormented his life  
Obeying the crown was a sinister price  
His soul was tortured by love and by pain  
He surely would flee but the oath made him stay  
  
Hes torn between his honor and the true love of his life  
He prayed for both but was denied  
  
So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed  
Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind  
So many years have past who are the noble and the wise  
Will all our sins be justified  
  
Please forgive me for the sorrow for leaving you in fear  
For the dreams we had to silence thats all theyll ever be  
Still Ill be the hand that serves you  
Though youll not see that it is me  
  
So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed  
Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind  
So many years have past who are the noble and the wise  
Will all our sins be justified
