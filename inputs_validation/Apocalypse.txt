Intro  
  
  
Yeah I was looking out my window  
  
when i heard this sound  
  
look up into the sky  
  
saw the moon turned to blood  
  
looked at my little brother  
  
said you high as hell maaan  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
Apocalypse  
  
12 the headlines youths just rolled through  
  
Apocalypse

Verse One  
  
  
Arrival of the Carnival  
  
New beats I never recycle  
  
While your looking for samples  
  
You might get trampled  
  
Surprise hey  
  
Im back with lightning and thunder  
  
I heard you over saying that i was a one year wonder  
  
You dumb or some i went to refugees  
  
Silly felony when im done  
  
Collect royalty from record companys  
  
Clouds getting darker  
  
Suns getting nearer  
  
Ill turn a atheist into a god fearing believer  
  
The back of a building  
  
Your bodys found by children  
  
Playin hide go seek  
  
All we found was his skeleton  
  
In the back of a car  
  
You spawned with the wrong guard  
  
You know my empire strikes back hard  
  
Listen hard war  
  
This is the day after action  
  
Projects cannons  
  
Being launched at the palace  
  
Vision revelation  
  
Sky know apocalypse  
  
Enemy pilots kamikaze into the abyss  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
Apocalypse  
  
12 the headlines youths just rolled through  
  
Apocalypse

Verse Two  
  
  
Aiyyo Back on earth  
  
The party is in the tunnel  
  
On the west side of the river  
  
Went mad quiver  
  
Rats get fed to the alligator  
  
Gun blast equivalent to the bombs in pearl harbor  
  
Rescue choppers broke the turn to hiroshima  
  
Im driving to jersey to escape the terror  
  
I was on the highway pushing a black viper  
  
A car pulls up is he a jack or a sniper sniper  
  
A blue range rover he says pull over  
  
I didnt know he was a DT undercover  
  
I screamed out my lungs  
  
This is discrimination  
  
He tried he said you just robbed a gas station  
  
Who me not me it couldnt be  
  
I was in the Grammys with Brandy  
  
Didnt you see me on tv  
  
Bullshit yall all in the same game  
  
He tried to run me off the road  
  
Like he was rosco rico or dre  
  
I stayed calm gave him a hell of a show  
  
Cause when its time to go  
  
All i gotta press is turbo  
  
Heard it on his walkie road block on 280 west  
  
Things got serious thats when i bust a left  
  
youTurn my eyes burned  
  
My concern was a truck coming  
  
Head on collision within a chase position  
  
Close one i almost went up in a blaze  
  
Running from what appears to be a masquerade  
  
Least that what i thought it was all in my mind  
  
Reality stuck when i got to the borderline  
  
The headline reads every ghettos sad story  
  
A rookie shoots a boy over mistaken identity  
  
crash  
  
  
Chorus repeat 2X  
  
not the record fades out
