Verse 1  
I told you I dont want you all the time  
Cause youre not mine  
Im not in love but Im in light  
So far its working fine  
But when I need you down Im desperate  
Im a little child  
Just like an animal down on my knees  
And beggin  
  
Chorus  
Yeah all wrapped up I wanna be your little baby now  
Put my head on your shoulder  
You can rock me rock me now  
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud  
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me  
  
PostChorus  
Open the door unlock me  
Weve got tonight so rock me now  
  
Verse 2  
Im in my bed and Im obsessed  
And I am wide awake  
I need someone like you to come  
And put me in my place  
Cause in the day I cant be tamed  
Boy you dont wanna know  
But in the night my hands are tied  
You tell me where to go  
  
Chorus  
Yeah all wrapped up I wanna be your little baby now  
Put my head on your shoulder  
You can rock me rock me now  
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud  
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me  
  
PostChorus  
Open the door unlock me  
Weve got tonight so rock me now  
  
Open the door unlock me  
Weve got tonight so rock me now  
  
Bridge  
Rock me now  
Rock me now  
  
Chorus  
Yeah all wrapped up I wanna be your little baby now  
Put my head on your shoulder  
You can rock me rock me now  
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud  
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me  
  
Yeah all wrapped up I wanna be your little baby now  
Put my head on your shoulder  
You can rock me rock me now  
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud  
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me
