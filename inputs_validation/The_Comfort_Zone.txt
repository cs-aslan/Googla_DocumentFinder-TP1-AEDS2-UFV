Where do you go  
When theres a need to be loved  
Oh Ill let you know  
Just what to do and where to go  
  
Hey hey welcome to the comfort zone  
When you need to be loved like you need to be loved  
Welcome to the comfort zone  
Do whatever fells right and turns you on  
  
After a hard days work  
Theres one thing to be certain of  
This ol familiar love  
Its unusual to find that its sensual  
Its all you need to let go  
  
Theres no need to try  
Or compromise  
Or settle for another outside of my love

When you get through  
Heed the message seek the comfort of my zone  
  
Hey welcome to the comfort zone  
When you need to be loved like you need to be loved  
Welcome to the comfort zone  
Do whatever fells right and turns you on  
  
Hey let me make you comfortable  
Let me take control  
And give your mind a break from the day you made  
Lets turn the lights down low  
And oh the rest you know  
Ill be here for you  
cause you just stepped into the comfort zone
