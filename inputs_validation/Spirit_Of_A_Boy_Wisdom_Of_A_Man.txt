He was 16 tender and tough  
She was too and hed do anything to prove his love  
With so much riding on the choice at hand  
The spirit of a boy or the wisdom of a man  
  
Hearts caught fire and love ran wild  
She cried the day she called to say she was having his child  
With so much riding on the choice at hand  
The spirit of a boy or the wisdom of a man  
  
Theres a constant contradiction what feels good and what feels right  
But you live with decisions that you make in your life  
And what steers your direction is hard to understand  
The spirit of a boy or the wisdom of a man  
  
Now he drives a diesel out of Dallas  
Hauling cars out to the coast  
It aint the dream that he remembered just a few short years ago  
But tonight at a truck stop while drinking a cup  
The waitress grins and winks at him  
And says
