Maybe I shouldnt have spoken  
Just kept my mouth shut  
Maybe all the effort didnt help much  
Singing for better conditions  
Hoping for better days  
Not saying that were perfect  
Or looking for some praise  
Gossip rumors just plain lies  
But were on the same side  
Gossip rumors lets put it aside  
Fuck were on the same side  
Knowing if I stumble  
Aware if I fall  
I dont need finger pointed at me  
If youre not trying at all  
Not trying to come off righteous  
Just always tried to be sincere  
Didnt mean to come off so welllearned  
Cause Im just another peer  
Gossip rumors just plain lies  
But were on the same side  
Gossip rumors lets put it aside  
Fuck were on the same side  
I know what Im shooting for PUT IT ASIDE  
I know how it felt  
And I dont have to prove it to anybody  
Because I already proved it to myself  
No matter where I am in this world  
I know exactly where I stand  
I thought we were on the same side man  
But at least I know Ive tried
