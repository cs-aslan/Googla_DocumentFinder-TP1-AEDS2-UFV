I Get Up  
  
Now dont try to change me  
I am what I am  
And I do what I want  
The best way that I can  
  
Now Im wondering if youre happy  
Cause if you want to make it true  
Oh baby this is what you do  
  
Chorus  
I get up I get up and  
Whatre you going to say  
I get up I get up and  
Whatre you going to do  
I get up I get up and  
Theres no walking away  
I get up I get up and  
  
Now Ive got the feeling  
Ive been living a dream  
But it dont really matter  
Cause it aint all it seems  
  
Now you dont have to worry  
To have a good time  
Oh baby this is what you do  
  
Chorus  
I get up I get up and  
Whatre you going to say  
I get up I get up and  
Whatre you going to do  
I get up I get up and  
Theres no walking away  
I get up I get up and  
  
  
Radio  
Television  
Politics  
And old religion  
All around the world  
Troubling strides  
Believe me when I tell you  
I dont need your advice  
  
I get high  
I get low  
I dont wanna die  
Fuck it all  
Ive gotta get up  
Ive gotta get out  
Ive gotta get out  
I get up  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Theres no walking away  
Oh this is what you do  
  
I get up I get up and  
Get up get up now  
I get up I get up and  
All around the world  
I get up I get up and  
This is what you do  
I get up I get up and  
All around the world  
I get up I get up and  
Oh this is what you do  
I get up I get up and  
You get up get up  
You get up
