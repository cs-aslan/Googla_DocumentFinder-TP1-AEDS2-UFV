You know better and I know better lets do it anyway  
Throw our hearts into the wind and let the music play  
  
One more time for old times sake where could we go wrong  
We know every word by heart come on lets sing our our love song  
  
Ohohoh ohohoh sha la la love song we can find the harmony and sing it
all night long  
Ohohoh ohohoh sha la la love song sing it sweet and sing it low till
all the musics gone  
  
Theres no telling what could happen if it happens right  
We may just turn the record over and let it play all night  
  
Its got an old familiar feeling made you sing along  
Theres no sweeter melody come sing this old love song with me  
  
Ohohoh ohohoh sha la la love song we can find the harmony and sing it
all night long  
Ohohoh ohohoh sha la la love song sing it sweet and sing it low till
all the musics gone  
  
Ohohoh ohohoh sha la la love song  
Ohohoh ohohoh sha la la love song  
Ohohoh ohohoh sha la la love song
