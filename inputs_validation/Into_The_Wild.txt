Red blood on the white snow  
Red blood on the white snow  
  
The troopers are coming  
They want me dead not alive  
Gonna run in the danger  
When they open fire  
  
Dont cry  
Little sister I wont be coming home  
Dont cry  
Little sister  
  
In the cold hearted winter  
Dogs are running at my back  
The nightmare is coming in  
And Im on this frozen track  
  
Dont cry  
Little sister I wont be coming home  
Dont cry  
Little sister Ill fight this one alone  
  
Red blood on the white snow  
Red blood on the white snow  
  
If you think Im guilty  
And Im just a gambling man  
Well no one is above the law  
Im gonna have to make a stand  
  
Dont cry  
Little sister I wont be coming home  
Dont cry  
Little sister Ill fight this one alone  
  
Red blood on the white snow  
Red blood on the white snow  
  
Across the land  
Theyre getting closer  
I keep my ear to the ground  
They ride me down  
Got no mercy  
But I never will be found  
Oh little sister  
Dont you cry  
You know I cannot stay  
I gotta find a place  
A place to hide  
Cos the blood hounds know my way  
  
Its the same old lies  
Dont believe what you hear about me  
Im gonna fight till its over  
And face that hanging tree  
  
Dont cry  
Little sister I wont be coming home  
Dont cry  
Little sister Ill fight this one alone  
  
Red blood on the white snow  
Red blood on the white snow  
  
Into the wild
