I used to wish that I could rewrite history  
I used to dream that each mistake could be erased  
Then I could just pretend  
I never knew the me back then  
  
I used to pray that You would take this shame away  
Hide all the evidence of who Ive been  
But its the memory of the place You brought me from  
That keeps me on my knees and even though Im free  
  
Heal the wound but leave the scar  
A reminder of how merciful You are  
I am broken torn apart take the pieces of this heart  
And heal the wound but leave the scar  
  
I have not lived a life that boasts of anything  
I dont take pride in what I bring  
But Ill build an altar with the rubble that Youve found me in  
And every stone will sing of what You can redeem  
  
Heal the wound but leave the scar  
A reminder of how merciful You are  
I am broken torn apart take the pieces of this heart  
And heal the wound but leave the scar  
  
Dont let me forget  
Everything Youve done for me  
Dont let me forget  
The beauty in the suffering  
  
Heal the wound but leave the scar  
A reminder of how merciful You are  
I am broken torn apart take the pieces of this heart  
Heal the wound but leave the scar  
  
Heal the wound but leave the scar  
A reminder of how merciful You are  
I am broken torn apart take the pieces of this heart  
And heal the wound but leave the scar leave the scar
