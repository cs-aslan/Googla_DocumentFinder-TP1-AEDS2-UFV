Shes got friends in high places her pictures in vogue  
Shes seen at the races and walking the dog  
She swallows the camera she follows the press  
She covers the angles shes dressed for success  
  
She dont bring me water  
She dont give me food  
All that she got is a real attitude  
  
Her mood swings are violent it cant be denied  
She kisses the bridegroom and disses the bride  
Godfathers baby who gets every wish  
She drinks with the family shes taking the fifth  
  
She dont bring me water  
She dont give me food  
All that she got is a real attitude
