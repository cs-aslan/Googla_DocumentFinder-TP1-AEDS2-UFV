Dont you like the way she talks to you  
When shes feeling woman warm  
And dont it make you feel so good  
Just to know shes yours all by yourself  
  
Dont you like to see the sun go down  
When shes lying close to you  
And cant you feel her all around  
And when she loves you aint she something else  
  
Chorus  
Aint she just some kind of lover in the morning  
Cant your arms feel the warmness where she slept  
Aint she just all that you have ever wanted  
And when she loves you aint she something else  
  
Dont you like the way she clings to you  
And loves you til theres nothing left  
Now tell me dont her lips taste good  
And when she loves you aint she somthing else  
  
Repeat Chorus  
Lord When she loves me shes sure something else
