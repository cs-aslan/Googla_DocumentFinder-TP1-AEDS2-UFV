See you right around the corner  
I know that you were getting closer  
It dawned on me it dawned on me  
That you could be the one for me  
But Im sure youve heard it all the time  
I just look like the other guy  
Next to me next to me  
Next to me next to me  
  
Lets go home together  
Youll say that its good for me  
Youre good for me  
But its all in my head  
When I wake in my bed  
Dont know  
  
Ive got no motivation  
Ive got not stimulation  
You could be you could be  
The one for me  
We will see that  
Ive got no motivation  
Give me some motivation  
In this life in this life in this life  
  
And I know youre not  
One of those girls  
Who takes her time  
Shell come for me shell come for me  
Shell come for me  
And I can wait for eternity  
For you to take your turn with me  
Turn with me turn with me  
  
Ive got no motivation  
Ive got not stimulation  
You could be you could be  
The one for me  
We will see that  
Ive got no motivation  
Give me some motivation  
In this life in this life in this life  
  
Baby its fine  
If you want to be mine  
Just call out my name  
Dont wait in line  
Just take my hand  
And break my heart tonight  
  
Ive got no motivation  
Ive got not stimulation  
You could be you could be  
The one for me  
We will see that  
Ive got no motivation  
Give me some motivation  
This life this life this life  
  
Take me home with you  
I cant go alone  
And take me home tonight
