I dont know what youve got  
But its getting to me  
Makes my cold nights hot  
Hot wind just goes right through me  
  
Were hummin baby  
Its in your hands  
Cause youve got me hummin yeah  
Cause youve got me hummin yeah  
  
Wow wake up early at night  
I cant go back to sleep  
I even walk alone on red lights  
I tied my tongue and try to speak  
  
When its my time to walk  
When my feet is startin to run  
Cause youve got me hummin yeah  
Cause youve got me hummin yeah  
  
Oh no  
Tough baby
