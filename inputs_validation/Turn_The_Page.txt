Nothing can survive in a vacuum  
No one can exists all alone  
We pretend things only happen to strangers  
Weve all got problems of our own  
  
Its enough to learn  
To share our pleasures  
We cant sooth pain with sympathy  
All that we can do is be reminded  
We shake our heads at the tragedy  
  
Every day were standing  
In a time capsule  
Racing down a river from the past  
Every day were standing  
In a wind tunnel  
Facing down the future coming fast  
  
Its just the age  
Its just a stage   
We disengage   
We turn the page  
  
Looking at  
The longrange forecast  
Catching all the names in the news  
Checking out  
The state of the nation  
Learning the environmental blues  
  
Truth is after all a moving target  
Hairs to split  
And pieces that dont fit How can anybody be enlightened  
Truth is after all so poorly lit
