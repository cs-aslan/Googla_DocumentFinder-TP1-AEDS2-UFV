Well the Lone Ranger and Tonto  
They are ridin down the line  
Fixin evrybodys troubles  
Evrybodys cept mine  
Somebody musta tol em  
That I was doin fine  
  
Oh you five and ten cent women  
With nothin in your heads  
I got a real gal Im lovin  
And Lord Ill love her till Im dead  
Go away from my door and my window too  
Right now  
  
Lord I aint goin down to no race track  
See no sports car run  
I dont have no sports car  
And I dont even care to have one  
I can walk anytime around the block  
  
Well the wind keeps ablowin me  
Up and down the street  
With my hat in my hand  
And my boots on my feet  
Watch out so you dont step on me  
  
Well lookit here buddy  
You want to be like me  
Pull out your sixshooter  
And rob every bank you can see  
Tell the judge I said it was all right  
Yes
