You think Im pretty  
Without any makeup on  
You think Im funny  
When I tell the punch line wrong  
I know you get me  
So Ill let my walls come down down  
  
Before you met me  
I was alright but things were kinda heavy  
You brought me to life now every February  
Youll be my valentine valentine  
  
Lets go all the way tonight  
No regrets just love  
We can dance until we die  
You and I  
Well be young forever  
  
You make me  
Feel like Im living a teenage dream  
The way you turn me on  
I cant sleep  
Lets runaway And dont ever look back  
Dont ever look back  
  
My heart stops when you look at me  
Just one touch  
Now baby I believe this is real  
So take a chance and dont ever look back  
Dont ever look back  
  
We drove to Cali  
And got drunk on the beach  
Got a motel and  
Built a fort out of sheets  
I finally found you  
My missing puzzle piece  
Im complete  
  
Lets go all the way tonight  
No regrets just love  
We can dance until we die  
You and I  
Well be young forever  
  
You make me  
Feel like Im living a teenage dream  
The way you turn me on  
I cant sleep  
Lets runaway And dont ever look back  
Dont ever look back  
  
My heart stops when you look at me  
Just one touch  
Now baby I believe this is real  
So take a chance and dont ever look back  
Dont ever look back  
  
Im a get your heart racing  
In my skintight jeans  
Be a teenage dream tonight  
  
Let you put your hands on me  
In my skintight jeans  
Be a teenage dream tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight  
  
You make me  
Feel like Im living a teenage dream  
The way you turn me on  
I cant sleep  
Lets runaway And dont ever look back  
Dont ever look back  
  
My heart stops when you look at me  
Just one touch  
Now baby I believe this is real  
So take a chance and dont ever look back  
Dont ever look back  
  
Im a get your heart racing  
In my skintight jeans  
Be a teenage dream tonight  
  
Let you put your hands on me  
In my skintight jeans  
Be a teenage dream tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight
