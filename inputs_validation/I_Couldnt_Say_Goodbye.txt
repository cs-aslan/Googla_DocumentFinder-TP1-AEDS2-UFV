I watch you as youre sleeping  
As Im standing at the door  
I dont want to let you go  
But I cant hold on anymore  
I just cant find the strength  
To say Im leaving you  
Its over now its over now  
And theres nothing I can do  
I couldnt say goodbye  
Couldnt stand the pain  
Couldnt watch you cry  
Knowing that your heart would break  
So I let you sleep  
Till the morning light  
When you wake up and you read the note I write  
Telling you that I  
I couldnt say goodbye  
Im walking down this rainy street  
Thinking youre awake by now  
As you read my letter  
And the tears fall from your eyes  
Just know I tried to make it work  
It just wasnt meant to be  
I needed you I needed you  
But not the way you needed me  
I couldnt say goodbye  
Couldnt stand the pain  
Couldnt watch you cry  
Knowing that your heart would break  
So I let you sleep  
Till the morning light  
When you wake up and you read the note I write  
Telling you that I  
I couldnt say goodbye  
I didnt mean to hurt you  
I didnt want to make you cry  
Its over now yes its over now  
I just couldnt say goodbye  
I couldnt say goodbye  
Couldnt stand the pain  
Couldnt watch you cry  
Knowing that your heart would break  
So I let you sleep  
Till the morning light  
When you wake up and you read the note I write  
Telling you that I  
I couldnt say goodbye
