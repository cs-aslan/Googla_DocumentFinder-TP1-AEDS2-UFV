After midnight were gonna let it all hang down  
After midnight were gonna chugalug and shout  
Were gonna stimulate some action  
Were gonna get some satisfaction  
Were gonna find out what it is all about  
After midnight were gonna let it all hang down  
  
After midnight were gonna shake your tambourine  
After midnight its all gonna be peaches and cream  
Were gonna cause talk and suspicion  
Were gonna give an exhibition  
Were gonna find out what it is all about  
After midnight were gonna let it all hang down  
  
After midnight were gonna let it all hang down  
  
After midnight were gonna shake your tambourine  
After midnight its all gonna be peaches and cream  
Were gonna cause talk and suspicion  
Were gonna give an exhibition  
Were gonna find out what it is all about  
After midnight were gonna let it all hang down  
  
After midnight were gonna let it all hang down  
After midnight were gonna let it all hang down  
After midnight were gonna let it all hang down  
After midnight were gonna let it all hang down
