GIVE ME A LINE  
And pour me wine  
Ill do the Devils daughter  
Fill my glass and kick your ass  
Ill do it any time  
Oh I dont want no Holy rollers  
On you knees  
I dont need  
Theres no time to waste tonight  
No dont hold me rollers  
Cause I might die tonight  
Its come down to blows  
I am  wasted and out of order  
With a bloody nose  
Oh I dont want no Holy rollers  
Demon swill with a thirst to kill  
Ill do it anytime  
Theres no time to waste tonight  
On your knees  
No dont hold me rollers  
Howl at the moon in the night  
Cause I might die tonight  
I dont need  
Wasted boys feeling no pain  
Im the devil alright  
Just give me shooters and that demon cocaine  
Im a wasted white  
White boys better  
Run for you lives  
Its do or die die  
Ill tell you why  
Rather die that get civilized  
Wasted white boys ride free and Id  
Oh let me ride
