Ive been tongue tied  
A little shy  
But youre the reason why  
Ive been nervous  
Inside  
But youre the reason why  
Because  
  
Chorus  
Im just sitting here thinking  
Thinking about you  
Thinking about your every move  
As you can see  
Lately  
Youve been on my mind  
All the time  
  
You got me frozen  
With your smile  
Staring in your eyes  
  
Its just a crush  
I know this  
But I know its  
Hopeless  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh yeah  
Youre pretty much  
Always on my mind  
On my mind yeah  
I think about you  
Constantly  
Id love it if youd  
Love me  
But  
  
Chorus  
  
All the time  
Yeah
