The rain falls hard on a humdrum town  
This town has dragged you down  
Oh the rain falls hard on a humdrum town  
This town has dragged you down  
Oh no and everybodys got to live their life  
And God knows Ive got to live mine  
God knows Ive got to live mine  
William William it was really nothing  
William William it was really nothing  
It was your life  
  
How can you stay with a fat girl wholl say  
Oh Would you like to marry me  
And if you like you can buy the ring  
She doesnt care about anything  
Would you like to marry me  
And if you like you can buy the ring  
I dont dream about anyone  except myself  
Oh William William it was really nothing  
William William
