Baby when I think about about about  
The day that we first met the day that we first met  
Wasnt lookin for what I found  
But I found you  
And Im bound to by happiness in being around you  
  
Chorus  
Im glad when Im makin love to you  
Im glad for the way you make me feel  
I love it cause you seem to blow my mind every time  
Im glad when I walk you hold my hand  
Im happy that you know how to be a man  
Im glad that you came into my life

I dig the way that you get down  
You get down for bout  
And you still know how to hold me  
And you still know how to hold me  
Perfect blend masculine

Chorus  
  
Im glad that you turned out to be  
That certain someone special  
Who makes this life worth living  
Im glad youre here just loving me  
So say that you wont leave  
Cause since the day you came
