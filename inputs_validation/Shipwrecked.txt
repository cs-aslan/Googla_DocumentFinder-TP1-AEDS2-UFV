Im a million miles from anywhere where can I be  
Somewhere out on the ocean  
Just take a look out on the horizon what can you see  
Theres nothing there for me  
  
I feel shipwrecked I might as well be shipwrecked  
Im helpless and alone drifting out to sea  
I cant believe what you said to me  
  
Even standing on the corner of a busy city street  
I still feel so lonely  
Why do you say you want to be with me  
But the next day say you dont  
  
Im shipwrecked I might as well be shipwrecked  
Im helpless and alone drifting out to sea  
I cant believe what you said to me  
Without you I feel shipwrecked  
But I cant let it show  
A million miles away from anywhere ooh ooh ohh  
  
Is it my imagination  
Or is it getting darker are the waves getting higher  
Im a million miles from anywhere  
A million miles from anything I know  
  
You know thats why Im shipwrecked  
I might as well be shipwrecked  
Im helpless and alone drifting out to sea  
I cant believe what you said to me  
You know thats why Im shipwrecked shipwrecked  
Losing my direction  
Please come and rescue me shipwrecked  
Shipwrecked  
Shipwrecked  
Shipwrecked  
Shipwrecked
