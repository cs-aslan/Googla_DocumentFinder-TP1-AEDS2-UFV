If you dont really love her  
Dont take her from me  
Because I really love her  
And need her desperately  
  
If you dont plan to give  
All your love for as long as you should live  
Dont take her from me  
  
If shes not something special  
Dont take her from me  
Because shes something special to me  
Cant you see  
  
If shes not number one  
Every day till your whole life is done  
Dont take her from me  
  
There is only one for me  
She is all there could ever be  
So dont take her from me
