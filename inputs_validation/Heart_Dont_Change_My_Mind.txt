We said wed try again but tryin not enough  
Actin like strangers aint no way of making love  
Its never gonna work its time we stopped pretending  
Time to turn the page all stories need an ending  
It makes no sense to stay  
Living my life in yesterday  
Im leaving Im leaving  
And Im begging you  
Heart dont change my mind  
Oh heart be strong this time  
And try to help me tell him goodbye  
Itll only bring pain for us to stay  
Oh heart its hard for you I know  
Let me let him go  
  
Dont let me think about how good it was before  
I know youd try anything to keep me from that door  
Its hard to leave him when youve loved him for so long now  
How can I walk away if hes still holding on now  
Ive found the strength today  
Look at me I can finally say  
Its over Its over  
So Im begging you  
  
Heart dont change my mind  
Oh heart be strong this time  
And try to help me tell him goodbye  
Itll only bring pain for us to stay  
Oh heart its hard for you I know  
Let me let him go  
  
It makes no sense to stay  
Sad that it has to end this way  
Its over Its over  
Heart dont change my mind  
Oh heart be strong this time  
And try to help me tell him goodbye  
Itll only bring pain for us to stay  
Oh heart its hard for you I know  
Let me let him go
