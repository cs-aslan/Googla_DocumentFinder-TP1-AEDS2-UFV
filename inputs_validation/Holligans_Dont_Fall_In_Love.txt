Vagabonds dont fall in love  
They just wheel and they deal  
So if I turn a funny colour when you kiss me  
I cant help the way that I feel  
  
Hooligans dont fall in love  
They just break up others lives  
So when I come to you on bended knee  
Dont forget my twenty other wives  
  
So why  
Turn to a life of violence and crime  
So why  
Why do you cheat and why do you lie  
  
Because theres always someone with a bigger car  
Theres always someone with a bigger cigar  
If youve been far  
Theres someone whos been further than your far  
When you make your cart you get to the start  
Theres always someone in a faster cart  
Theres always someone in a faster cart  
Theres always someone in a faster cart  
  
Gangsters dont fall in love  
They just roam from town to town  
So when we kiss and we hold and we whisper  
Please dont ever write it down  
  
Hooligans dont fall in love  
They just lie and they drink  
So if you say I wont say i will  
Then I wont I think  
  
So why  
Turn to a life of violence and crime  
So why  
Why do you cheat and why do you lie  
  
Because theres always someone with a bigger car  
Theres always someone with a bigger cigar  
If youve been far  
Theres always someone whos been further than your far  
At last youre straight and you make a new start  
Theres always someone with a better heart  
Theres always someone with a better heart  
Theres always someone with a better heart  
  
But all in all were not so bad  
We never take from our own kind  
Bads quite good when its all youve ever had  
And no bloody good sounds quite refined
