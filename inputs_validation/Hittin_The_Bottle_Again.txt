Well I dont know who or where I am  
I dont know who do give a damn  
Its a hell of a mess that Ive got me in  
Hittin the bottle again  
I cant walk so I cant go home  
No need to talk cause Im alone  
If I stay here theyre gonna lock me in  
Hittin the bottle again  
Hittin the bottle again ever than Ive drunker been  
Or is it drunker than Ive ever been hittin the bottle again  
  
 guitar   
  
Well I tried to quit for a wife of mine  
I tried to quit but I changed my mind  
Every once in awhile and a now and a then  
Hittin the bottle again  
Hittin the bottle again
