When I lay down to take my rest  
Most of the time my minds on happiness yes  
Some of the time but not for long  
I get a feeling of something thats yet to come  
I get a picture telling me whats undone  
  
Chorus  
When I find out that you dont love me honey  
When I find out that your going away  
Therell be no surprise  
Because I saw you running  
Saw you running from where I lay  
Therell be no surprise  
Because I saw you running  
Saw you running from where I lay  
  
Well Ive got an eye upon the road  
And Ive got a hand to hold my heavy load oh yes  
Ive got a man and Ive got a gun  
One is for fighting oh the other one is just for fun  
One is for fighting oh the other one is just for fun  
  
Chorus  
  
When I lay down to take my rest  
Most of the time my minds on happiness yes  
Some of the time but not for long  
I get a feeling of something thats yet to come  
I get a picture telling me whats undone  
  
ChorusRepeat x2
