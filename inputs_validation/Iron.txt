Left in the darkness  
Here on your own  
Woke up a memory  
Feeling the pain  
You cannot deny it  
Theres nothing to say  
Its all that you need to find the way  
  
Oh Damn the war is coming  
Oh Damn you feel you want it  
Oh Damn just bring it on today  
  
You cant live without the fire  
Its the heat that makes you strong  
Cause youre born to live and fight it all the way  
You can hide what lies inside you  
Its the only thing you know  
Youre embracing that never walk away  
Dont walk away  
  
Dont walk away  
Dont walk away  
Dont walk away  
  
Raised in this madness youre on your own  
It made you fearless nothing to lose  
Dreams are a drug here they get in your way  
Thats what you need to fight day by day  
  
Oh Damn the war is coming  
Oh Damn you feel you want it  
Oh Damn just bring it on today  
  
You cant live without the fire  
Its the heat that makes you strong  
Cause youre born to live and fight it all the way  
You can hide what lies inside you  
Its the only thing you know  
Youre embracing that never walk away  
Dont walk away  
  
You need not to fear us  
unless youre a dark heart  
a vile one who preys on the innocent  
I promise you cant hide forever in the empty darkness  
for well hunt you down  
like the animals you are  
and pull you in the very bowels of hell  
  
Oh Damn the war is coming  
Oh Damn you feel you want it  
Oh Damn just bring it on today  
  
You cant live without the fire  
Its the heat that makes you strong  
Cause youre born to live and fight it all the way  
You can hide what lies inside you  
Its the only thing you know  
Youre embracing that never walk away  
Dont walk away  
  
Dont walk away  
Dont walk away  
Dont walk away
