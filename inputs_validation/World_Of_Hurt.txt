Aggravation fuelin me  
Money powered hypocrisy  
I have no feelings youre much the same  
We have no feelings we feel no pain  
  
I am numb to all I see  
This the way it has to be  
Gone is hope gone is need  
I know stone dont bleed  
  
Whats it worth if I die  
Whats the reason they all cry  
I have no feelings too much the same  
Not my problem I feel no blame  
  
We are blind and we are cold  
Were afraid of growing old  
We are numb to all we see  
Nothing sacred  
  
Backs turned to madness  
Backs to misery and I put the  
Brush to the canvas  
An paint a world  
Paint my world of  
  
Hurt  
World of hurt Of hurt  
  
We are blind and we are cold  
Still afraid of growing old  
We are numb to all we see  
Nothing sacred  
  
Hurt  
Paints my world of hurt  
Paints my world in my world of  
In my world of hurt
