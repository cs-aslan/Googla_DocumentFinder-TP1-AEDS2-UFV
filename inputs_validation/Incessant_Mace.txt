Hes afraid hell suffer his fathers fate  
Two sets of silver records and plates  
Two bloody hands and bleeding hearts  
Dont feel its not to late to start  
  
Only the photographs on your wall  
Are chained and down your hall  
Reminding you of all the days  
When you collected hell to pay  
Well hell to pay  
I said its not too late  
Not its not too late  
incessant mace  
Oh God I can see it you know its incessant mace  
  
Leisure slacks and broken backs  
Are what you get for piling stacks  
Beneath your treasure chest  
You wonder why youre under stress
