Split split in two  
Somethin else  
Shed precious skin  
Save yourself  
Bleed afterbirth  
What youre worth  
Yes yes of course  
Its gonna hurt  
  
Nature is violent  
The nature of the beast is violent  
You know that and someone else  
Another one that wasnt me no  
  
Its getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
Its getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
I cant believe I could never remember which one you are  
Its getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
  
Thrive just become  
Your disease  
Leave them behind  
You are free  
Hey what you want  
You deserve  
Yes yes of course  
This is gonna hurt  
  
Its getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
Its getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
I cant believe I could never remember which one you are  
Its getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
  
I just dont know anymore  
I just dont know anymore
