I know a dark secluded place  
A place where no one knows your face  
A glass of wine a fast embrace  
Its called Hernandos Hideaway away  
  
All you see are silhouettes  
And all you hear are castanets  
And no one cares how late it gets  
Not at Hernandos hideaway away  
  
At the Golden Finger Bowl or anyplace you go  
You will meet your Uncle Max and everyone you know  
But if you go to the spot that I am thinking of  
You will be free to gaze at me and talk of love  
Just knock three times and whisper low  
That you and I were sent by Joe  
Then strike and match and you will know  
Youre in Hernandos hideaway away  
  
I know a dark secluded place  
A place where no one ever knows your face  
Wine is fine with a fast embrace  
Hernandos Hideaway away  
  
At the Golden Finger Bowl or anyplace you go  
You will meet your Uncle Max and everyone you know  
But if you go to the spot that I am thinking of  
You will be free to gaze at me and talk of love  
Just knock three times and whisper low  
That you and I were sent by Joe  
Then strike and match and you will know  
Youre in Hernandos hideaway
