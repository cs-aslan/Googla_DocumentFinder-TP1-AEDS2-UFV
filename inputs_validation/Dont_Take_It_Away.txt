I been lookin for you all night long darlin  
Youve got to talk to me  
I wanna tell you how wrong Ive been  
And I wont do it again  
  
You know that woman didnt mean a thing to me  
I hope I dont embarrass you too much  
Here in front of all your friends  
Im gonna get down on my knees  
  
Please let me make it  
Please I can give you up  
Cause youve made love  
So good for me so long  
  
Dont take it away  
Cause love dont come easy  
Darlin Im sorry  
I stepped over the line  
  
Dont take it away  
Dont make me go crazy  
Cause I would follow you  
To the ends of my mind  
  
From now on  
Im gonna be the kind of man  
That you can lean on  
  
And when the waters of life  
Get a little too rough or a little too deep  
Im gonna be your steppin stone  
  
And oh I remember all those nights  
That you used to take right a hold of me  
And youd hold on  
  
Please let me make it  
Please I can give you up  
Cause youve made love  
So good for me so long  
  
Dont take it away  
Cause love dont come easy  
Darlin Im sorry  
I stepped over the line  
  
Dont take it away  
Dont make me go crazy  
Cause I would follow you  
To the ends of my mind
