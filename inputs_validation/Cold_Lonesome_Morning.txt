One of these cold lonesome mornings youre gonna kill me  
Im gonna lay there and Im gonna die  
You will soon give me pain enough to fill me  
Cause Im gone past doin any good to cry  
And the warm sunshine is like a stranger  
Theres a cruel violation with the dawn  
Lord my pain cant stand illumination  
And one of these cold lonesome mornings Ill be gone  
One of these cold lonesome mornings dark and early  
Before a wild bird sings Im gonna fly  
While its still dark and Im still reachin for you  
Ill wake up and I cant cry  
But I know my heart cant stand another tremor  
Now its holding together I dont know  
But just before the dawnings first glimmer  
One of these cold lonesome mornings Im gonna go  
Yes one of these cold lonesome mornings youre gonna kill me unverified
