Come with me and lets go wander  
Far beyond the wild blue yonder  
Out where stars roam free  
Though the journeys far from breezy  
Stick with me Ill make it easy  
You can depend on me  
  
Yeah theres a long road before us  
And its a hard road indeed  
Bur darlin I swear  
Ill get us there  
Wherever the trail may lead  
  
Once we cross that far horizon  
Life is bound to be surprisin  
But well take it day by day  
Never mind the wind and weather  
If we walk that trail together  
Somehow well find our way  
  
Yeah theres a long road before us  
And its a hard road indeed  
Bur darlin I vow  
Well get through somehow  
Wherever the trail may lead  
  
Cant tell you when well be there  
It may take all our lives  
Were headin for that great unknown  
Well soon be walkin free there  
But til that day arrives  
At least we wont be travellin alone  
  
And theres a long road before us  
And its a hard road indeed  
Bur darlin dont fear  
Cause Ill be right here  
To give you the strength you need  
And through the whole ride  
Ill be by your side  
Wherever the trail may lead
