Intro  
I love to be a British queen  
I am Victoria you see  
Now wheres my British butler  
With my British cup of tea  
Tea is not from Britain maam  
From India it was brought  
Yes for your cuppa thousands died  
And many wars were fought  
  
Chorus  
British things my British things  
It seems that tea is not  
British things my British things  
Can I sweeten it a jot  
  
Verse 1  
Do tell me sugars British though  
No its Caribbean imported  
For sugar in your cup of tea  
Slaverys been supported  
I know its wrong your majesty  
But slaves in Africa  
Worked hard in fields of sugar cane  
To sweeten up your char  
  
Chorus  
British things ah British things  
I thought that there were many  
British things ah British things  
  
Afraid theres hardly any  
  
Verse 2  
You know your British cotton vest  
Whats wrong with it  
Explain  
The cottons from America  
And picked by slaves again  
  
Verse 3  
Your empires built on fighting wars  
Thats how your incomes swollen  
Your British things are from abroad  
And most are frankly stolen  
  
Hook  
Whatever next Go on Pray tell  
Our British queen is foreign as well  
  
Verse 4  
Its true I am of foreign descent  
And your husband Albert A German gent  
At least Ive got a British name  
Victorias Latin thats a shame  
  
Chorus  
British things ah British things  
There are no we declare  
All our favourite British things  
Seem to come from elsewhere
