911 its a critical emergency  
Better run run run come and charge him with the 143  
Told me his world was mine  
Such a beautiful lie  
Now hes done done done and this love is no more for me  
  
Hand inna the air as he waves me goodbye  
He said he care but no tears in his eyes  
And ask me if Im alright  
Nigga is you blind  
  
Like a bullet your love me hit me to core  
I was flying til you knocked me to the floor  
And its so foolish how you keep me wanting more  
Im screaming murderer how could you murder us  
I call it murder no love allowed  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Fifofum like the sky has fallen down on me  
Numb numb numb hes so cold he doesnt feel a thing  
  
Broken heart was the case  
Wanna put him away  
Hes the only one one one I ever let get the best of me  
  
Hand inna the air as he waved me goodbye  
He said he care but no tears in his eyes  
And asked me if Im alright  
Nigga is you blind  
  
Like a bullet your love me hit me to core  
I was flying til you knocked me to the floor  
And its so foolish how you keep me wanting more  
Im screaming murderer how could you murder us  
I call it murder no love allowed  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Usually Im the one that they cry for  
But this man hes the one that Id die for  
Mama said theres no cause for a rebel  
Do you hear me now  
  
Oh oh oh no love no love no love allowed  
  
Like a bullet your love me hit me to core  
I was flying til you knocked me to the floor  
And its so foolish how you keep me wanting more  
Im screaming murderer how could you murder us  
I call it murder no love allowed
