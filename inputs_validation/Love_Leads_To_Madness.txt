Do I feel alright  
Ill go anywhere you say you want to to take me  
Save me run awayayay steal awayayay  
Cause I feel alright  
Ill do anything you say you want to make me  
Take me far awayayay run awayayay  
  
Weve been up all night  
Tryin to avoid a situation  
Hold me let me feel your way  
Cause I want to stay  
Let them all start talkin  
We wont give ourselves away  
  
Our love leads to madness  
Our love leads to madness  
Our love leads to madness  
  
Do you feel alright  
An can you see me when youre lookin in your mirror  
Crazy try to find a way so your heart dont pay  
Run awayayay  
Dont you give yourself away  
  
Our love leads to madness  
Our love leads to madness  
Our love leads to madness  
Our love leads to madness
