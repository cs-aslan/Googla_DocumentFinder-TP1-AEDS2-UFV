If I ever find truth Im gonna let you know  
If I ever find faith Im gonna sit in every bit of its afterglow  
If I ever find a way to bring love here today  
You better bet your life that this is what Ill say  
Give it if youve got it  
Get it if you dont  
  
Take my hand in the meantime  
And lets walk into the sunshine  
Everybody got something that they want to sing about laugh about cry about  
Its true  
For me its you  
  
Give it away give it away give it away  
If its something that you got layin round your house  
Man let me tell ya if aint a kiss  
Its something youll never miss  
Give it to somebody that dont have a thing layin round like a prayer or a
sweet sound  
Give it if youve got it  
Get it if you dont  
  
Take my hand in the meantime  
Lets walk into the sunshine  
Everybody got something that they want to sing about laugh about cry about  
Its true  
For me its you  
  
Na na na na na na na na na  
For me its you  
Na na na na na na na na na  
For me its you  
Na na na na na na na na na  
For me its you  
Na na na na na na na na na  
  
Give it to somebody that dont have a thing  
Aint got soft shoes to dance or a love song to sing  no  
Get yourself on the right track  
Let somebody ride your back for a while  
  
If I ever find truth Im gonna let you know  
You better bet your life if this is what Im gonna say just give it away  
You cant take it where youre goin anyway  
  
Take my hand in the meantime  
And lets walk into the sunshine  
Everybody got something they want to sing about laugh about cry about its
true  
For me its you  
Na na na na na na na na
