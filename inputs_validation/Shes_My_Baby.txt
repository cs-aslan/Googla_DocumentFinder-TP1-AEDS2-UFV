Shes my baby She belongs to me  
But yesterday she walked home all alone  
Everybody else looks at my baby  
Then they wandered over to me  
But babys feelin bad today  
She said shes thinking of goin away  
Oh baby Im cryin And my bodys flyin  
But I remember you  
Shes my baby Aint that something  
But I know she belongs to you  
Yesterday was another day when I  
Saw your baby walkin home alone  
Im feelin sorry  
I called you but I  
I guess that I forgot your name  
Babys feelin bad today  
She said shes thinkin of goin away  
But shes just like lightning  
She goes right through you  
Then you know youll never  
Be the same  
Now everybody looks  
All around the corner  
Just to see your baby  
Walkin home  
  
Shes my baby  
Aint that something  
But I know that she belongs to you  
She belongs to you
