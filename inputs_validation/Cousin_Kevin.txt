Were on our own cousin  
All alone cousin  
Lets think of a game to play  
Now the grownups have all gone away  
You wont be much fun  
Being blind deaf and dumb  
But Ive noone to play with today  
Do you know how to play hideandseek  
To find me it would take you a week  
But tied to that chair  
You wont go anywhere  
Theres a lot I can do with a freak  
How would you feel if I  
Turned on the bath  
Ducked your head under  
And started to laugh  
What would you do if I shut you outside  
To stand in the rain  
And catch cold so you died  
  
Im the school bully  
The classroom cheat  
The nasty play friend  
You ever could meet  
Ill stick pins in your fingers  
And tread on your feet  
  
Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm  
Would change your expression  
To one of alarm  
Ill drag you round by a lock of your hair  
Or give you a push  
At the top of the stairs  
  
Im the school bully  
The classroom cheat  
The nasty play friend  
You ever could meet  
Ill put glass in your dinner  
And spikes in your seat
