Ive met a girl or two in my lifetime and Ive loved a few but not the right
time  
  
I think Im a wastin my time lovin anyone but you  
  
You got a hold on me I just cant seem to break free  
  
I walk a girl to town and start to fool around but honey youre the rock in my
shoe  
  
I stroll into the night spots thinkin that Im something real hot  
  
I got a pretty girl and shes got a lot but I know she aint true  
  
Its just not the same Im playin a fools game  
  
Oh when I start to dance and try to make romance honey youre the rock in my
shoe  
  
Now my heart has reached that decision cause my mind keeps havin a vision  
  
No  hers and his and and I guess I always knew  
  
Youd make the bells ring and pull my heart strings  
  
Im walkin down the aisle with the great big smile  
  
Cause there aint no rocks in my shoe  
  
  
  
Theres always a rock in my shoe when I walk with someone new  
  
I try to find love in anothers arms but it seems I just dream of you  
  
Now my heart has reached  
  
Im walkin down the aisle
