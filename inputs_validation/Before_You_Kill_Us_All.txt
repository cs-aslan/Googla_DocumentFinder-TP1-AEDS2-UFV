Must be doin something wrong baby I dont know  
But the gold fish are floating at the top of the bowl  
And the dog he wont eat he just lays around  
All night long he makes a lonesome sound  
  
I know I had it coming and its all my fault  
But baby come back  
Before you kill us all  
  
The way the plants are dyin youd swear its fall  
Looks just like autumn up and down the hall  
And I talk to em baby like you sposed to do  
But theyre tired of hearing how Im missin you  
  
And I know you told me not to call  
But baby come back  
Before you kill us all  
  
Well its a desperate situation  
I got a strong will to survive  
But if this place is any indication  
I may not make it out on time  
  
Well its an eerie feeling in the still of the night  
Knowin that the cats down to three more lives  
Youve turned as all into nervous wrecks  
We just sit around and wanderin whos goin to be next  
  
And I know I had it coming and its all my fault  
But baby come back  
Before you kill us all  
  
Baby come back  
Before you kill us all  
  
Baby come back  
Baby come back  
Before you kill us all  
  
Baby come back
