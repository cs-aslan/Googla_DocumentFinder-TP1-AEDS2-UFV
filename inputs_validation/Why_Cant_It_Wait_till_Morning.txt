Why cant it wait til morning  
We can talk about it then  
Cause Ive had a drink too many  
And my troubles well I aint got any  
  
Why cant it wait til daylight  
Things will seem much clearer then  
Im tired and my eyes are weary  
And I just want you lying here with me  
  
So close your eyes  
Ill make it oh so nice  
  
Well I dont wanna think about what weve said  
And I dont wanna know why we hurt ourselves  
Cause I just wanna hold you so close to me  
Itll take care of itself and I wanna sleep  
  
So why cant it wait til next time  
Cause that time may never come  
Stay here with your arms around me  
Youre going nowhere without me  
  
So close your eyes  
Ill make it oh so nice for you
