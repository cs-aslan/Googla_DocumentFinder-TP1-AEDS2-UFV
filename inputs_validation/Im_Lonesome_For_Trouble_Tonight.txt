Hes nothin but trouble but hes always on my mind  
I tried all I know to do to leave trouble behind  
I can hardly live without him I even miss the fights  
Im lonesome for trouble tonight  
Im lonesome for trouble tonight  
And I ache for troubles arms to hold me tight  
Everytime we get together seems like nothin comes out right  
Lord Im lonesome for trouble tonight  
 steel   
Unhappy when Im with him Im unhappy when Im not  
Ive tried so hard to get along but troubles all Ive got  
Its hard to have somebody on your mind but out of sight  
Yes Im lonesome for trouble tonight  
Im lonesome for trouble tonight
