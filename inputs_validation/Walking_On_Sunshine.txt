I cant wait wanna see  
How this night is gonna be  
Just a touch away  
From a feeling that is here to stay  
We can make it last forever baby  
Our love will stand the test of time  
In the middle of our world  
Ill be waiting for you to be all mine  
  
Were walkin on sunshine  
In the middle of the night  
And it feels like Im somewhere above the sky I I I  
  
Take my hand and close your eyes  
Say the sweet little things that make me cry  
Catch my tears with a kiss  
These special moments do exist  
We can make it last forever baby  
Our love will stand the test of time  
In the middle of our world  
Ill be waiting for you to be all mine  
  
Were walkin on sunshine  
In the middle of the night  
And it feels like Im somewhere above the sky I I I  
  
Lets take a chance and try love baby  
No Im not givin up  
Till you tell me that youll be in my life  
Until the end of time  
  
Were walkin on sunshine  
In the middle of the night  
And it feels like Im somewhere above the sky I I I  
  
Lets take a chance and try love baby  
No Im not givin up  
Till you tell me that youll be in my life  
Until the end of time  
  
Were walkin on sunshine  
In the middle of the night  
And it feels like Im somewhere above the sky I I I  
Were walkin on sunshine  
In the middle of the night  
And it feels like Im somewhere above the sky I I I
