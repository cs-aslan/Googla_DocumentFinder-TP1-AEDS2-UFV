Workin in the city  
This towns got no pity  
Bossman owns a heart of stone  
Im on the line its overtime  
Ill tell you its a crime  
They get me by the hour  
By my blue collar  
Youre squeezin me too tight  
Its Friday night  
Lets run tonight  
Till the morning light  
  
Chorus  
Keep on runnin keep on hidin  
Keep on runnin away  
Its okay its alright  
Its okay its alright  
And if it makes you want to jump and shout go ahead  
Keep on runnin keep on hidin  
Keep on runnin away its okay  
  
Crusin with my baby  
Think we just might maybe  
Find some back seat rhythm and blues  
Radio down we go down we go  
  
Chorus
