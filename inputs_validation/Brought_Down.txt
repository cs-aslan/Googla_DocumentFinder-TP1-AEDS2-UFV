I was seldom sober in nineteen hundred and fifthyfour  
Hey baby maybe cause my baby had a baby by me  
And I was still drinking dry gin  
While you cried no no more  
And you were lyin and acryin  
And your tears fell dying on the floor  
  
And Im brought down  
And I dont think I can get up again  
Brought down  
My heart is hurt again  
  
You were the fine lady in the early mornings  
That always painted her toes  
And lookin towards the east  
Youd say hello to the early dawn before they rose  
And you were the love lady  
That always hung up her finely pressed clothes  
And sayin so long to the western sundown  
You taught me how it grows  
  
And Im brought down  
And I dont think I can get up again  
Brought down  
And you just hurt my heart again  
Brought down  
Brought down  
Im brought down  
  
Brought down  
Brought down  
Brought down  
Down  
  
Im brought down  
And I dont think I can get up again  
Im brought down  
Im hurt its bad  
Brought down  
God its a shame theres no more Dr Strangely strange  
Brought down  
And Im brou  
Brought down  
ught down  
Brought down  
And there must be more to life than this
