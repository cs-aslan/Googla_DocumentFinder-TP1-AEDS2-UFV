You know who you are  
This is for you  
  
Hmmm yeah ooh yeah ohh  
  
I thought I knew who you were  
I see now you were a lesson to learn  
And all I am to you now is a bridge thats been burned  
Now I was the first to believe  
I made you part of my musical dream  
And your thanks to me came without an apology yeah  
  
We wrote Loving Me 4 Me dont Walk Away  
Cant Hold Us Down all part of our history  
Dont forget Infatuation Im a Fighter  
Feeling Underappreciated  
  
Yeah this song is for you to remind you  
That I moved on sang my songs  
Ive got no regrets  
  
Mmm oh  
  
Hope it all was worth it uh  
Looks like I didnt need you  
Still got the album out  
Ha
