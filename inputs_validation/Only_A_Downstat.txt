Only a downstat  
Personality problem  
He would say things like I love you  
And cry real tears  
Met him in some place  
Like a home for old mothers  
Where the cure is always death  
But noone ever leaves  
He wore a number 7  
Badge on his collar  
He would show it with pride  
And say it means I can feel  
Hed bribe the warders  
To send letters to someone  
Who didnt even know his name  
But said shed read them anyway  
And in the evening   
He writes poetry for people  
Who deny hes alive  
And say Ill mention that name  
A violator of the law of no feelings  
They should be put in the chair  
Until their eyes come in   
If you have reasons  
I might sell you my time  
Ill leave it under the stairs  
In a body of mine  
Old memories are slowly fading out of me  
We are the unknowns we are all you need
