The sky above is filled with stars the road is long  no cars are in sight  
With one hand on the wheel Ive been driving all day I can drive all night  
Im headed for home with one thing on my mind yeah  
Every hotel I have seen has arborright chairs arbor right dreams  
Office parties and wedding pals and tacky pictures on the walls  
  
Pretty barmaid to and fro the barman plays the songs we know  
She gets into twist and shout and its boozing time and Im down and out  
  
Thats my second home yeah what more can I say lord  
  
You should never say trust me  
Its already been done  
Its already been done  
Beneath the seas beneath the trees and under the sun  
  
Never say trust me  
My faith in you is all you need  
Love is all I need  
  
The sky above is filled with stars may god bless you is all I can say  
Cats and dogs and baby smiles will drive my loneliness away  
  
What will be will be yeah  
That is all that I know girl  
  
You should never say trust me  
Cause I know youll be there  
Yes I know youll be there  
  
Ill be a right as rain can be  
This is our love affair  
  
Never say trust me  
My faith in you is all you need  
Love is all I need  
  
You should never say trust me  
Its already been done  
Its already been done  
Beneath the seas beneath the trees  
And under the sun  
And under the sun
