Many a month has come and gone  
Since Ive wandered from my home  
In those Oklahoma hills  
Where I was born  
  
Many a page of my life has turned  
Many lessons I have learned  
And I feel like in those hills  
Where I belong  
  
Way down yonder in the Indian nation  
Ridin my pony on the reservation  
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born  
  
Way down yonder in the Indian nation  
A cowboys life is my occupation  
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born  
  
But as I sit here today  
Many miles I am away  
From the place I rode my pony  
Through the draw  
  
Where the oak and blackjack trees  
Kiss the playful prairie breeze  
And I feel back in those hills  
Where I belong  
  
Now as I turn life a page  
To the land of the great Osage  
In those Oklahoma hills  
Where I was born  
  
Where the black oil rolls and flows  
And the snow white cotton grows  
And I feel like in those hills  
Where I belong
