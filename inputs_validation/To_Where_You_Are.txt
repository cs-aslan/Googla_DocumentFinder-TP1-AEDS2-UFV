Who can say for certain  
Maybe youre still here  
I feel you all around me  
Your memorys so clear  
Deep in the stillness  
I can hear you speak  
Youre still an inspiration  
Can it be  
That you are mine  
Forever love  
And you are watching over me from up above  
Fly me up to where you are  
Beyond the distant star  
I wish upon tonight  
To see you smile  
If only for awhile to know youre there  
A breath aways not far  
To where you are  
Are you gently sleeping  
Here inside my dream  
And isnt faith believing  
All power cant be seen  
As my heart holds you  
Just one beat away  
I cherish all you gave me everyday  
Cause you are mine  
Forever love  
Watching me from up above  
And I believe  
That angels breathe  
And that love will live on and never leave  
Fly me up  
To where you are  
Beyond the distant star  
I wish upon tonight  
To see you smile  
If only for awhile  
To know youre there  
A breath aways not far  
To where you are  
I know youre there  
A breath aways not far  
To where you are
