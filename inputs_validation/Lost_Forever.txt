All your life youve been slipping and sliding  
Trying to find a way  
Sun wont shine but now its your time to pay  
Theres no turning back as you look  
The hangman in the eye  
  
Now hells just your death away  
  
Its too late to say you care  
When theres evil in your stare  
You say youre not to blame  
In your head voices mocking every prayer  
  
Remember the face you saw  
That once was you  
Spirit high theres no way that  
You could lose  
Give him rope they said  
As you look the hangman in the eye  
Now around your neck you feel  
The noose  
  
In your head voices mocking every prayer  
Now youre lost forever  
  
Im burning with fire its time to  
Leave or get out  
Im burning in fire I cant take  
No more so get out  
Im burning with fire the wheels of  
Steel will grind you  
Burning in fire this time  
Youre lost forever  
Lost forever  
  
Theres an evil in your stare  
Lost forever  
And hells just a breath away  
Youre lost forever  
And theres no way out you burn  
With fire its time to get out  
Get out get out  
And theres no way out  
Lost forever
