Forever  
Its been hours  
Seems like days  
Since you went away  
  
And all I do is check the screen  
To see if youre okay  
You dont answer when I phone  
Guess you want to be left alone  
  
So Im sending you my heart my soul  
And this is what Ill say  
  
PreChorus  
Im sorry  
Oh so sorry  
Cant you give me one more chance  
To make it all up to you  
  
Chorus 2  
Email my heart  
And say our love will never die and I  
I know youre out there  
And I know that you still care I know you care  
Email me back and say our love will stay alive  
Foreveremail my heart  
  
I can see you in my mind  
Coming on the line  
And opening this letter  
That Ive sent a hundred times  
  
Heres a picture of us two us two  
I look so good on you on you  
And cant you please forgive me  
For the hurt I put you through  
  
PreChorus  
  
Chorus  
  
PreChorus  
  
Chorus  
  
Forever email my
