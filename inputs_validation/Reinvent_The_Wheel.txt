Seems like everywhere I look  
Theres another version of the same old book  
And someone telling me its new  
Every song on my radio sounds like one I heard a long time ago  
Different windows same old view  
Yeah  
Uhhuh  
  
All the clothes in the magazines I could swear Ive already seen  
In my closet years ago  
Hairstyles and supermalls youve seen one well youve seen them all  
Tell me something I dont know  
  
But in a world thats mostly imitation  
Its hard to recognize the real  
It takes a brave heart to resist temptation  
To take the easy way and reinvent the wheel  
Yeah  
  
A friend of mine finds Mr Right every other Friday night  
At a smoky singles bar  
And she cant seem to understand why life dont go like she plans  
She goes on wishing on a star  
Yeah  
  
But in a world thats mostly imitation  
Its hard to recognize the real  
It takes a brave heart to resist temptation  
To take the easy way and reinvent the wheel  
Yeah  
  
But in a world thats mostly imitation  
Its hard to recognize the real  
It takes a brave heart to resist temptation  
To take the easy way and reinvent the wheel  
Yeah  
  
Reinvent the wheel  
Reinvent the wheel
