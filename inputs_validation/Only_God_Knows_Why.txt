Ive been sittin here trying to find myself  
I get behind myself I need to rewind myself  
Looking for the payback listening for the playback  
They say that every man bleeds just like me  
  
And I feel like number one yet Im last in line  
I watch my younger son and it helps to pass the time  
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain  
I made a couple of dollar bills still I feel the same  
  
Everybody knows my name they say it way out loud  
A lot of folks fuck with me its hard to hang out in a crowd  
I guess thats the price you pay to be some big shot like I am  
Out stretched hands and one night stands  
  
Still I cant find love and when the walls are tumbling down  
I will always be around  
Yeah  
  
And when the walls are tumbling down I will always be around  
People dont know about the things I say and do  
They dont understand about the shit Ive been through  
Its been so long since Ive been home  
  
Ive been gone Ive been gone way too long  
Maybe Ive forgotten all the things I miss  
Oh somehow I know there is more to life than this  
Ive said it too many times and I still stand firm  
  
You get what you put in and people get what the deserve  
Still I aint seen mine no I aint seen mine  
Ive been given but just aint gettin Ive been walkin that thin line  
So I think Ill keep a walking with my head held high  
  
Ill keep moving on and only God knows why  
Only God Only God Only God knows why  
Only God knows why why why why  
Only God knows why  
  
Take it to the river hey  
Take it to the river hey
