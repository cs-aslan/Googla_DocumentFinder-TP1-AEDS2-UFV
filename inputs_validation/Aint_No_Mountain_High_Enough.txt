Will  
Listen baby  
Aint no mountain high  
Aint no valley low  
Aint no river wide enough baby  
  
Kelly  
If you need me call me  
No matter where you are  
No matter how far  
  
Will  
Dont worry baby  
  
Kelly  
Ill be there in a hurry  
You dont have to worry  
  
Both  
Cause baby there  
Aint no mountain high enough  
Aint no valley low enough  
Aint no river wide enough  
To keep me from getting to you babe  
  
Will  
Remember the day when I set you free  
I told you could always always count on me  
  
Kelly  
From that day on I made a vow  
Ill be there when you want me someday somehow  
  
Both  
Cause baby there  
Aint no mountain high enough  
Aint no valley low enough  
Aint no river wide enough  
To keep me from getting from you babe  
  
Will  
Oooo darling  
  
Kelly  
  
No wind no rain  
No winters cold  
Can stop me now  
  
Will  
Dont stop me baby  
  
Kelly  
Cause you are my goal  
Oooo baby  
  
Will while Kelly is singing  
When you are in trouble  
Ill be there on the double  
Just send for me  
  
Lots of chorus and random words  
  
Both  
Cause baby there  
Aint no mountain high enough  
Aint no valley low enough  
Aint no river wide enough  
To keep me from getting to you babe  
  
Aint no mountain high enough
