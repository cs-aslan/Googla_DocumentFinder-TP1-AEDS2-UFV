I am an earthworm following  
There is a nighthawk watching  
me crawling  
La la la la   
  
its a lonely night  
Ill take the airwaves home tonight  
crawl with me in to the hole  
Where everyone can hide  
  
Were in the wormhole  
Seeking to be safe again  
Without a single brave soul  
Leaking out tonight  
  
After the fires theres a falling rain  
Washing us free of the daily pain  
Off the hook and down the drain  
And out to the other side  
  
To where the soil is rich and muddy in the riverbed  
Feed on the urgent promise  
Of the dead tonight
