They tell me youre a shy boy  
But I want you just the same  
Dont play innocent with me  
You know its not just fun and games  
When I look into your eyes  
So much passion burns inside  
But if you need some coaxing  
I will do it  
Step by step theres nothing to it  
  
1234 come on baby say you love me  
567 times  
891011 Im just gonna keep on counting  
Until you are mine  
  
Come out of your shell boy  
You know we go like hand in glove  
Youre afraid of giving in  
But I am never giving up on your love  
And no matter what it takes  
I will steal your heart away  
Take a chance for once you wont regret it  
Want my love just come and get it
