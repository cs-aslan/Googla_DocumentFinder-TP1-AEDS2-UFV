Love that runs away from me  
Dreams that just wont let me be  
Blues that keep on botherin me  
Chains that just wont set me free  
Too far away from you and all your charms  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms  
  
Each night in dreams I see your face  
Memories time cant erase  
I awake and find you gone  
Im so blue and all alone  
So far away from lips so sweet and warm  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms  
  
That ol lonesome feelin all the time  
I know youll never be mine  
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep  
I mean vows that we just couldnt keep  
  
Too far away from you and all your charms  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms
