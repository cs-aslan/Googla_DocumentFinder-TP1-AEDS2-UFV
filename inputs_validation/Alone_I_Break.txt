Pick me up  
Been bleeding too long  
Right here right now  
Ill stop it some how  
  
I will make it go away  
Cant be here no more  
Seems this is the only way  
I will soon be gone  
These feelings will be gone  
These feelings will be gone  
  
Now I see the times they change  
Leaving doesnt seems so strange  
I am hoping I can find  
Where to leave my hurt behind  
All this shit I seem to take  
All alone I seem to break  
I have lived the best I can  
Does this make me not a man  
  
Shut me off  
I am ready  
Heart stops  
I stand alone  
Cant be on my own  
  
I will make it go away  
Cant be here no more  
Seems this is the only way  
I will soon be gone  
These feelings will be gone  
These feelings will be gone  
  
Now I see the times they change  
Leaving doesnt seems so strange  
I am hoping I can find  
Where to leave my hurt behind  
All this shit I seem to take  
All alone I seem to break  
I have lived the best I can  
Does this make me not a man  
  
Am I going to leave this place  
What is it Im hanging from  
Is there nothing more to come am I gonna leave this place  
Is it always black in space  
Am I going to take its place  
Am I going to leave this race Am I going to leave this race  
I guess gods up in this place  
What is it that Ive become  
Is there something more to come more to come  
  
Now I see the times they change  
Leaving doesnt seems so strange  
I am hoping I can find  
Where to leave my hurt behind  
All this shit I seem to take  
All alone I seem to break  
I have lived the best I can  
Does this make me not a man  
Does this make me not a man
