You tell me that youre sad and lost your way  
You tell me that your tears are here to stay  
But I know youre only hiding  
And I just wanna see you  
  
You tell me that youre hurt and youre in pain  
And I can see your head is held in shame  
But I just wanna see you smile again  
See you smile again  
  
But dont burn out  
Even if you scream and shout  
Itll come back to you  
And Ill be here for you  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer  
Hope your heart is strong enough  
When the night is coming down on you  
We will find a way through the dark  
  
I wish that I could take you to the stars  
Id never let you fall and break your heart  
And if you wanna cry or fall apart  
Ill be there to hold you  
  
You tell me that you hurt its all in vain  
But I can see your heart can love again  
And I remember you laughing  
So lets just laugh again  
  
But dont burn out  
Even if you scream and shout  
Itll come back to you back to you  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer  
Hope your heart is strong enough  
When the night is coming down on you  
We will find a way through the dark  
  
And you dont need  
You dont need to worry  
And you will see its easy to be loved  
I know you wanna be loved  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer  
Hope your heart is strong enough  
When the night is coming down on you  
We will find a way through the dark  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer  
Hope your heart is strong enough  
When the night is coming down  
We will find a way through the dark
