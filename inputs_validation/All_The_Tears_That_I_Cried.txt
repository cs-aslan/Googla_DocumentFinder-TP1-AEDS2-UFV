Sometimes its hard to remember you lied  
And memory fades as the years pass you by  
Sometimes the truths got up lay down and died  
But I cant forget all the tears that I cried  
Sometimes I try to pretend its alright  
The promises I make last nearly all night  
Still in the morning I run and I hide  
cause I cant forget all the tears that I cried  
But Ill get fooled like the last time  
Oh how these eyes are sore  
Theyll cry again just like before  
Lonely the track I decided to take  
Lost from the start all the friendships I make  
Single fares only the trails only I ride  
cause I cant forget all the tears that I cried  
Too much reminiscing is bad for the soul  
It screws up your life and it makes you feel old  
Dont want to remember what I cant abide  
cause I cant forget all the tears that I cried  
But Ill get fooled like the last time  
Oh how these eyes are sore  
Theyll cry again just like before  
I find it so hard just to make up my mind  
Youve all been so patient and all been so kind  
But when it comes to emotions my outbursts are tied  
cause I cant forget all the tears that I cried  
But Ill get fooled like the last time  
Oh how these eyes are sore  
Theyll cry again just like before  
cause I cant forget all the tears  
I cant forget all the tears  
I cant forget all the tears  
I cant forget all the tears  
I cant forget all the tears
