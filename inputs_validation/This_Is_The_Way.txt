Your heart is my need  
And I love what it means to succeed  
As your fate is my prize  
Love youre breathe in me  
Its what keeps me alive  
Hold on till forever is gone  
Hold on to whatever it takes  
To go on and on and on oh baby  
  
This is the way that we live  
This is the world where our dreams survive  
Fight for the love that we give  
The love that we make is all in the way that we live  
The way that we live  
  
In my dreams I can fly  
In your arms theres no earth no sky  
Theres one truth no lies  
Theres no distance between us  
Just trust in our lives  
Hold on till forever is gone  
Hold on to whatever it takes to go on and on oh baby  
  
This is the way that we live  
This is the world where our dreams survive  
Fight for the love that we give  
The love that we make is all in the way that we live  
The way that we live the way that we live  
  
In our lives theres so much useless information  
The truth is as simple as the air that we breathe  
So many souls with the need for human affirmation  
You and I choose to believe we are free  
  
This is the way that we live  
This is the world where our dreams survive  
Fight for the love that we give  
The paths that we take its all in the way that we live  
This is the way that we live  
This is the world where our dreams survive  
Fight for the love that we give  
This is the way that we live
