Some people get a cheap laugh breaking up the speed limit  
Scaring the pedestrians for a minute  
Crossing up progress driving on the grass  
Leaving just enough room to pass  
Sunday driver never took a test  
Oh yeah once upon a time in the west  
  
Yes its no use saying that you dont know nothing  
Its still gonna get you if you dont do something  
Sitting on a fence thats a dangerous course  
Oh you could even catch a bullet from the peacekeeping force  
Even the hero gets a bullet in the chest  
Oh yeah once upon a time in the west  
  
Mother mary your children are slaughtered  
Some of you mothers ought to lock up your daughters  
Whos protecting the innocenti  
Heap big trouble in the land of plenty  
Tell me how were gonna do whats best  
You guess once upon a time in the west  
  
Oh yeah once upon a time in the west  
Oh yeah once upon a time in the west  
Oh yeah once upon a time in the west  
  
Once upon a time in the west
