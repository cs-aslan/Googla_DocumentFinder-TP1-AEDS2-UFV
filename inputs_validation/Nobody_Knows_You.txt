 Cox   
  
Once i lived the life of millionaire  
People spending my money honey  
Lord and i just didnt care now lord  
Takin my friend out  
Tryin to have a good time  
They drank that strong bootleg liquor  
And that good old champagne and wine  
  
Well just as soon as my money got so low  
I couldnt find my friends lord  
And i just didnt have no place to go  
Now no no  
But if i ever and if i ever get my hands  
On them green dollars again yeah  
Im gonna hold on  
Till that big eagle grin lord now  
  
Im trying to tell yall  
That nobody wants you  
People nobody wants you no  
When youre down and out now now lord  
Because in your pocket no  
There is not one penny  
And all of them socalled friends  
Im trying to tell yall  
That you havent got any  
  
But yeah and just as soon  
As you get back on your feet again  
People im tryin to tell you  
That here they come  
Tellin you all  
Theyre your long lost friend  
Oh but im tryin to tell everybody  
Lord without a doubt  
That nobody wants you  
Nobody wants you no no  
Nobody wants you no  
Nobody needs tou nobody wants you  
When youre down and out lord  
And nobody says a good thing about you  
And nobody can tell you when to turn  
And when to go
