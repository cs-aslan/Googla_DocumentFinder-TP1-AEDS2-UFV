Oh my name is Jock Stewart Im a canny gun man  
And a roving young fellow Ive been  
So be easy and free when youre drinking with me  
Im a man you dont meet every day  
  
I have acres of land I have men at command  
I have always a shilling to spare  
So be easy and free when youre drinking with me  
Im a man you dont meet every day  
  
Well I took out my dog and him I did shoot  
All down in the county Kildare  
So be easy and free when youre drinking with me  
Im a man you dont meet every day  
  
So come fill up you glasses of brandy and wine  
Whatever it costs I will pay  
So be easy and free when youre drinking with me  
Im a man you dont meet every day
