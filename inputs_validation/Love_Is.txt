Verse 1  
Its in the eyes of the children  
As they leave for the very first time  
And its in the heart of a soldier  
As he takes a bullet on the front line  
Its in the face of a mother  
As she takes the force of the blow  
And its in the hands of the father yea  
As he works his fingers to the bone yea  
  
PreChorus  
Im standing under a white flag oh  
Can you see me oh  
Can you see me Oh  
Im standing for everything we have oh  
Can you hear me oh  
Can you hear me  
  
Chorus  
This is why we do it  
This is worth the pain  
This is why we fall down  
To get back up again  
This is where the heart lies  
This is from above  
Love is this this is love  
Love is why we do it  
Love is worth the pain  
Love is why we fall down  
To get back up again  
Love is where the heart lies  
Love is from above  
Love is this this is love  
  
This is love  
This is love  
This is love  
  
Verse 2  
Its in the soul of a city  
What it does after it crumbles and burns  
And its in the blood of a hero  
To know where he goes  
He may never return eh  
  
PreChorus  
Im standing under a white flag oh  
Can you see me oh  
Can you see me Oh  
Im standing for everything we have oh  
Can you hear me oh  
Can you hear me  
  
Chorus  
This is why we do it  
This is worth the pain  
This is why we fall down  
To get back up again  
This is where the heart lies  
This is from above  
Love is this this is love  
Love is why we do it  
Love is worth the pain  
Love is why we fall down  
To get back up again  
Love is where the heart lies  
Love is from above  
Love is this this is love  
  
Bridge  
This is love  
This is love  
  
This is love  
This is love  
  
This is love  
This is love  
  
This is love  
This is love  
  
If you could be anyone that you wanted to be  
With anyone that you wanted to be with  
Doing anything that you wanted to do  
What would it be and who would be with you  
Time flies but youre the pilot  
It moves real fast but youre the driver  
You may crash and burn sometimes  
  
Chorus  
This is why we do it  
This is worth the pain  
This is why we fall down  
To get back up again  
This is where the heart lies  
This is from above  
Love is this this is love  
Love is why we do it  
Love is worth the pain  
Love is why we fall down  
To get back up again  
Love is where the heart lies  
Love is from above  
Love is this this is love
