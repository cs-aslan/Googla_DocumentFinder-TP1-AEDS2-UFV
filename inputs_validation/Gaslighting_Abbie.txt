One plush summer you come to me ripe and ready  
And bad through and through  
With that deep mystical soul synergy pumping steady  
Between me and you  
  
Lovin all the beautiful work weve done cara mia  
And its barely July  
If we keep on boppin until Labor Day  
Lil miz Abbie bye bye  
  
What will it be some soothing herb tea  
That might be just the thing  
Lets say we spike it with Deludin  
Or else maybe tonight a hand of solitaire  
  
Chorus  
Flame is the game  
The game we call gas lighting Abbie  
Its a luscious invention for three  
One summer by the sea  
  
With the long weekend thats comin up fast  
Lets get busy  
Theres just too much to do  
That black mini looks just like the one shes been missin  
Feels good on you  
  
Theres a few items we need in town allezvous girl  
Theres no time to waste  
Such as fresh cable and fifteen watt bulbs  
Couple dozen its a big old place  
  
Lets keep it light well do a fright night  
With blood and everything  
Some punky laughter from the kitchen  
And then a nice relaxing hand of solitaire  
  
Chorus  
  
You can choose the music  
Ill set up my gear  
Later on well chill and watch the fireworks from here  
  
How can you knock this mighty spite lock  
Check out the work itself  
A mix of elegance and function  
Thats right a tweak or two and then shes out of here  
  
Chorus
