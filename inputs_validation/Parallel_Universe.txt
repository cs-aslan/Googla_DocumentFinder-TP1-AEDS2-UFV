Deep inside of a parallel universe  
Its getting harder and harder  
To tell what came first  
  
Under water where thoughts can breathe Easily  
Far away you were made in a sea  
Just like me  
  
Chorus  
Christ Im a sidewinder  
Im a California King  
I swear its everywhere  
Its everything  
  
Staring straight up into the sky  
Oh my my a solar system that fits  
In your eye Microcosm  
  
You could die but your never dead spider web  
Take a look at the stars in  
Your head fields of space kid  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Psychic changes are born in your heart Entertain  
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same  
Bless your heart girl  
  
Kill the pressure its raining on  
Salty Cheeks  
When you hear the beloved song  
I am with you  
  
Chorus x2
