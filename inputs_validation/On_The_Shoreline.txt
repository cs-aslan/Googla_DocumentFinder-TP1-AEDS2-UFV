Well theres a place where two worlds collide  
The pile of stone against the pull of the tide  
You can stay with your feet on the ground  
Or step into the water leave the dry behind  
  
On the shoreline  
Meet me on the shoreline  
Where you can only swim if you try  
  
Well if theres somewhere on the other side  
It might be better it might be as bad  
Someday soon youll have to make a move  
Cos you cant stay forever ah just waiting  
  
On the shoreline on the shoreline  
Meet me on the shoreline on the shoreline  
  
Take me over lead me through  
  
Well can you take me there to the other side  
Where everything is new uncertain and strange  
Dont ever let me go till were there  
I dont know what it is Im looking for  
And until its found I wont be sure  
  
Well there are squares in the game of life  
When you can keep on moving or turn aside  
Yes there are times when you have to decide  
To put your feet in the water or stay  
  
On the shoreline on the shoreline  
Meet me on the shoreline on the shoreline  
Where you can only swim if you try  
Ill be there oh  
On the shoreline on the shoreline  
Ill be there on the shoreline on the shoreline  
Where you can only swim if you try  
Ill be there  
Ill be there oh  
Yes Ill be there  
Ill be there
