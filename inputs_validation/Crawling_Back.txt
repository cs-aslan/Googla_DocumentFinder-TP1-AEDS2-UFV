Only you and no one else  
Can keep me crawling back  
You know I cant help myself  
And now Im crawling back  
  
After all youve done to me  
The times youve turned me down  
I still will be your clown  
Because I love you  
Im crawling back  
  
You know I would die for you  
Heaven knows how I have cried for you  
But what else can I do  
But crawl on back to you ooh  
Crawling back to you  
  
People stop they talk and they stare  
But they dont know that you really care  
That youre only lonely and making believe  
And you need me around  
When the world turns you down  
  
Whenever you might need me  
I will come crawling back  
Wherever you will lead me  
I will come crawling back
