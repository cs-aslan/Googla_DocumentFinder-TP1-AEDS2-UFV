I thought I told you hed be home soon  
Couldnt help myself youre too good to be true  
I fall short each time  
Every time he aint here  
You and your charm creep closer  
Closer and near  
Like a fool for fire I fall with my pride and all  
Like a bomb before explosion  
Ticking by your call  
Youre the wiser one disguised from greed  
And Im just a child who belongs on her knees  
  
But I found a boy who I love more  
Than I ever did you before  
So stand beside the river I cried  
And lay yourself down  
Look how you want me now that I dont need you  
  
So you thought that Id crumble to my knees  
At the first sight of you crawling back to me  
To whisper will you leave your man   
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me  
I wont stand by you  
  
Cause I found a boy who I love more  
Than I ever did you before  
So stand beside the river I cried  
And lay yourself down  
Look how you want me now that I dont need you  
  
I aint yours for no taking  
You must be mistaken  
I could never look into your eyes and settle for wrong  
And ignore the right  
  
When I found a boy who loves me more  
Than you ever did me before  
So stand beside the river you cried  
And lay yourself down  
Look how you want me now that I dont need you
