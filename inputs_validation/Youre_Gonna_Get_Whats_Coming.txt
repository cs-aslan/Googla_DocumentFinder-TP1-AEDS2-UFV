You came up on me like a landslide  
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it  
Ive got a Thunderbird parked right outside  
Give me a minute to finish this thing and well light it  
  
In all this heat its a job keeping cool  
And I could fry an egg on you  
  
You came up on me like a landslide  
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it  
  
Youre gonna get whats coming  
You been asking for it two days running  
Youre gonna get whats coming  
Youre gonna get whats coming to you  
  
I hope that youre half as intrepid as you make out  
Often or not but you never got what you asked for  
Keep on pouring until you hear me shout  
And turn up the sound if you want me to drive any faster  
  
Caution went out when you walked in the room  
If it never came back it would be too soon  
  
Youre gonna get whats coming  
You been askin for it two days runnin  
Youre gonna get whats comin  
Youre gonna get whats coming to you  
  
You came upon me like a landslide  
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it  
  
Youre gonna get whats comin  
You been askin for it two days runnin  
Youre gonna get whats comin  
Youre gonna get whats comin to you
