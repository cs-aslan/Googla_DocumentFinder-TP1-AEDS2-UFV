Im in love with you I know  
And I know that you love me too  
Im in love with you I know  
Im in love with everyone too  
Were all comrades now you know  
Were all brothers under the skin  
With a few adjustments now  
Living in the perfect system  
The adjustments simple there is really no pain  
Youll hardly notice anything has changed  
Living in a programmed life never really has ups and downs  
Theres no need for fighting now  
Theres no reason to wear a frown  
In a perfect system  
Theres no confrontation  
Unnecessary friction  
To impede our concentration  
Weve simply done away with  
Unnecessary friction  
I live in a system  
I got an occupation  
I get enough nutrition  
By eating protein biscuits  
Recommended by the system  
Its routine regulation  
I had an operation     
Im in love with you I know  
And I know that you love me too  
Im in love with you I know  
Im in love with everyone too  
I can tell by the look in your blank dull eyes  
That you agree but Im not a bit surprised  
Living in a programmed life never really has ups and downs  
Theres no need for fighting now  
Theres no reason to wear a frown  
I had an operation  
With no adverse reaction  
They tampered with my brain some  
It helped me see the reason  
For living in the system  
It helped me see the reason  
Were all brothers in a perfect world  
In a perfect world theres uniformity  
Were all brothers in a perfect world  
In a perfect world theres conformity  
Were all brothers in a perfect world  
Theres no need for spontaneity  
Perfect system were all brothers to the end  
Brothers to the end  
Brothers to the end  
I know and I know that you love me too  
Brothers to the end I know Im in love with everyone too  
Brothers to the end I know were all comrades under the skin  
Brothers to the end I know living in a perfect system  
BROTHERS TO THE END
