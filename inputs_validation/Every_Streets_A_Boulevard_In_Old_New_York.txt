I tell you every streets a boulevard in old New York  
Every streets a highway of your dreams  
Its a thrill to shop on 34th street  
Or down in Union Square  
We like the people you meet  
On Mulberry street have you ever been there  
  
Every streets a boulevard in old New York  
So keep smiling and youll never wear a frown  
Just remember theres an East Side and the West Side  
And Uptown and Down  
Thats why were proud to be a part of New York town  
  
34th street Union Square Mulberry Street  
Have you ever been there  
  
Every streets a boulevard in old New York  
Streets are paved with happiness in old New York  
Were proud youre a part of it  
Were happy that you came  
Each sidewalk is a concrete path to fame  
Just remember theres an East Side and the West Side  
And Uptown and Down  
In this great big metropolis known as New York town
