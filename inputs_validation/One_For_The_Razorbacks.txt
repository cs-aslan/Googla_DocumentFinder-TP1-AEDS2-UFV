Juliets trying to find out what she wants  
But she dont know  
Experience has got her down  
Look this direction I know its not perfection  
Its just me  
I want to bring you up again now  
  
Im losing whats left of my dignity  
A small price to Ill pay to see that youre happy  
Forget all the disappointments you have faced  
Open up your worried world and let me in  
  
Juliets crying cause now shes realizing  
Love can be filled with pain and distrust  
I know I am crazy and a bit lazy  
But I will try to bring you up again some how
