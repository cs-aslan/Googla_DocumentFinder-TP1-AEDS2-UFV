Your eyes had a welcome sign  
Your lips said youd be mine  
You came and I knew it all the time  
  
Your name I dont recall  
I never knew you at all  
I hope Im not the best that you didnt find  
  
Oh love is blind  
Love is blind  
Youre looking for love  
I dont have the time oh  
  
No promises no lies  
The truth lies in your eyes  
I want you and you want me  
  
Love is blind  
Love is blind  
Youre looking for love  
I dont have the time no  
  
Love is blind  
Yeah love is blind  
Im not looking for love  
But dont leave me behind  
  
Love is blind  
Love is blind yeah  
Youre looking for love  
I dont have the time  
  
Oh love love  
Love is blind ooh  
Love is blind ooh
