All your twobit friends theyre shootin you up with pills  
They said that it was good for you that it would cure your ills  
  
I dont care just where its at  
Im just like an alley cat  
  
And when youre filled up to here with hate  
Dont you know you gotta get it straight  
Filled up to here with hate  
Beat her black and blue and get it straight  
  
Do do do do do do  
When youre lookin through the eyes of hate  
  
All your twobit friends theyre ask you for your autograph  
They put you on the stage they thought itd be good for a laugh  
  
But I dont care just where its at  
Cause honey Im just like an alley cat  
  
And when youre filled up to here with hate  
Dont you know you gotta get it straight  
Filled up to here with hate  
Beat her black and blue and get it straight  
  
Uh huh  
  
Oh Jim how could you treat me this way  
Hey hey hey  
How could you treat me this way  
  
Oh Jim how could you treat me this way  
Hey hey  
How could you treat me this way  
  
You know you broke my heart  
Ever since you went away  
Now you said that you love us  
But you only make love to one of us  
Oh Jim how could you treat me this way  
You know you broke my heart  
Ever since you went away  
When youre looking through the eyes of hate  
Oh oh oh oh  
When youre looking through the eyes of hate  
Oh oh oh oh
