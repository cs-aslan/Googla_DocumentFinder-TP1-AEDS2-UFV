Youre enough  
If I never had another  
Never hold another lover  
Baby youre enough  
All the rest are second best  
Compared to you  
  
Youre enough  
If I never know another  
After what weve known together  
Baby youre enough  
Ive already had my sweetest dreams come true  
  
Cant you see  
In these eyes that adore you  
Ive been waiting here for you  
Baby cant you see  
Look at me  
See loves greatest nonbeliever  
Believing that she might be seeing love  
In your eyes  
  
Stars above  
Made for wishin made for dreamers  
Wont you listen to this heart  
And what its dreamin of  
If theyll only shine their lucky starlight down on me  
Make it bright enough for only you to see  
That baby youre enough for me
