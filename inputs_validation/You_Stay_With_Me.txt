TV flashes down the hall  
Painting pictures on the wall  
And youre still sleeping on my knees  
And in the glow of silver light  
I trace the lines above your eyes  
Just another wrinkle that you can blame on me  
  
But I can hear the current of the freeway in the distance  
If I keep listening  
And I wonder if you ever thought of streaming off  
Somewhere with it  
Am I not what you thought  
Will you get tired of what you got  
  
Chorus  
If I cant give you anymore  
Than weathered ships and distant shores  
Would you still be my compass  
Cause you keep loving me the same  
I dont know how but you still stay with me baby  
You stay with me baby  
  
Another day another week  
Well slip back in old routines  
Til nights like these come in between  
Simple moments in the dark  
Ones that life cant tear apart  
They come along just when we need  
  
And I still hear the current of the freeway in the distance  
But I stop listening  
Cause I know youll stay even though the waves are always shifting  
  
Were fighting our way through  
I guess I always knew
