Swings from somewhere you cant see  
She sits in the top of the greenest tree  
She sends out an aroma of undefined love  
Drifts on down in a mist from above  
  
Shes just a girl a girl a girl you want  
Shes just a girl a girl a girl you want  
  
You can hear her calling everywhere you turn  
You know youre headed for the pleasure burn  
The words get stuck on the tip of your tongue  
Shes the real thing but you knew it along  
Shes just a girl a girl a girl you want  
  
Chorus  
Look at you your mouth watering  
Look at you your mind spinning  
Why dont we just admit its all over  
Shes just a girl you want  
  
Shes just a girl a girl a girl you want  
Shes just a girl a girl a girl you want  
  
She swings from somewhere you cant see  
She sits in the top of the greenest tree  
She sends out an aroma of undefined love  
Drifts on down in a mist from above  
  
Shes just a girl a girl a girl you want  
Shes just a girl a girl a girl you want  
  
Chorus  
  
Shes just a girl a girl a girl you want Repeat x 2
