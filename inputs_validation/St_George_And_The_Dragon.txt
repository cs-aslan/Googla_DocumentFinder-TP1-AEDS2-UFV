Can you tell me where I might find the Hydra  
Is he wearing a familiar face  
Does he still live below Seventh Avenue  
With the princess dipped in lace  
Does he know that Im a soldier of fortune  
And not a victim of circumstance  
We drew lots for his soft underbelly  
Now his fate is sealed with my lance  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
Youve never seen the man with nothing to say  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
Youd better watch yourself St George is on his way  
Is it true that hes a mighty warrior  
And a viper of the first degree  
Ive been sentenced here to slay the giant  
Geld this fear I cannot see  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
Youve never seen the man with nothing to say  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
Youd better watch yourself St George is on his way  
Can you tell me where I might find the Hydra  
Is he wearing a familiar face  
Does he still live below Seventh Avenue  
In the slums of Satans grace  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
Youve never seen the man with nothing to say  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
Youd better watch yourself St George is on his way  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
Youve never seen the man with nothing to say  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
Youd better watch yourself St George is on his way  
I can tell by the I can tell by the  
I can tell by the I can tell by the  
I can tell by the I can tell by the  
I can tell by the look in your eye
