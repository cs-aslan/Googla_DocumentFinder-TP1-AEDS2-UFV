On Thursday night she looked a fright  
Her prickly hair all curled oh Lord what a sight  
Dance dance little sister dance  
  
On Friday night shes all decked out  
Her high heel shoes and dress so tight  
Dance dance little sister dance  
  
On Saturday night she bassadee  
She stepping high on Fredericks Street  
Dance dance little sister dance  
  
I said dance dance little sister dance  
Dance little sister dance  
Dance little sister dance  
I said dance dance little sister dance  
Dance little sister dance  
Dance little sister dance  
  
It make me hot Im wet with sweat  
It burn like hell Ive four hours left  
Dance dance little sister dance  
  
Get next to me drive me close  
Dont mammaguay I lose control  
Dance dance with fire dance  
  
I said dance dance little sister dance  
Dance little sister dance  
Dance little sister dance  
I said dance dance little sister dance  
Dance little sister dance  
Dance little sister dance  
  
Jump out of Africa with a step that looks so bold  
Ah when you kickin high it make my blood run cold  
  
I said dance dance little sister dance  
Dance little sister  
Dance little sister dance  
I said dance dance little sister dance  
Dance little sister  
Dance little sister dance  
  
On Saturday night we dont go home  
We bacchanal there aint no dawn  
Dance little sister dance  
I said dance dance little sister  
Dance little sister  
Dance little sister dance  
I said dance dance little sister  
Dance little sister
