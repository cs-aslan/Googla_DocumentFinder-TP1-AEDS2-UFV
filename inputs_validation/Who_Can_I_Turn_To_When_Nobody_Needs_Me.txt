Who can I turn to  
When nobody needs me  
My heart wants to know  
So I must go  
Where destiny leads me  
With no star to guide me  
And no one beside me  
  
Ill go on my way  
And after the day  
The darkness will hide me  
But maybe tomorrow  
Ill find what Im after  
Ill throw off my sorrow  
Beg steal or borrow  
My share of laughter  
Cause with you I could learn to  
With you on a new day  
  
But who can I turn to  
If you turn away  
With you I could learn to  
With you on a new day  
But who can I turn to  
If you turn away
