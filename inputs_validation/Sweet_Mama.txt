Here we go  
Cmon  
I was raised on the west side Shanty Town  
I didnt get up til the sun went down  
When your backs against the wall you better get tough  
I learned real quick how to swing and duck  
I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine  
Good lookin women backwoods and moonshine  
Learned more about life on the streets than in school  
Sweet Mama didnt raise no fool No she didnt  
Hahahaha  
Ooooohhh  
Some folks cheat and some folks lie  
I can judge a man by the look in his eyes  
So dont hand me Jack and try to call it Cola  
I know the difference tween shit and shinola  
I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine  
Good lookin women backwoods and moonshine  
Learned more about life on the streets than in the school  
Sweet Mama didnt raise no fool No she didnt  
Play it boys  
MMmmHhmmm  
Mama was no angel when she taught me right from wrong  
She knew every single note and every word in every single song  
She taught me how to gamble and how to roll the dice  
If it makes you feel good DO IT dont think twice  
I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine  
Good lookin women backwoods and moonshine  
Learned more about life on the streets than in school  
Sweet Mama didnt raise no fool  
I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine  
Good lookin women backwoods and moonshine  
Learned more about life on the streets than in school  
Sweet Mama didnt raise no fool Noooooo
