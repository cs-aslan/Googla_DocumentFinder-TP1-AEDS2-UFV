Radio speaker  radio bleep  
Put it on hard disc   
See it on your pc  
Everybody moving  cause  
their so afraid of losing  
You gotta pull the straps  
Till it cant fight back  
  
Say you gotta pull straps  
Till it cant fight back  
Press it down press it down  
  
Whats going on  
Oh whats going on  
There was a time  
When all I could see  
was a sun in the sky  
There was a place I knew where we  
We used to run run with  
the wind in our faces  
  
I look to the left I look to the right  
Cant get through  
Press it down I cant get through  
Look to the left I look to the right  
I cant get through  
  
I cant get through  
I cant get through  
  
Radio play radio scream  
Coming up through  
All the crap on my windscreen  
I cant get through  
I cant go back  
Laugh too scared  
I might have a heart attack  
I say I might have a heart attack  
  
I cant get through  
I cant get through
