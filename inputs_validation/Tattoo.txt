Me and my brother were talking to each other  
Bout what makes a man a man  
Was it brain or brawn or the month you were born  
We just couldnt understand  
  
Our old man didnt like our appearance  
He said that only women wear long hair  
  
So me and my brother borrowed money from Mother  
We knew what we had to do  
We went downstairs past the barber and gymnasium  
And got our arms tattooed  
  
Welcome to my life tattoo  
Im a man now thanks to you  
I expect Ill regret you  
But the skin graft man wont get you  
Youll be there when I die  
Tattoo  
  
My dad beat me cause mine said Mother  
But my mother naturally liked it and beat my brother  
Cause his tattoo was of a lady in the nude  
And my mother thought that was extremely rude  
  
Welcome to my life tattoo  
Weve a long time together me and you  
I expect Ill regret you  
But the skin graft man wont get you  
Youll be there when I die  
Tattoo  
  
Now Im older Im tattooed all over  
My wife is tattooed too  
A rootytoottoot rootytootytoottoot  
Rootytoottoot tattoo too  
To you
