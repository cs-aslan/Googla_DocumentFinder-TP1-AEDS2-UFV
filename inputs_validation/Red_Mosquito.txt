Watched from the window with a red mosquito  
I was not allowed to leave the room  
I saw the sun go down and now its comin up  
Somewhere in the time between  
I was bittenmust have been the devil  
He was just payin me  
A little visit a reminding me of his presence  
Lettin me knowhes a waitin for me  
Red mans your neighbor call it behavior  
While youre climbing up slippery hills  
Two steps ahead of him punctures in your neck  
Hoverin just above your bed 2x  
I was bittenmust have been the devil  
He was just paying me  
A little visit reminding me of his presence  
And lettin me knowhes awaitinhes awaitin  
Up thereyeah  
If I had known then what I now know 4x
