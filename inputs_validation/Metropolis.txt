Oh oh I cant even take it in  
Oh oh I cant even take it in  
Oh oh I left my heart in Metropolis  
  
So far apart I check that the coast was clear  
I feel like a post card  
I wish you were here  
Subway through the dark tearing through the park  
Taxi down the street the avenues at my feet  
Dont matter much to me  
What it is that I do  
As long as Im coming home With you  
  
Oh oh oh as far as I can see  
Youre the only one the only one who can get to me  
Like a high jacked plane  
Or a runaway train  
Or a speeding bullet  
Theres no stopping this  
I left my heart in Metropolis  
  
A thousand miles feels like a million years  
Like hundreds of postcards  
That say I wish you were here  
Airplane through the sky grey all racing by  
Air bike on the beach sailboat on the sea  
Dont matter much to me  
What it is that I do  
As long as Im coming home with you  
  
Oh oh oh as far as I can see  
Youre the only one the only one who can get to me  
Like a high jacked plane  
Or a runaway train  
Or a speeding bullet  
Theres no stopping this  
I left my heart in Metropolis  
I left my heart in Metropolis  
  
Like a high jacked plane  
Or a runaway train  
Or a speeding bullet  
Theres no stopping this  
I left my heart in Metropolis  
I left my heart in Metropolis  
I left my heart in Metropolis  
I left my heart in Metropolis  
  
Oh oh I cant even take it in  
Oh oh I cant even take it in  
Oh oh I cant even take it in  
Oh oh I left my heart in Metropolis
