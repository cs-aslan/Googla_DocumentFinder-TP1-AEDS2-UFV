One two three  
Yes Ive been waitin but you just dont come around  
Youve been droppin in on everyone all over town  
Say what you like but you just dont know your place  
And everywhere we go people seem to know your face  
Youve been checkin out the scene every single night  
Never knowing where youve been you say Its alright  
I placed all my faith in you then you let me down  
Everything I said is true but you dont hear a sound  
Yeah you ought to be ashamed but you dont accept the blame  
They said it was too late for your love  
They said it was too late youre gonna go  
They said I was too late for your love  
They said I was too late youre gonna go  
You never can tell with friends  
You never can tell with you never can tell with  
You never can tell with friends  
You never can tell with you never can tell with  
Yes every now and then my mind turns things around  
And I believe its true that our love can still be found  
Just one thing I care about from sea to shining sea  
And you know thats the love you give the love you give to me  
Youve been checkin out the scene every single night  
Never knowing where youve been you say Its alright  
I placed all my faith in you then you let me down  
Everything I said is true but you dont hear a sound  
Yeah you ought to be ashamed but you dont accept the blame  
They said it was too late for your love  
They said it was too late youre gonna go  
They said Ive been too late for your love  
They said it was too late youre gonna go  
You never can tell with friends  
You never can tell with you never can tell with  
You never can tell with friends  
You never can tell with you never can tell with  
You never can tell with friends
