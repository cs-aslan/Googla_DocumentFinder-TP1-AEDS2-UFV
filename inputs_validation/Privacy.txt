Aint the pictures enough why do you go through so much  
To get the story you need so you can bury me  
Youve got the people confused you tell the stories you choose  
You try to get me to lose the man I really am  
  
You keep on stalking me invading my privacy  
Wont you just let me be  
Cause you cameras cant control the minds of those who know  
That youll even sell your soul just to get a story sold  
  
Chorus  
I need my privacy I need my privacy  
So paparazzi get away from me  
  
Some of you still wonder why one of my friends had to die  
To get a message across that yet you havent heard  
My friend was chased and confused like many others I knew  
But on that cold winter night my pride was snatched away  
  
Now she get no second chance she just ridiculed and harassed  
Please tell my why  
No theres a lesson to learn respects not given its earned  
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity  
  
Chorus  
  
Now theres a lesson to learn stories are twisted and turned  
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity  
  
Chorus x3
