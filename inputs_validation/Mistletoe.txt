Its the most beautiful time of the year  
Lights fill the streets spreadin so much cheer  
I should be playin in the winter snow but Ima be under the mistletoe  
I dont wanna miss out on the holiday but I cant stop starin at your face  
I should be playin in the winter snow but Ima be under the mistletoe  
  
With you shawty with you  
With you shawty with you  
With you under the mistletoe  
  
Everyones gatherin around the fire  
Chestnuts roastin like a hot July  
I should be chillin with my folks I know but Ima be under the mistletoe  
Word on the street Santas comin tonight  
Reindeer flyin through the sky so high  
I should be makin a list I know but Ima be under the mistletoe  
  
With you shawty with you  
With you shawty with you  
With you under the mistletoe  
With you shawty with you  
With you shawty with you  
With you under the mistletoe  
  
Aye love the Wisemen follow the star the way I follow my heart  
And it lead me to a miracle hey love  
Dont ya buy me nothin cause I am feelin one thing  
Your lips on my lips thats a merry merry Christmas  
  
Its the most beautiful time of the year  
Lights fill the streets spreadin so much cheer  
I should be playin in the winter snow but Ima be under the mistletoe  
I dont wanna miss out on the holiday but I cant stop starin at your face  
I should be playin in the winter snow but Ima be under the mistletoe
