They try to trace her in the town  
Appeal for information on the local news  
Someone must have missed her by now  
A mother or a father or a friendly face to talk her down  
  
Shes heading for the great escape  
Heading for the rave  
Heading for the permanent holiday  
  
I Wave  
Hold your breath till you feel it begin  
Here it comes  
Do you feel that  
Feel this  
Get used to it  
  
She had the face of the Statue of Liberty  
Oh free me  
The fire and ice of Amazon and Eskimo  
Take me home  
The edge and the glance of high fashion  
Ask me about next year  
  
II Mad  
Tell me Im mad  
How should I know  
Tell me Im mad  
I have been here for so long  
Help me paint a picture  
They say its a lie  
Tell me Im mad  
Youre a fine one to decide  
  
Burn me in the fires of wild heaven  
Like it never never never would stop  
Tell me Im mad  
Tell me I imagined that  
Was it something I didnt say  
Or was it something I said  
Leave that stuff alone  
Use me instead  
  
I know Im always falling off the edge of the world  
I got space in my bed  
Youve got Egypt in your head  
Ive got a headful of Troy  
Chandeliers and Charlemagne  
Fireworks and toys  
  
III The Opium Den  
Hold your breath till you feel it begin  
Here it comes  
Get used to it  
  
But you sleep like a ghost with me  
Its as simple as that  
So tell me Im mad  
Roll me up and breathe me in  
Come to my madness  
My opium den  
Come to my madness  
Make sense of it again  
  
IV The Slide  
Make a drug of my senses  
Ill get you out of your head  
Im sick for you  
Love wastes us together  
Love holds us together  
Love folds us together  
Flowers  
  
V Standing in the Swing  
I dont know what youre doing here  
When theres murder on the street  
I appreciate your concern  
But dont waste your time on me  
Im ashes on the water now  
Somewhere far away  
You think you came here just in time  
But youre twenty years too late  
You wont have long to wait  
  
Easy you said I was easy This world sharpens teeth Eat your words
