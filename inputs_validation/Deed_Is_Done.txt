Oh so I pray  
Oh at night  
I wake up praying  
All day light  
I pray to you  
And hear my request  
I ask of you  
To save this baby  
  
O look at the girl  
From inside  
Is cancer eaten  
Is life deprived  
And if so by who  
Could it be you  
I see no need  
For a babys wisdom for you  
  
Oh God the girl  
All yellow turned  
Cheeks are swollen  
And soul is burned  
  
Oh but the girl  
The girl is gone  
And the deed is done  
It must be wrong  
  
Now I pray  
My prayers not heard  
Could it be your death  
Death to mortal word  
  
Oh and see her pain  
And drain and drain  
Could you be deaf  
And blind my friend  
Oh and so we hold  
Can you not hear  
Can you not see  
And if with words  
You could change the way  
Things are arranged  
Surely youd be speaking  
Seeking no change  
  
Oh but the girl  
Deaf dumb and blind  
From the cancer burning  
Deep down inside  
Oh but the deed is done  
And the girl is gone  
And I see no faith  
That I have won  
  
Well you may find youre little  
You may find your tracks  
You may go  
For me the girl is gone  
Oh you may find youre attraction  
To me the babys gone
