Well Im flying down desert streets wrapped in mothers wine and sheets  
Asbestos boots on flaming feet dreaming of forbidden treats  
When uniforms on nighttime beats ask me where Im going and what I eat  
I answer them with a voice so sweet  
I cant come down till its plain to see  
I cant come down Ive been set free  
Who you are and what you dont make no difference to me  
Well someone trying to tell me where its at  
And how I do this and why I do that  
With secret smiles like a Chesire cat  
And little wings like a vampire bat  
I fly away to my cold water flat and eat my way to a bone of fat  
And I say to the man with the funny hat  
They say Ill be good to lose my grip  
My hold on reality is starting to slip  
To tell me to got off with this trip  
The say its like a sinking ship  
Life is sweet its too warm to sip  
And if I drink Ill chuck and flip Ill just say as I take a nip  
Oh I dream of cotton seas and granite walls and redwood trees  
And ugly eye that only sees endless mirrors and infinite mes  
About the winters coming freeze this afterthought I say with ease  
To all of you who make your fees
