Run like Hell in Hell  
The deadly race begins  
Cyanide suicide  
No prayers or foolish whims  
Tonight well fight  
With glory in our veins  
Cant stop us now  
Our evil always will reign  
  
The master switch is set  
And we must guard the only key  
Rip ride  
  
Satans speed our speed  
Incarnate pure alive  
Light up the night  
Were living on a wire  
We choose you loose  
Nobody body catches fire  
Were free youll see  
We live by our desires  
  
Riding in the air nocturnal  
Living free  
Rip ride  
  
Rip ride  
  
Run like Hell in Hell  
The deadly race begins  
Cyanide suicide  
No prayers or foolish whims  
Tonight well fight  
With glory in our veins  
Cant stop us now  
Our evil always will reign  
  
The master switch is set  
And we must guard the only key  
Rip ride
