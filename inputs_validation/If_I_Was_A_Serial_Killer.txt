Violent J  
If I was a Serial Killer  
They would find all my victims heads  
In funky ass gas station toilets  
And if I was a Serial Killer  
I would be strange and deranged  
And I would never change  
If I was a Serial Killer  
Id be known as the smoker  
Cause Id cut off and smoke all they hair  
And if I was a Serial Killer  
I would sleep on broken glass and thumbtacks  
And I would smoke mad crack  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
First thing I would do is kill a couple hotties  
Theyd always get some mustard up decapitated bodies  
Dumped on State police law just before dawn  
To let em know my ritual had begun  
Id crack a 40 with the devil tell him dig me a hole  
Cause Im coming when I die until them Im in control  
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though I aint  
But if I was Id do my walls all blood red with blood paint  
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though I aint  
But if I was Id never stop cause I know I cant  
Violent J  
If I was a Serial Killer  
I would drive a black van  
And I would ride around on college campus  
And if I was a Serial Killer  
I would walk among us and gain trust  
Until I needed that rush  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
Id park outside these bitches homes and then drive away  
Then come back with my lights off this time Im here to stay  
Id wear human bones around my neck and have my ceremonies  
Then go back upstairs and microwave some macaronis  
You know whats all up in my trunk  
So dont ask me to pop it  
Once I get out to my cabin  
Then Ill finally unlock it  
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though Im not  
But if I was Id snap a photo once they died on the spot  
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though Im not  
But if I was Id know that I cant so I would never stop  
Violent J  
And I dont know myself anymore  
and I dont know who I am anymore  
And I dont know who to be anymore  
and I dont know who I am anymore  
And I dont know what to think anymore  
and I dont know who I am anymore  
Except that I am strange and deranged  
and I dont know who I am anymore  
And I will never change  
chorus  
I wanna hold up this hatchet  
Psychopathic Records shit well burn the whole planet down  
I wanna run with this hatchet  
We gotta always kick the wicked shit well always be the same  
I wanna hold up this hatchet  
Fuck the world take me under bitch we trying to rule the tunnels  
The Tempest raining lightning balls of fire rain  
ICP with Mike E Clark again  
I wanna run with this hatchet  
Wicked Clowns Blaze Twiztid Boondox and Lotus  
Holding down the underground and you know this  
I wanna run with this hatchet  
You know this  
Chop it on down  
Chop it on down  
I wanna run with this hatchet  
I wanna run with this hatchet  
chorus again  
I wanna hold up this hatchet  
Psychopathic Records shit well burn the whole planet down  
I wanna run with this hatchet  
We gotta always kick the wicked shit well always be the same  
I wanna hold up this hatchet  
Fuck the world take me under bitch we trying to rule the tunnels  
The Tempest raining lightning balls of fire rain  
ICP with Mike E Clark again  
I wanna run with this hatchet  
Wicked Clowns Blaze Twiztid Boondox and Lotus  
Holding down the underground and you know this  
I wanna run with this hatchet  
You know this

If I was a Serial Killer  
I would bury all my special projects  
Underneath the garden in my grandmothers backyard  
And if I was a Serial Killer  
I would be strange and deranged  
And I would rock my hatchet chain
