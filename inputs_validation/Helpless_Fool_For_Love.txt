verse  
I saw you  
It was a rainy day in May or June  
I couldnt help it  
God you looked so fine  
I just had to make you mine all mine  
Well Im a helpless fool for love  
Instantly  
I cannot eat nor sleep no  
Hard to breathe  
You read my love so easy  
A be see  
Twist my mind around and 1 2 3  
Then Im a helpless fool for  
chorus 1  
Ah  
When he walks   
When he talks  
When he moves  
Makes my day  
Im the helpless one  
Ah  
Not unkind  
I dont mind  
When he talks  
Just a rush  
Im a fool for love  
verse  
All shook up  
I know its stupid to precipitate  
Without getting all humiliate  
Didnt know what I should say or do  
Everything Ill give to you and me when Im here without you  
Were gonna have a riot  
Trust in me I cant live without you  
Im gonna make you happy  
What you need helpless fool without you  
Ill give you everything  
Ill try to be you know you know you know you know you know  
Still your helpless fool for  
chorus 2  
Ah  
When he walks  
When he talks  
When he moves  
Makes me feel  
Im a fool for love  
Ah  
What a joy youre my boy  
And it seems like a dream  
Now Im all shook up  
Ah  
Need you Doctor Love  
Are you there  
Every day Im the helpless one  
Ah  
Not unkind  
I dont mind  
When he talks  
Just a rush  
Im a fool for love  
I am a helpless fool for love  
I am a helpless fool for love  
I am a helpless fool for love  
chorus 2  
I am a helpless fool for love
