If Ive told you once Ive told you a thousand times  
You cant go on playing with peoples minds  
But you lied thinking that youd get by  
Breaking hearts one by one in a line  
Cause youre driving me crazy  
I just cant go on making love to a woman  
Whos been playing with me all along  
So dont do that to me anymore  
Dont do that to me anymore  
Dont do that to me anymore  
Dont do that to me anymore  
I can count the times you really made me a fool  
I guess what weve got was a different set of rules  
Well you cried thinking that Id breakdown  
But Im not sure I need you hanging around  
Cause youre driving me crazy  
I just cant go on making love to a woman  
Whos been playing with me all along  
Dont do that to me anymore  
Dont do that to me anymore  
Dont do that to me anymore  
Dont do that to me anymore  
Dont do that to me anymore  
Dont do that to me anymore  
Dont do that to me anymore  
Dont do that to me anymore  
You wont have me to kick around anymore  
Im not a fool for you and thats for sure  
No reason left for you to try to pretend  
I told you before now Ill say it again  
Dont do that to me anymore  
Dont do that to me anymore  
Dont do that to me anymore  
Dont do that to me anymore
