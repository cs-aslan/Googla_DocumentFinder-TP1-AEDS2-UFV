Two feet they come a creepin  
Like a black cat do  
And two bodies are layin naked  
A creeper think he got nothin to lose  
So he creeps into this house yeah  
And unlocks the door  
And as a mans reaching for his trousers  
Shoots him full of thirtyeight holes  
  
Mr Saturday night special  
Got a barrel thats blue and cold  
Aint good for nothin  
But put a man six feet in a hole  
  
Big Jims been drinkin whiskey  
And playin poker on a losin night  
And pretty soon ol Jim starts a thinkin  
Somebody been cheatin and lyin  
So Big Jim commence to fightin  
I wouldnt tell you no lie  
Big Jim done pulled his pistol  
Shot his friend right between the eyes  
  
Mr Saturday night special  
Got a barrel thats blue and cold  
Aint good for nothin  
But put a man six feet in a hole  
  
Oh its the Saturday night special for twenty dollars you can buy yourself
one too  
  
Hand guns are made for killin  
They aint no good for nothin else  
And if you like to drink your whiskey  
You might even shoot yourself  
So why dont we dump em people  
To the bottom of the sea  
Before some ol fool come around here  
Wanna shoot either you or me  
  
Mr Saturday night special  
You got a barrel thats blue and cold  
You aint good for nothin  
But put a man six feet in a hole  
  
Mr the Saturday night special  
And Id like to tell you what you could do with it  
And thats the end of the song
