Before you go  
Do me a favor  
Give me a number  
Of a girl almost like you  
With legs almost like you  
Im buried deep in mass production  
Youre not nothing new  
I like to drive along the freeways  
See the smokestacks belching  
Breasts turn bronw  
So warm and so brown  
  
Though I try to die  
You put me back on the line  
Oh damn it to hell  
Back on the line hell  
Back on the line  
Again and again  
Im back on the line  
Again and again  
And I see my face here  
And its there in the mirror  
And its up in the air  
And Im down on the ground  
  
By the way  
Im going for cigarettes  
And since youve gotta go  
Wont you do me that favor  
Wont you give me that number  
Wont you get me that girl  
Yeah shes almost like you  
Yes shes almost like you  
And Im almost like him  
Yes Im almost like him  
Yes Im almost like him  
Yeah Im almost like him
