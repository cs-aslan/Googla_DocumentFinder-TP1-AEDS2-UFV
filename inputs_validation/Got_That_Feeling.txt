Got that feeling  
Luck is just a little of it  
Got that feeling  
I cant stop winning  
  
A to Z  
Look what youre missing as we speak  
Your numbers rising take a peak  
Theres just enough to go around get a piece  
Your own little piece of hell  
  
Got that feeling  
Loving every minute of it  
Got that feeling  
I cant stop winning  
  
Have a drink  
A pot of coffee cannot think  
Too many friends here just an inch  
Between striking out and striking rich just a risk  
One Ill take and take again  
  
Got that feeling  
Gotta bet a little of it  
Got that feeling  
I cant stop winning  
And start living  
  
You cant borrow tomorrow
