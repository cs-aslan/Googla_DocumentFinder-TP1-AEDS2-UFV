I was on the first ship to Peru  
Charted all the courses like all sailors do  
First to cross the MasonDixon line  
Overseein wetbacks for good California wine  
  
And Ive done it again done it again done it again  
And Ive done it again done it again done it again  
  
I was there when Jan and Liford sang  
First to feel the cold Alaskan white man  
First to take a trip on lsd  
First to vote for Roosevelt back in 33  
  
And Ive done it again done it again done it again  
And Ive done it again done it again done it again  
  
Yes Ive seen it yes Ive seen it  
And deep inside youre brave  
You know I mean it yes I mean it  
  
And Ive done it again done it again done it again  
And Ive done it again done it again done it again  
  
And Ive done it again done it again done it again  
And Ive done it again done it again done it again
