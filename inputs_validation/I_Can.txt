Chorus Regine Velasquez  
I can live I can love  
I can reach the heavens above  
I can right what is wrong  
I can sing just any song  
I can dance I can fly  
And touch the rainbow in the sky  
I can be your good friend  
I can love you Until the end  
  
Mikee Cojuangco  
What took you so long to make me see  
How lucky I am cause I am free  
Free to do the things I wanna do  
  
Donna Cruz  
What took you so long to make me feel  
I can give love  
A love so real  
What took you so long to let me know  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Mikee Donna Regine  
What took you so long to make me cry  
So I would know the reason why  
Im so lucky I can smile I didnt notice for a while  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I can dance I can fly And touch the rainbow in the sky  
I can be your good friend  
I can love you Until the end
