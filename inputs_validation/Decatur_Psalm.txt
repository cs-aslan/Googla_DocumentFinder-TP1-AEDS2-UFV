Cool Breeze  
I call the crib they say Breeze you aint know  
I say What  
Big Time got popped in his Benzo  
I said Damn man Im riding in his Lexus  
Im bout to dump this niggas shit in New Dimensions  
Get to the crib so I can call Big Slate up  
And tell em the money man done slipped and got his throat cut  
And everything that we took from the warehouse  
I heard somebody talking bout it at the White House  
Man I thought you said that this job was for me and you  
I aint know that Bill Clampett wanted some too  
You tell his folks that Im sorry bout that Lexus  
Im bout to dip and see my sister up in no  
Cant even tell you where I put my extra player card  
Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys  
Just tell everybody who us a dime  
Its the Great Hoe Round Up Yo Money time  
I got to have mine then Im outta here  
Take a loss come back up just like Coco Grier  
Aint got to worry bout yo partner getting caught like a lame  
It wont be over til that big girl from Decatur sang  
  
It wont be over till that big girl from Decatur sang  
East Pointe police dont know a damn thing  
  
Big Boi  
Yeah it wont be over  
Check this out  
Can you see what I be hearing talking to spirits when I sleep  
Peep this out real quick Slick we gets on this beat and speak  
about that pimp shit that walk with that limp shit that hemp shit  
Looking up in your face I see a coward and a dimwit  
Looking to run up in my private home just like you was the folks  
Serving a warrant to a baby daddy who do they come to quote  
On a Tuesday April Fools Day dont get caught slipping  
Leaving the keys off in the ignition making me guilty by suspicion  
Penny pinchers trying to stack for ninetysix  
Buying another Fleetwood Diamond took it so know wes in the mix  
I need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off  
Cause them niggas at the corner sto been looking at me for too long  
Staring like accidents on highways high days are better than sober ones  
Dont be biased but I know it has to come  
So I put two in the sky to let them know Im babysitting  
Yall dont know nothing bout Big Boi cause that nigga steady dipping  
It aint over why that why that till the bitch open her mouth up  
and sang  
  
Big Gipp  
Took me a long time to get here  
Long time man  
Im talking about years and years  
Riding past funeral fields holding bodies of my peers  
If you dont educate yourself  
Now how the fuck you gonna understand how you posed to get paid  
Niggas walk around get with shade tree ass ways  
Fuck a fade let my hair drag  
Back and forth like a seesaw  
Jumping Lily to lilypad dad  
Looking to get my Goodie feel  
Im broke in like some old men  
Whod stop them or would stop  
Im dropping lines for the big plot  
Sixteen is when I started to dream  
Its ninetysix Im in your face  
Can you hear that bitch scream  
  
It wont be over til that big girl from Decatur sang
