Your man is always flaming  
Hes hitting his head against the wall  
He do it to you  
He do it again he knows to do  
Ive always found you complicated  
A boy tried to shut you up  
I do what I do  
I do it again again again  
And Id like you to know  
Its alright  
Theres a world around us  
I need you to know  
Im alright  
No need to worry about me  
Cause Im just fine  
Your man has lost his meaning  
Smash his head against the wall  
He do it to you  
He do it again  
Hes coming back to you  
You give me the strangest feeling  
You shut me of myself  
You do it to me  
Then you do it again  
Then you do it again  
Then you do it again  
Then you do it again  
And Id like you to know  
Its alright  
Theres a world around us  
I need you to know  
Im alright  
No need to worry about me  
Cause Im just fine  
Im just Im just fine  
And Id like you to know Im alright  
Its a world around us  
I need you to know  
Im alright  
No need to worry about me  
Cause Im just fine  
Im just fine  
Im just fine  
Im just fine
