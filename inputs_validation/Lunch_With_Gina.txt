That must be her again  
Shes leaning on my bell  
That cold psychotic ring  
The one I know so well  
So Im nailed to the floor in the nooption zone  
Theres about zero chance shell give up and go home  
  
This endless afternoon  
It started on the day I met her  
Lunch with Gina is forever  
  
Shes coming round the corner  
Her bodys just a blur  
I peel out like The Flash  
It dont mean boo to her  
So I duck into Ninos shes barred from the place  
The minute I walk out shes right in my face  
  
Shes got nothing but time  
No use in trying to be clever  
Lunch with Gina is forever  
  
Now Im in my apartment  
The blinds down the lights out  
The phone rings God help me  
Theres nobody home  
  
I crouch on the carpet  
Not breathing just being  
Like meat on the bone  
  
Im in a cozy booth  
Maybe my watch is fast  
Another Tanqueray  
Ill wait til twenty past  
Im about to go postal when she waltzes in  
I guess shes a knockout hey where have I been  
  
The waiter never comes  
God knows the service could be better  
Lunch with Gina is forever  
  
Coffee and a kiss  
Maybe later maybe never  
Lunch with Gina
