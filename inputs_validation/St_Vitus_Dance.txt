So you think you know whats going on inside her head  
You think she wants your money but its you she wants instead  
  
When you think about the things that she did long ago  
It breaks your heart but deep down boy you dont want her to go  
You feel your love so shattering  
You feel you want to die  
Just because someone did take off  
Telling you a lie  
  
If I were you Id try again and try to make amends  
She only thinks of you you know Im talking as a friend
