To be that good it must be taxin  
No such thing as satisfaction  
Youre makin things happen while Im relaxin  
Like a Sunday afternoon  
My dad used to tell me I was lazy  
I got dance moves like Patrick Swayze  
Im the left over turkey for the worlds mayonnaise  
The star next to the moon  
  
Now I know Im just here to amuse you  
And I dont mean to abuse you  
But if I could just use you one time  
  
Tell me what its like  
To be the queen of it all  
The Neiman Marcus of the Mall  
And tell me what its like to be the one and only  
All American Girl  
  
Now I never had a supernatural feelin  
Not to mention a sexual healin  
But every now and then I get to the kneelin  
To thank him for it all  
But you probably got some inside connection  
So many numbers that you gotta rolodex them  
So much muscle that you never gotta flex them  
To catch you when you fall  
  
And I know Im just here to amuse you  
And I dont mean to confuse you  
But if I could just use you one more time  
  
Tell me what its like to be the house on the hill  
The number one diet pill  
And tell me what its like to be the one and only  
All American Girl  
  
Now I bet you wont say you get crazy  
Or that you dont shave your legs  
When youre lazy  
Or that youre just like everybody else in the world  
You just got lucky thats all  
  
And I know youre not here to amuse me  
But you sure know how to confuse me  
So if I could just ask you once again  
  
To tell me what its like to be a star on the rise  
A breakfast cereal prize  
And tell me what its like to be the one and only  
All American Girl  
The All American Girl  
The all amazing crazy girl
