Each day just goes so fast  
I turn around its past  
You dont get time to hang a sign on me  
  
Love me while you can  
Or Ill get a plan  
  
A lifetime is so short  
A new one cant be bought  
But what youve got means such a lot to me  
  
Make love all day long  
Make love singing songs  
  
Make love all day long  
Make love singing songs  
  
Theres people standing round  
Who screw you in the ground  
Theyll fill you in with all the things you see  
  
Ill make love to you  
If you want me to
