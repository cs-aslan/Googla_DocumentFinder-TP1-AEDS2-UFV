I pray on Christmas  
That the Lord will see me through  
I pray on Christmas  
Hell show me what to do  
  
I pray on Christmas  
Hell help me understand  
And I pray on Christmas  
Hell take me by the hand  
  
I pray on Christmas  
That the sick will soon be strong  
I pray on Christmas  
The Lord will hear my song  
  
I pray on Christmas  
That God will lead the way  
And I pray on Christmas  
Hell get me through another day  
  
I pray on Christmas
