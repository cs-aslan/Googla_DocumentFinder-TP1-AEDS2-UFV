Mota  
Everyday well its the same  
That bong thats on the table starts to call  
My name  
  
I take a hit and zone out again  
Ill be paranoid and hungry by a quarter to ten  
Watching reruns on my TV  
Im laughing off my ass at Threes Company  
  
I dont know if Im understood  
Buy hearing Jimmy Buffett never sounded so good  
Your memorys gone and so is your life your life  
  
Mota Boy  
But losing out just never felt so right  
Your enemys you and so is your life your life  
Mota Boy  
But losing out might feel okay all night  
Mota  
  
Im driving down to the barrio  
Going 15 miles an hour cause Im already stoned  
Give the guy a twenty and wait in the car  
He tosses me a baggie then he runs real far  
  
I take a hit but it smells like a clove  
Oh fuck I got a baggie of oregano  
This ritual is destroying me  
But I guess it could be worse  
It could be methedrine  
  
Your memorys gone and so is your life your life  
Mota Boy  
But losing out just never felt so right  
Your enemys you and your couch is your life  
Your Life  
  
Mota Boy  
But losing out might take  
Losing out might take you all night  
Mota  
Losing out might feel okay all night  
Yeah losing out might feel okay all life
