Hey hey  
  
Look closer you can see all the money  
I got a dollar bill in the cockpit  
Surprised that your wallet is a black hole  
I got another job at the liquor store damn  
  
Oh well Im bone broke  
  
They got a white pony in the stable  
And ride him when the doggie isnt able  
But he doesnt really care because they pay him  
But still a black suit is gonna shake him down  
  
Oh well Im bone broke  
Hey broke as Ill ever be  
  
It look another way girl Im telling ya  
God gave seven minutes right to ya  
And your mother put her money into platinum  
And now you never have to pay attention do ya do ya  
  
Uh huh  
  
Yeah Im kneeling on a brick with my nails  
Im telling her the moneys in the mail  
Keeps shiny in my box never fake it  
But now the brick breakers gonna break it down  
  
Oh well Im bone broke  
  
Look another way girl Im telling ya  
God gave seven minutes right to ya  
Your mother put her money into platinum  
So that you wouldnt have to pay attention right
