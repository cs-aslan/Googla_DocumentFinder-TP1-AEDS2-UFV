Thousand miles  
Of lonesome highway  
Drinking gallons of coffee in a little cafe  
Brought me here and its so good to find theres someone whos got  
The same story as mine  
  
Just look at us were a couple hard cases  
So howd we end up where we are  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
I feel somethin hittin me awful hard  
I dont know where its callin me  
Well I just know it starts  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
  
Alison  
Been so long  
I cant believe Id get somethin so sweet  
Where an ache used to be dont fall  
If love anymore but Id never met anyone like you before  
Stay here with me for a couple more weeks  
I think theres somethin goin on  
  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
I feel somethin hittin me awful hard  
Dont know where its callin me  
I just know it starts  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
  
Shenandoah  
Well it sure took a while to find it  
Its been waiting there all this time  
Both  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
I feel somethin hittin me awful hard  
Alison  
Dont know where its callin me  
Shenandoah  
Well I just know it starts  
Both  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart
