Leigh Anne  
I dont want to need you like I do  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
Hard to stay away from something as fine as you  
  
Will I be the one you love enough  
Or just another angel I cant touch  
Leave me in between that will never do  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
Just a little piece aint enough of you  
  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
I dont want to chase you like a fool  
Up and down the avenue  
Carry your books home too  
  
Let me be the one you love enough  
Youre just another angel I cant touch  
Something in between itll never do  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
Just a little piece aint enough of you  
  
No no no  
Dont say no  
I dont want to need you like I do  
Just want to get close to you  
No no no  
Please dont go  
Cause baby youll find  
That Im too good to lose  
  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
I dont want to need you like I do  
Up and down the avenue  
Im gonna carry your books home too  
  
Someday Ill be the one you love enough  
Or just another angel I cant touch  
Nothing in between will ever do  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
Just a little piece aint enough of you  
  
No no no  
No no no  
Just a little piece aint enough of you
