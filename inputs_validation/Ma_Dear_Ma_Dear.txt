Ma dear Ma dear she told me one day  
That Id meet my true love and take her away  
She said Id be happy and to be good and true  
Id never be lonely broken hearted or blue  
  
Ma dear Ma dear just like you said  
I met my true love one and we are to wed  
Ma dear shes an angel and Im goin to be true  
Or else I may lose her I dont want to lose her to somebody new  
  
Ma dear Ma dear I was not untrue  
I tried hard to please her but shes gone and Im blue  
Ma dear Im so lonesome broken hearted too  
Ma dear Ma dear oh Ma dear what must I do
