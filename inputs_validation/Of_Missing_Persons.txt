Your father was a rounder  
He played that rock and roll  
A leaper and a bounder  
Down to his gypsy soul  
The music was his angel  
And sorrow was his star  
And those of us who follow  
Might hope to reach as far  
  
Theyre walking slow in Houston  
Speechless in DC  
Theres no way I could tell you  
What he meant to me  
  
Your mothers a survivor  
Shell do what must be done  
Her children will revive her  
And help her see the sun  
She almost knew that unison  
But the singing stopped too soon  
Now she shares the silence  
With a man up in the moon  
  
To speak of missing persons  
Tonight theres only one  
And we all carry with us what the mans begun  
  
And you can sing this song  
On July the Fourth  
In the sunny south and the frozen north  
Its a day of loss its your day of birth  
Does it take a death to learn what a life is worth  
  
Your brothers are all older  
And theyll take it in their stride  
The worlds a little colder  
But manhoods on their side  
Now youre the little girlchild  
And you look so much like him  
And hes right there inside you  
Each time you want to sing  
  
Sing of missing persons  
Tonight theres only one  
But hes where you can find him when its said and done  
  
And we will sing this song  
On July the Fourth  
From the sunny south and the frozen north  
This will always be your day of birth  
May you always see what your life is worth
