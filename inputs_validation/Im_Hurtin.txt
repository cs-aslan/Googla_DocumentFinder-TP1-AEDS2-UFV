Oh Im hurtin  
  
Felt this wayyesterday  
Today I keep hurtin yeah hurtin  
  
Time goes by right on by  
And I Im still hurtin yeah hurtin  
  
You walked away and the pain began  
I knew Id never love again  
  
Oh my heart tore apart  
And Im sure hurtin yeah hurtin  
  
You walked away and the pain began  
I knew Id never love again  
  
Seems to me my destiny  
Is to be just hurtin  
Yeah hurtin
