Im gonna love that girl  
Like shes never been loved before  
Im gonna show that girl  
Shes the fella that I adore  
When shes in my arms again  
Our dreams will all come true  
The years between might never have been  
Well start our lives anew  
Im gonna kiss that girl  
Like shes never been kissed before  
And tho I miss that girl  
Shes the fella Im waitin for  
Well never part again  
Shell hold my heart again  
Forever and ever more  
Im gonna love that girl  
Like shes never been loved before
