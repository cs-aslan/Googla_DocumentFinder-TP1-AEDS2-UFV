If I paint the lashes dark  
And the eyes more bright  
And your lips more scarlet  
Ask if itll all be right  
And its mirror after mirror  
No vanities displayed  
Youre just looking for the face you had  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made  
  
And if I look upon you now  
As though I have my view  
With the earth beneath your feet  
And heaven up above  
Would you think me cruel  
After everythings been said  
Youre only looking for the face you had  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made  
  
And if I paint the lashes dark  
And your eyes more bright  
And your lips more scarlet  
Ask if itll all be right  
And its mirror after mirror  
No vanities displayed  
Im just looking for the face you had  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made  
  
Your original face  
Before time and space  
Your original face  
Before time and space  
Your original original face  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made
