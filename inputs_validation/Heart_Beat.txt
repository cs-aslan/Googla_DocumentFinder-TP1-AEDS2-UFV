Is it a crime to love a woman  
To give her everything  
People change she goes away  
And youre left with nothing  
Youve been together for so long  
Thats whats makin it hard  
Just like an oldfashioned noose  
You cry some tears and you move along  
In your arms I was singin  
Now my ears are ringin  
To hear your heart beat for another man  
Can you be in love again  
When youve been burned through and through  
Having to stop with an open heart  
Leaves a lot to lose  
cause youve been together for so long  
Thats whats makin it hard  
Just like an oldfashioned noose  
You cry some tears move along  
In your arms I was singin  
Now my ears are ringin  
To hear your heart beat for another man
