The night we met  
The night that I wont forget  
You seemed what Id been waiting for  
But baby Ive been wrong before  
  
You held me tight  
And everything seemed just right  
I couldnt ask for me  
But baby Ive been wrong before  
  
He used to smile at me  
And ahold my hand like you do  
Then he left me  
And abroke my heart in two  
  
I see your face  
And feel your warm embrace  
Youre all that I adore  
But baby Ive been wrong before  
  
Oh baby Ive been wrong before
