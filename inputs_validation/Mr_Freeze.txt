You will be the lucky one  
Who will see the deadly one  
You will die on your knees  
By the hand of Mr Freeze  
  
Will you see when the rest are blind  
Will you remain frozen in time  
Will you flee underground  
  
Watch the blanket search the ground  
You will die on your knees  
By the hand of Mr Freeze  
  
Horror awaits for those who evade  
Ice cold blood stops in their veins  
  
Arm yourselves to the T  
Repel the threat of Mr Freeze  
See the blood drop in your eye  
See your family burned alive  
  
I dont even know you  
I just know where you live  
I raided your childs bedroom  
And burned his virgin skin  
  
I crucified your nation  
I left the dead rot  
I parade down the street  
Carrying an iron cross  
  
The oceans have been ripped away  
It does no good to pray  
Catalysm  
Men restore to cannibalism  
  
Im worth all youd care for  
Then Ill fuck you in the ass  
Im so fucking happy  
Ill kick your face and laugh  
  
Todays war stories  
At night you can hear him scream  
Theres blood on your pillow  
This is no bad dream  
You try to think with reason  
But all you can do is scream
