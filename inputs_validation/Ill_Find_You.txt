We give we take we bend until we break  
We touch and feel to hurt or heal  
And in the end  
  
We run so far from who we really are  
And we starve and thirst we praise and curse  
And I dont care  
  
How near or far Ill find you wherever you are  
You know Ill find you wherever you go  
  
We shout and scream but its just a silly dream  
And we hold it inside like its live or die  
Till in the end we learn to wait  
And we squeeze the hands of fate  
And we twist and turn  
We freeze and burn but I dont care  
  
How near or far Ill find you wherever you are  
You know Ill find you wherever you go  
Through the time and space  
Ill always see your face  
And if I must count every star  
  
How near or far Ill find you wherever you are  
You know Ill find you wherever you go
