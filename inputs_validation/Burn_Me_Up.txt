verse 1  
I would like to be a martyr  
Over time its getting harder  
Who do I have to go and kill  
To get my face on a dollar bill  
chorus 1  
Every single time I look  
Someone else has beat me to it  
Some poor bastard bites the dust  
I really dont know who to trust  
But theres one thing I cant deny  
Id rather it was me they fried  
Have a drink from an empty cup  
Light a match and burn me up  
verse 2  
Im exhausted Im committed  
Im outsmarted Im out witted  
My heads filled with dynamite  
Its coming out of my ears at night  
chorus 2  
I think I am being watched  
Electric eyes that never turn off  
Radar beams insinuating  
Evil thoughts while Im masturbating  
And even my old trinitron  
Its comin through when nothings on  
Have a drink from an empty cup  
Light a match and burn me up  
instrumental
