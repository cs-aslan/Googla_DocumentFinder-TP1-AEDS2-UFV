Girl on the phone keeps aringing back  
Her voice is smooth but the tone is bland  
Shes telling me this and shes telling me that  
She talks about me and I must agree  
With what she says about me  
About how nice I can be  
But it makes no difference to my mind  
  
Girl on the phone keeps aringing back  
She knows all my details  shes got my facts  
She tells me my height and she knows my weight  
She knows my age and says shes knows fate  
  
And I must say  its logical  
What foresight she must have  
Ive got to meet her whenever I get time  
  
Says she knows everything about me  
Every word Ive ever said  
Every book Ive ever read  
She told me that we met along time ago  
I cant think when but she should know  
  
Girl on the phone keeps aringing back  
Knows where I get my shirts and where I get my pants  
Where I get my trousers where I get socks  
My leg measurements and the size of my cock  
  
And I must say its unnerving  
To think that she knows me  
Knows me so well  better than anyone  
Better than myself  
  
Says she knows everything about me  
Every record Ive listened to  
Every window that Ive looked through  
She told me that we met along time ago  
I cant think when but she should know  
  
Girl on the phone keeps aringing back  
Shes telling me this and shes telling me that
