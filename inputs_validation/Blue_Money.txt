The photographer smiles  
Take a break for a while  
Take a rest do your very best  
Take five honey  
Five honey  
  
You search in your bag  
Light up a fag  
Think its a drag but youre so glad  
To be alive honey  
Alive honey  
  
Hey when this is all over  
Youll be in clover  
Well go out and spend  
All of your blue money  
Blue money  
  
Do do you do  
  
Well the cameraman smiles  
Take a break for a while  
Do your best do your very best  
Take five honey  
Take five  
  
You search in your bag  
Light up a fag  
Say its a drag but youre so glad  
To be alive honey  
Alive honey  
  
When this is all over  
Youll be in clover  
Well go on out and spend  
All of your blue money  
Blue money

Youll be in clover  
Well go on out and spend  
All of your blue money
