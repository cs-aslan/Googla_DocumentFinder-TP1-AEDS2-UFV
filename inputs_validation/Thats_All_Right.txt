You told me baby once upon a time  
You said if I would be yours you would sure be mine  
Thats alright  
I know you dont love me no more baby but thats alright  
Every night and day I wonder who is loving you tonight  
  
You told me baby your love for me was strong  
When I woke up little girl half of this big world was  
gone  
Thats alright  
I guess Ill never be the same but thats alright  
  
Every night and day I wonder who is loving you tonight  
  
Please tell me baby whats getting wrong with you  
You dont treat me halfway right baby look a like you  
used to do  
But thats alright  
I guess Ill never be the same but thats alright  
Every night and day I wonder who is loving you tonight
