The snitch the snoop the tattletale  
Lead a threadbare up stairs  
Adieu my little ballyhoo  
You broke my heart in two  
And now I haunt the bars and scent those trite affairs  
She went home to gather her comb  
And caught him unawares  
  
And there was her man enjoying the lay of the land  
He took a walk in the dark with a dish from the stand  
Girls and their creations  
Tight in the brightest grenadine  
But Id take all that Ive seen  
For a slow drag with Josephine  
  
Josephine Josephine  
But Id trade all that Ive seen for a slow drag with Josephine  
  
Gavotte garrotes Cotillions and slow Arabesques  
Drumrolls and Farandoles were all made in jest  
But when you make that move  
I cant resist  
When will you declare your armistice  
  
Josephine Josephine  
But Id trade all that Ive seen for a slow drag with Josephine  
  
In another time and place a different fate was cast  
He tried to skeddledaddledo  
She might have slapped him  
Just for saying Grant one more chance before you pass  
Then curse the nurse that named me the first or bury me at last  
  
And in threequarter time  
The true and the false  
Dancing the Hesitation Waltz  
Then comes the flirtation  
And temptation  
Hip hip hooray  
Listen to what I say  
Then you can take it away
