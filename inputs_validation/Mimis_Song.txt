Spoken  
You know tonight is a very important night  
For me for a number of reasons  
My little girl is here tonight  
And I dont think you understand  
What its like being the daughter of  
Someone whos always gone  
Its kind of scary and its kind of lonely  
And I guess she thinks to herself sometimes  
Is mummy ever going ever gonna come home  
And so my daughter looked up at me  
Last week and she said mummy  
When are you just gonna stay home  
One day and be with me  
And so it kinda struck me funny  
And I didnt realize that I hadnt spent  
Anytime with her for a long time  
So I sat down and wrote down this song  
After she went to bed  
And I told her tonight when it was bedtime  
I would sing her son  
I bet you ask yourself  
Why Im never there  
Its not because I like being away  
You see Ive made a spectacle of myself  
And it seems that the whole world needs me  
I understand when you cry alone  
And mamas not there to wipe your eyes  
You see its only because  
Im out being someone to make you cry  
I got a little letter  
And I read it on the plane  
And in my heart I felt a funny kind of pain  
I wish that I could be there  
To touch your face again  
Mimi youre beautiful  
Mimi youre mine  
And other things that I do in my life  
Seem to take up all your precious time  
Theres so much I long to say  
So much more I long to do  
But I guess its all just have to wait  
Till I can get to see you  
Mimi youre mine  
Oh Mimi youre mine  
Oh Mimi you fill my life  
You fill my life with so much love  
Cause youre beautiful  
And you love me  
And youll understand  
Mimi its bedtime say Goodnight  
Goodnight
