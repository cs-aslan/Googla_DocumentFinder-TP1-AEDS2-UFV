I was addicted to you  
But I didnt know it  
You were afflicted by booze  
You didnt show it huh  
  
Life is a velvet crowbar  
Hittin you over the head  
Youre bleeding but you want more  
This is so like you I said  
Put yourself on back to bed  
  
Youre like crack to me  
I dont want to leave  
Im watchin you sleep  
Pray youll start breathin  
My babys on his  
Eighth life darlin  
Stayin with him  
Till the mornin  
  
Youre like crack to me  
So fun I cant see  
With your golden grill  
Your purple dream  
My babys on his  
Eighth life darlin  
Gonna watch him  
Till the mornin  
  
I was addicted to you  
Didnt wanna blow it  
You were a dick with your crew  
Always on the road  
  
You wanna touch life so hard  
Why cant you give it a rest  
Youre not that bright for a star  
Burned yourself out nothing left  
  
Youre like crack to me  
I dont want to leave  
Im watchin you sleep  
Pray youll start breathin  
My babys on his  
Eighth life darlin  
Stayin with him  
Till the mornin  
  
Youre like crack to me  
So fun I cant see  
With your golden grill  
Your purple dream  
My babys on his  
Eighth life darlin  
Gonna watch him  
Till the mornin  
  
Styrofome on the microphone  
Cant give it up  
Cant go it alone  
Flame coloured paradise  
For you darlin  
But death doesnt come  
With a warning  
  
Life is a velvet crowbar  
Hittin you over the head  
Youre bleeding syrup amour  
Bleeding to death  
  
Youre like crack to me  
I dont want to leave  
Im watchin you sleep  
Pray youll start breathin  
My babys on his  
Eighth life darlin  
Stayin with him  
Till the mornin  
  
Youre like crack to me  
So fun I cant see  
With your golden grill  
Your purple dream  
My babys on his  
Eighth life darlin  
Gonna watch him  
Till the mornin  
  
My babys on his  
Last life darlin  
Gonna stay around  
Till morning  
  
My babys on his  
Last life darlin  
Ive got to stick around  
Till morning
