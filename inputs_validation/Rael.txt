The Red Chins in their millions  
Will over spill their borders  
And chaos then will reign in our Rael  
  
Rael the home of my religion  
To me the center of the Earth  
  
The Red Chins in their millions  
Will over spill their borders  
And chaos then will reign in our Rael  
  
My heritage is threatened  
My roots are torn and cornered  
And so to do my best Ill homeward sail  
And so to do my best Ill homeward sail  
  
Now Captain listen to my instructions  
Return to this spot on Christmas Day  
Look toward the shore for my signal  
And then youll know if in Rael Ill stay  
  
If a yellow flag is fluttering  
Sickly herald against the morn  
Then youll know my courage has ended  
And youll send your boat ashore  
  
But if a red flag is flying  
Brazen bold against the blue  
Then youll know that I am staying  
And my yacht belongs to you  
  
Now Captain listen to my instructions  
Return to this spot on Christmas Day  
Look toward the shore for my signal  
And then youll know if in Rael Ill stay  
  
Hes crazy if he thinks were coming back again  
Hes crazy if he thinks were coming back again  
Hes crazy if he thinks were coming back again  
Hes crazy anyway  
  
If a yellow flag is fluttering  
Sickly herald against the morn  
Then youll know my courage has ended  
And youll send your boat ashore
