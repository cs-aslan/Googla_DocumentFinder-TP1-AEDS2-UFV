We had a good thing going  
But its all over now girl  
We had a good thing going  
That is so hard to find  
  
Weve been in love  
But you didnt really care  
I wanted you  
And your love to share  
  
I said baby  
Is it something Ive done  
I said baby  
Is it something Ive said  
Dont make me cry  
No no no no no  
  
We had a good thing going  
But its all over now girl  
We had a good thing going  
That is so hard to find  
  
I didnt know you  
Had a doubt in your mind  
With a kiss you  
Didnt show any sign  
You made a fool out of me  
And I was too blind  
I couldnt see  
It was over for me yeah  
  
We had a good thing going  
But its all over now girl  
We had a good thing going  
But its all over now  
All over now  
All over now
