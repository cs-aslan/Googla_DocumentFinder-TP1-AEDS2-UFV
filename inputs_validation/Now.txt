Like it played loud  
Powerhouse sounds  
My body wants to rock and let it out  
Really high born  
  
Morning till dawn  
Im going all the way just on and on  
Its gonna be wild its gonna be wild  
Its gonna be wild  
Now  
  
Teach me to fly  
want to stay high  
I have to live it up before I die  
Nightlife and booze  
Girls to choose  
  
Are you ready baby come on lets cruise  
Its gonna be wild its gonna be wild  
Its gonna be wild  
Now  
  
Getting out of control  
Theres nothing that can bring me down  
Nothing Ill leave out tonight  
Im feeling good Im living now  
  
Like it real hot  
Never cant stop  
Im running down the line to the top  
Never stay low  
  
Im on the go  
No one holds me back  
Its gonna be wild its gonna be wild  
Its gonna be wild  
Now  
  
Its gonna be wild its gonna be wild  
Its gonna be wild  
Now Now Now Now Now Now Now
