Breathe air youre not used to tread floors you dont fall through  
Make waves  
You crash a symbol hard  
Follow no one always play the wrong card  
Waste days in foreign places  
Shed lights on your better side  
Reassure me that youll wait for me wait for me as long as it takes  
  
And Ill hold my breath Ill hold my breath  
  
Until you see me in your dreams  
Well stay awake beneath the trees  
Well watch the buildings turn to dust  
A sky of diamonds just for us  
You are the risk Ill always take  
The only branch Ill never break  
Those fears well blow them all way  
  
Fight fires in your best clothes touch skin with your eyes closed  
Chase thunder  
With the volume down  
Pack a suitcase wonder to the next town  
Force quit on your losing streak  
Solve a riddle in a magazine be tongue in cheek  
Tell me that were still too young that were still too young and Ill my
tongue  
  
Until you see me in your dreams  
Well stay awake beneath the trees  
Well watch the buildings turn to dust  
A sky of diamonds just for us  
You are the risk Ill always take  
The only branch Ill never break  
Those fears well blow them all way  
  
Im here Im here to save you  
No fall I will swim to save you  
  
Until you see me in your dreams  
Well stay awake beneath the trees  
Well watch the buildings turn to dust A sky of diamonds just for us  
You are the risk Ill always take  
The only branch Ill never break  
Those fears well blow them all way
