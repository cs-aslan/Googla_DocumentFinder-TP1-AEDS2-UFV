Searching back through the friends Ive known  
Sometimes sad for the way its grown  
Ranging up and ranging out  
And trying to change my ways about  
Theres a place in the leaf a place in the bough  
Found a place for me just now just now just now  
Moving on with every word  
Moving with all the words Ive heard  
Turning the wheel as fast as I can  
Turning the wheel to make me a man  
Theres a man in the moon a man in the sea  
Growing strong theres a man in me just now just now just now  
No behind and no before  
Theres no need to worry any more  
Happy then happy now  
Theres always a way to get happy somehow  
Friend on the road a friend in the home  
A better friend now than Ive ever known just now just now just now  
Searching back for the friends Ive known  
Sometimes sad for the way its grown  
Changing up and ranging out  
And trying to change my ways about
