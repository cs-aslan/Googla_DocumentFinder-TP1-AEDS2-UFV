Dont you like to see the hero take his licks like a man  
Stand up and be tested and be true   
Would you like to be a hero in your life  well you can  
Did you know its up to you   
Would you trade your place with jesus on the cross if you could  
Shining through eternity   
Would it bother you to know that you can be just as good  
As you really want to be   
And if youre bound to do your duty then its time that you do  
Look your future in the face  
For the most important person in the world which is you  
Or the whole damn human race  
Chorus  
Theres a holy band of angels flying high through the night  
Where no mortal ever trod  
Singing holy holy holy holy oh jesus christ  
Is the lord almighty god  
  
You see the good thing is you dont have to be as good as jesus to  
Start out with  
All you gotta do ask yourself how would gary cooper have done it  
Or john kennedy  
Or martin luther king  
Or malcom x   
Chorus  
Theres a holy band of angels flying high through the night  
Where no mortal ever trod  
Singing holy holy holy holy oh jesus christ  
Is the lord almighty god
