Chorus  
Most thugs front when they get the chance say what  
Some thugs hit the blunt when they get the chance say what  
Live thugs stack chedder then they make plans say what  
  
I Cool J NY2K  
Rule milleniums with my compadres  
They tounges sway with really nothing to say  
They pack guns but I stack funds  
Im second to none  
My hot streaks just begun  
You want to bring beef You got to serve it welldone  
You ran the wrong way now you livin on the run  
Not some each ones a bum every one  
Coughed up a lung became my son  
Flames I brung platinumn weighs a ton  
Heavy on the chest I pitty all the rest  
I put em to the test  
I spit it like Im blessed  
I testify  
I have no need to lie  
I buried many still many want to die  
I zone out crazy starin dont faze me  
Got ya whole strategy shook  
Its too daisy  
  
Chorus  
Clack relaod clack reload  
Got ya pictures sittin in my lap  
He explode  
Duck when you hear the rattattat  
Cause once you cross over baby aint no comin back  
believe that  
I flows when I hit that  
Strive till I get that  
Never mind a setback  
No time to wet that  
A lyrical hijack you dont want to try that  
Creep wit my CD dont let em know you buy that  
One in the snips one in the whip with the low jack  
Call a 911 to get the LL back  
Original bells LL  
Rocked them till they fell  
Competition bailed  
Looked like mince green when mic had em swelled  
Wrote all them rhymes and never gonna sell  
Meanwhile Im countin prezzies in the the tel  
And in the meanwhile I throw my baby in Chanelle  
  
Chorus  
Unh Im lyrically hot tonight come on  
Unh Im lyrically hot tonight come on  
Layin low to catch you on stage so I can run on  
Matter fact you not on my level I throw my son on  
Mission is complete technique is unique  
Defeat the rhyme weak and mine ya kneedeep  
Rewind a rip beats and give jeeps the heat  
Even if you walkin wit ya walkman in the street  
Actin gassed up but you really on need  
How you countin your paper kid without a GED  
Slow down let me do my thing now hold up  
Maybe thats the reason you stressed quick to roll up  
Put the L down picked the other LL up  
Maybe we can straighten this out before its toeup  
Watch me closely boom Im a blowup  
And spend the whole rest of my life stackin dough up  
  
Chorus  
Whoo Vinnie Biggs you hot with this one dawg  
Roundtree  
Rock The Bells  
Unh Brian Daughtery  
Unh all my peeps my peeps my peeps across the land  
Know what I mean we gonna keep gettin paper  
This is real  
This is real right here  
Rock The Bells  
Its deeper than the deepest blue sea dawg  
Know what Im sayin  
Im feelin it like you feelin it  
ha ha word up  
Im lovin it like you lovin it baby  
Rewind it its short
