Theres a certain feeling  
Known to all who hear the sound  
The call of morning rising  
Youre in a mystic space  
Cant you feel the force embrace the chill of the wind  
As it names you  
  
Oh cant you see the lies in front of you  
Your journey ends so far and still the distance  
Spins round and round you  
Now you cry  give me sanctuary  
You scream but no one listens  
Again you cry  give me sanctuary  
Until the end Ill fight and die to be free  
Oh No sanctuary  
  
Youre walking halfway in  
But crawling halfway out  
Theres a void in your mind that you cling to  
You feel lost in time youve got no words to rhyme  
No more charms no more spells to protect you  
  
Oh cant you see the lies in front of you  
Your journey ends so far and still the distance  
Spins round and round you  
Now you cry  give me sanctuary  
You scream but no one listens  
Again you cry  give me sanctuary  
Until the end Ill fight and die  
Oh Ive got to be free
