Are you missing something  
Looking for something  
Tired of everything  
Searching and struggling  
Are you worried about it  
Do you wanna talk about it  
Oh Youre gonna get it right some time  
  
Theres so much to be scared of  
And not much to make sense of  
Are you running in a circle  
You cant be too careful  
And you cant relate it  
Cause its complicated  
Oh Youre gonna get it right some time  
Youre gonna get it right some time  
  
Its how you see the world  
How many times can you see  
You cant believe what you learn  
  
Its how you see the world  
Dont you worry yourself  
Your not gonna get hurt  
  
Oh  
  
Is there something missing  
Theres nobody listening  
Are you scared of what you dont know  
dont wanna end up on your own  
You need conversation  
And information  
  
Oh  
  
Gonna get it right sometimes  
You just wanna get it right sometimes  
  
Its how you see the world  
How many times have you heard  
You cant believe a word  
  
Its how you see the world  
Dont you worry yourself  
Cause nobody can learn  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Thats how you see the world  
Thats how you see the world
