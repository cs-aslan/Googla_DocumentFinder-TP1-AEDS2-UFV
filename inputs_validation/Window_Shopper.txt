Forevers a lonely time and the dogs arent always  
Arent always on my mind  
Cause I didnt free them  
The scenery is burning me cause Im still in it  
So why dont you free me  
Cause its not my business  
What hes done to me  
Control is all you really need  
And I cant believe it  
I cant believe that  
You didnt see me  
  
Passing glances fall on me  
Like screams on deaf ears  
Theyre all laughing at me  
With encouraging cheers  
What hes done to me  
Control is all you really need  
And I cant believe it  
I cant believe that  
You wouldnt free me  
  
Why dont you see me  
Why dont you free me  
I cant believe that  
You dont believe me  
  
I guess I had it comin  
My fault for not runnin  
I just dressed too tempting  
Cause your heads fuckin empty  
And I cant believe it  
I cant believe that you didnt see me
