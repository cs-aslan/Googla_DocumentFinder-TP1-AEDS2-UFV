When a bee lies sleepin  
In the palm of your hand  
Youre bewitched and deep in loves  
Long looked after land  
  
Where youll see a sun up in sky  
With the mornin dew  
And where the days go laughin by  
As love comes callin on you  
  
Sleep on bee dont waken  
Cant believe what just passed  
Hes mine for the taken  
I am happy at last  
  
Maybe I dreams but he seems  
Sweet golden as a crown  
A sleepin bee done told me  
I will walk with my feet off the ground  
  
When my one true love  
I has found  
  
Sleep on bee dont waken  
Can not believe what just passed  
Hes mine for the taken  
I am happy at last  
  
Maybe I dreams but he seems  
Golden as a crown  
A sleepin bee told me  
I will walk with my feet off the ground  
  
When my one true love  
I has found
