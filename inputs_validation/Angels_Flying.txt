I Cant Hold My Tears Now  
I Cant Hold Them Back  
Maybe Shell Come Back  
Come Back To Me  
  
Those Beautiful Eyes  
Those Beautiful Smiles  
Theyre Like Sugar And Honey  
I Was Wrong She Was Right  
You Are An Angel  
You Are An Angel  
  
Chorus  
If You See Angels Flying  
Wave Goodbye  
If You See Angels Flying  
Wave Goodbye  
  
Cant Hold My Tears Back  
Were Too Far Apart  
Maybe Shell Come Back  
Come Back To Me  
  
Those Beautiful Eyes  
Those Beautiful Smiles  
Theyre Like Sugar And Honey  
I Was Lost Now Im Found  
Please Forgive Me  
You Are An Angel  
  
Chorus 5x  
  
Those Beautiful Eyes  
Those Beautiful Smiles  
Theyre Like Sugar And Honey  
I Was Wrong She Was Right  
You Are An Angel
