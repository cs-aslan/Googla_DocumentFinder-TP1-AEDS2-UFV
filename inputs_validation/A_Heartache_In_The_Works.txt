This ole heart of mine  
Is now showing signs  
From the wear and tear of times  
You have taken it and crushed it  
Then came close to throwing it away  
Holding on to someone who dont love the same way that you do  
Always hits right where it hurts  
Its a heartache in the works  
  
Looking through my tears  
Its hard to see you care  
When I know that you dont hear  
When I lie away beside you  
And cry til I see the light of day  
  
Holding on to someone who dont love the same way that you do  
Always hits right where it hurts  
Its a heartache in the works  
  
Its hard to keep surviving  
When love is slowly dying  
And all the pain without keeps building up  
  
Holding on to someone who dont love the same way that you do  
Always hits right where it hurts  
Its a heartache in the works  
  
Holding on to someone who dont love the same way that you do  
Always hits right where it hurts  
Its a heartache in the works  
Its a heartache in the works
