And if the bottles no solution  
Why does it feel so warm  
And if that girl is no solution  
Why did she feel so warm  
And if to feel is no solution  
Why do I feel  
Why do I feel so tired  
Why do I feel so broken  
Why do I feel so outside  
Why do I seem so blind  
Im so sick of feeling  
Its ruined my life  
  
If living rough is no solution  
Why does it ease my mind  
If looking back is no solution  
Why are we all  
Nothing but children  
Children inside  
  
Why do the Gods  
Sit back and watch  
So many lost  
What kind of mother  
Leaves a child in the traffic  
Turning tricks in the dark  
What kind of God  
  
I crawled around inside myself  
It was a long way down  
It was a mine and it was mine  
And in the darkness  
I saw a perfect mirror  
Floating in space  
  
When I meet God  
Im going to ask her  
What makes her cry  
What makes her laugh  
Is she just stars and indigo gas  
Does she know why  
Love has no end  
But its darkangel friend  
Tearing women and men  
Slowly apart  
  
Stain  
Dont do that  
Scream  
Dont do that  
Fail  
Never do that  
Never do that  
I want to go out  
Dont do that  
I want an adventure  
Just stay  
I want  
Just stay in  
I want to make love  
  
And if the bottles no solution  
Why does it feel so warm  
And if looking back is no solution  
Why are we all just children inside  
And if to feel is no solution  
Why does the whole damn world feel so broken  
So outside and outofsorts  
  
A perfect mirror  
Floating in space  
Waves and numbers  
But oh such beautiful numbers  
And oh such waves
