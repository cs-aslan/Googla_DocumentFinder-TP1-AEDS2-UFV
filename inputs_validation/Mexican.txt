Chico Fernandez sleepin on his gun  
Dreams of Santa Anna  
Fighting in the sun  
Drums so loud from both sides  
Makes it hard to dream  
A bluish fall on an orange fast  
Makes that hard to seems reason  
  
Mornin calm mornin  
Ah Chicos gonna have his share  
Mornin sad mornin  
Sad it must be Aahahahahahahahahahaha  
Mornin sad mornin  
Mexicaan  
  
Seniorita panned in  
Chico comeonhome  
Santa Annas losing  
Youll be the first to go  
Sam Whosmans laughin  
Davy Crocket too  
Whenn Anna takes the Alamo  
The first to go is you  
  
Mornin calm mornin  
Ah Chicos gonna have his share  
Mornin sad mornin  
Heaven will be there  
Aahahahahahahahahahaha  
Mornin sad mornin  
Mexicaan
