Never thought too much about her leavin  
Id find someone there was no doubt  
But this time the feelin is strange and different  
Since shes been gone theres one thing I found out  
  
Chorus  
It takes a mighty man to live with lonesome  
Some big men might live with misery  
But theres one thing I know for sure its certain  
Its for sure its gonna take a lot bigger man than me  
  
Ive never suffered much in the hurtin line  
Ive always been as good as any man  
But show me who can lose in love and like it  
And Ill be the first to proudly shake his hand
