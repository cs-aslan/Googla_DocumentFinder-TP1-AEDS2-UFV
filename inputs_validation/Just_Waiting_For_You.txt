I am pleading tonight in this letter I write  
Cause it seems as tho Im talking to you  
All the tearstains you see take as kisses from me  
Cause Im lonesome here waiting for you  
  
Does your heart still feel light do you still think your right  
That you left me for one you thought true  
After years we have known leaving me here alone  
So lonesome just waiting for you  
  
I treasure each thought every memory old pal  
That we spent in the days we once knew  
And it hurt so inside many times I have cried  
So heartbroken just waiting waiting for you  
  
But perhaps dear someday when the clouds drift away  
And the sunshine again fills the blue  
Youll mend the break in my heart once again we will start  
From where Ive waited so worried and blue
