Worked the bars and sideshows along the twilight zone  
Only a crowd can make you feel so alone  
And it really hit home  
Booze and pills and powders you can choose your medicine  
Well heres another goodbye to another good friend  
  
After all is said and done  
Gotta move while its still fun  
Let me walk before they make me run  
After all is said and done  
I gotta move its still fun  
Im gonna walk before they make me run  
  
Watched the taillights fading there aint a dry eye in the house  
Theyre laughing and singing  
Started dancing and drinking as I left town  
Gonna find my way to heaven cause I did my time in hell  
I wasnt looking too good but I was feeling real well  
  
After all is said and done  
I gotta move I had my fun  
Let us walk before they make me run  
  
After all is said and done  
I did alright I had my fun  
I will walk before they make me run
