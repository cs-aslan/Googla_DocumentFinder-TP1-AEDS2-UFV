Discontent you must leave  
Leaving love leaving me  
So go away for your dreams to come true  
But should young dreams grow old  
And warm friendships grow cold  
Therell be someone waiting for you  
  
And if you ever find  
That fate is unkind  
An the devil starts taking his dues  
When your fair weather friends  
Leave when fair weather ends  
Therell be someone waiting for you  
  
Youll always have someone who loves you  
Youre never alone dont you see  
And when your worlds slowing down  
Youll need someone around  
Let that someone always be me  
  
Youll always have someone who loves you  
Youre never alone dont you see  
And when your worlds slowing down  
Youll need someone around  
An let that someone always be me
