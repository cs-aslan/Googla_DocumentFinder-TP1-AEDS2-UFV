Everybody know I dont fuck with you  
And I aint finna to go in no club nigga  
Unless you let me in with this lil nigga  
  
Pistol in the party pistol in the party

Pistol in the party pistol in the party  
They let me in the club I brought my pistol to the party

But all I do is just point fingers  
Had the niggas fightin like Jerry Springer  
Finger fuck a ho with my trigger finger  
I know pimp niggas I know gang bangers  
Same plan different angle  
Want to tangle with Gucci  
So your life you want to gamble  
Got her waitin for you at the funeral  
And you Auntie numbers like candles  
Big Guwap I keep a banger  
Tell the truth I dont like strangers  
Trap game is a deadly game but I told the pussy jet like Jesse James  
  
Aint no 1 on 1 nigga  
He swing I hit you  
I aint no front for fun nigga  
He ridin with you he die with you  
I aint think of bitin my tongue nigga  
Everybody know I dont fuck with you  
And I aint finna to go in no club nigga  
Unless you let me in with this lil nigga  
  
Pistol in the party pistol in the party  
They let me in the club I brought my pistol to the party  
Pistol in the party pistol in the party  
They let me in the club I brought my pistol to the party
