Bass note treble stereo control how low you go  
Just enough to make your juices flow  
Press play dont stop rotate too hot  
You feel Im real  
Im everything you need so tell me whats the deal  
  
Chorus  
Two thousand watts eight ohms two hundred volts real strong  
Too much of that fuse blown  
Be careful what you say dont overload  
Two thousand watts eight ohms two hundred volts real strong  
Too much of that fuse blown  
Be careful what you say dont overload  
  
3D high speed feedback Dolby  
Release two or three when I reach I can go til I hit my peak  
Compact steelo chico DLo highpost lady  
Shorty really want to be there for me  
  
Chorus
