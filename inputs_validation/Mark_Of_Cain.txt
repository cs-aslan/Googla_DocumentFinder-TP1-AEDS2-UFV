I am a young woman  
With callused hands and feet  
With an ever growing problem  
Buried in me deep  
It has stripped me of my beauty  
With an overwhelming pain  
And on yesterdays proud forehead  
It has burned the mark of Cain  
It happened long ago  
Though it seems like only yesterday  
I had come back home  
After years of wandering astray  
Walked familiar streets  
Never knowing fate would find me there  
And ever since Ive been crippled  
Neath this burden I must bear  
The Mark of Cain the child of pain  
Of trouble and of war  
Mother nature cannot comfort  
Nor the coolness of the sea  
Lord above how can I love  
This thing that I abhor  
Child of pain is growing in me  
Within me he is waging war  
Battling for breath battling for blood  
And a body of His own  
Ive considered the solution  
But that would be my death  
For while Ive waited and debated  
He has grown  
Deep in my heart I wish I could love him  
Erase our past with a mothers embrace  
I want to start fresh but within me Im fearful  
Will I find my oppressor in his tiny face  
The Mark of Cain the child of pain  
Of trouble and of war  
Mother Nature cannot comfort  
Nor the coolness of the sea  
Lord above how can I love  
This thing that I abhor  
Child of pain is growing in me  
Deep in my heart I wish I could love him  
Erase our past with a mothers embrace  
I want to start fresh but within me Im fearful  
Will I find my oppressor in his tiny face  
The Mark of Cain the child of pain  
Of trouble and of war  
Mother Nature cannot comfort  
Nor the coolness of the sea  
Lord above how can I love  
This thing that I abhor  
Child of rape is growing in me  
Child of rape is growing in me  
Child of rape is growing in me  
Growing in me growing in me
