I was friendly with this girl who insisted on touching my face  
She told outrageous stories I believed them  
Til the endings were changing from endings before  
Shes not touching me anymore  
Untogether I couldnt help him I got hard  
You can try your whole life but you cant save the unsaveably  
Untogether  
I was shipwrecked with this frog who was constantly testing my faith  
He made outrageous demands I ignored him  
Til I strapped on my bird feet and surfed into shore  
Hes not touching me anymore  
Untogether I couldnt help him I got hard  
You can try your whole life  
But you cant change the unchangeably  
Untogether  
Now this bird nests on my back keeps me turning and straining to see  
We threw outrageous parties we were golden  
Now the bird keeps her distance and I keep my spleen  
Sometimes theres no poison like a dream  
Untogether I couldnt help it it got hard  
You can dry your eyes  
But you cant hold the impossibly  
Untogether
