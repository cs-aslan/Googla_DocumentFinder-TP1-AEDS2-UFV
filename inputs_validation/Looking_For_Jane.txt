Where did she go  
Where did she go from here  
The last time I saw her  
she made all the clouds disappear  
She said with a smile  
yea the weathers alright  
She left her coat at home that night  
  
Where do I begin today  
Where do colours never fade  
In the sunshine in the rain  
its quite the same  
Its never gonna change  
Ill be looking for Jane  
  
Why did she come  
Why did she come to me  
There must have been millions  
in the world shed rather see  
At least in my mind  
as time has gone by  
its always harder to laugh then to cry  
  
Where do I begin today bababa  
Where the colours never fade bababa  
In the sun and in the rain  
its quite the same  
Its never gonna change  
Ill be looking for Jane  
  
Where do I begin today bababa  
Where the sunshine never fades bababa  
In the sun and in the rain  
its quite the same  
Its never gonna change  
Ill be looking for Jane  
  
Where do I begin today  
Where the colours never fade  
In the sun and in the rain  
its quite the same  
Its never gonna change  
Ill be looking for Jane  
  
Where do I begin today  
Where the sun will never fade  
In the sun and in the rain  
its quite the same  
Its never gonna change  
Ill be looking for Jane  
  
In the sunshine in the rain  
its quite the same  
Its never gonna change  
Ill be looking for Jane
