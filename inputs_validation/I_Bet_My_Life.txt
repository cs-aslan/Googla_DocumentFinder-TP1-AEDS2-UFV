Verse  
I knew I took the path  
That you would never want for me  
I know I let you down  
Didnt I  
  
So many sleepless nights  
Where you were waiting up on me  
Well Im just a slave  
Unto the night  
  
PreChorus  
Now remember when I told you  
Thats the last youll see of me  
Remember when I broke you  
Down to tears  
  
I knew I took the path  
That you would never want for me  
I gave you hell through  
All the years  
  
Chorus  
So I I bet my life  
I bet my life I bet my life for you  
I I bet my life  
I bet my life I bet my life for you  
  
Verse 2  
Ive been around the world  
And never in my wildest dreams  
Would I come  
Running home to you  
  
Ive told a million lies  
but now I tell a single truth  
Theres you in  
Everything I do  
  
PreChorus  
Now remember when I told you  
Thats the last youll see of me  
Remember when I broke you  
Down to tears  
  
I knew I took the path  
That you would never want for me  
I gave you hell through  
All the years  
  
Chorus  
So I I bet my life  
I bet my life I bet my life for you  
I I bet my life  
I bet my life I bet my life for you  
  
Bridge  
Dont tell me that Im wrong  
Ive walked that road before  
And left you on your own  
And please believe them  
When they say  
  
That its left for yesterday  
And the records that I play  
Please forgive me for  
All Ive done  
  
Chorus  
So I I bet my life  
I bet my life I bet my life for you  
I I bet my life  
I bet my life I bet my life for you
