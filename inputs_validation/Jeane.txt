Jeane  
The low life has lost its appeal  
And Im tired of walking these streets  
To a room with its cupboards bare  
Jeane  
Im not sure what happiness means  
But I look in your eyes and I know  
That it isnt there  
  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried  
Oh Jeane  
  
Theres ice on the sink where we bathe  
So how can you call this a home  
When you know its a grave  
Yet you still have that greedy grace  
As you tidy the place  
But it will never be clean  
Jeane  
  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried  
  
Gash on the nail  
Its just a fairytale  
And I dont believe in magic anymore Jeane  
  
But I think you know  
I really think you know  
Oh yes I think you know the truth Jeane  
  
No heavenly choirs not for me  
And no not for you  
Because I think you know  
I really think you know  
I think you know the truth  
Oh Jeane  
  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried
