I say a prayer every night  
Whatever I do Ill get it right  
With no regret no guilt or shame this time no not this time  
Once I surrender I wont dare look back  
Cause if I do Ill get off track  
Move ahead in faith  
And patiently await your answer  
What will it be  
  
Sight beyond what I see  
You know whats best for me  
Prepare my mind prepare my heart  
For whatever comes Im gone be ready  
Strength to pass any test  
I feel like Im so blessed  
With you in control I cant go wrong  
Cause I always know  
Im gonna be ready  
  
I was free to do what I wanted to  
Lost everything but I still had you  
You showed me your grace  
Now my lifes renewed and I thank you yes I thank you  
So Ill tell anyone wholl listen Ill testify  
About how good you were to me when so call friends passed me by  
The fact that you would show somebody so broke down  
So much mercy  
  
Sight beyond what I see  
You know whats best for me  
Prepare my mind prepare my heart  
For whatever comes Im gonna be ready  
Strength to pass any test  
I feel like Im so blessed  
With you in control I cant go wrong  
Cause I always know  
Im gonna be ready  
  
So use me as you will  
Ill pay the price  
Cause made the ultimate sacrifice  
Its all because of you that I even have life  
And Ill give my love as a tribute to how great you are  
  
Sight beyond what I see  
You know whats best for me  
Prepare my mind prepare my heart  
For whatever comes Im gonna be ready  
Strength to pass any test  
I feel like Im so blessed  
With you in control I cant go wrong  
Cause I always know  
Im gonna be ready  
  
Im gonna be ready
