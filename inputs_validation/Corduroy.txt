The waiting drove me mad youre finally here and Im a mess  
I take your interest back cant let you roam inside my head  
I dont want to take what you can give  
I would rather starve than eat your bread  
I would rather run but I cant walk  
Guess Ill lie alone just like before  
Ill take the vermins path oh and I must refuse your test  
A push me and I will resist this behaviors not unique  
I dont want to hear from those who know  
They can buy but cant put on my clothes  
I dont want to limp for them to walk  
Never would have known of me before  
I dont want to be held in your debt  
And Ill pay it off in blood let I be wed  
And Im already cut up and half dead  
Ill end up alone like I began  
Everything has chains absolutely nothings changed  
Take my hand not my picture spilled my tincture  
I dont want to take what you can give  
I would rather starve than eat your bread  
All the things that others want for me  
Cant buy what I want because its free 2x  
Cant be what you want because Im  
I aint sposed to be just fun  
Oh to live and die let it be done  
I figure Ill be damned all alone like I began  
Its your move now  
I thought you were a friend but I guess I I guess I hate you
