I hear a car I hope its yours  
I hear the phone I hope its you  
It seems I spend most half my life waiting  
For the things Ill never do  
When you were here in love with me  
There was so much so much so much I couldnt see  
And I watched you home believing  
That you would never leave  
Now I cant stand to be without you  
Im burning for one more kiss  
I dream every night about you  
Sometimes Im on target sometimes I seem to miss you  
Night after night I lie awake  
Wondring how long its gonna take  
Till I hold you close beside me  
And share the love we make  
Cause I cant stand to be without you  
I cant take much more of this  
I dream every night about you  
Sometimes Im on target sometimes I seem to miss you  
Ah oh baby turn your heart around  
Ah oo baby turn your heart around  
Di di di di di di  
Ah come back da da da baby turn your heart around oh  
Whom I gonna run to Di di di di di di  
Ah come back da da da let me turn your heart around oh  
Whom I gonna run to Di di di di di di  
Ah come back da da da baby turn your heart around oh  
Whom I gonna run to Di di di di di di
