All set ready to go but little does he know  
He aint comin back no more  
All set ready to fly into that deep blue sky  
Like so many times before  
  
Now the towers callin theres no reply  
And theres nothin they can do  
Now the night is fallin before they eyes  
Still no ones comin through callin  
  
Somewhere out in time God knows whats on his mind  
Is there a reason for his doubt  
Somehow unaware just like he didnt care  
There must be ways of gettin out  
  
Not the towers callin theres no reply
