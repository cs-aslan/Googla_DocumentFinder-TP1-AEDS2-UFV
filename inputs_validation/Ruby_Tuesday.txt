She would never say where she came from  
And yesterday dont matter if its gone  
When the sun is bright  
Or on the darkest night  
No one knows she comes and goes  
  
Chorus  
Goodbye ruby Tuesday  
Who could hang a name on you  
When you change with every new day  
Still Im gonna miss you  
  
No question why she needs to be so free  
Shell tell you its the only way to be  
She just cant be chained  
To a life where nothings gained  
And nothings lost at such a cost  
  
Chorus  
Goodbye ruby Tuesday  
Who could hang a name on you  
When you change with every new day  
Still Im gonna miss you  
  
Theres no time to lose I heard her say  
Cast your dreams before they slip away  
Tired all the time  
Lose your dreams and you will lose your mind  
Aint life unkind  
  
Chorus x4  
Goodbye ruby Tuesday  
Who could hang a name on you  
When you change with every new day  
Still Im gonna miss you
