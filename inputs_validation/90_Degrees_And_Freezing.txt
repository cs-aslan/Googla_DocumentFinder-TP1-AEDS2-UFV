Here I am  
In this broken town  
Missing you  
Wishing you were still around  
  
Streets are full of people happy  
Heading on their way  
Why am I the only one  
Whos COLD on such a pretty day  
  
Chorus  
90 degrees and freezing  
Im out here on my own  
I cant shake this feeling  
That Im really all alone  
The Sun way up there shining  
But down here on the ground  
Its 90 degrees and freezing  
  
Right or wrong  
This is how it is  
The love that kept me warm  
Well now its his  
  
I remember how the heat in your eyes  
Helped me find my way  
How can I be left so cold inside  
On such a pretty day  
  
Chorus x2
