I can kill standing still  
Its easy  
I can scare with a stare  
Its easy  
  
Hey Ringo  
Its sad though  
Because its hard to walk tall  
When youre small  
Whether dressed in  
Disciplined style  
Never mind  
When youre small  
You walk as if youre falling  
  
I attack from the back  
Because its easy  
And I can assail  
While wearing very nice jewelry  
  
Oh hey Ringo  
Its sad though  
Because its hard to walk tall  
When youre small  
Whether dressed in  
Disciplined style  
Never mind  
When youre small  
You spend your life crawling  
  
I burst into  
Public baths  
And I throw my weight around  
And no one can even see me  
No one can even see me  
Nobody can see me  
No one can see me  
  
Success is just a mess  
Hey Ringo  
Its sad though  
Because its hard to walk tall  
When youre small  
Whether dressed in  
Disciplined style  
Never mind  
When youre small  
Youre bound to look
