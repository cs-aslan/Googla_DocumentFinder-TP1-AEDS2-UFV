Six oclock on a Christmas morning  
And for what  
Well isnt it for the honor of god  
Aunt Kate  
I know all about the honor of god  
Mary Jane  
  
Six oclock the siren kicks him from a dream  
Tries to shake it off but it just wont stop  
Cant find the strength but hes got promises to keep  
And wood to chop before he sleeps  
  
I may never get over  
But nevers better than now  
Ive got bases to cover  
  
Hes in the parking lot and hes just sitting in his car  
Its nine oclock but he cant get out  
He lights a cigarette  
And turns the music down  
But just cant seem to shake that sound  
  
Once I thought Id get over  
But its too late for me now  
Ive got bases to cover  
  
Melody walks through the door  
And memory flies out the window  
And nobody knows what they want  
til they finally let it all go  
  
The pain inside  
Coming outside  
  
So many ways to drown a man  
So many ways to drag him down  
Some are fast and some take years and years  
Cant hear what hes saying when hes talking in his sleep  
He finally found the sound but hes in too deep  
  
I could never get over  
Is it too late for me now  
Feel like blowing my cover  
  
Melody walks through the door  
And memory flies out the window  
And nobody knows what they want  
til they finally let it all go  
  
But dont cut your losses too soon  
cause youll only be cutting your throat  
And answer a call while you still hear at all  
cause nobody will if you wont  
  
Six oclock on a christmas morning  
I know all about the honor of god  
Mary  
I know all about the honor of god  
Mary Jane
