Well there must have been a reason  
for the smile that you had upon your face last night  
Are you the cat that got the cream  
Did you lick your lips did you close your eyes  
Can you imagine how it feels  
Its so hard to reveal  
Oh I cant get through and Im falling  
Im getting out Im losing ground  
The Spanish archers gonna bring you down  
  
is there someone somewhere waiting in the wings  
to take my place  
Lets not drag it out like a Cagney death scene  
In this season of change its not hard to explain  
Like the leaves on the trees Im falling  
And as you turn dont look away  
The Spanish archers gonna make you pay  
  
Do you remember when the sky was blue  
we used to talk for miles  
And now we drive along in this thundering silence  
Its such an obvious lie with that easy smile of yours  
Im letting go and Im falling  
Im getting out losing ground  
The Spanish archers gonna bring you down  
  
Well is there something I can say as we stumble to the edge have we gone too
far  
Why dont we call it a day before we call it a nightmare darlin  
If we made a mistake then all that it takes to be free  
Is the wave of a hand and youre falling  
And as you turn dont look away  
The Spanish archers gonna make you pay
