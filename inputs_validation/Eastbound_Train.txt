It was New Cross Station I was going on home  
Saw you get your ticket standing on your own  
Here come the train about 0244  
I couldnt get a smoker you took another car  
  
Yeah the end of the line we both had to change  
And youre standing right behind me  
Im a feeling kinda strange  
We got to Mile End Road my heart skipped a beat  
Standing right behind me Im a shakin in my seat  
34 minutes and the train comes through  
Im ridin on the Central Im alookin at you  
  
Woman on the eastbound train  
Sometimes I wanna see you again  
  
Now I couldnt read a paper you couldnt read a book  
Kept on taking me another look  
You got off the train you never looked behind  
I tried but I cant get you out of my mind  
  
Woman on the eastbound train  
Sometimes I wanna see you again  
  
Well I got one more thing I wanna say before I go  
If you get the message on the radio  
You can write a letter get in touch with me  
Leave your number with the company yeah  
  
Woman on the eastbound train  
Sometimes I wanna see you again
