See all the people  
With hatred in their eyes  
I cant help thinking that  
Its only a disguise  
Cause underneath that core  
Theres got to be more  
That what we realize  
  
Maybe theyre scared  
To let the inside out  
Maybe theyre afraid to  
Show what theyre all about  
So they put on a heavy front and hope that no one else  
Can work them out  
So they pull on all the heaviness  
But its only an illusion heaviness  
Cant you see  
Theyre scared to  
Show a little bit of emotion  
In case a little bit of emotion  
Gives them away  
  
Look at that lady dancing around with no clothes  
Shell give you all her body  
Thats if youve got the dough  
Shell let you see most  
Anything but theres one thing  
That shell never show  
And thats a little bit of emotion  
A little bit of emotion  
In case a little bit of emotion  
Gives her away  
But its a shame shes acting that way  
Somehow shes gotta get through every day  
And the only way  
Is not to show one little bit of emotion  
A little bit of true emotion  
In case of a little bit of emotion  
Gives her away  
  
People learn their lines  
And they act out their part  
Then they talk on cue  
But its got no heart  
Its all on the surface  
And its all contrived  
Theyre scared to come out  
Somehow theyve got to survive  
  
Look at that looney  
With a smile on his face  
He knows no shame  
And feels no disgrace  
Hes got a look in her eyes  
That makes it seem that hes from outer space  
Maybe that looney knows whats its all about  
Hes got something to say  
But he cant spit it out  
Hes uncoordinated so we shut him out  
In case he shows a little bit of emotion  
A little bit of real emotion  
Were afraid to see a bit of emotion  
So we walk away  
Show a little bit of real emotion  
Show a little bit of emotion  
Were afraid to see a bit of emotion  
So we walk away
