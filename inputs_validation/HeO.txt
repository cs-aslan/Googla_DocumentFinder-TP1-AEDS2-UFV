Heo he came walking down my street  
Heo and he stopped in front of my door  
Heo and he knocked on the door a long while  
Heo then he turned and he walked away  
Heo then he turned and he walked away  
Heo and he never came back again  
Heo I wasnt at home that day  
Heo and I never found out that he came
