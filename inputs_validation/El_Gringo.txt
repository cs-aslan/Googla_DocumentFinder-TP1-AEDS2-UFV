Dont look for me in Heaven  
Dont look for me in Hell  
Heaven taken me alive  
Ive got no soul to sell  
  
Dont look for me in prison  
Dont try to save my soul  
Im a man without a country  
And Ive got no place to go  
  
You can say Im just a gringo  
You can say Im just a man  
I live outside the law  
Doing anything I can  
  
I keep the laws I make  
And I break the laws you keep  
Im living on the edge  
Living on the street  
  
Dont look for me in Heaven  
Dont look for me in Hell  
Heaven taken me alive  
Ive got no soul to sell  
  
Dont look for me in prison  
Dont try to save my soul  
Im a man without a country  
And Ive got no place to go  
  
Each day I fight to live  
I fight to stay alive  
Dont get in my way  
Unless you want to die  
  
One who stands tall  
Never stands alone  
  
Solo  
  
Dont look for me in Heaven  
Dont look for me in Hell  
Never taking me alive  
Ive got no soul to sell  
  
Dont look for me in prison  
Dont try to save my soul  
Im a man without a country  
And Ive got no place to go  
  
You can say Im just a gringo  
You can say Im just a man  
I live outside the law  
Doing anything I can  
  
I keep the laws I make  
And I break the laws you keep  
Im living on the edge  
Living on the street  
  
Dont look for me in Heaven  
Dont look for me in Hell  
Heaven taken me alive  
Ive got no soul to sell  
  
Dont look for me in prison  
Dont try to save my soul  
Im a man without a country  
And Ive got no place to go
