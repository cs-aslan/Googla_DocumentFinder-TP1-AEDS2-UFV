Well I gotta funny feeling  
But Im gonna stay cool  
Somethings telling me Im  
Gonna break all the rules  
Let me tell ya Im not insecure  
But I gotta empty feeling  
Think that you got the cure  
You said it all youve got to stay  
To proud to fall no more to say  
  
Well Im feeling sober but Im high on the throne  
Like a demon sick of sin and tired of being alone  
Ive made a bed thats hard to lie in  
But if loving you is wrong cant do nothing but sin  
  
You said it all youve got to stay  
To proud to fall no more to say  
  
You said it all youve got to stay  
To proud to fall no more to say  
  
Let them hang me they would if they knew  
Even half the things Ive been doing with you  
Walk me to the gallow and drop me to the floor  
And watch me swinging and I still want more  
  
You said it all youve got to stay  
To proud to fall no more to say
