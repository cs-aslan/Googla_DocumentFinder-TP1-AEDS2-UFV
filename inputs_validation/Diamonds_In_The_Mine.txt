The woman in blue shes asking for revenge  
The man in white  thats you  says he has no friends  
The river is swollen up with rusty cans  
  
And the trees are burning in your promised land  
And there are no letters in the mailbox  
And there are no grapes upon the vine  
And there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore  
And there are no diamonds in the mine  
  
Well you tell me that your lover has a broken limb  
You say youre kind of restless now and its on account of him  
Well I saw the man in question it was just the other night  
He was eating up a lady where the lions and Christians fight  
  
And there are no letters in the mailbox  
And there are no grapes upon the vine  
And there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore  
And there are no diamonds in the mine  
  
You tell them now  
  
Ah there is no comfort in the covens of the witch  
Some very clever doctor went and sterilized the bitch  
And the only man of energy yes the revolutions pride  
He trained a hundred women just to kill an unborn child  
  
And there are no letters in the mailbox  
Oh no there are no no grapes upon your vine  
  
And there are there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore  
And there are no diamonds in your mine  
And there are no letters in the mailbox  
And there are no grapes upon the vine  
And there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore  
And there are no diamonds in your mine
