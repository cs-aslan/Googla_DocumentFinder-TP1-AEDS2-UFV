Tried to sneak out without saying  
With my loudest record playing  
Ooh my mama said Look at this you havent done your bed  
My mama said Thats a thing that you should do instead  
  
Then I did what she had told me  
Dying for my friend to hold me  
Ooh my mama said Try and get one thing into your head  
My mama said Pa and me we give you room and bed  
How I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
Lalala lalala life  
  
In the morning she said Listen  
Ooh I felt like in a prison  
Yeah my mama said I know youve been out again with Fred  
My mama said  
My mama said Dont you lie your cheeks are blushing red  
My mama said  
Oh I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
Lalala lalala life  
  
I said I can live without it  
How I wish you wouldnt doubt it  
Ooh my mama said If you want to hurt me go ahead  
My mama said  
My mama said I suppose youd rather see me dead  
My mama said  
Oh I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
Lalala lalala life Repeat x4
