I know you dont believe it  
Like I believe it  
Oh no its not your fault  
You sit alone inside a room  
Wait for the world to come to you  
They never do  
  
It must be something that you cant let go  
It hurts that you wont let me know  
Every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I cant help to be myself  
I hold on to this moment  
Any time is right to be alive  
  
And then in conversation  
I love the way you mention  
Nothings ever gone your way  
With a hammer in your hand  
You spell out a master plan  
We never learn  
  
It must be somebody holding your heart  
Something that tears us apart  
Every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I cant help to be myself  
I hold on to this moment  
Any time is right to be alive  
  
And I dont think that its right  
To let love pass by  
Any time of life  
Its good to be alive  
  
Every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I cant help to be myself  
Yes every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I cant help what I feel  
But it sure feels real  
I wanna hold on to this moment  
Cause babe it sure feels right  
To be alive  
To be alive  
To be alive
