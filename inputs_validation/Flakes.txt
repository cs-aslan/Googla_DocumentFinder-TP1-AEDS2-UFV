Flakes flakes  
Flakes flakes  
They dont do no good  
They never be workin  
When they oughta should  
They waste your time  
Theyre wastin mine  
Californias got the most of them  
Boy they got a host of them  
Swear tgod they got the most  
At every business on the coast  
Swear tgod they got the most  
At every business on the coast  
They got the flakes  
Flakes flakes  
They cant fix yer brakes  
You ask em wheres my motor   
well it was eaten by snakes  
You can stab n shoot n spit  
But they wont be fixin it  
Theyre lyin an lazy  
They can be drivin you crazy  
Swear tgod they got the most  
At every business on the coast  
Swear tgod they got the most  
At every business on the coast  
Take it away bob  
I asked as nice as I could  
If my job would  
Somehow be finished by Friday  
Well them whole damn weekend  
Came n went frankie  
Wanna buy some mandies bob  
n they didnt do nothin  
But they charged me double for Sunday  
You know no matter what you do  
They gonna cheat n rob you  
Then theyll send you a bill  
Thatll get your senses reelin  
And if you do not pay  
They got computer collectors  
Thatll get you so crazy  
til your headll go through th ceilin  
Yes it will  
Im a moron n this is my wife  
Shes frosting a cake  
With a paper knife  
All what we got heres  
American made  
Its a little bit cheesey  
But its nicely displayed  
Well we dont get excited when it  
Crumbles n breaks  
We just get on the phone  
And call up some flakes  
They rush on over  
n wreck it some more  
n we are so dumb  
Theyre linin up at our door  
Well the toilet went crazy  
Yersterday afternoon  
The plumber he says  
Never flush a tampoon  
This great information  
Cost me half a weeks pay  
And the toilet blew up  
Later on the next dayayeeeay  
Blew up the next day  
Wooooo  
We are millions n millions  
Were coming to get you  
Were protected by unions  
So dont let it upset you  
Cant escape the conclusion  
Its probably gods will  
That civilization  
Will grind to a standstill  
And we are the people  
Who will make it all happen  
While yer children is sleepin  
Yer puppy is crappin  
You might call us flakes  
Or something else you might coin us  
But we know youre so greedy  
That youll probably join us  
Were coming to get you were coming to get you  
Were coming to get you were coming to get you  
Were coming to get you were coming to get you  
Were coming to get you were coming to get you
