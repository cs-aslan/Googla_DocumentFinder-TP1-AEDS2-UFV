Dont think sorrys easily said  
Dont try turning tables instead  
Youve taken lots of chances before  
But Im not gonna give anymore  
Dont ask me  
Thats how it goes  
Cause part of me knows what youre thinking  
  
Dont say words youre gonna regret  
Dont let the fire rush to your head  
Ive heard the accusation before  
And I aint gonna take anymore  
Believe me  
The sun in your eyes  
Made some of the lies worth believing  
  
Chorus  
I am the eye in the sky  
Looking at you  
I can read your mind  
I am the maker of rules  
Dealing with fools  
I can cheat you blind  
And I dont need to see anymore  
To know that  
I can read your mind I can read your mind  
  
Dont leave false illusions behind  
Dont cry cause I aint changing my mind  
So find another fool like before  
Cause I aint gonna live anymore believing  
Some of the lies  
While all of the signs are deceiving  
  
Chorus
