Something going on at the corner of the block  
Its the kids down there  
They were starting to rock  
High black fever running everyplace  
When the Greek kid pulled a knife  
And pushed it in his face  
Some girl makes it with a lover in the door  
As the ambulance pulls away  
She cries out more  
  
Chorus  
And its all night long all night long  
On with the action  
You need the fastest legs alive  
On with the action  
If you cant run you aint survive  
On with the action  
Mamas boy and teachers pet  
On with the action  
Its down our street is it in yours yet  
  
All the kids stand laughing  
They never had such fun  
Then someone cuts a blind man who just cant make a run  
And the queen whos been standing behind the toilet door  
His parents dont like boyfriends call him a whore  
But the ministers staring  
With his Bible in his hand  
Was this gods children he didnt understand  
  
Chorus x2
