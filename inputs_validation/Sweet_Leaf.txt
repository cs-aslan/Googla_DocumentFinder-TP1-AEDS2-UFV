Alright now  
Wont you listen  
  
When I first met you didnt realize  
I cant forget you for your surprise  
You introduced me to my mind  
And left me wanting you and your kind  
  
I love you oh you know it  
  
My life was empty forever on a down  
Until you took me showed me around  
My life is free now my life is clear  
I love you sweet leaf though you cant hear  
  
Come on now try it out  
  
Straight people dont know what youre about  
They put you down and shut you out  
You gave to me a new belief  
And soon the world will love you sweet leaf
