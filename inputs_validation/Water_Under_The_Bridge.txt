Verse 1  
If youre not the one for me  
Then how come I can bring you to your knees  
If youre not the one for me  
Why do I hate the idea of being free  
And if Im not the one for you  
Youve gotta stop holding me the way you do  
Oh and if Im not the one for you  
Why have we been through what we have been through  
  
PreChorus  
Its so cold out here in your wilderness  
I want you to be my keeper  
But not if you are so reckless  
  
Chorus  
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently  
Dont pretend that you dont want me  
Our love aint water under the bridge  
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently  
Dont pretend that you dont want me  
Our love aint water under the bridge  
Woaah woaaah  
Say that our love aint water under the bridge  
  
Verse 2  
What are you waiting for  
You never seem to make it through the door  
And who are you hiding from  
It aint no life to live like youre on the run  
Have I ever asked for much  
The only thing that I want is your love  
  
Chorus  
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently  
Dont pretend that you dont want me  
Our love aint water under the bridge  
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently  
Dont pretend that you dont want me  
Our love aint water under the bridge  
Woaah woaaah  
Say that our love aint water under the bridge  
  
PreChorus  
Its so cold in your wilderness  
I want you to be my keeper  
But not if you are so reckless  
  
Chorus  
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently  
Dont pretend that you dont want me  
Our love aint water under the bridge  
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently  
Dont pretend that you dont want me  
Our love aint water under the bridge  
  
Outro  
Say it aint so say it aint so  
Say it aint so say it aint so  
Say it aint so say it aint so  
Say it aint so say it aint so  
Say that our love aint water under the bridge  
Say it aint so say it aint so  
Say it aint so say it aint so  
Say it aint so say it aint so  
Say it aint so say it aint so  
Say that our love aint water under the bridge  
Say that our love aint water under the bridge
