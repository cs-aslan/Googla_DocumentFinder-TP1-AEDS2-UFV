Onetta there in the corner stands  
And she wonders where she is  
And the rain still hurts  
Some people seem to have everything  
Nine am on the hour hand  
And shes waiting for the bell  
And shes looking real pretty  
Shes waiting for her clientele  
  
She works hard for the money  
So hard for it honey  
She works hard for the money  
So you better treat her right

Twentyeight years have come and gone  
And shes seen a lot of tears  
Of the ones who come in  
They really seem to need her there  
Its a sacrifice working day to day  
For little money just tips for pay  
But its worth it all just to hear them say that they care  
  
She works hard for the money  
So hard for it honey  
She works hard for the money  
So you better treat her right  
  
Already knows shes seen her bad times  
Already knows these are the good times  
Shell never sell out she never will not for a dollar bill  
She works hard  
  
She works hard for the money  
So hard for it honey  
She works hard for the money  
So you better treat her right
