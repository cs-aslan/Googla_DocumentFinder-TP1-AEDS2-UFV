I could hardly believe it  
When I heard the news today  
I had to come and get it straight from you  
They said you were leavin  
Someones swept your heart away  
From the look upon your face I see its true  
So tell me all about it tell me bout the  
Plans youre makin  
Then tell me one thing more before I go  
  
Chorus  
Tell me how am I suppose to live without you  
Now that Ive been lovin you so long  
How am I supposed to live without you  
How am I supposed to carry on  
When all that Ive been livin for is gone  
  
I didnt come here for cryin  
Didnt come here to break down  
Its just a dream of mine is coming to an end  
And how can I blame you  
When I build my world around  
The hope that one day wed be so much  
More than friends  
And I dont wanna know the price Im  
Gonna pay for dreaming  
When even now its more than I can take  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
And I dont wanna face the price Im  
Gonna pay for dreaming  
Now that your dream has come true  
  
Chorus
