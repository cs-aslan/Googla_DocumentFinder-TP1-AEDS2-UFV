If its getting harder to face everyday  
Dont let it show dont let it show  
Though its getting harder to take what they say  
Just let it go  
And if it hurts when they mention my name  
Say you dont know me  
And if it helps when they say Im to blame  
Say you dont own me  
  
Even if its taking the easy way out  
Keep it inside of you  
Dont give in  
Dont tell them anything  
  
Dont let it  
Dont let it show  
  
Even though you know its the wrong thing to say  
Say you dont care say you dont care  
Even if you want to believe theres a way  
I wont be there I wont be there  
  
But if you smile when they mention my name  
Theyll never know you  
And if you laugh when they say Im to blame  
Theyll never own you  
  
Even if you feel youve got nothing to hide  
Keep it inside of you  
Dont give in  
Dont tell them anything  
  
Dont let it  
Dont let it show
