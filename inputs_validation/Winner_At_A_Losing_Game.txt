Baby look here at me  
Have you ever seen me this way  
Ive been fumblin for words  
Through the tears and the hurt and the pain  
Im gonna lay it all out  
On the line tonight  
And I think that its time  
To tell this uphill fight goodbye  
  
Chorus  
Have ever had to love someone  
That just dont feel the same  
Tryin to make somebody care for you  
The way I do  
Is like tryin to catch the rain  
And if love is really forever  
Im a winner at a losin game  
  
I know that baby you tried  
To find me somewhere inside of you  
But you know you cant lie  
Girl you cant hide the truth  
Sometimes two hearts  
Just cant dance to the same beat  
So Ill pack up my things  
And Ill take what remains of me  
  
Chorus  
  
I know that Ill never be the man that you need or love  
Yeah baby its killin me to stand here and see  
Im not what youve been dreamin of  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh oh if love is really forever  
Im a winner at a losin game  
Ooo Im tired of losing  
Oh oh oh
