I like him I like him  
How strange the feeling I like him  
I never dreamed it could be  
Hes foolish unworldly and yet appealing I like him  
I feel alive and free  
How did the birds and the bees outsmart me  
Whos little arrows are these that dart dart dart me  
I like him I like him  
Up to the ceiling I like him  
Hes for me A to Zee  
I like him I like him and he likes me  
  
Instrumental  
  
I never dreamed it could be  
Hes foolish unworldly and yet appealing I like him  
Hes for me A to Zee  
I like him I like him and he likes me
