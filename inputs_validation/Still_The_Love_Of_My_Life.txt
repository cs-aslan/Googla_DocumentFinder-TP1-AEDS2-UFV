Ive been thinkin bout the first time I looked at you  
I got the feelin that I found someone Ive always known  
And ever since that day we laughed and we cried  
We learned along the way that love takes a lifetime  
Cant believe Ive found somebody like you  
  
Youre still the reason why the sky will never fall  
This love will never die forever we can have it all  
And when I need to believe I just look in your eyes  
Youre still the one youre still the love of my life  
Of my life my life  
  
Weve had our ups and downs we run against the wind  
I built some mighty walls and watched your heart just climb right in  
Some people thought wed crumble but they were wrong we survived  
And makin love to you still feels like the first time  
Here with me there aint nobody but you  
  
Youre still the reason why the sky will never fall  
This love will never die forever we can have it all  
And when I need to believe I just look in your eyes  
Youre still the one youre still the love of my life  
  
Had a taste of the cold hard rain  
Walk through the winds of change  
But they just made us that much stronger  
Even now when I watch you sleep  
Cant believe youre here with me  
You are the answer the answer to the rest of my life  
Youre still the reason why  
  
Youre still the reason why the sky will never fall  
This love will never die forever we can have it all  
And when I need to believe I just look in your eyes  
Youre still the one youre still the love of my life  
  
Youre still the reason why the sky will never fall  
This love will never die forever we can have it all  
And when I need to believe I just look in your eyes  
Youre still the one youre still the love of my life  
  
Youre still the reason why the sky will never fall  
This love will never die forever we can have it all  
And when I need to believe I just look in your eyes  
Youre still the one youre still the love of my life
