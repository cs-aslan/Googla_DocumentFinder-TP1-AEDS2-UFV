Very much about you know whatever I been going trough and what I been  
Learning lot of her wonderful life lessons you know that are easy to
combine  
But youre very blessed after you realize why you had to go trough what you
had  
To go trough is it very important that you really listen to the words you  
Know and if you have a hard time to hear what Im saying please raise your
hand  
You know object whatever you guys ready in there All set OK  
  
And I you know Its really interesting because I used to  
I used to be a performer  
And I really dont consider myself a performer so much anymore  
Im really just you know Im sharing you know  
More or less the music that Ive been giving  
But if I stop if I start if I you know  
Feel like saying baby baby baby for  
Eighteen bars whatever you know  
I just I do that
