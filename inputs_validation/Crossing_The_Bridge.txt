Dearest almight creator  
  
Violent J  
Ive lived one hell of a life if your to take it tonite  
Ive lived the life of a king but so much to darken the light  
  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
Lookin 360 degrees 2 hundred thousand disease  
How can I lay back and chill so many down on there knees  
  
Violent J  
But then again who am I Im just some typical guy  
I aint no fuckin hero I just been wonderin why  
  
Chorus  
I seen some children crossing the bridge  
What kind of life did they get to live  
What kind of choice do they get to make  
What if it was a childs mistake  
  
Violent J  
Ill never question the book but lets say I lived by the book  
I never ate meat on Tuesdays how much bigger would my wings look  
  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
I try to pray everyday but sometimes get lost on the way  
I seen the holiest spirit so much to miss lead the way  
  
Violent J  
I gave the visions I got I been told im gonna rot  
Inside the devils intestines Im still here holdin my spot  
  
Chorus  
  
Breakdown  
Come on up and open up your door  
What if its a pergatory door repeat  
fuckin take me instead
