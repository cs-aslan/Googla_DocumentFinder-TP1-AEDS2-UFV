With the sun in place  
Theres a test of faith  
Streams of thought awaken  
  
New realities  
Singularities  
Breaking all illusions  
  
Sudden burst of heat  
Burning source of life  
Masterful destruction  
  
Powers not an act  
Its understanding truth  
Changing my direction  
  
Live in the moment  
Breathe in a new beginning  
Wisdom revealed  
As I unlearn to learn  
  
Lifes biggest battles  
Often are fought alone  
My spirit brings me home  
  
Emerald thoughts flow through my consciousness  
Drawn to curses left behind  
Test of will the threshold to ones faith  
Starts a fire in the mind  
  
Searching out  
Reaching in  
To arrive  
Where I began  
Sights remembered  
In the light  
  
Searching out  
Reaching in  
To arrive  
Where I began  
Sounds remembered  
Come alive  
  
Embrace the days  
Dont turn away  
Lifes true intent needs patience  
Karma starts the signal
