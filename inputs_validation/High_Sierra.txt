Ive been higher than the high sierra  
Lower than Death Valley must be  
Ive been right mostly wrong  
Wrong about you right about me  
  
The way I feel cant explain  
So much passion turned to pain  
The sun still shines most of the time  
Did you know the sun shines when it rains  
  
Ive been higher than the high sierra  
Lower than Death Valley must be  
Ive been right mostly wrong  
Wrong about you right about me  
  
Ive been cussed and Ive been praised  
And Ive been nothing these days  
But Ill come back time will see  
If Im wrong about you right about me  
  
Ive been higher than the high sierra  
Lower than Death Valley must be  
Ive been right mostly wrong  
Wrong about you right about me  
Wrong about you right about me  
Wrong about you right about me
