And you said nothing at all  
Well I couldnt have said it better myself  
Tonight the conversation takes the fall  
Just love me like you love nobody else  
  
Little lady I think theres something on your mind  
Ive known you long enough to know  
The words are not that hard to find  
  
And the harder you try and the longer you go  
Well theres nothing but love in those eyes any more  
You know what to say but you never know how  
You can keep your mouth shut because it doesnt really matter right now  
  
I will guide you all the way  
Because I know exactly what youre trying to say  
  
You have the right to remain silent  
Ill get the lights you get that smile  
  
And you say nothing at all  
Well I couldnt have said it better myself  
Tonight the conversation takes the fall  
Just love me like you love nobody else  
  
I see the angels theyre standing right outside your door  
Theyre watching over me theyre watching over us all  
You can send them home tonight because you wont need them anymore  
In your arms I think Ive found the safest place to fall  
When I step in the door and I stare at your face  
There are so many things that I wish I could say  
Well I struggle with words but they put up a fight  
You can keep your mouth shut because it doesnt really matter tonight  
  
I will guide you all the way  
Because I know exactly what youre trying to say  
You have the right to remain silent  
Ill get the lights  
You get that smile  
  
And you say nothing at all  
Well I couldnt have said it better myself  
Tonight the conversation takes the fall  
Just love me like you love nobody else  
  
And I know you feel the same  
Youve been searching for the words  
Now you know what to say  
  
Just say nothing  
Dont say a word  
Silence is gold  
Dont say a word  
  
This is the moment weve been waiting for  
If I exercise my right  
I will take your body language and hold it against you tonight  
  
And I know you feel the same  
Ive wondered all my life if this moment comes would I know what to say  
Then you say nothing at all  
So many times I stumbled on the words I wanted to say  
Then you say nothing at all  
So many thoughts that I should have just let my heart explain  
Then you say nothing at all  
So many ways we could turn the words around  
Then you say nothing at all  
So many nights our hearts came crashing to the ground  
Then you say nothing at all  
So many dreams that are finally coming true  
Well I couldnt have said it better myself  
Now you finish me off when you finish my thoughts the way you do  
  
You say nothing at all  
Well I couldnt have said it better myself  
Tonight the conversation takes the fall  
Just love me like you love nobody else
