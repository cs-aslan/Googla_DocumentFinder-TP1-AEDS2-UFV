Woman trouble always in my life  
Got a babe but shell never be my wife  
Cause I know yes I know  
When she got you man youre never letting go  
  
You see her in the street with the sparkling eyes  
Dont forget that she knows how to cry  
Cause you know yes I know  
When she got you man youre never letting go  
  
She says baby that well never fight  
I know Im gonna treat you right  
You wont be lonely this I know  
Theres a time when women have got to go  
  
Woman trouble always on my mind  
My kind of woman Ill never find  
Cause I know yes I know  
When she got you man youll never let go  
  
Woman trouble always in my life  
Got a babe but shell never be my wife  
Cause I know yes I know  
When they got you man theyre never letting go
