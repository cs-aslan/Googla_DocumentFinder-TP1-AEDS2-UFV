Take comfort where you find it  
whatever gets you through  
Take comfort dont be blind to it  
You must do whats a right for you  
  
Every one at times must run for cover  
Dont you know you really cant be blamed  
For in this youre just like any other  
Theres no need no need to feel ashamed  
  
Take comfort where you see it  
Whatever makes it right  
Take comfort when you need it  
To help you through the night  
  
By the way we live in our confusion  
And the way that we misspend our youth  
By the time were stripped of our illusions  
We may find illusions are the truth
