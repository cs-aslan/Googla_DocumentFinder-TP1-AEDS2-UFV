Well shes up against the register with an apron and a spatula  
Yesterdays deliveries tickets for the bachelors  
Shes a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes  
Well its just an invitation to the blues  
  
And you feel just like Cagney she looks like Rita Hayworth  
At the counter of the Schwabs drugstore  
You wonder if she might be single shes a loner and likes to mingle  
Got to be patient try and pick up a clue  
  
She said How you gonna like em over medium or scrambled  
You say anyways the only way be careful not to gamble  
On a guy with a suitcase and a ticket getting out of here  
Its a tired bus station and an old pair of shoes  
This aint nothing but an invitation to the blues  
  
But you cant take your eyes off her get another cup of java  
Its just the way she pours it for you joking with the customers  
Mercy mercy Mr Percy there aint nothing back in Jersey  
But a brokendown jalopy of a man I left behind  
And the dream that I was chasing and a battle with booze  
And an open invitation to the blues  
  
But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candyapple Caddy  
And a bank account and everything accustomed to the finer things  
He probably left her for a socialite and he didnt cept at night  
And then hes drunk and never even told her that her cared  
So they took the registration and the carkeys and her shoes  
And left her with an invitation to the blues  
  
Cause theres a Continental Trailways leaving local bus tonight good evening  
You can have my seat Im sticking round here for a while  
Get me a room at the Squire the filling stations hiring  
And I can eat here every night what the hell have I got to lose  
Got a crazy sensation go or stay now I gotta choose  
And Ill accept your invitation to the blues
