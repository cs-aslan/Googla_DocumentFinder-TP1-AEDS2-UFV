Looking for what I need  
I heard a tale that somewhere  
That a dude had a real go at me  
  
So like a rat race cowboy  
I slipped into the human zoo  
Headed down some trouble  
Got myself a drink or two  
  
Well I took to the streets  
And I took to the bars  
Marched right in but I didnt get far  
Manager said hey boy theres the door  
But I didnt leave until I evened the score  
  
I gotta face the hangman  
Gotta pay for what I done  
I gotta face the hangman  
Or by the noose I swing  
In the morning sun  
  
Like a tipsy gypsy  
Looking like Id been had  
But like the story says  
This wildeyed boy is bad  
  
I got a police squad car  
Taxi to the local slam  
They said  
Son youre gonna pay for what youve done  
But I dont give a damn  
  
Just cause I like to drink and dance all night  
An alley cat brawl in an old fist fight  
  
Give me no lip boy or Ill kick you in the mouth  
Watch you head fly north and your teeth fly south  
  
I gotta face the hangman  
Gotta pay for what I done  
I gotta face the hangman  
Or by the noose I swing  
In the morning sun  
  
Now the judge looked and me and said  
That boy he definitely be guilty  
Oh let him swing  
  
I gotta face the hangman  
Gotta pay for what I done  
I gotta face the hangman  
Or by the noose I swing  
In the morning sun  
  
I gotta face the hangman  
Gotta pay for what I done  
I gotta face the hangman  
Or by the noose I swing  
In the morning sun
