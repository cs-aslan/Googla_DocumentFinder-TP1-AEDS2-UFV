I found a girl with a pretty face  
I tied a rope around her waist  
I know when shes in and when  
She goes out  
Well there aint nothing to guess about  
She covers her ears when i play my guitar  
She runs away but not very far  
Just push a button  retractable cord  
I pull her back when i get bored  
One word from her and shed be free  
But shes exactly where she wants to be  
Magnetic Madonna she glows in the night  
Reciprocal pull i flow to her light  
Woman i am bound to you  
But what do i want to do  
Woman what do i want
