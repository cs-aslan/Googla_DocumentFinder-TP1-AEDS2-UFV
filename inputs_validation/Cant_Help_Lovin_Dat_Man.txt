Oh listen sister  
I love my mister man and I cant tell you why  
Dere aint no reason why I should love dat man  
It must be sumpin dat de angels done plan  
De chimbleys smokin  
De roof is leakin in  
But he dont seem to care  
He can be happy  
With jes a sip of gin  
I even loves him when his kisses got gin  
  
Fish got to swim and birds got to fly  
I got to love one man till I die  
Cant help lovin that man of mine  
  
Tell me hes lazy  
Tell me hes slow  
Tell me Im crazy maybe I know  
Cant help lovin that man of mine  
  
When he goes away  
Dats a rainy day  
And when he comes back dat day is fine  
The sun will shine  
  
He can come home as late as can be  
Home without him aint no home to me  
Cant help lovin that man of mine  
  
He can come home as late as can be  
Home without him aint no home to me  
Cant help lovin that man the way I do  
Oh Cant help lovin that man of mine
