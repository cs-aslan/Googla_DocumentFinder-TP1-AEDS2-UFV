I cant believe that Ive found you  
Fate did a number on me  
If you end up with my arms around you  
Its meant to be  
  
Well maybe my crazy is showing  
But maybe Im hooked on your touch  
But wherever my life is going  
There aint no rush  
Cause  
  
Wherever youre going  
Id like to go too  
If you dont have anything  
Better to do  
Id love to spend  
Some more time together  
So what are you doing  
Between now and forever  
  
Ill take the blue with the gray days  
I just pray the road will be long  
Cause if Im beside you theres no way  
I can go wrong  
  
Wherever youre going  
Id like to go too  
If you dont have anything  
Better to do  
Id love to spend  
Some more time together  
So what are you doing  
Between now and forever  
  
Id love to spend some more time together  
So what are you doing  
Between now and forever  
  
What are you doing  
Between now and forever
