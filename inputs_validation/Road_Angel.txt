I was ridin down that highway  
Silver Harley by my side  
When I thought I saw my lady  
She was headed for the Berkely Hill  
Pistol on her hip in case she needed a thrill  
I dont believe it  
Dont believe a word  
I dont believe it  
Dont believe a word  
I said come on with me baby  
Dont you want to ride with me  
She put her hand into her bag now  
Pulled out a half pint of red eye sauce  
Sneakin round the corner drinkin whiskey from a jar  
I dont believe it  
Dont believe a word  
I dont believe it  
Dont believe a word
