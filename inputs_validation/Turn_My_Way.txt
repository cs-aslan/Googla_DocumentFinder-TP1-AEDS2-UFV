  
Take my hand  
And dont let go  
Trust this man  
And let it flow  
  
Dont take me down  
Cause Im not done  
Dont steal my crown  
Before its won  
The wide expanse  
The wheel of chance  
Will turn my way  
The sky will not be gray  
  
I dont want to be like other people are  
Dont want to own a key dont want to wash my car  
Dont want to have to work like other people do  
I want it to be free I want it to be true  
  
Take my hand  
And dont let go  
Trust this man  
And let it flow  
  
I drank in every bar in town  
I filled my cup when I was down  
I saw the things I wanted to see  
Became the man I wanted to be  
But then somehow I lost my way  
Ive got to get back there today  
  
I dont want to be like other people are  
Dont want to own a key dont want to wash my car  
Dont want to have to work like other people do  
I want it to be free I want it to be true  
  
I dont want to be like other people are  
Dont want to own a key dont want to wash my car  
Dont want to have to work like other people do  
I want it to be free I want it to be true  
  
I dont want to be like other people are  
Dont want to own a key dont want to wash my car  
Dont want to have to work like other people do  
I want it to be free I want it to be true  
  
I dont want to be like other people are  
Dont want to own a key dont want to wash my car  
I lie awake at night or wait until its light  
I want it to be free I thought that I was right  
  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right
