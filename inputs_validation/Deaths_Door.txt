Well Im knocking on Deaths door  
Will I take my rest among the blessed  
Mother are you waiting  
Father are you pacing  
Im coming home  
  
Im knocking on Deaths door  
Will I take my rest in my Sunday best  
Mother are you anxious  
Father are you gracious  
Im coming home  
  
Ive been away too long  
For so long youve been strong  
Ive been away too long  
I know that it was wrong  
But Im coming home  
  
Well Im knocking on Deaths door  
Will I take my rest have I passed the test  
Mother are you praying  
Father I am saying  
Im coming home
