The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play  
Through the meadow land toward a closing door  
A door marked nevermore that wasnt there before  
  
The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories  
Of the golden smile that introduced me to  
The days of wine and roses and you  
  
The days of wine and roses  
more instrumentalrest of the first verse  
  
The lonely  the night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories  
Of the golden smile that introduced me to  
The days of wine and roses and you
