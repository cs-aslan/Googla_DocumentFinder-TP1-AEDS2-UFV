I called you on the phone to say I love you that I stop by for you at nine  
My heart broke when you said that its all over  
Someone else would take up all your time  
And thats a lot of heartaches for a dime  
Ill never know what made you change your mind  
I only know Ive held you close and kissed you my last time  
Thats a lot of heartaches for a dime  
  
I went downtown to join the marry makers I told myself that heres where I
belong  
I thought that I was doin fine without you and then I heard somebody play our
song  
And thats a lot of heartaches for a dime  
Thats a lot of heartaches for a dime
