Untem gliben glaussen glauben  
Give it to me baby huh huh huh huh  
Give it to me baby huh huh huh huh  
Give it to me baby huh huh huh huh  
And all the girlies say Im pretty fly for a white guy  
  
Uno dos tres cuatro cinco cinco seis  
  
You know its kinda hard just to get along today  
Our subject isnt cool but he fakes it anyway  
He may not have a clue and he may not have style  
But everything he lacks well he makes up in denial  
  
So dont debate a player straight  
You know he really doesnt get it anyway  
Gonna play the field and keep it real  
For you no way for you no way  
So if you dont rate just overcompensate  
At least youll know you can always go on ricki lake  
The world needs wannabes  
So hey hey do that brand new thing  
  
Give it to me baby huh huh huh huh  
Give it to me baby huh huh huh huh  
Give it to me baby huh huh huh huh  
And all the girlies say Im pretty fly for a white guy  
  
He needs some cool tunes not just any will suffice  
But they didnt have ice cube so he bought vanilla ice  
Now cruising in his pinto he sees homies as he pass  
But if he looks twice theyre gonna kick his lily ass  
  
So dont debate a player straight  
You know he really doesnt get it anyway  
Gonna play the field and keep it real  
For you no way for you no way  
So if you dont rate just overcompensate  
At least youll know you can always go on ricki lake  
The world loves wannabes  
So hey hey do that brand new thing  
  
Now hes getting a tattoo yeah hes gettin ink done  
He asked for a 13 but they drew a 31  
Friends say hes trying too hard and hes not quite hip  
But in his own mind hes the hes the dopest trip  
  
Give it to me baby huh huh huh huh  
Give it to me baby huh huh huh huh  
Give it to me baby huh huh huh huh  
Uno dos tres cuatro cinco cinco seis  
  
So dont debate a player straight  
You know he really doesnt get it anyway  
Gonna play the field and keep it real  
For you no way for you no way  
So if you dont rate just overcompensate  
At least youll know you can always go on ricki lake  
  
The world needs wannabes  
The world loves wannabes

And hey hey do that brand new thing
