I just met infatuation its something in his smile  
My obsession cant stand the thoughts you and I  
Something takes over pulls me up onto my feet  
Before I know it I got you pushing up on me  
  
On the floor  
Under the burning lights  
Screaming look behind  
Hands on this waist of mine  
And I dont know where this will lead  
But Im hoping you tell me  
Out here whipping my hair all crazy baby  
  
Doin it like Im at work  
Im making that thang jump  
  
Im making that thang twirk so get up on it baby  
Im doin what I do  
I make it move  
Got me out here whipping my hair awww  
  
Baby I just might have what you need  
Sprinkling you with pieces of me  
Now lets make it a sight to see baby  
  
On the floor  
Under the burning lights  
Screaming look behind  
Hands on this waist of mine  
And I dont know where this will lead  
But Im hoping you tell me  
Out her whipping my hair all crazy baby  
  
Doin it like Im at work  
Im making that thang jump  
Im making that thang twirk so get up on it baby  
Im doin what I do  
I make it move  
Got me whipping my hair awww  
  
We flashing pictures kodak moment memory  
Look at the flickers sparks on my camera screen  
The buried treasure come with me and we will find  
Create a perfect world just for you and I  
  
On the floor  
 Burning lights  
Screaming look behind  
Hands on this waist of mine  
And I dont know where this will lead  
But Im hoping you tell me  
Out her whipping my hair all crazy baby  
  
Doin it like Im at work  
Im making that thang jump  
Im making that thang twirk so get up on it baby  
Im doin what I do  
I make it move  
Got me whipping my hair awww

Sprinkling you with pieces of me  
Now lets make it a sight to see baby
