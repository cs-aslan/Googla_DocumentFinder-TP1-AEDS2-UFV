Well lordy I shall not be I shall not be moved  
I shall not be I shall not be moved  
Just like a tree thats growin in the meadow down by the water  
I shall not be moved  
  
Im on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved  
On my way to glory land I will not be moved  
Im like a tree thats planted by the water  
I shall not be moved  
  
Chorus x2  
I shall not be I shall not be moved  
I shall not be I shall not be moved  
Just like a tree thats planted by the water  
I shall not be moved  
  
Well Im on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved  
On my way to glory land I shall not be moved  
Im like a tree thats planted by the water  
I shall not be moved  
  
Oh well  
I shall not be I shall not be moved  
I shall not be I shall not be moved  
Just like a tree thats planted by the water  
I shall not be moved  
  
Chorus  
  
Glory glory glory hallelujah I shall not be moved  
Glory hallelujah I shall not be moved  
Just like a tree thats planted by the water  
I shall not be moved
