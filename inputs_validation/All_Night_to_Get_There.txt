Baby lets pretend  
Were just kids seventeen again  
Dont let anyone know  
Hold on tight and lets just let it go  
This aint just a kiss were stealing  
Lets take our time and chase this feeling  
  
Nowhere to be and all night to get there  
All nightbreathing the same air  
Real close and real slow baby  
Just you and me and love laying right here  
Sunset watching us disappear  
We can do anything I dont care  
Weve got nowhere to be and all  
Night to get there  
  
Secret hideaway  
Twilight choir in a serenade  
The whole worlds spinning so fast  
Lets jump off and let it roll right past us  
We can stay this way forever  
Getting gonegetting lost together  
  
Nowhere to be and all night to get there  
All nightbreathing the same air  
Real close and real slow baby  
Just you and me and love laying right here  
Sunset watching us disappear  
We can do anythingI dont care  
Weve got nowhere to be and all  
Night to get there  
  
Nowhere to be and all night to get there  
All nightbreathing the same air  
Real close and real slow baby  
Just you and me and love laying right here  
Sunset watching us disappear  
We can do anythingI dont care  
Weve got nowhere to be and all  
Night to get there  
  
Nowhere to be and all night to get there
