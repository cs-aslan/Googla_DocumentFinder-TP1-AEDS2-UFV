Mama always prayed that Id be a better man than daddy  
And I determined not to let her down  
Deserted by the man she loved and left to raise four children  
We were the local gossip of the town  
  
I promised her that Id live right and not be like the others  
But I wound up in jail on Christmas day  
I told her Id be home and not to worry bout my brothers  
When I got home my mom had passed away  
  
chorus  
And I hear tell the road to hell is paved with good intentions  
And mama my intentions were the best  
Theres lotsa things in my life I just as soon not mention  
Looks like Ive turned out like all the rest  
But mama my intentions were the best  
  
A little boy with big blue eyes abeggin to go fishing  
I promised him but never took the time  
Now they wont let me see him and I sit here awishing  
Wishin I could hold him one more time  
  
repeat chorus  
But mama my intentions were the best
