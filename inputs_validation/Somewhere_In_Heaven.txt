Somewhere  
In heaven  
There is a place  
Waiting for you and me  
  
He made a promise  
Gave every drop of Blood  
Died on the cross  
so wed be free  
  
Oh Oh Oh Oh  
  
Somewhere Somewhere  
In Heaven  
Theres a place  
Waiting waiting for you and me  
  
He made a promise  
Gave every drop of Blood  
And died on the cross  
So wed be free  
  
Somewhere Somewhere  
In Heaven  
There is a place  
Waiting waiting for you and me  
  
He made a promise  
When He gave every drop of His blood  
Died on the cross  
So wed be free
