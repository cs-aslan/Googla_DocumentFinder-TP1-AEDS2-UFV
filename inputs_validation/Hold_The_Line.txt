Its not in the way that you hold me  
Its not in the way you say you care  
Its not in the way youve been treating my friends  
Its not in the way that you stayed till the end  
Its not in the way you look or the things that you say that youll do  
  
Hold the line love isnt always on time oh oh oh  
Hold the line love isnt always on time oh oh oh  
  
Its not in the words that you told me girl  
Its not in the way you say youre mine ooh  
Its not in the way that you came back to me  
Its not in the way that your love set me free  
Its not in the way you look or the things that you say that youll do  
  
Hold the line love isnt always on time oh oh oh  
Hold the line love isnt always on time oh oh oh  
  
Its not in the words that you told me  
Its not in the way you say youre mine ooh  
Its not in the way that you came back to me  
Its not in the way that your love set me free  
Its not in the way you look or the things that you say that youll do  
  
Hold the line love isnt always on time oh oh oh  
Hold the line love isnt always on time oh oh oh  
Love isnt always on time  
  
Hold the line love isnt always on time  
Love isnt always love isnt always on time  
Hold the line love isnt always on time love isnt always on time  
Love isnt always on time love isnt always on time oh oh oh
