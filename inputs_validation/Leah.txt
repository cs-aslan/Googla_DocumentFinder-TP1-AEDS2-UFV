LeLeah Leah LeLeah Leah  
Here I go  
From the hut to the boat to the sea  
For Leah  
  
Ahhah I gotta go diving in the bay  
Gotta get a lot of oysters find some pearls today  
To make a pretty necklace for Leah  
Leeah  
  
Ive gotta go deep and find the ones just right  
Ill bet my Leahll be surprised tonight  
Ill place the pearls around the only girl for me  
Leeah  
  
But somethings wrong I cannot move around  
My leg is caught its pulling me down  
But Ill keep my hand shut tight for if they find me  
Theyll find the pearl for Leah  
  
And now its over Im awake at last  
Old heartaches and memories from the past  
It was just another dream about my lost love  
Bout Leeah  
  
LeLeah Leah LeLeah Leah  
Here I go  
Back to sleep and in my dreams Ill dream  
With Leah Leah Leah
