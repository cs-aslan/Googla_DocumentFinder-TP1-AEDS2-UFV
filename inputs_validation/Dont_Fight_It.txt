There you sit  
All by yoself  
Everybodys dancin  
They cant ahelp themselves  
  
The mood is much too strong  
You cant ahold out longer  
So get up  
Dont fight it  
You got to feel it feel it  
  
You better get on up  
And get that groove  
You know what baby  
I like the way you move  
  
Ya do the Thing  
Like you oughta be alright  
So dont fight it  
Whoa baby yeah yeah  
Feel it feel it  
  
The way you Jerk  
The way you do The Twine  
Youre too much baby  
Id like to make you mine  
  
And after the dance  
Im gonna take you home  
So dont fight it  
Baby youve got to feel  
Feel it feel it  
  
Dont fight it oh no  
Feel it feel it  
  
You got to feel  
Feel it feel it  
  
You cant fight it  
Feel it feel it
