This looks like a December day  
This looks like a time to remember day  
And I remember the spring such a sweet tender thing  
And loves summer college  
Where the green leaves of knowledge  
Were waiting to fall with the fall  
  
And where September wine  
Numbed the measure of time  
Through the tears of October now Novembers over  
And this looks like a December day  
  
This looks like a December day  
It looks like weve come to the end of the way  
And as my memories race back to loves eager beginning  
Reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending  
The ending that wont go away  
  
And as my memories race back to loves eager beginning  
Reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending  
The ending that wont go away  
  
And this looks like a December day
