TM  
  
Yo for those who live the way that I live  
We came a long way  
From wiping coal outta eyelids to raps hottest  
Fake Gazelles to black Pradas  
Selling nicks to trey bags to making hits like Kidada Jones father  
OGs would send me to the store with a dollar  
Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow  
Aint nothing free in the world in life  
No matter who you are everybody got they price  
And some cost more than others  
When you poor its like life aint even worth living  
But when you rich its every fat ass worth hittin  
With no chips your drawers just stay on your hips  
I play with the six cuz money make the whole world spin  
But without the Franklin faces you see whos your real friends  
Its V12s honeys on the cell bobbin out the JBL  
Its Nas and R Kell  
  
R Kelly  
Never thought that Id ever live this life  
Money stacked in rolls honeys on each side  
Anything I want I can say its mine  
No more worries bout how can I provide  
  
Money makes the world go round  
Nothin move but the money  
You believe it if you want to  
Money makes the world go round  
Said nothin move but the money
