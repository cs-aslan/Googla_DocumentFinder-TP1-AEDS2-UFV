Oh where is she woman  
Shes only here for the sun  
Its now youll discover  
Shes only here for the fun  
And who will move over  
Sweet talker choosin her side  
And its then its all over  
She just along for the ride  
  
She s a roller  
Shes just a roller  
Bet shell roll her life away  
  
One town is just like another  
One man will just never do  
Dont turn around  
When she calls out your name  
Shes gonna break you in two  
  
But shes a roller  
Shes just a roller  
Rolling time come today  
  
One town is just like another  
One man will just never never do  
Dont turn around  
When she calls out your name  
Shes gonna snap you in two
