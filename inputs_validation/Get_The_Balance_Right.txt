Theres more besides joyrides  
Little house in the countryside  
Understand learn to demand  
Compromise sometimes lie  
Get the Balance right get the balance right  
Be responsible respectable  
Stable but gullible  
Concerned and caring help the helpless  
But always remain ultimately selfish  
Get the balance right get the balance right  
You think youve got a hold of it all  
You havent got a hold at all  
When you reach the top get ready to drop  
Prepare yourself for the fall youre gonna fall  
Its almost predictable  
Dont take this way dont take that way  
Straight down the middle until next Thursday  
Push to the left back to the right  
Twist and turn til youve got it right  
Get the balance right
