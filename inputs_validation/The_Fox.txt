The fox went out to the chase one night  
Prayed to the moon to give him light  
He had many a mile to go that night  
Before he reached the towno towno towno  
Many a mile to go that night before he reached the town  
Many a mile to go that night before he reached the town  
  
He ran til he came to a great big pen  
Where the ducks and the geese were kept there in  
Said a couple of you gonna grease my chin  
Before I leave this town o town o town o  
Couple of you gonna grease my chin before I leave this town  
Couple of you gonna grease my chin before I leave this town  
  
He grabbed the grey goose by the neck  
Throwed a duck across his back  
He didnt amind with the quack quack quack  
And the legs all dangling downo downo downo  
Didnt amind with the quack quack quack  
And the legs all dangling downo downo downo  
Didnt amind with the quack quack quack  
And the legs all dangling downo downo downo  
  
Old mother Flipper Flapper jumped out of bed  
Out of the window she cocked her head  
Cryin John John the grey goose is gone  
And the fox is on the towno towno towno  
John John the grey goose is gone  
And the fox is on the towno  
John John the grey goose is gone  
And the fox is on the towno  
  
Well the fox he came to his own den  
There were the little ones eight nine ten  
Saying Daddy you better go back again  
Cause it must be a mighty fine towno towno towno  
Saying Daddy you better go back again  
Cause it must be a mighty fine town  
Saying Daddy you better go back again  
Cause it must be a mighty fine town  
  
Well the fox and his wife without any strife  
Cut up the goose with a carving knife  
They never had such a supper in their lifeacapo
