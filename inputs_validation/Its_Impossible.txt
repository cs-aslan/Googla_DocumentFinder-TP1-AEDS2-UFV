Its impossible tell the sun to leave the sky its just impossible  
Its impossible ask a baby not to cry its just impossible  
Can I hold you closer to me and not feel you goin through me  
Split the second that I never think of you Oh how impossible  
  
Can the ocean keep from rushin to the shore Its just impossible  
If I had you could I ever want for more Its just impossible  
And tomorrow should ya ask me for the world somehow Id get it  
I would sell my very soul and not regret it  
For to live without your loveIts just impossible  
  
Can the ocean keep from rushin to the shore Its just impossible  
If I had you could I ever want for more Its just impossible  
And tomorrow shouldya ask me for the world somehow Id get it  
I would sell my very soul and not regret it  
For to live without your love  
Its just impossible  
  
Impossible impossible
