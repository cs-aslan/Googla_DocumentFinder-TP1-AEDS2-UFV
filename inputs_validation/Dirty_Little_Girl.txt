Ive seen a lot of women who havent had much luck  
Ive seen you looking like youve been run down by a truck  
That aint nice to say sometimes I guess Im really hard  
But Im gonna put buckshot in your pants if you step into my yard  
  
When I watch the police come by and move you on  
Well I sometimes wonder whats beneath the mess youve become  
Well you may have been a pioneer in the trade of womens wear  
But all you got was a mop up job washing other peoples stairs  
  
Im gonna tell the world youre a dirty little girl  
Someone grab that bitch by the ears  
Rub her down scrub her back  
And turn her inside out  
Cause I bet she hasnt had a bath in years  
  
Heres my own belief about all the dirty girls  
That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl  
And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself  
So dont show up around here till your social workers helped
