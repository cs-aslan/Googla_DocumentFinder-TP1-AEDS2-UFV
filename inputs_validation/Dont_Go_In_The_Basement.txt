Oh  
You can tell a dirty story  
In the old conservatory  
  
But dont go in the basement  
  
You can make a scene  
On the mezanene  
  
But dont go in the basement  
  
You can fill yourself with static  
With the ghosts up in the attic  
  
But dont go in the basement  
  
You can light yourself a torch  
On the old front porch  
  
But dont go in the basement  
  
Oh you may think that its real cool  
To ride down the bannister like some darn fool  
Oh dont go Dont go  
Dont go in the basement  
  
You can feel quite aloof  
Playing rummy on the roof  
  
But dont go in the basement  
  
Where the cockroaches dance  
You can wallow in romance  
  
But dont go in the basement  
  
You may think that its deluxe  
To ride the elevator filled with ducks  
  
Oh dont go dont go  
Dont go in the basement
