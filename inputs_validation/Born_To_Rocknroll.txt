If music be the food of love then play on  
Lend me your ears as I lay down this song  
Youre touched by the feelingits hard to control  
Let me tell you people  
I was born to rocknroll  
  
Some people want to fight some people want to fly  
Others live for pleasureeven do or die  
Some are born to powertry to save a soul  
Let me tell you people  
I was born to rocknroll  
  
It may sound a little absurd  
But I was born to spread the word  
Got the music in my soul  
I was born to rocknroll  
  
Some people are born to money  
Privileged all their days  
Never had a problemnever had to pay  
But I dont have a doubt about the feeling in my soul  
Let me tell you people  
I was born to rocknroll  
  
It may sound a little absurd  
But I was born to spread the word  
Got the music in my soul  
I was born to rocknroll  
  
Instrumental  
  
It may sound a little absurd  
But I was born to spread the word  
Got the music in my soul  
I was born to rocknroll  
  
It may sound a little absurd  
But I was born to spread the word  
Got the music in my soul  
I was born to rocknroll  
  
Born to rocknroll  
I was born to rocknroll
