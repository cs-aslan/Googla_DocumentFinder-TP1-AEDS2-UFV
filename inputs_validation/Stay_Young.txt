One way out is all youre ever going to get  
From those wholl hand it out dont never let it upset you  
cause theyll put words into your mouths  
  
Theyre making you feel so ashamed  
Making you taking the blame  
Making you cold in the night  
Making you question your heart and your soul  
And I think that its not quite right  
  
Hey  Stay young and invincible   
cause we know just what we are  
And come what may were unstoppable  
cause we know just what we are  
Yeah we know just what we are  
Yeah we know just what we are  
  
Feed your head with all the things you need  
When youre hungry  
Stay in bed and sleep all day as long as its Sunday  
cause theyll put words into my mouth  
  
Theyre making me feel so ashamed  
Making me taking the blame  
Making me cold in the night  
Making me question my heart and my soul  
And I think that its not quite right  
  
Hey  Stay young and invincible   
cause we know just what we are  
And come what may were unstoppable  
cause we know just what we are  
Yeah we know just what we are  
Yeah we know just what we are  
  
Hey  Stay young and invincible   
cause we know just what we are  
And come what may were unstoppable  
cause we know just what we are  
And hey  Stay young and invincible   
cause we know just what we are  
And come what may my faiths unshakeable  
cause we know just what we are  
cause we know just what we are  
cause we know just what we are  
cause we know just what we are  
cause we know just what we are  
Know just what we are  
Know just what we are  
Know just what we are  
Know just what we are
