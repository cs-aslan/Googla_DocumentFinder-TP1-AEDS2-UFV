Its a great great pleasure a great great great big thrill  
Its a great great pleasure a great great great big thrill  
When you got your baby and a whole lotta time to kill  
  
Did you ever get a feelin that your feet had turned to stones  
Do you ever get a feelin that your feet had turned to stones  
Do you get a funny feelin running up and down your bones  
Thats rheumatism  
  
Its a great great pleasure a great great great big thrill  
Its a great great pleasure a great great great big thrill  
When you got your baby and a whole lotta time to kill  
  
Did you ever feel lucky and wake up cold in hand  
Did you ever feel lucky and wake up cold in hand  
Find you aint got a nickel and your womans got another man  
Bad deal
