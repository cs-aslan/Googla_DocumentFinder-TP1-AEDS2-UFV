You are so unpredictable  
When I am not  
You are so irresistible  
That I cant stop  
You say my name  
And I start walking on heaven  
  
What flying saucers did you come here on  
What extraterrestrial planet are you from  
Youre much more than life  
Youre from galaxy paradise  
  
What flying saucers did you come here on  
What will they say when they find that youre gone  
Say youll stay in life  
Queen from galaxy paradise  
  
You are so unforgettable  
And I will not  
Our loves far more than sensual  
And twice as hot  
You touch my hand  
And I know that well love forever  
  
What flying saucers did you come here on  
What extraterrestrial planet are you from  
Youre much more than life  
Youre from galaxy paradise  
  
What flying saucers did you come here on  
What will they say when they find that youre gone  
Say youll stay in life  
Queen from galaxy paradise
