He sits alone in a crowded station  
And lights his cigarette  
The light flickers slightly  
And tells him politely  
His lifes not at its best  
  
She weighs him up cause his loves taken lightly  
And loves her only regret  
But loves not a sin in her eyes  
And shes asking him why   
Why are you leaving  
I just cant say  
Why are you leaving  
He dont know daddys gonna stay  
  
Put a little light in her darkest day  
So she can see it  
Put a little love in her heart on the way  
So she can feel it  
  
He walks home with his pride in his pocket  
And pulls it out with his change  
And his love is something and it just turned into nothing  
Now isnt that strange  
  
She holds her head high close to the bright sky  
Hes got his head in the clouds  
But loves not a sin in her eyes  
And hes telling her why   
Why are you leaving  
I just cant say  
Why are you leaving  
He dont know daddys gonna stay  
  
Put a little light in her darkest day  
So she can see it  
Put a little love in her heart on the way  
So she can feel it
