Up until one century ago there lived  
In the Zi Duang provence of eastern country  
A glasslike spider  
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web  
In weeks creating a macabre  
  
Shrine of remains  
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers  
Like floors in a building  
  
At the top of this palacelike place assembled with almost apparent  
Care were tiny shining objects glass beads dewdrops  
One could almost call it an altar  
When the breeze blew through this construction  
It produced sounds of wailing crying  
Tiny wails tiny cries  
  
The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically  
For their mother  
But the Glass Spider would have long gone having known that the babies  
Would survive someone on their own  
OhThe Glass Spider had blue eyes almost likea humans  
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries  
  
Dont you hear this wasted cry Life is over you  
Mummy come back cause the waters all gone  
But youve seen whos in heaven Is there anyone in hell  
Mummy come back cause its dark now  
Take care take care  
Mummy come back cause the waters all gone  
Somewhere she glows divine Somewhere she wakes alone  
But you youve promise in your lovin eye God its dark now  
  
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah  
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah  
  
Gone Gone the waters all gone  
Mummy come back cause the waters all gone  
Stay low on the ground fire can drive you savage and afraid  
Spitting the dawn come come come along before the animals awake  
Run run weve been moving all night rivers to the left  
If your mother dont love you then the riverbed might  
Gone gone the waters all gone  
Mummy come back cause the waters all gone  
  
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah  
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah  
  
Gone gone the waters all gone  
Mummy come back cause the waters all gone
