You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
Im telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
Hes making a list  
And checking it twice  
Gonna find out whos naughty or nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
Chorus  
He sees you when youre sleeping  
He knows when youre awake  
He knows if youve been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh You better be good tonight  
  
You better tin horns  
And lettle toy drums  
A rootytoottoot  
And a tumtumtum  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
Chorus  
He sees you when youre sleeping  
He knows when youre awake  
He knows if youve been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh You better be good tonight  
  
You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
Im telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town
