Monday morning feels so bad  
Everybody seems to nag me  
Coming Tuesday I feel better  
Even my old man looks good  
Wednesday just dont go  
Thursday goes too slow  
Ive got Friday on my mind  
  
CHORUS  
See my baby  
Gonna have fun in the city  
feel like fucking you  
Do my baby screw  
Be with my girl  
Shes so pretty  
all I want to do  
Ill go crazy  
She looks fine tonight  
zoom zoom zoom  
She is out of sight to me so divine  
Tonight I spend my bread  
Tonight I lose my head  
Tonight Ive got to get tonight  
Monday I have Friday on my mind  
  
Do the five day drag once more Monday blue  
  
There is nothing else that bugs me  
More than working for the rich men poor man beggar  
Man thief  
Hey Ill change that scene one day  
Today I might be mad  
Tomorrow Ill be glad  
Cause Ill have Friday on my mind  
  
CHORUS  
  
See my baby feel like fucking you  
Gonna have fun  
zoom zoom zoom  
Be with my girl repeat ad lib
