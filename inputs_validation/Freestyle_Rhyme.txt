Kid Rock Im gonna rock the house biatch  
It goes 1 for the trebble and 2 for the bass  
  
And the blue eyed devils gonna rock this place  
Cause I dont give a damn what ya label me  
Im still able G to wreck the whole town  
Got my cards on the table its a Royal Flush  
  
In God I trust and its a must I bust  
The angel dust and the strick 9  
A big bag of shrooms and the Boones wine  
Never uptight see Im that light that shines  
  
Ladys always askin me whats your sign  
Im a Capricorn not a Taurus  
Im the oriental lick master from the forest  
Im the Borris sorest looser that you ever saw  
  
But watch out slick Im quick on the draw  
And Ill be blastin the fools like this  
Pop pop pop shit  
Rocks no joke I go straight for the throat  
  
Chillin it late on my old mans boat  
I hate to grin about the girls I got  
1234567 yo I got a whole lot  
Stright pimpin cant stop this  
  
So when I get low on dough I make my hoes dance topless  
Watch me rock this Im far from spotless  
Im really kinda dirty flippin you the birdy  
Rollin on chrom Ds  
  
Bumpin them motherfuckin Beasties  
I see these emcees laugh at Rock  
But Im nuclear  
Feel the wrath of the after shock  
  
Cause after Rock rocks the spot I leave the whole crowd hot  
On the mic with my nuts in my hand  
With the sluts backstage hittin nuts on demand  
That could never be a buster a straight hustler  
  
I got a good bitch but I still dont trust her  
Let me lay it on the line  
  
Im just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme freestyle rhyme  
Im just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme freestyle rhyme  
  
Im just another kid tryin to get mine  
Freestyle rhyme freestyle rhyme  
Im just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme freestyle rhyme uhh uhh  
  
I gave an invitation to the president just for kicks  
It said your courduly invited to suck my dick  
Im a trippin true as this  
I got mill in the bank cause I make so much sense  
  
Hell bent and Im whisky bound  
Is there anything wacker than the wicked clown no  
Some people just dont get it  
They got no talent so they hide behind the gilnick and rcok with it  
  
Its a shame but whos to blame  
I got a see note brain steel veins  
I got love for everyone  
Just dont get dumb cause if ya get dumbya get done  
  
From the jimmy to the beach to the bum  
From the fist to the back to attack with the hand granades  
You cant fade me Im down for mine  
And the hate in the world is the sign of the times  
Let me lay it on the line  
  
Im just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme freestyle rhyme

Freestyle rhyme freestyle rhyme  
  
Im just another kid tryin to get mine

Now Im the highest flyest emcee in town  
The scratchin most smackinest emcee around  
Heaven sentin representin always  
Your on MTV radio game all crazed  
  
I blaze smoke screen 45 OGs  
Got the ladys breakin with this goatee  
24 on a 12 step relapse  
Phil and Bill bozin at the knee caps  
  
Ill be back if I dont make green  
With the funky rhymes and the no sell out themes  
I have dreams and aspirations  
My graduation was from pimp of the county to pimp of the nation  
  
Damn nation is shockin signs  
From the Kid Rock flows to the free style rhymes
