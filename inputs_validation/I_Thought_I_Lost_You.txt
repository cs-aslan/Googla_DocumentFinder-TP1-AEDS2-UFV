Miley  
Nobody listens to me  
Dont hear a single thing I say  
Say anythings to me  
Anything to get you on my head  
Dont know how I really feel  
Cause its the faith  
That makes it like that I dont care  
Dont know how much it hurts  
To turn around like you were never there  
Like somehow you could be replaced  
And I could walk away  
From the promises we made  
And swore wed never break  
  
Miley e Travolta  
Chorus  
I thought I lost you  
When you ran away  
To try to find me  
I thought Id never  
Your sweet face again  
I turned around  
And you were gone  
And on and on  
The days went  
I kept the moments  
That we were in  
And I knew in my heart  
That you  
Would come back for me  
My friend  
And now I got you  
When I thought  
I lost you  
  
Bridge travolta  
I told myself  
I wouldnt sleep  
Till  
I searched the world  
From sea to sea  
  
Miley  
I made a wish upon a star  
I turned around  
And there you were  
  
Together  
And now here we are  
  
Miley Here we are  
I thought I lost you  
  
Travolta  
I thought I lost You  
  
Miley you  
  
Together Yeh I thought I lost you
