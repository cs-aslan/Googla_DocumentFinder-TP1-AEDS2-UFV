Born of the sun  
Crashed to the earth  
Tormented reviled  
Engorged hate from birth  
Hellions the steed  
Bloods on the wing  
Claws set to slice  
Vengeance hell bring  
  
Cremating the land  
In seek and destroy  
Apocalypse slays  
Napalm hell deploy  
The beast of a god  
Regaled of his race  
Prepare to onslaught  
And bare face to face  
Across the divide  
The thresholds in flames  
The Painkiller rises again  
  
The scream of the demon  
Theres evil about  
Theyve come to posses us  
Out demons out  
  
Blade of the wheel  
Cuts deep in the bone  
Its Gideons quest  
To take Satans throne  
  
The critical mass  
And power that they wield  
Exterminates all  
When vermin rebel  
A maelstrom begins to disintegrate  
And pulverize all in its wake  
  
Demonizer  
Out out out demons out
