Were in trouble all the time  
You read about us all in the papers  
We walk around and bump into walls  a blind delegation  
And we aint afraid of high power  
Were bullet proof  
And weve never heard of Eisenhower  
Missile power justice or truth  
  
Were the Department of Youth  
Your new Department of Youth  
Were the Department of Youth  
Just me and youth  
  
We talk about this whole stupid world  
And still come out laughing  
We never make any sense  
But hell that never mattered  
But well make it through our blackest hour  
Were living proof  
And weve never heard of Billy Sunday  
Damon Runyon manners or couth  
Were the Department of Youth  
Your new Department of Youth  
Were the Department of Youth  
Just me and youth  
  
Were the Department of Youth  
The new Department of Youth  
Were the Department of Youth  
Weve got the power  
Were the Department of Youth  
And who gave it to you  
Donny Osmond
