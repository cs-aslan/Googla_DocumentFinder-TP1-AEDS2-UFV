This is a national anthem  
From the flipside of the empire  
Hand on my heart  
Heart on the sleeve of the constitution  
Sinking right into a mirror  
Leaving reflections on its surface  
Caught in a kind of radiobeacon  
Thats sending out signals  
Transmitting them backwards  
Hey tell me its true  
Is this the other side of you  
Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face  
Do I still walk on the same structure  
Hey what do we know  
Realeasing arrows over cosmic meadows  
Nothing is real  
Even iron or steel  
Melting gently in the cold structure  
Watching your face thru a peephole  
As I lean against the door  
Cant understand what you say  
But I think that youre calling my name  
Leaving the ones I loved is like  
Leaving the one they want me to be  
Making decisions  
In realtimeprecision  
As millions of sailors  
In parallelworlds  
Hey tell me its true  
Is this the other side of you  
Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face  
Do I still walk on the samestructure  
Hey what do we know  
Realeasing arrows over cosmic meadows  
Nothing is real  
Even iron or steel  
Melting gently in the cold structure  
Everybody walks this side of the runway  
Everybody hopes to get off the trap  
All we really like is to groove with emotion  
Waiting for the airline to lift us up
