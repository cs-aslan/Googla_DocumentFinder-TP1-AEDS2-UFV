Got a little rhythm a rhythm a rhythm  
That pitapats through my brain  
So darn persistent  
The day isnt distant  
When itll drive me insane  
Comes in the morning  
Without any warning  
And hangs around me all day  
Ill have to sneak up to it  
Someday and speak up to it  
I hope it listens when I say  
  
Fascinating rhythm  
Youve got me on the go  
Fascinating rhythm  
Im all aquiver  
  
When a mess youre making  
The neighbors want to know  
Why Im always shaking  
Just like a flivver  
  
Each morning I get up with the sun  
Start ahopping  
Never stopping  
To find at night no work has been done  
  
I know that  
Once it didnt matter  
But now youre doing wrong  
When you start to patter  
Im so unhappy  
  
Wont you take a day off  
Decide to run along  
Somewhere far away off  
And make it snappy  
  
Oh how I long to be the man I used to be  
Fascinating rhythm  
On wont you stop picking on me
