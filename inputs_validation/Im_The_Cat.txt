Baby Im around you enough to know when youre coming down  
And I am there with a smile prepared to bring you around  
Youre thinking that youve got me trained  
Im aware of that  
  
But when you need your outlook changed  
Baby Im the cat  
Baby Im allowed to be late when Im coming home  
You know Ill be there when I want to  
  
And you let me roam  
You think youve got me figured out  
I dont know about that  
But when you want to twist and shout  
  
Baby Im the cat  
Baby I might not be all that  
Your fortune cookie promised you  
But I will do  
  
Im the cat  
Baby I    Baby Im the cat  
Oh yeah    Baby Im the cat  
Baby Im in love with the way you scratch my back  
  
Youve got the only thing I want  
And thats a fact  
And when sometimes we disagree  
You take me to the mat  
  
But when I get you spinning free  
Baby Im the cat  
Baby I might not be all that  
The gypsy woman prophesied  
  
But be advised  
Im the cat  
Baby I might not be all that  
Your Magic 8 Ball said Id be  
  
But you will see  
Im the cat  
Baby I Baby Im the cat  
Oh yeah Baby Im the cat
