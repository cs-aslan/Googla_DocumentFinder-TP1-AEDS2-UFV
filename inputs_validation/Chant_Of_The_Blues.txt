I dont know why Im so doggone unlucky today  
Just got the news that my best gal has left me to stay  
Things were pretty rosy  
We got along so fine  
Until another guy moved in  
And handed her a line  
I dont know why Im so doggone unlucky today  
  
  
So I decided to try and get her off my mind  
Started to walkin to see what enjoyment Id find  
Was invited to a party  
Then there was a fight  
A fella got a whippin  
You guessed it right  
I dont know why Im so doggone unlucky today
