When the shades of night are falling  
Comes a fellow everyone knows  
Its the old dope peddler  
Spreading joy wherever he goes  
Every evening you will find him  
Around our neighborhood  
Its the old dope peddler  
Doing well by doing good  
  
He gives the kids free samples  
Because he knows full well  
That todays young innocent faces  
Will be tomorrows clientele  
Heres a cure for all your troubles  
Heres an end to all distress  
Its the old dope peddler  
With his powdered happiness
