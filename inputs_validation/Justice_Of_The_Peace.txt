Its such a terrible shame it was only a game  
Then her brothers found out seven Johnny be Goodes  
We was only pretending at mummys and daddys  
They totally misunderstood  
Oh what a terrible plight what a terrible fight  
It was too much to bear her father said ere  
I think you better sign its a letter designed  
To have you married by the first of the year  
Get the Justice of the Peace  
Get the Justice get the Justice of the Peace  
Oh get the Justice of the Peace  
Get the Justice get the Justice of the Peace  
  
If you want to play with fire  
Youll get yourself burned  
I was messing with the ashes  
But look at how it turned out  
Get the Justice of the Peace  
Get the Justice get the Justice of the Peace  
  
Oh what a terrible waste such a shocking disgrace  
To give me away Im too young to die  
A shotgun wedding heading straight for the sky  
And Im shy Mary Ellen Im shy why why why
