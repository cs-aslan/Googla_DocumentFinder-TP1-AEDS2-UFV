I told you from the start I couldnt give you my heart it belonged to someone
else  
I tried like hell but still we fell I guess we could not help ourselves  
You sure felt good in my world little girl but its time to draw the line  
Cause theres a lady whos mine and shes not the kind to just die upon the
vine  
Rose knows somethings going on Rose knows shes spending too much time alone  
I suppose better get myself back home Rose knows somethings going on  
  
Id love to stay here and lay down with you dear and hold you one more time  
I wish it could be but unfortunately Ive got roses on my mind  
Rose knows somethings going on  
Rose knows somethings going on
