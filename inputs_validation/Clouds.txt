Clouds  
Different shapes and sizes  
Hiding the horizon  
  
Clouds  
In the distance  
Coming to change my plans  
All my dreams will melt like sand  
  
Clouds  
The moment that you say goodbye  
Theyre going to rush right to the sky  
  
Whoa  
Baby baby please dont go  
  
Its going to rain  
Its going to rain  
Its going to rain down tears  
Of heartaches and fears  
  
Its going to rain  
Its going to rain  
I know for sure  
Cause you dont reach for me no more  
  
Its going to rain  
Its going to rain  
There in the distance  
Is that number one pain  
  
Clouds  
Thunder is the warning  
So dark and so alarming  
  
Clouds  
Go away go away  
Go dont take away my sunny days  
  
Clouds  
Leave me be  
Getting so dark out  
I just cant see
