Just one year of love  
Is better than A lifetime alone  
One sentimental moment in your arms  
Is like A shooting star right through my heart  
Its always A rainy day without you  
Im A prisoner of love inside you  
Im falling apart all around you yeah  
My heart cries out to your heart  
Im lonely but you can save me  
My hand reaches out for your hand  
Im cold but you light the fire in me  
My lips search for your lips  
Im hungry for your touch  
Theres so much left unspoken  
And all I can do is surrender  
To the moment just surrender  
And no one ever told me that love would hurt so much  
Oooh yes it hurts  
And pain is so close to pleasure  
And all I can do is surrender to your love  
Just surrender to your love  
Just one year of love  
Is better than A lifetime alone  
One sentimental moment in your arms  
Is like A shooting star right through my heart  
Its always A rainy day without you  
Im A prisoner of love inside you  
Im falling apart all around you  
And all I can do is surrender
