Fore day in the mornin babe  
You aint got home yet  
Hmm its fore day in the mornin babe  
You aint got home yet  
I cried and cried  
Til my pillows soaking wet  
Babe I cant get started  
Since you threw me down  
Hmmm I cant get started  
Since you threw me down  
I thought you were the square babe  
And you played me for a clown  
I loved you baby  
But you dont mean me no good  
Hmmm I loved you baby  
But you dont mean me no good  
You give me so much trouble  
I believe I move from your neighborhood
