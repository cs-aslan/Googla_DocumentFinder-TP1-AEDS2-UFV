Take away from me  
That what you just gave  
Nothing left to heal  
Nothing left to save  
Given half a chance  
Given what weve spent  
I will not repay  
I will not repent  
I dont want to leave  
I dont want to stay  
Get away from me  
Stay the hell away  
And I will give up my mind  
And I will give up my way  
And I will pluck out my eyes  
Yes I will feel my way  
I will  
  
Is there something wrong  
With the way I feel  
I dont want to beg  
I dont have to steal  
Let me prove myself  
Let me earn your trust  
Let me betray  
The way that we discussed  
I dont want to leave  
I dont want to stay  
Get away from me  
Stay the hell away  
  
And I will give up my mind  
And I will give my way  
And I will pluck out my eyes  
Yes I will feel my way  
I will  
  
In open hand unopened gift  
Her broken bones her head wont lift  
A decades been since youve been gone  
Mend the cracks and say so long  
Say so long
