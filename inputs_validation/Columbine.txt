Tossin hair aravin  
Eyes of flashin blue  
All the livin that youre savin  
Wont buy you dreams for you  
  
Cut yourself a columbine  
Tear it from the stem  
Now breathe upon the petals fine  
And throw them to the wind  
  
Watch the petals dancin  
See them twirl and sing  
All your pride and prancin  
How much does it mean  
  
Watch the petals start to fly  
And then come falling down  
Hear the wind begin to cry  
As she sees some touch the ground  
  
Ah lady like the flower fair  
Some day youll have to fall  
And you can find me standin there  
To catch you if you crawl  
  
Tossin hair aravin  
Eyes of flashin blue  
All the livin that youre savin  
Wont buy you dreams for you
