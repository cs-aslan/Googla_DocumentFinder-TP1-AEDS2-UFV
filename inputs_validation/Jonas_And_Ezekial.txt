I left my anger in a river running highway 5  
New hampshire vermont bordered by  
College farms hubcaps and falling rocks  
Voices in the woods and the mountaintops  
  
I used to search for reservations and native lands  
Before I realized everywhere I stand  
There have tribal feet running wild as fire  
Some past life sister of my desire  
  
Chorus  
Jonas and Ezekiel hear me now  
Steady now and dont come out  
Im not ready for the dead to show its face  
Whose turn is it anyway  
Anyway  
  
Now when I was young my people taught me well  
Give back what you take or youll go to hell  
Its not the devils land you know its not that kind  
Every devil I meet becomes a friend of mine  
Every devil I meet is an angel in disguise  
  
Chorus  
  
White chain rope fear  
hush my darling  
Be still my dear  
  
A bullet in the head now hes dead  
A friend of a friend someone said  
He was an activist with a very short life  
I think theres a lesson here  he died without a fight  
  
In the war over land where the world began  
Prophecies say its where the world will end  
But theres a tremor growing in our backyard  
Fear in our heads fear in our hearts  
Prophets in the graveyard  
  
Chorus  
  
Jonas and Ezekiel hear me now  
Steady now I feel your ghost about  
Im not ready for the dead to show its face  
Whose angel are you anyway  
  
I said theres prophets in the graveyard  
now I walk in beauty  
Prophets in the graveyard  
beauty is before me  
Prophets in the graveyard  
beauty is behind me  
above and below me
