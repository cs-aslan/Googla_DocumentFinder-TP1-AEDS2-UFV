MESS OF BLUES  
WITH JOOLS HOLLAND  
WRITERS DOC POMUS MORT SHUMAN  
I just got your letter baby Too bad you cant come home I swear Im goin
crazy Sittin here all alone Since your gone I got a mess of blues I aint
slept a week since Sunday I cant eat a thing all day Every day is just blue
Monday Since youve been away Since your gone I got a mess of blues Whoops
there goes a teardrop Rollin down my face If you cry when youre in love It
sure aint no disgrace Whoops there goes a teardrop Rollin down my face If
you cry when youre in love It sure aint no disgrace I gotta get myself
together Before I lose my mind Im gonna catch the next train goin And leave
my blues behind Since your gone I got a mess of blues I got a mess of blues
