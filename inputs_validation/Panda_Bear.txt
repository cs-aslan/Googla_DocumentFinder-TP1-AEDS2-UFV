Im moving to Tokyo  
cause Im tired of San Francisco  
My contracts are finally void  
And I am getting out  
On houses and building tops  
I swallow the beams and sundrops  
If my echos could reach your ears  
Then I could save my calls  
What happens when Im above  
The east river when you are in love  
Were staring at all these lights  
And I am going blind  
Fill all of the navy yards  
With hard working security guards  
cause the numbers are wearing off  
My plastic access cards  
How can I begin to say  
I feel better off when we stay  
In Paris on winter nights  
Beneath the snowy veil  
Content like a panda bear  
Still breathing the fresh mountain air  
Ill put on a diving tank  
And sing when I inhale
