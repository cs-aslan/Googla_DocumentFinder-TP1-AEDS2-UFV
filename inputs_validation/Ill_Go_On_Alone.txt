Were traveling down two different roads in world so far apart  
You want me yet theres something else before me in your heart  
Youre wanting me to change my life the way youre living yours  
But I cant change I see no way you wanted me before  
  
If you dont want me like I am then please dont pity me  
If you cant change a little bit then why not set me free  
If we cant live together then its best we live apart  
Youll go your way and Ill go mine well both make brand new start  
  
Theres nothing we can do it seems well never get along  
With you believing like you do you say I live so wrong  
But I cant change my way of life I lived it much too long  
You either take me like I am or Ill go on alone  
  
So either say you want my love or take the way you live  
Remember though before you get you got to learn to give  
So if it change my life or go then go its goin be  
Cause I cant change my life when you want something more than me
