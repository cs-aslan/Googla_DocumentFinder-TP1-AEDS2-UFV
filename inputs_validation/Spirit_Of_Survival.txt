In this world the gods have lost their way  
  
Cant keep this picture from out of my mind  
This fear hand in hand crossing innocence time  
Surrounding creation they caught in a trap  
The youngest offenders will witness confusion  
  
They drive him so fast not a care in the end  
Escaping collision every twist every bend  
When youre young invincible nothing to lose  
Keep seeing this picture standing in a circle  
The gods have forgotten to switch on the light  
Whos lost in the dark will crash in the night  
  
These lessons were living the lies of the day  
Expect them to honor and never disobey  
Yet greed is controlling the elders display  
No wonder the younger look at them in shame  
  
The spirit of survival  
Whos teaching the hatred  
The spirit of survival  
Or the class of your school  
The spirit of survival  
The color of your money  
Were standing in a circle  
We dont understand at all  
  
They dont understand at all  
In this world I truly do believe there is a safer place  
In this world I truly do believe there is a safer place  
  
The younger the older the wiser become  
Recover misfortune this true life as one  
Our genius is shining the past has all gone  
Whats left is the clearest perception of one  
The spirit of survival  
To magnify the power  
The spirit of survival  
To magnify the soul  
The spirit of survival  
To magnify the love  
Were standing in a circle  
We dont understand at all  
We dont understand at all  
In this world
