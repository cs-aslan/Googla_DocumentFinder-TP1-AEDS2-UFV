Saw the sun come up again  
Last weeks papers and a pack of darts  
That got me through til ten  
The ten fifteens five minutes late  
I really should just get out more these days  
Next door is coughing up his lungs  
Two AM Im sure she said  
Shes gonna get herself a gun  
I blacked out from three to five  
You should hear whats going on outside  
  
As the morning bread goes hard  
On the corner shop theyre waiting  
Just for rush hour to start  
And Im wondering why his kids are late  
I really should just get out more these days  
  
Days and each one shows  
Theres so much Ill never know  
If I dont ever get  
If I never get home home  
  
And old Ryans still his rust  
And Tuesday comes and goes  
Like any late night bus  
I could do a lot more with my time  
But you should hear whats going on outside
