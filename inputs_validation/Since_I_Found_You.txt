Theres a smile on the faces I see  
Since I found you  
Theres a laugh in the eye where a tear used to be  
Since I found you  
Theres a sound of a Memphis section playing on my radio  
And it sings of the reasons why I love you so  
Since I found you  
  
Theres a groove thats so smooth  
I can hardly tell whos in the studio  
And the girls on the street  
Sing out of tune so sweet  
I just have to go its all I need to know  
Since I found you I aint never going to give you up  
Since I found you you keep me looking up  
You keep me looking up  
You keep me looking up  
Turn it up
