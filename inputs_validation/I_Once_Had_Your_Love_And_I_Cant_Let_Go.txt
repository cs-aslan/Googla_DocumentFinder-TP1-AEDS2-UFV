Every day I think of you  
Cant believe its true that Im so into you  
That I dont know where Im goin  
I never felt this way before  
  
All I want to do is to love you baby  
Behind closed doors  
Ooh I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
Dont let go  
  
All of the good times that we shared  
Every days a holiday  
We could celebrate makin love together  
Ooh lets keep this fire burnin  
Every day is new girl  
When I think of you I get so excited  
Ooh you keep my whole world turnin  
  
I just had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
I once had your loving baby  
And I cant let go  
I once had your loving baby  
And I cant let go  
Dont let go  
All of the good times that we shared  
Cant let you go  
Cant let you go  
Cant let you go  
Cant let you go  
Girl I cant let you go  
  
Sure as Heaven above weve found love  
You and I can fly away  
Maybe to LA or some lovely island  
Take a stroll along the ocean  
Building castles in the sand  
Doin all the things we planned together  
Ooh I love you so much baby  
  
I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
Dont let go  
  
All of the good times that we shared  
I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
Cant let it go girl  
  
I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
Cant let it go no no  
  
Ooh I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go  
Cant let go  
I once had your lovin baby  
Cant let go  
I once had your lovin baby  
Cant let go  
I once had your lovin baby  
And I cant let go ooh
