Wheres my Peggy Sue  
I could use a Rosalita  
If theres a Long Tall Sally out there  
Im dyin to meet her  
  
Why cant I hear Beth callin me  
Why cant I be the one to make Sara smile  
I wish I was arm in arm with Jean genie  
Walkin down the aisle  
  
Oh yeah all right  
  
But I got no Mary Jane  
Theres no Sloopy or Dancin Queen  
Im just a fool in the rain  
Waitin on my Billie Jean  
  
I want an Angie a Mandy a CandyO  
A devil in a dress of blue  
A Rosanna Diana a sweet Caroline  
Id even take a RunAround Sue  
  
Oh yeah all right  
  
Well I never got to scream for a Layla  
I never saw MaryAnne walkin away  
I never danced on the sand with a Rio  
Or woke up with a Maggie May  
  
I dialed 8675309  
But there was no Jenny Jenny  
Oh why cant I get myself a browneyed girl  
When Willie Nelson loved so many  
  
And why does Jack have Diane  
And why does Billy Joe have Bobbie Sue  
And everybody had Roxanne  
Except youknowwho  
  
I want an Angie a Mandy a CandyO  
A devil in a dress of blue  
A Rosanna Diana a sweet Caroline  
Id even take a RunAround Sue  
  
Well Id take any ol Suzy Q  
I got no reason to be picky  
She can be a GoodyGoodyTwoShoes  
Or she can be my Darling Nikki  
  
Oh Brandy would be such a fine girl  
And so would the sweet Judy Blue  
I guess I sound just like that other fella  
Cause you know I wish I had Jessies girl too  
  
Oh yeah all right  
  
Well Id die for a kiss from Allison  
Even though I know shed break my heart  
Or give me a Lolololola  
Minus the extra part  
  
I want an Angie a Mandy a CandyO  
A devil in a dress of blue  
A Rosanna Diana a sweet Caroline  
Id even take a RunAround Sue  
  
You know Id even take a RunAround Sue  
Well Id even take a RunAround Sue  
  
Oh yeah all right
