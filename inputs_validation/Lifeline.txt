Changing her colours shes off to the shore  
She rides the soul train and he fight the law  
Theres a power in his voice and it makes her feel so sure  
So live and live in love  
One day hell build a statue with his hands  
So gentle when he tries to understand  
This subterfuge he never really planned  
Now youre living in the lifeline  
Were moving  
In the lifeline  
Were walking  
In the lifeline  
Were throwing  
So live and let live in love  
Exchanging their letters their exits begun  
With deathless precision hes aiming his gun  
A democracy of sorts that justifies the sun  
So live and let live in love  
Neither has the ghost of a chance  
Those decisions only can be made once  
You never really know just what youre giving  
Till youre living in the lifeline  
Were moving  
In the lifeline  
Were walking  
In the lifeline  
Were throwing  
He could have built a statue with his hands  
So gentle when he tries to understand  
You never really know just what youre giving  
Till youre living in the lifeline  
Were moving  
In the lifeline  
Were walking  
In the lifeline  
Were throwing to you  
But Im not living
