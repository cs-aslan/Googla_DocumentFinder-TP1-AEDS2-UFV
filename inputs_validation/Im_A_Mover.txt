I was born by the river just like this river  
Ive been moving ever since  
Aint got no body to call my own you know  
Ive been moving since the day I was born  
Life is a game just made for fun I dont need no body  
No I dont love no one  
Yes Im a mover baby  
Now get out of my way will ya  
Dont try to stop me now  
  
Following the footpath one fine day  
When I asked a wise man which was the way  
He said follow you heart and look for yourself  
And come back and tell me what you have learned  
Yes Im a mover  
  
Went back and told him Id found me a wife  
Eleven children and a real good life  
Told him Id left this happy home  
Cause I need to return to the long winding road  
Yes Im a mover
