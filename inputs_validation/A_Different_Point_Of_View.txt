When Im sitting so close to you  
Theres only one thing that I wanna do  
But I know what youre likely to say  
That Im going about it the wrong way  
  
We cant agree about anything  
Where to go or even where weve been  
And I know what youre likely to do  
Say that Ive never care about you  
  
And all I wanted to say was that I love you  
But you tell me now you dont believe its true  
You got a different a different  
A different point of view  
You got a different  
Point of view  
  
You dont believe a single word I say  
If Id say black was white youd say it was grey  
But in spite of been treated this way  
I still dream of you all night and day  
  
And all I wanted to say was that I love you  
But you tell me now you dont believe its true  
You got a different a different  
A different point of view  
You got a different  
Point of view  
  
Just this once  
Just say yes  
Please  
  
Youve got a clever way of haunting me  
Im never scared but youre still daunting me  
Cause I know what youre likely to say  
And I know that youll get your own way  
  
And all I wanted to say was that I love you  
But you tell me now you dont believe its true  
You got a different a different  
A different point of view  
You got a different  
Point of view  
  
You got a different a different  
A different point of view  
You got a different  
Point of view
