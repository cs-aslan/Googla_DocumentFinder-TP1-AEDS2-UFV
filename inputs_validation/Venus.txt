Tell me now and Ill understand  
Does Venus hold you in the palm of her hand  
Has her blackness touched your very heart  
Shell smile sweetly as your world falls apart  
  
Chorus  
And I just cant quit it babe  
I just cant stand the pain  
And I just cant quit it babe  
I keep running back again  
  
Little by little piece by piece  
Your defenses have all slipped away  
And real beautys such an elusive thing  
Somewhere down the line youll have to pay  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh no its such a cold cold feeling  
Cuts your body to the bone  
Oh no its a strange strange feeling  
Loves been abandoned and Im so alone  
  
And everyday I see my flame growing dimmer  
Ive nothing left but this very life to save  
And evrey night I feel that Im a winner  
Shes taking me down to the grave  
  
And everyday I see my flame growing dimmer  
I cant seem to chase the ghosts away  
And every night I get too high Im a winner  
Ive nothing left but to pray  
  
And every night she makes me feel like a winner  
And every night she makes me think Im a winner  
Venus smiles and encircles me  
And wraps me in a soft princely gown  
  
Waves of darkness rise like the sea  
In her addiction I will drown
