Bye bye baby  
Time to hit the road to dreamland  
Youre mine baby  
Dig you in the land of nod  
Hold tight baby  
Well be swinging up in dreamland  
All night baby  
Where the little cherubs trot  
Well look at that knocked out moon  
You been ablowing his top in the blue  
Never saw the likes of you  
Bye bye baby  
Time to hit the road to dreamland  
Dont cry baby  
It was divine but the rooster has finally crowed  
Time to hit the road  
  
Look at that knocked out moon  
He been ablowing his top in the blue  
Never saw the likes of you  
Bye bye baby  
Time to hit the road to dreamland  
Dont cry baby  
Well it was divine but the cuckoo has finally crowed  
Time to hit the road Time to hit the road  
Time to hit the road
