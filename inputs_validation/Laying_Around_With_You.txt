What I wouldnt give to wrestle over the remote control  
What I wouldnt give to hit you harder than you thought I could with the
pillow  
And we stop just for a second because you got a feather in your eye eye  
I get it out and you kiss me I smile and then we get back to our pillow fight  
Now that sounds like fun  
If the sky begins to fall we wouldnt even notice  
Really wouldnt bother us at all if the world came to an end  
Nothing matters but us two when Im laying around with you  
When Im laying around with you  
What I wouldnt give to  
Oh what I wouldnt give to cook you dinner from the microwave  
And what I wouldnt give to burn the popcorn and hear you tell me baby
thats okay  
Baby thats okay  
Then you leave to go to the store and its almost too much for me  
Though I know itll only be a minute  
Then you come back through the door with a bag of all the foods that were not
supposed to eat  
Now tonight that cant be beat  
If the sky begins to fall we wouldnt even notice  
Really wouldnt bother us at all if the world came to an end  
Nothing matters but us two when Im laying around with you  
When Im laying around with you  
What I wouldnt give to  
I want to be in your arms where no harm could ever come my way  
I want to be where you are oh near or far every night and day oh  
If the sky begins to fall we wouldnt even notice said I wouldnt notice  
Really wouldnt bother us at all if the world came to an end wouldnt bother
us  
Nothing matters but us two when Im laying around with you  
When Im laying around with you  
When Im laying around with you  
When Im laying around with you  
If the sky begins to fall we wouldnt even notice wouldnt notice  
Really wouldnt bother us at all if the world came to an end world came to an
end  
Nothing matters but us two when Im laying around with you  
Laying around with you  
When Im laying around with you  
Laying around with you  
Laying around with you  
What I wouldnt give to  
When Im laying around with you  
No no no when Im laying around with you
