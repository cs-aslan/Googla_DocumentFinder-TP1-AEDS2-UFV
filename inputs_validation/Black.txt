Hey oh  
Sheets of empty canvas  
Untouched sheets of clay  
Were laid spread out before me  
As her body once did  
All five horizons  
Revolved around her soul  
As the earth to the sun  
Now the air I tasted and breathed  
Has taken a turn  
  
Oh and all I taught her was everything  
Oh I know she gave me all that she wore  
And now my bitter hands  
Chafe beneath the clouds  
Of what was everything  
Oh the pictures have  
All been washed in black  
Tattooed everything  
I take a walk outside  
Im surrounded by  
Some kids at play  
I can feel their laughter  
So why do I sear  
Oh and twisted thoughts that spin  
Round my head  
Im spinning  
Oh Im spinning  
How quick the sun can drop away  
  
And now my bitter hands  
Cradle broken glass  
Of what was everything  
All the pictures had  
All been washed in black  
Tattooed everything  
All the love gone bad  
Turned my world to black  
Tattooed all I see  
All that I am  
All Ill be  
  
Yeah  
I know someday youll have a beautiful life  
I know youll be a star  
In somebody elses sky  
But why  
Why  
Why cant it be  
Why cant it be mine
