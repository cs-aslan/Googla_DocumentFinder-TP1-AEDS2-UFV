Open your eyes  
And turn off your mind  
Step right up folks  
And you will find  
A growing trend  
An epidemic  
Spread with zen  
And hypodermics yeah  
Yeah  
  
Just close your mind  
You can find all you need with your eyes  
  
The big machines take care of you  
Until you kill yourself and then  
The sales go through the roof  
Calculated formulated  
Feed my head with simple thoughts  
And let me breathe instead of being taught  
All bottled up and tearing at the seams  
Im bored just let me breathe  
  
A daily dose of eMpTyV  
Will flush your mind right down the drain  
Shannon Hoon and Kurt Cobain  
Make yourself a household name yeah  
Yeah  
  
Just close your mind  
You can find all you need with your eyes  
  
The big machines take care of you  
Until you kill yourself  
And then the sales go through the roof  
Calculated formulated  
Feed my head with simple thoughts  
And let me breathe instead of being taught  
All bottled up and tearing at the seams  
Im bored just let me breathe  
  
Strike up your best angst ridden posture whoa  
Manufactured anger  
Lets not forget my legacy  
All my heroes have failed me  
Now theyre dead and buried yeah  
  
Just close your mind  
You can find all you need with your eyes  
  
The big machines  
Will take care of you  
Until the fashion fades  
And the checks go through  
My bankrolls red  
And my face is blue  
And still theyll turn their backs on you  
For someone new  
Feed my head  
With some real thoughts  
And let me think instead  
Of being taught  
Ill say things  
You wont believe  
Just stand back  
Just let me breathe
