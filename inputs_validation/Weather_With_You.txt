Walking round the room singing Stormy Weather  
At fifty seven Mt Pleasant St  
Well its the same room but everythings different  
You can fight the sleep but not the dream  
  
Things aint cooking in my kitchen  
Strange affliction wash over me  
Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire  
Couldnt conquer the blue sky  
  
Everywhere you go  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go  
Always take the weather  
Everywhere you go  
You always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go  
Always take the weather the weather with you  
  
Well theres a small boat made of china  
Its going nowhere on the mantelpiece  
Well do I lie like a lounge room lizard  
Or do I sing like a bird released  
  
Everywhere you go  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go  
Always take the weather  
Everywhere you go  
You always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go  
Always take the weather the weather with you  
  
Everywhere you go everywhere you go  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go take the weather  
You always take the weather  
Everywhere you go everywhere  
You always take the weather with you  you go  
Everywhere you go  
You always take the weather you take the weather the weather with you  
  
Everywhere you go  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go  
You always take the weather  
Everywhere you go  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go  
You always take the weather take the weather the weather with you
