I love making love to you  
Duet by cher and greg allman  
  
Aw feels so fine every time  
Ooh I love making love to you  
Anywhere I dont care  
Oh I love making love to you  
  
Oh the fire in your eyes  
Makes my loving temperature rise  
And honey sweet ecstasy  
Ooh I love what youre doing to me  
Please dont stop  
Oh I think Im gonna lose control  
Honey dont stop  
I want you to fill me with your soul  
  
Chorus  
Cause theres no lightning and thunder  
Any seven wonder mightier  
Than what youve got  
Keep it up forever  
No one does it better baby  
Come and get it while its hot  
  
Oh give me more like before  
I love making love to you  
Makes me feel life is real  
Ooh I love making love to you  
Oh your heart touching mine  
Starts the beat of unnatural rhyme  
Such a sweet melody  
Oh I love what youve given to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Give me more like before  
Ooh I love making love to you  
Makes me feel life is real  
Ooh I love making love to you  
  
Chorus x3
