When you were born  
There in your mothers arms  
An angel told me always you will be  
A gift of love from God to me  
  
Though your road is long  
Ill be right by your side  
Through changes youll see always you will be  
A gift of love from God to me  
  
Love took flight the day you came into my life  
There is magic in the way I feel  
Hearts opened wide gazing into your eyes  
Ill be there for you  
As long as I am alive  
  
I have never loved  
More than I love you  
A gift for free always you will be  
A gift of love from God to me
