If I believe in paradise  
I swear I must be there  
I swear I must be there right now with you  
If I believe in miracles  
Id know that one was happening to me  
  
But I dont believe in paradise  
And miracles are not real  
Then someone tell me what is this I feel  
  
Chorus  
I wanna believe its love this time  
I wanna believe my hearts not telling me lies  
But with you I cant deny  
If I believe in paradise  
I swear  
Im there  
  
If I believe in magic spells  
It all would be so clear  
A magic spell must have brought you here  
If I can see the future  
Id see if you and I were meant to be  
  
But I dont know any magic  
And tomorrows just a dream  
Then something in this fantasy is real  
  
I wanna believe its love this time  
I wanna believe my hearts not telling me lies  
I wanna believe its love this time  
I wanna believe my hearts not telling me lies  
But with you I cant deny  
If I believe in paradise I swear  
Im there  
  
Im there  
I swear  
If I believe
