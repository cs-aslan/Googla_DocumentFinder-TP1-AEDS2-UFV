Ive got a sort of lowdown feeling a sickness that is hard to describe  
It aint no use to call a doctor cause the cure I know he couldnt prescribe  
Day by day Im gradually failin guess its just a matter of time  
Its started in my mind and infected my heart  
Baby when you said goodbye  
 piano   
I thought that I was slowly improvin when the tears began to dry  
Then I passed you on the corner and it took the rainbow out of my sky  
So baby wont you hear my pleadin your love would really pull me through  
It would heal my troubled mind leave these heartaches behind  
Cause youre the only cure for the blues  
 guitar   
I strolled beside that muddy Mississippi and as the evening sun sank low  
That naggin deep inside said jump boy but the longin in my heart said no  
I guess that Ill continue on a walking and maybe Lady Luck will come through  
Then contentment I will find in my troublesome mind  
Cause baby youre the cure for the blues  
Cause baby youre the cure for the blues
