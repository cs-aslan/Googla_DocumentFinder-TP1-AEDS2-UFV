Young and wired  
Set to explode in the heat  
You wont tire  
Cause baby was born with the beat  
Take you higher than youve ever known  
Then drive you down to your knees  
I pick you up when youve had enough  
You been burned baby lessons learned  
  
In and out of love  
Hear what Im sayin  
In and out of love  
Its the way that were playing  
In and out of love  
Too much is never enough  
Shes gonna get ya  
  
Running wild  
When me and my boys hit the streets  
Right on time  
Shes here to make my night complete  
Then Im long gone I got another show  
One more town one mile to go  
One endless night of fantasy  
Is all she left of her with me  
  
In and out of love  
Hear what Im sayin  
In and out of love  
Its the way that were playing  
In and out of love  
When were together  
In and out of love  
Its too much forever  
  
In and out of love  
Hear what Im saying  
In and out of love  
Its the way that were playing  
In and out of love  
Too much is never enough  
Shes gonna get you  
  
In and out of love
