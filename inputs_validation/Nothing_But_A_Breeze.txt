Life is just too short for some folks  
For other folks it just drags on  
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey  
Others figure teas too strong  
  
Well Im the type of guy who wants to ride the middle  
I dont like all this bouncing back and forth  
Me I want to live with my feet in Dixie  
And my head in the cool blue north  
  
In a small suburban garden  
Not a single neighbour knows our name  
I know the woman wishes we would move some place  
Where the houses arent all the same  
  
Jesse I wish you would take mewhere the grass is greener  
I couldnt really say where it may be  
Oh some place high on a montain top  
Bown by the deep blue sea  
  
And there well do just as we please  
It aint nothing but a breeze  
  
One day Ill be old gray Grandpa  
All the pretty girls will call me Sir  
Now where theyre asking me how things are  
Soon theyll ask me how things are  
  
Well I dont mind being an old gray Grandpa  
As long as youll be my gray Grandma  
But I wish we would move with our tea and cookies  
To the shade of the old pawpaw  
  
There well do just as we please  
It aint nothing but a breeze  
  
Life is just too short for some folks  
For other foks it just drags on  
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey  
Others figure teas too strong  
  
Well Im the type of guy who wants to ride in the middle  
I dont like all this bouncing back and forth  
Me I want to live with my feet in Dixie  
And my head in the cool blue north
