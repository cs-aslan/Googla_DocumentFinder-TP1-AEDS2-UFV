The Cliffs of Dooneen To Izabella and Tadeusz  
You may travel far from your own native home  
Far away oer the mountains far away oer the foam  
But of all the fine places that Ive ever been  
Theres none can compare with the cliffs of Dooneen  
Its a nice place to be on a fine summers day  
Watching all the wild flowers that neer do decay  
Oh the hare and the pheasant are plain to be seen  
Making homes for their young round the cliffs of Dooneen  
Take a view oer the mountain fine sites youll see there  
Yes in a high rocky mountain in the west coast of Clair  
Oh the towns of Kilkee and Kilrush can be seen  
From the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of Dooneen  
So fare thee well to Dooneen fare thee well for a while  
And althoug we are parted by the ragin sea wild  
Once again I will wander with my Irisjh colleen  
Round the high rocky slopes of the cliffs of Dooneen
