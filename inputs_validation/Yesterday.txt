Yesterday  
All my troubles seem so far away  
Now it looks as though theyre here to stay  
Oh I believe in yesterday  
  
Suddenly  
Im not half the man I used to be  
Theres a shadow hanging over me  
Oh yesterday came suddenly  
  
Why she had to go  
I dont know she wouldnt say  
I said something wrong  
Now I long for yesterday  
  
Chorus  
Yesterday  
Love was such an easy game to play  
Now I need a place to hide away  
Oh I believe in yesterday  
  
Why she had to go  
I dont know she wouldnt say  
I said something wrong  
Now I long for yesterday  
  
Chorus
