When I was young  
The sky was filled with stars  
I watched them burn out one by one  
Ive had my share  
Of disappointing love affairs  
And Im no stranger to disillusionment  
Little darlin  
If you need a helping hand  
If you need someone  
You can count on me  
And I will understand  
  
Chorus  
Heartache spoken here  
I know a thing or two about heartbreak and tears  
So come on down well talk about it  
Heartache spoken here  
Heartache spoken here  
I know a thing or two about heartbreak and tears  
So come on down well talk about it  
Heartache spoken here  
  
A house of cards  
A castle made of sand  
Dont take much to blow away  
Rows and rows  
Of broken hearts and broken homes  
So much sadness you see it every day  
Little darlin If you need a helping hand  
If you need someone  
You can count on me  
And I will understand  
  
Chorus  
  
I know it hurts so  
When the one you love dont need you  
I know the sorrow  
That a reckless heart can lead to  
  
Chorus
