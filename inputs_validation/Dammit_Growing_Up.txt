Its alright to tell me  
What you think about me  
I wont try to argue  
Or hold it against you  
I know that youre leaving  
You must have your reasons  
The season is calling  
And your pictures are falling down  
  
The steps that I retrace  
The sad look on your face  
The timing and structure  
Did you hear she fucked him  
A day late a buck short  
Im writing the report  
On losing and failing  
When I move Im flailing now  
  
And itll happen once again Ill turn to a friend  
Someone that understands  
Sees through the master plan  
  
But everybodys gone  
And Ive been here for too long  
To face this on my own  
Well I guess this is growing up  
  
Well I guess this is growing up  
  
And maybe Ill see you  
At a movie sneak preview  
Youll show up and walk there  
On the arm of that girl  
And Ill smile and youll wave  
Well pretend its okay  
The charade it wont last  
When shes gone I wont come back  
  
And itll happen once again Ill turn to a friend  
Someone that understands  
Sees through the master plan  
  
But everybodys gone  
And Ive been here for too long  
To face this on my own  
Well I guess this is growing up  
  
Well I guess this is growing up 4x  
Well I guess this is growing up
