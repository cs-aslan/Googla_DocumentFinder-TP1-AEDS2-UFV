I got my feet back on the ground  
We were headed for disaster  
Woke up I got ready for work  
You werent around  
I was fast but you were faster  
Such a night feeling right  
Nothing I could say  
Then you went away  
Have to know whyd you go  
Couldnt even beg you to stay  
  
Lyin in a sweat tryin to forget  
All of my lovin for you girl  
Lyin in a sweat tryin to forget  
All of my lovin for you girl  
  
Huntress you compell me with your eyes  
Its my heart that youre enslaving  
Serpent dance  
You really hypnotize  
To the lions den is the road for me youre paving  
In a trance saw you dance  
And you made romance to me  
Dont take it away  
Took a chance circumstance  
And it wasnt hard to see  
  
Lyin in a sweat tryin to forget  
All of my lovin for you girl  
Lyin in a sweat tryin to forget  
All of my lovin for you girl  
  
Youre the one that made me feel this way  
So alone without your smile  
You took my heart  
Left my soul to pay  
Just to watch me crawl on another smile  
  
Lyin in a sweat tryin to forget  
All of my lovin for you girl  
Lyin in a sweat tryin to forget  
All of my lovin for you girl
