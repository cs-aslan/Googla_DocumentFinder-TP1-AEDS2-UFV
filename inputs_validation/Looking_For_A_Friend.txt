Gather round all you people  
Watch me while you can  
Been trawling too long Ive been losing out strong  
For the strength of another man  
  
Ive been hasty wasty standing on the backstep  
Waiting for the phone to ring  
But this semiacoustic love affair  
Is driving me to the brink  
  
Im just looking for a friend  
Im just looking for a friend  
You dont have to be a big wheel you dont have to be the end  
Im just looking for looking for a friend  
  
God help all you ladies  
May the devil take all you men  
Youre far too busy having babies  
To help yourselves to a friend  
  
Youre lazy crazy hung upon the insane  
Waiting for the phone to ring  
Incomprehensible  
Incomprehensible the wall  
  
Im just looking for a friend  
Im just looking for a friend  
You dont have to be a big wheel you dont have to be the end  
Im just looking for looking for a friend looking  
  
Im just looking for a friend  
Im just looking for a friend  
You dont have to be a big wheel you dont have to be the end  
Im just looking for looking for a friend  
  
Im just looking for a friend  
Im just looking for a friend  
You dont have to be a big wheel you dont have to be the end  
Im just looking for looking for a friend
