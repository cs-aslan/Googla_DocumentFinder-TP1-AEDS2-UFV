Is it true today that when people pray  
Cloudless skies will break  
Kings and queens will shake  
Yes its true and I believe it  
Im living for you  
  
Is it true today that when people pray  
Well see dead men rise  
And the blind set free  
Yes its true and I believe it  
Im living for you  
  
Im gonna be a history maker in this land  
Im gonna be a speaker of truth to all mankind  
  
Im gonna stand Im gonna run  
Into your arms into your arms again  
Into your arms into your arms again  
  
Well its true today that when people stand  
With the fire of God and the truth in hand  
Well see miracles well see angels sing  
Well see broken hearts making history  
Yes its true and I believe it  
Were living for you
