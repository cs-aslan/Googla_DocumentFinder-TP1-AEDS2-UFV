Theres no method in my madness no craft no guile  
No expertise no self assuring smile  
No wizardry or witchcraft no crass deceit  
No dark conspiracies I stand on my own two feet  
Im coming through just like jack ruby  
  
I ragged around the edges but I got control  
Theres no way around it and I got control  
I reach out for my program still got control  
Straight down to business who needs control  
Ive got panache just like jack ruby  
  
I dont beg forgiveness I dont beg at all  
But I beg to differ cause I got the ball  
There was no invitation youre not my type  
And whats gone it aint worth having kiss it all goodbye  
Right on the money just like jack ruby
