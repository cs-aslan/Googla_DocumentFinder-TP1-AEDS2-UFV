As merry as the days were long  
I was right and you were wrong  
  
Back at the old grey school  
I would win and you would lose  
  
But youve got everything now  
Youve got everything now  
And what a terrible mess Ive made of my life  
Oh what a mess Ive made of my life  
  
No Ive never had a job  
Because Ive never wanted one  
  
Ive seen you smile  
But Ive never really heard you laugh  
  
So who is rich and who is poor  
I cannot sayoh  
  
You are your mothers only son  
And youre a desperate one  
Oh  
  
But I dont want a lover  
I just want to be seenohin the back of your car  
  
A friendship sadly lost  
Well this is trueand yet its false  
Oh  
  
But did I ever tell you by the way  
I never did like your face  
  
But youve got everything now  
Youve got everything now  
And what a terrible mess Ive made of my life  
Oh what a mess Ive made of my life  
  
No Ive never had a job  
Because Im too shy  
  
Ive seen you smile  
But Ive never really heard you laugh  
  
So who is rich and who is poor   
I cannot sayoh  
  
Oh  
You are your mothers only son  
And youre a desperate one  
Oh  
  
But I dont want a lover  
I just want to be tied ohto the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
Oh
