Ten fingers we have each  
Nine planets around the sun repeat  
Eight ball is the last if you triumphant be  
Seven oceans pummel the shores of the sea  
Its a typical situation  
In the typical times  
Too many choices  
Everybodys happy  
Everybodys free  
Well keep the big door open  
Everyonell come around  
Why are you different  
Why are you that way  
If you dont get in line  
Well lock you away  
It all comes down to nothing  
Six senses feeling  
Five around a sense of self  
Four season turn on and turn off  
I can see  
Three corners from this corner  
Two is a perfect number  
But one  
Everybodys happy  
Everybodys free  
Well keep the big door open  
And everyonell come around  
Why are you different  
Why are you that way  
If you dont step in line  
Well lock you away  
Its a typical situation  
In these typical times  
We cant do thing about it
