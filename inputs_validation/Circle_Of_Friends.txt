We were made to love and be loved  
But the price this world demands will cost you far too much  
I spent so many lonely years just trying to fit in  
Now Ive found a place in this circle of friends  
In a circle of friends we have one Father  
In a circle of friends we share this prayer  
That every orphaned soul will know  
And all will enter in  
To the shelter of this circle of friends  
If you weep I will weep with you  
If you sing for joy the rest of us will lift our voices too  
But no matter what you feel inside theres no need to pretend  
Thats the way it is in this circle of friends  
In a circle of friends  
We have one father  
In a circle of friends we share this prayer  
That well gather together no matter how the highway bends  
I will not lose this circle of friends  
Among the nations tribes and tongues we have sisters and brothers  
And when we meet in heaven we will recognize each other  
With joy so deep and love so sweet  
Oh well celebrate these friends  
And a life that never ends  
In a prayer  
That will not be long before  
All will enter in  
To the shelter of this circle of friends  
That it will not be long before  
All will enter in  
To the shelter of this circle of friends
