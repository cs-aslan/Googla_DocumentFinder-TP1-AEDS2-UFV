He was walking with your brother on the streets of alabama  
He was marching next to martin when he died  
Working face to face in cuba and managua nicaragua  
He did not yet beat the devil but he tried  
Chorus  
Hold on brother jesse jackson  
Theres a better world acoming  
Where a man can hope a man will show some heart  
You just keep right on believing  
In the better side of human  
They aint ready for it yet but its a start  
And you moveem when you hitem in the heart  
We must bring it all together we must start right from the bottom  
Back to helping one another when we can  
cause if hes hungry and hes human and hes fighting for his freedom  
Then he shouldnt be too hard to understand  
Chorus  
Hold on brother jesse jackson  
Theres a better world acoming  
Where a man can hope a man will show some heart  
You just keep right on believing  
In the better side of human  
They aint ready for you yet but its a start  
And you moveem when you hitem in the heart  
Chorus  
Hold on brother jesse jackson  
Theres a better world acoming  
Where a man can hope a man will show some heart  
You just keep right on believing  
In the better side of human  
They aint ready for you yet but its a start  
And you moveem when you hitem in the heart
