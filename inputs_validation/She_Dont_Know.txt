Only a memory this morning  
My baby up and walked away  
In my heart the tears keep pouring  
She left with so much more to say  
  
Chorus  
She dont know whose heart shes breaking  
She dont know my dream lies still  
She dont know how much shes taking  
She dont know and never will  
  
I cant sleep Ive gotta find her  
Ive got to make her understand  
Although another love may bind her  
No one can love her like I can  
  
Chorus x2  
  
She dont know she dont know  
She dont know she dont know  
She dont know she dont know
