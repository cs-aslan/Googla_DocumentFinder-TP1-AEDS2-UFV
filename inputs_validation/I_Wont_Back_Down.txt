No I wont back down  
No I wont back down  
You can stand me up at the gates of Hell but I wont back down  
  
I will stand my ground wont be turned around  
I will keep my world from draggin me down I wont back down  
No I wont back down  
  
Hey baby there aint no easy way out  
Hey I will stand my ground  
No I wont back down  
  
Oh I know whats right I got just one life  
I will keep this world from pushin me around Ill stand my ground  
No I wont back down  
  
Hey baby there aint no easy way out  
Hey I will stand my ground  
Hey I will stand my ground  
And I wont back down  
  
And I wont back down no I wont back down
