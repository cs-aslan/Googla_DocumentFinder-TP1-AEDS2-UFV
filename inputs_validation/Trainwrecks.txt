We sleep all day and rock the night  
We just get up to start another fight  
We kiss and then we bite  
We are Trainwrecks  
  
You dont keep passing up a slob  
Get freaky now cause I cant keep a job  
We dont update our blogs  
We are Trainwrecks  
  
People love to tell us what to do  
Thats just cause theyre jealous of me and you  
  
Were digging through the couch for cash  
Were taking cabs cause both our cars are trashed  
But were still kicking ass  
We are Trainwrecks  
  
We think its uncool to be on time  
Mooching off our friends is not a federal crime  
  
Someday well cut our critics down to size  
And crash a Diddy party in disguise  
We fall but then we rise  
We are Trainwrecks  
Trainwrecks  
  
Thats the story of our lives  
We are Trainwrecks
