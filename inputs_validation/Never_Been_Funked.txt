Never Been Funked  
I aint trying to make no political statement  
I aint trying to tell you the news of the world  
I aint one to give intellectual realness  
I just want you to want me the way that I do  
  
Dont it make you feel good make you feel good  
Dont it make you feel good  
  
Chorus  
You aint never been funked like this before  
Never been funked never been funked  
You aint never been funked like this before  
  
I dont keep in touch with economical worries  
My interest dont lie in that same old story  
Communicating was never my problem  
I never have to talk to get through to you  
Talktalk  
  
Do you really want to funk with me  
Do you really want to funk with me
