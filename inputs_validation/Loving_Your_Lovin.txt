We dont need the aggravation  
Honey dont need the pain  
Even though youre nearing starvation  
Well its all the same  
  
What can I say now  
What can I possibly do  
To prove to you honey  
Im in love with you  
Im in love with you  
  
Im in love with your loving now lover  
Im in love with your loving now lover  
  
Love thats lost and love that is found  
Natural love thats true  
I need a love that is safe and sound  
Just like you  
  
Who needs the trouble now  
Who got the time  
No doubt about it  
It aint yours  
And it sure aint mine  
  
Chorus  
Wholl do the walking when its time to leave  
Wholl move the car from the street  
Wholl break your heart in a moments time  
You cant believe in me  
If you cant believe in me  
  
Chorus x3
