Come with me come with me  
And we shall run across the sky  
We illuminate the night  
Ohhhh I I will try and guide you  
To better times and brighter days  
Just dont be afraid  
  
Come on up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can see heaven much better  
Lets go up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can be closer to heaven  
  
Stay with me stay with me  
And we shall let expression sing  
Hear freedom ringin  
Ohhh memories of yesterdays broken dreams  
Hey dont you know dont you know  
That they are gonna fade away  
Dont be afraid  
  
Come on up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can see heaven much better  
Lets go up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can be closer to heaven  
  
Well laugh Ill tell you the story of love  
How it is the happiness in it baby  
We combine these thoughts and together we will travel  
To the fountain of lovingness  
I will never never never never  
Never leave you baby  
As we grow older and older and older babe  
  
Standing strong well say  
Say dont you wanna go  
Say dont you wanna go  
Say dont you wanna go  
Say dont you wanna go  
Say dont you wanna go  
Say dont you wanna go  
Say dont you wanna go  
Say dont you wanna go  
  
Up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can see heaven much better  
Lets go up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can be closer to heaven  
  
Lets go up the up the up the ladder to heaven  
Heaven heaven heaven heaven
