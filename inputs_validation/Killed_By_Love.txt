Ive got more to lose more to lose than you  
Cause Im the only one in love between us too  
I know that Ive been struck by lightning from above  
Cause Ive been killed by love  
  
I got a longer fall a longer fall to take  
Cause Im a bigger fool with a bigger heart to break  
You pushed me way to far a push became a shove  
And I was killed by love  
  
Drop me off in a crowded lonely city  
Everybody there was crying  
Drop me off in a town without pity  
And let me be the one thats dying  
  
Killed by love  
Killed by love  
Killed by love  
Oh bye bye love  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
  
Killed by love killed by love  
Killed by love killed by love  
Killed by love killed by love  
Oh bye bye love oh bye bye  
  
Killed by love oh yeah  
Killed by love Im thinking fast baby  
Killed by love you know youre killing me baby  
Baby baby  
Oh bye bye love
