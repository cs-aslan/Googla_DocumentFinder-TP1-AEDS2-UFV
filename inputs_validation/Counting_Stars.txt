Lately Ive been Ive been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
But baby Ive been Ive been prayin hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
Well be counting stars  
Yeah well be counting stars  
  
I see this life  
Like a swinging vine  
Swing my heart across the line  
In my faces flashing signs  
Seek it out and ye shall find  
  
Old but Im not that old  
Young but Im not that bold  
And I dont think the world is sold  
Im just doing what were told  
  
I feel something so right  
Doing the wrong thing  
I feel something so wrong  
Doing the right thing  
I could lie could lie could lie  
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive  
  
Lately Ive been Ive been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
Baby Ive been Ive been prayin hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
Well be counting stars  
  
Lately Ive been Ive been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
But baby Ive been Ive been prayin hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
Well be well be counting stars  
  
I feel the love  
And I feel it burn  
Down this river every turn  
Hope is a four letter word  
Make that money  
Watch it burn  
Old but Im not that old  
Young but Im not that bold  
And I dont think the world is sold  
Im just doing what were told  
I feel something so wrong  
Doing the right thing  
I could lie could lie could lie  
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
