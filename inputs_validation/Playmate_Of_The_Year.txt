Theres this girl I dont know  
Comes by every year or so  
And if I get the mail before my mom  
Then I will stay out of trouble  
  
Shell change every year  
Even pretty without beer  
She doesnt care about my hair  
My car my tiny peepee  
In the mirror  
  
Who yeah  
Shes finally here  
Who yeah  
Comes one time a year  
Who yeah  
Shes finally here  
Who yeah  
My Playmate of the Year  
  
Chorus  
She moves me  
She makes me grow  
Im so happy and boy does it show  
Now shes going to my head  
Going to my head to my head  
Im going to make this milky clear  
Youre my Playmate of the Year  
  
Hello how are you  
Its great to see you too  
Lets grab a sock  
Its time to rock  
And afterwords  
You never want to talk  
  
We always agree  
Whos in charge here is me  
We never fight  
You know Im right  
Its always straight between you and me  
  
Let me go down on this girl for a day  
We can play spin the bottle  
Everyone can hear her say  
That I was the best that shes ever had  
She could be my Playmate  
And she could call me Dad  
  
Who yeah  
Shes finally here  
Who yeah  
She comes one time a year  
Who yeah  
Shes finally here  
Who yeah  
My Playmate of the Year  
  
Chorus  
  
Who yeah  
Shes finally here  
Who yeah  
My Playmate of the Year  
  
Chorus  
  
She moves me  
She makes me grow  
Im so happy and boy does it show  
Now shes going to my head  
Going to my head to my head  
Im going to make this milky clear  
Youre my Playmate of the Year  
Playmate of the Year  
Playmate of the Year
