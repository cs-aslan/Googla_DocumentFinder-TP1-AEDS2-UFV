Ive been watching my tv  
Its got a hundred different stations  
They all look the same to me  
Now Im ready for a new sensation  
  
Im getting ready for the big time  
Someday Im going to be in big time news  
Dont have to take it when youre big time  
Someday youll call me Mr Big Time too  
  
In the big reclining chair  
With a cold six pack of beer  
Youve got a front row seat  
Lean back and put up youre feet  
Man the future is looking bright from here  
  
Im getting ready for the big time  
Someday Im going to be in big time news  
I can taste it Ill be prime time  
Someday Im going to be in big time news  
Dont have to take it when youre big time  
Someday youll call me Mr Big Time too  
  
Im getting ready for the big time  
Someday Im going to be in big time news  
Aint going to waste it when Im big time  
Ill be ready for it bing bang boom  
I can taste it Ill be prime time  
Someday Im going to be in big time news  
Dont have to take it when youre big time  
Someday youll call me Mr Big Time too
