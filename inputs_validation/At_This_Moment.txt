What did you think  
I would do At This Moment  
When youre standing before me  
With tears in your eyes  
Trying to tell me that you  
Have found you another  
And you just dont love me no more  
  
What did you think  
I would say At This Moment  
When Im faced with the knowledge  
That you just dont love me  
Did you think I would curse you  
Or say things to hurt you  
Cause you just dont love me no more  
  
Did you think I could hate you  
Or raise my hands to you  
Now come on you know me too well  
How could I hurt you  
When Darlin I love you  
And you know Id never never hurt you  
  
What do you think  
I would give At This Moment  
If youd stay Id subtract  
Twenty years from my life  
Id fall down on my knees  
Kiss the ground that you walk on  
If I could just hold you again
