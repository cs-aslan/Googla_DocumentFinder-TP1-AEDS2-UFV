Oh woman get your head out of curlers   
Time to get your butt out of bed   
Get down your hats and your baggage my child  
  
Going back home getting back to the homestead  
Im gonna heat me some water  
  
Put a shine upon my shoes  
Telephone my mac keep the room above Joes  
Cause were coming back  
Coming back to the homestead  
Evrything is packed gettin back to the homestead this time  
This time well stay  
Baby  
  
I know that we could have made it  
We had ideas in our heads  
And I wish somehow we could have saved it  
  
But were gasoline alley bred  
Yet the years havent really been wasted  
  
And I know it in my head  
We did good for the life that we tasted  
Cause were gasoline alley  
Gasoline alley bred  
  
Woman did you really believe it  
  
I did evrything a man could do  
Breakin my back just to make us a dime  
That dont mean a thing when no one wants to know you  
Ive seen the hurt upon your face  
How many times do you think that Ive cried  
  
Knowin evry day your heart was gettin broken  
  
Holdin back your pride till you were nearly chocking  
Oh  
Lets get away  
Baby
