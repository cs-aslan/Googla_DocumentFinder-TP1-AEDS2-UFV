Life never seems to get you down  
You always seem so full of fun  
Never feel alone  
Dont need anyone  
I always have to think of you  
I need to know how much you care  
Wonder where you are  
I always need you here  
Dont say you care  
If you are going to hurt me  
Dont tell me lies  
Cause I can see theyre not true  
Dont say youll stay  
If you are going to leave me  
Dont speak of love  
Cause you know Ill always love you  
You think Id make your life my own  
You think Id stop you being free  
Try to tie you down  
And make you stay with me  
I only want you as you are  
Id never stop you being you  
Dont want you to change  
All I want is you  
Dont say you care  
If you are going to hurt me  
Dont tell me lies  
Cause I can see theyre not true  
Dont say youll stay if you  
If you are going to leave me  
Dont speak of love  
Cause I know Ill always love you  
Dont say youll care  
If you are going to hurt me
