I pulled out my Stage Coach Times  
And I read the latest news  
I tapped my feet in dumb surprise  
And of course I saw they knew  
  
The Pinkertons pulled out my bags  
And asked me for my name  
I stuttered out my answer  
And hung my head in shame  
  
Now theyve found me  
At last theyve found me  
Its hard to run  
From a starving family  
  
Now theyve found me  
Well I wont run  
Im tired of hearing  
There goes a wellknown gun  
  
Now Ive seen this chain gang  
Lord I say let me see my priest  
I couldnt have faced your desert sand  
Old burning brown backed beast  
  
The poor house they hit me for my kin  
And claimed my crumbling walls  
Now I know how Reno felt  
When he ran from the law  
  
Now theyve found me  
At last theyve found me  
Its hard to run  
From a starving family  
  
Now theyve found me  
Well I wont run  
Im tired of hearing  
There goes a wellknown gun  
  
Now theyve found me  
Lord I say at last theyve found me  
Its hard to run  
From a starving family  
  
Lord I say now theyve found me  
Well I wont run  
Im tired of hearing  
There goes a wellknown gun  
  
Lord I say now theyve found me  
At last theyve found me  
Its hard to run  
From a starving family  
  
Now theyve found me  
I wont run  
Im tired of hearing  
There goes a wellknown gun
