In The Deep Dark Bowls of the  
Underworld order must be maintained  
Without a strict and unforgiving  
Chain of command chaos is inevitable  
  
Whats up youngsta since your the new booty  
And dont know nothin I gotta show ya bout  
The peckin order  
Its the order in how we do  
Things and move things  
See somebody gonna  
Tell you what to do after I tell that  
Motherfucker what to do  
  
Its the peckin order echo  
Its the peckin order echo  
  
We got the power to make you niggas sour  
Big fish whale like itchy cower  
Steppin out the shower its the peckin order  
Ax ya daughter how we peck inspect  
High class ass the projects  
Push my Lex to the California range  
Southern lane  
Infamous skeems is on the brain for my connect game  
Put a strain on every leak and I chain thats right

Take a svornnotes to make a see notes  
Doin all tha howdy bullshit floats and niggas dont  
Some niggas dont gangsta paradise say nothin nice  
Yeah we livin so tight we need Jesus in our lives  
  
Its the peckin order  
Its the order how we do things and move things  
Only fuck wit the true things  
  
Havin heavy in the course whit the world of depression  
Messin wit the wrong bitches never learn our lesson  
Stressin no guessin never question even when we playin  
We testin confession  
Do you still want to meet wit the killers  
Hold accountable for anything you repeat  
Its the peckin order ask your daughter how we peck  
When we smoke you its your best friend we suspect  
  
Its the peckin order  
Its the order how we do things and move things  
Only fuck wit the true things

All that cryin and beggin and shit  
To be honest whit you that shit really dont even

Where your people can see you and kiss on you

And I will blow noodles out you motherfuckin head  
And none of that happens after that
