You just stood there screaming  
Fearing no one was listening to you  
They say the empty can rattles the most  
The sound of your voice must soothe you  
Hearing only what you want to hear  
And knowing only what youve heard  
You youre smothered in tragedy  
Youre out to save the world  
  
Misery  
You insist that the weight of the world  
Should be on your shoulders  
Misery  
Theres much more to life than what you see  
My friend of misery  
  
You still stood there screaming  
No one caring about these words you tell  
My friend before your voice is gone  
One mans fun is anothers hell  
These times are sent to try mens souls  
But somethings wrong with all you see  
You youll take it on all yourself  
Remember misery loves company  
  
Misery  
You insist that the weight of the world  
Should be on your shoulders  
Misery  
Theres much more to life than what you see  
My friend of misery  
You just stood there creaming  
My friend of misery
