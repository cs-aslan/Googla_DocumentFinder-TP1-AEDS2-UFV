Its been seven years down the road  
I got no more tears in me left to flow  
When I did my baby wrong  
She left me lonely for so long  
Now Im out here all alone  
Lord wont you please bring my baby home  
  
Chorus x 2  
Lord wont you pleasebring my baby home  
Lord wont you please bring my baby home  
  
It go one for the treble  
Two for the bass  
Used to mess with this girl  
Way back in the day  
  
She was from the pjs  
And she went both ways  
Yeah the girl was a freak  
I used to call her monique  
  
And before I even speak  
About knockin the boots  
I say her name been changed to avoid lawsuits  
So now we gettin down to the nitty of the gritty  
  
She brought her friend around  
And damn she was pretty  
Betty was twisted  
She said her number was listed  
  
They grabbed my love two fisted  
Hugged it and kissed it  
They say one in the hand  
Is worth two in the bush  
  
But when shove came to push  
Yo I had my own theories  
World series of love  
Its two on one  
  
Til I got caught with the smokin gun  
His wife came home  
And she bursted in  
Now Im lookin for my heart  
  
Like Im made from tin  
The road that I travel  
Aint got yellow bricks  
My old woman jinxed  
  
That all men are pricks  
And she flipped the script  
Shes puttin lip to lip  
And every time I think about it I just lose my grip  
  
cause Ive been up  
And Ive been down  
And Ive been fast  
And Ive been slow  
And Ive been square  
And Ive been round  
And Ive been high  
And Ive been low  
And Ive been cool  
And Ive been calm  
And Ive been kind  
And Ive been crass  
  
I held the whole world right in my palm  
I tried to spread it around  
But it sure went fast  
  
Chorus  
  
Seven years sure have flown by  
I got no more tears and they are left to cry  
When I did my sugar bad  
I lost the best thing I ever had  
And now Im out here on my own  
Lord wont you please bring my baby home  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Bring my baby home
