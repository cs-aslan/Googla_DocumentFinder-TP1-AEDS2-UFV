I know what youre thinking  
But Im not your property  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you say  
  
Move along theres nothing left to see  
Just a body nothing left to see  
  
A couple more for breakfast  
A little more for tea  
Just to take the edge off  
Just to take the edge off  
  
Move along theres nothing left to see  
Just a body pouring down the street  
  
Move along theres nothing left to see  
Just a body nothing left to see  
  
Move along
