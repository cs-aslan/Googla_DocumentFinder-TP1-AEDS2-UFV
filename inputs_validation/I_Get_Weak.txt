My love my heart  
Oh bruised and broken all alone when were apart  
I die inside  
Oh this room is like a battlefield of love tonight  
I know I should be stronger but I lose all control  
Fighting with myself tryna hide what you dont know  
  
But I get weak  
Im giving it all away  
I know its not wise to leave myself so opened but  
All the rules get broken in your eyes  
I give it all up to you  
And everything thats been keeping me together  
Brings me to my knees  
I get weak  
  
One look one touch  
Oh Im helplessly pretending you dont mean that much  
It gets so hard  
The waiting here forever with this shattered heart  
Lying to myself tryna act like I dont care no  
The way its killing me every time that youre not there  
  
Cause I get weak  
Im giving it all away  
I know its not wise to leave myself so opened but  
All the rules get broken in your eyes  
I give it all up to you  
And everything thats been keeping me together  
Brings me to my knees  
I get weak  
  
I get weak  
And all the walls Ive been building up  
Just crack and then break when youre around  
I get weak  
And nothing I do to fight it matters now  
  
I get weak  
Im giving it all away  
I know its not wise to leave myself so opened but  
All the rules get broken in your eyes  
I give it all up to you  
And everything thats been keeping me together  
Brings me to my knees  
  
I get weak oh  
I get weak oh  
I get weak oh  
  
All the rules get broken in your eyes  
I give it all up to you  
And everything thats been keeping me together  
Brings me to my knees
