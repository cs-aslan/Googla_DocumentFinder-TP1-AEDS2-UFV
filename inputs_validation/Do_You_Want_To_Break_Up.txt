Chorus  
Yea oh yea yea  
Do you want to breakup  
  
Ive got a heavy heart  
Got heart filled full of lead  
Pocket full of heartache  
car crash in my head  
Ive got a steady hand  
Gonna lead me to my home  
Take me up to heaven  
heavens where Im goin  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive seen trouble  
I looked right up to its face  
Never tried to turn away  
And Ive been sad  
Ive been overjoyed  
So let me disembrace you now  
My little trouble boy  
  
Chorus  
  
You took me to the ocean  
Dropped me like a stone  
Took me to the deep blue ocean  
I dont wanna stay there baby  
I dont wanna swim alone  
  
Chorus
