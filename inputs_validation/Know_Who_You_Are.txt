Know who you are  
Theres a world wants to know you  
Know where to go  
Theres a world wants to touch you  
  
Feel all you can  
Let your heart speak and guide you  
Dont be afraid  
Of the love deep inside you  
  
Bring it out for everyone  
When you smile we can see the sun  
Bring it out for all to hear  
Because you have so much to give  
  
And theres so much to know  
But if you wait for your moment  
Well it may never show  
  
Know who you are  
There a new song inside you  
Weep if you can  
Let the tears fall behind you  
  
Bring it out for everyone  
When you smile we can see the sun  
Sing it out for all to hear  
Because you have so much to say  
  
And you have so much to do  
And everyones waiting  
Yes its all up to you  
  
Know who you are  
Theres a world deep inside ou  
Trust if you can  
Theres a friend the to guide you
