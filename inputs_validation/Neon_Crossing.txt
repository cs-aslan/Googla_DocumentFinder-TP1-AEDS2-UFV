All you people can feel it waiting  
Innocence and love wrapped in the arms of the burning neon  
I feel it I feel it  
Its so entertaining and so wonderful  
It magically calls for you  
Big neon crossing show me the way  
Save my soul today  
Dont you worry and dont be afraid  
Does it send you to the world appealing  
Where there is spoken word that I cant take  
So Im the liar Im the liar  
Youd be so disappointed  
To find out that the magic was not  
Really meant for you
