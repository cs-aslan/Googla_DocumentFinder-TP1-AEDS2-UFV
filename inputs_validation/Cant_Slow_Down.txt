I know whats on your mind  
You feel youre wasting time  
want to talk about it  
You feel theres something wrong  
Dont feel like holding on  
You better think about it  
You say you jest cant see  
Dont lay that hurt on me  
What Im trying baby  
Got something on my mind  
Something Ive got to find  
Im on the move baby  
  
Chorus  
You see I cant slow down  
Got to keep movin baby cant slow down  
No I cant slow down  
Oh cant slow down  
Got to keep movin on oh baby

Trying to get things done  
Can you hear me baby  
You think my loves nowhere  
You think I just dont care  
Are you kidding baby  
Dont make me play no games  
Too hard to just stay sane  
You know that time wont wait  
Why should I hesitate  
Got to do it baby  
  
You see I cant slow down  
I got to keep movin baby cant slow down  
No I cant slow down  
Cant stop baby no cant slow down
