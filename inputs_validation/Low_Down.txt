Wont you give me the low down  
Just as quick as you can  
Baby Ive been out of touch  
Just give me the scam  
  
Dont give me the sports page baby  
No political news  
Dont you give me the gossip  
Just give me the truth  
Just between me and you  
  
Give me the low down  
If you can  
Dont want a show down  
I just want to know where I stand  
Dont read me the horoscope babe  
That aint what I need  
Our future will never last  
But thats between you and me  
  
I dont want the movie section  
Ill see for myself  
I dont want the news that fits  
Shove it back on the shelf  
  
Give me the truth  
Just between me and you  
  
Give me the low down  
If you can  
I dont want a show down  
I just want to know where I stand  
  
The headlines are screaming  
They change everyday  
As long as I aint in them  
Im happy that way  
  
I know that you wont lie to me  
But you hold back the truth  
Please give me the low down  
I can only get it from you  
  
Give me the truth  
Just between me and you  
  
Give me the low down  
If you can  
Dont want a show down  
I just want to know where I stand  
  
Give me the low down  
As quick as you can  
I dont want to hear about it  
I want it straight from you  
  
Give me the truth
