Put geronimo in jail down south  
Where he couldnt look  
A gift horse in the mouth  
Took old geronimo by storm  
Ripped off the feathers from his uniform  
Chorus  
Oh boys take me back  
I wanna ride in geronimos cadillac  
Oh boys take me back  
I wanna ride in geronimos cadillac  
Sergeant sergeant oh dont you feel  
Theres something wrong with your automobile  
Warden warden oh listen to me  
Be brave and set geronimo free  
Governor governor oh isnt it strange  
You never seen a car on the indian range  
chorus  
People people oh dont you know  
The indians got no place to go  
Jesus told me and I believe its true  
The red mans in the sunset too  
Took our land now they wont give it back  
They sent geronimo a cadillac  
chorus
