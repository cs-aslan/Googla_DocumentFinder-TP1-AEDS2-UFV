Theres a stormy vision  
Stars before my eyes  
I seem to have this fear of the dark  
That only love defies  
And Im walkin as if in a trance  
And Im talkin like a man possessed  
Makes me wonder if Ill ever get straight  
When you snap your fingers and change my fate baby  
Love gets its way and honey I must obey  
Im under the spell  
So tough to clear out my head  
Comin down from a night of passion  
I blacked out the moment I felt  
This could only be love  
Im under the spell  
A physical reaction the doctors all agree  
Disillusions all in my head  
Its so real to me  
And Im walkin as if in a trance  
And Im talkin like a man possessed  
Makes me wonder if Ill ever get straight  
When you snap my fingers and change my fate baby  
Youll get your way  cause honey  I must obey  
  
Im under the spell  
So tough to clear out my head  
Comin down from a night of passion  
I blacked out the moment I felt  
This could only be love  
Im under the spell  
Starstruck  I stare into space  
I see the flash  then I hear the thunder  
So shocked  Im merely a shell  
Its stranger than love   
Im under the spell  
  
Fools fall in love under the moonlight  
Count me as one  under the spell
