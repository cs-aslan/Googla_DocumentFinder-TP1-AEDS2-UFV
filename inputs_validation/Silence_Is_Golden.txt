Oh dont it hurt deep inside  
To see someone do something to her  
Oh dont it pain to see someone cry  
How especially if that someone is her  
  
Silence is golden but my eyes still see  
Silence is golden golden but my eyes still see  
  
Talking is cheap people follow like sheep  
Even though there is no where to go  
How could she tell he deceived her so well  
Pity shell be the last one to know  
  
How many times will she fall for his lines  
Should I tell her or should I be cool  
And if I tried I know shed say I lied  
Mind your business dont hurt her you fool  
  
Silence is golden but my eyes still see  
Silence is golden golden but my eyes still see
