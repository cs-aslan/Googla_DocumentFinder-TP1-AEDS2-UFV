In pitch dark  
I go walking in your landscape  
Broken branches  
Trip me as I speak  
  
Just cause you feel it  
Doesnt mean its there  
Just cause you feel it  
Doesnt mean its there  
  
Theres always a siren  
Singing you to shipwreck  
Dont reach out dont reach out  
Dont reach out dont reach out  
  
Stay away from each rocks  
Wed be a walking disaster  
Dont reach out dont reach out  
Dont reach out dont reach out  
  
Just cause you feel it  
Doesnt mean its there  
Someone on your shoulder  
Someone on your shoulder  
  
Just cause you feel it  
Doesnt mean its there  
Someone on your shoulder  
Someone on your shoulder  
  
There there  
  
Why so green and lonely  
Lonely lonely  
  
Heaven sent you to me  
To me to me  
  
We are accidents waiting  
Waiting to happen  
  
We are accidents waiting  
Waiting to happen
