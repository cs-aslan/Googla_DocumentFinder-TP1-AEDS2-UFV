You bastard fan  
You always speak badly about me  
Hoping in a new Pele  
Receiving just new Ireland  
You want the worst for me cause I know you say  
She makes good songs just when shes in pain  
Shame on you baby  
You hope in my misfortunes  
And you think of what pain can makes me turn back to write good songs  
Sorry for the disappointment but in the family we are all good  
  
My fathers well  
Hes not dying today  
My mothers well  
Shes not dying today  
My face is OK so they say to me  
But dont worry cause it will not die today  
Maybe tomorrow somewhere  
  
Hi ears with feet  
Or I could say ears with six feet under  
You hope the beekeeper comes to take someone  
Shame on you  
I can do good songs if Im happy toosuch as goodbye pieces  
OK its not a good example  
  
Mary Magdalenes alive and  
Not dying today  
Matt and john are OK  
Theyre not dying today  
Mac Aladdin is good too I know youre sad about  
But hes not dying today  
Beenie lost her sunset but not dying today  
My career is on a thread but not dying today  
My face is OK so they say to me  
But dont worry cause it will not die today
