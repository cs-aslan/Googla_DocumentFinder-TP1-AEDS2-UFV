Sometimes I like to sit and watch the clouds for hours  
Its just so extraordinary  
Standing in the pouring rain just because its raining  
Its all so fascinating  
All that I need is what I see or rather what I feel  
You believe what you wanna believe  
And thats alright with me  
And thats alright to feel what youre feeling  
You know it makes no difference to me  
And I dont mind I dont need no reason  
If its good enough for you its good enough for me  
And if I told you I could see what you cant see  
Would you say its my imagination  
Cause what is real is only your reality  
It needs no explanation  
All that I need is what I see or rather what I feel  
You believe what you wanna believe  
And thats alright with me  
And thats alright to feel what youre feeling  
You know it makes no difference to me  
And I dont mind I dont need no reason  
If its good enough for you its good enough for me  
Sometimes its hard  
To know which way to go  
Just when you think you wont figure it out  
Youll know  
Sometimes I like to sit and watch the clouds for hours  
Its just so extraordinary  
Standing in the pouring rain just because its raining  
Its all so fascinating  
Sometimes I like to sit and watch the clouds for hours  
Standing in the pouring rain just because its raining  
All that I want is what I see or rather what I feel  
Rather what I feel  
Do you feel like I feel  
All that I want is what I feel  
Do you feel like I feel  
Do you feel like I feel  
Do you feel like I feel
