You know that my tears  
Have kept me awake  
The longer youre gone  
Ill hunger and shake  
From Warsaw to Rome  
Ill wait out of time  
With you in my heart  
The rhythm divine  
  
So wont you come close  
Bring this to an end  
With each winter rose  
My love I will send  
So tender the night  
When you hold me tight  
With you in my heart  
The rhythm divine  
  
With you in my heart  
The rhythm divine  
  
You know that these tears  
Have kept me awake  
The longer youre gone  
Ill hunger and shake  
From Warsaw to Rome  
Ill wait out of time  
With you in my heart  
The rhythm divine  
The rhythm divine  
The rhythm divine  
  
With you in my heart  
The rhythm divine
