JeanPaul Maunick  
Weve got so little time on our hands to make all the changes  
That were needin  
Cant leave until tomorrow what we need to do today oh no  
We just cant leave it  
  
War is not the answer to the problems that were facin  
Gotta learn to live together  
Prejudice and pride ignorance for our defence is not the way  
If we wanna have a future  
  
Turn back the pages of our history  
Learn from our mistakes  
  
Got to know got to know got to know  
People got to know it  
Got to know got to know got to know  
What we reap is what we sow  
  
The writins on the wall and its clear for all to see the danger  
Wont you heed it  
We can use the power of expression choose our destination  
What it is What it is  
  
Lets send a message loud and clear to the leaders of the world theres no
excuse  
For this abuse  
No more wars no more wars no more wars dont want to fight no more  
No more no more no more  
  
Turn back the pages of our history  
Learn from our mistakes  
  
Got to know got to know got to know  
People got to know it  
Got to know got to know got to know  
What we reap is what we sow  
  
There is no shame and all to gain  
Gotta give peace a chance  
Woh oh oh do right
