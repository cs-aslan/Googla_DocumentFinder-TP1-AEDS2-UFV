Get used to it Katy  
Everyone trashes you under the table  
As theyre smiling at your face  
Cruel words like a stun gun  
Life can be hum drum  
Knock to the ground oh  
  
But if you got them talking  
Staring and stalking  
You know its working  
But you only get a minute or two  
  
Cause nobody hates you  
Are you aware  
Youre just one note in a symphony  
Nobody needs you  
Nobodys there  
Your name wont go down in history  
Live on in infamy  
But to the point  
Would you care  
Would you care would you care  
  
Get used to it Katy  
Peoples attention  
Sure is focused on you  
Your the subject of the day  
They need something to speak about  
No need to freak out  
Tomorrow is over  
Today you got them talking  
Staring and stalking  
You know its working  
But you only get a minute or two  
  
Cause nobody hates you  
Are you aware  
Youre just one note in a symphony  
Nobody needs you  
Nobodys there  
Your name wont go down in history  
Live on in infamy  
But to the point  
Would you care  
  
Mean worlds mean words mean thoughts meanwhile  
Dont let it get to you  
Girl dont cry  
They lie  
Dont let it get to you  
Get used to it  
  
Nobody hates you  
Are you aware  
Youre just a note in a symphony  
Nobody needs you  
Nobodys there  
Nobody nobody nobody  
  
Cause nobody hates you  
Are you aware  
Youre just a note in a symphony  
Nobody needs you  
Nobodys there  
Your name wont go down in history  
Live on in infamy  
But to the point  
Would you care  
But to the point  
Would you care  
Would you care would you care
