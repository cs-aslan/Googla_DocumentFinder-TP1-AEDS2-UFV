I was an unmarried girl  
Id just turned twentyseven  
When they sent me to the sisters  
For the way men looked at me  
Branded as a Jezebel  
I knew I was not bound for Heaven  
Id be cast in shame  
Into the Magdalene laundries  
  
Most girls come here pregnant  
Some by their own fathers  
Bridget got that belly  
By her parish priest  
Were trying to get things white as snow  
All of us woebegottendaughters  
In the streaming stains  
Of the Magdalene laundries  
  
Prostitutes and destitutes  
And temptresses like me  
Fallen women  
Sentenced into dreamless drudgery  
Why do they call this heartless place  
Our Lady of Charity  
Oh charity  
  
These bloodless brides of Jesus  
If they had just once glimpsed their groom  
Then theyd know and theyd drop the stones  
Concealed behind their rosaries  
They wilt the grass they walk upon  
They leech the light out of a room  
Theyd like to drive us down the drain  
At the Magdalene laundries  
  
Peg OConnell died today  
She was a cheeky girl  
A flirt  
They just stuffed her in a hole  
Surely to God youd think at least some bells should ring  
One day Im going to die here too  
And theyll plant me in the dirt  
Like some lame bulb  
That never blooms come any spring  
Not any spring  
No not any spring  
Not any spring
