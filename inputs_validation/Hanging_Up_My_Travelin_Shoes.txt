Ive been goin around in a whirlwind not knowing which way to go  
Ive been lost in a jungle of heartaches looking for what I dont know  
Ive spread my wings and Ive done some things that I never meant to do  
Its took me some time but Ive made up my mind Im hanging up my travelin
shoes  
  
Chorus  
Hangin up my travelin shoes  
My runnin around is all through  
Im foldin my wings up for you  
Im hangin up my travelin shoes  
  
Ive been ridin a sea of uncertainty runnin away fom is all  
Ive listened to nothing that life had to tell me  
Watched all my dreams rise and fall  
Ive made my mistakes but its not too late to pull myself out of the blues  
Its took me some time but Ive made up my mind Im hanging up my travelin
shoes  
  
Chorus  
  
Hangin up travelin shows
