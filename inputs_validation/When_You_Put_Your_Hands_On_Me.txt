I dont know about the travel of time  
And Ive never seen most of the world  
I dont know diving out of the sky  
Or living like diamonds and pearls  
  
See I havent danced to a musical tune  
And I havent noticed the flowers in bloom  
I havent smiled when alone in my room very much  
Then we touched  
  
I just know when you put your hands on me  
I feel sexy and my body turns to gold  
I just know when you put your hands on me  
I feel ready and I lose my self control  
  
I dont know if a doll can unwind  
Or how to make a person go  
I dont know how to be what you like  
And simply open up the depths of my soul  
  
So I keep my wings and my eyes on the down  
Ready for nothing but holding my ground  
I havent used a particular noun very much  
Then we touched  
  
I just know when you put your hands on me  
I feel sexy and my body turns to gold  
I just know when you put your hands on me  
I feel ready and I lose my self control  
  
I wont notice or pay you no mind  
Boy I couldnt care less what you do with you time  
Your fingertips on my hips  
Just move me like one of a kind
