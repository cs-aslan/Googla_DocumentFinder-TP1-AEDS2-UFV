Me and this girl weve been falling in love  
Beneath the quarter moon beneath the quarter moon  
Me and this girl Ive been living above  
On a road called Oppenheimer  
Tar on the roof there were stars in her hair  
Beneath the quarter moon beneath the quarter moon  
Me and this girl we were going somewhere  
On a road called Oppenheimer  
Me and this girl weve been working it out  
Weve got a long way to go weve got a long way to go  
Me and this girl weve been having it out  
On a road called Oppenheimer  
Me and this girl weve been getting it on  
Beneath the quarter moon beneath the quarter moon  
Watching it go til its all the way gone  
On a road called Oppenheimer  
And the days gonna be today and the time is gonna be right now  
No Im never gonna fall for anyone else but her  
And the place is gonna be right here  
On a road called Oppenheimer Oppenheimer  
Me and this girl we been falling in love  
Beneath the quarter moon beneath the quarter moon  
Me and this girl Ive been dreaming above  
On a road called Oppenheimer  
Tar on the roof there were stars in her hair  
Beneath the quarter moon beneath the quarter moon  
Me and this girl we were going somewhere  
On a road called Oppenheimer  
And the days gonna be today and the time is gonna be right now  
No Im never gonna fall for anyone else but her  
And the place is gonna be right here  
On a road called Oppenheimer Oppenheimer  
Oppenheimer Oppenheimer  
Me and this girl weve been working it out  
Weve got a long way to go weve got a long way to go
