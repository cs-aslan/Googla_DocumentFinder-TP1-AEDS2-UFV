My father used to say  
You sleep with dogs the next day  
Youll wake up in the bed scratching  
Those inevitable fleas  
At ten years old  
You listen to what youre told  
But I never felt the itch  
I never would  
  
My mother had forbidden me  
To waste away my life  
I want you to have all the things  
I could never buy you  
So dont stop what Id begun  
Youre my one and only son  
Follow what I say not what Ive done  
Follow what I say not what Ive done  
  
Shower scrub and shave  
Cleanly boys dont misbehave  
  
Follow what I say not what Ive done
