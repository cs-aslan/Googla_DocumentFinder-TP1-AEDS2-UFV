What is this thing in life that persuades me to spend  
Time away from you  
If you can answer this you can have the moon  
This is the place to be anyway you can see  
Theres a lovely view  
Why are there always so many other things to do  
Distractions like butterflies are buzzing round my head  
When Im alone I think of you  
And the life wed lead if we could only be free  
From these distractions  
  
The postmans at the door  
While the telephone rings on the kitchen wall  
Pretend were not at home and theyll disappear  
I want to be with you tell me what I can do  
Nothing is too small  
Away from all this jazz we could do anything at all  
Distractions like butterflies are buzzing round my head  
When Im alone I think of you  
And the things wed do if we could only be through  
With these distractions  
Ill fond the peaceful place far a way from the noise of a busy  
Day  
Where we can spend our nights counting shooting stars  
Distractions like butterflies are buzzing round my head  
When Im alone I think of you  
And the things wed do if we could only be through  
With these distractions like butterflies theyre  
Buzzing round my head when Im alone I think of you  
And the life wed lead if we could only be free  
From these distractions
