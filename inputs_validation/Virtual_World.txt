See the water break my hand  
No one knows my name  
Im not in demand  
  
Signs are right  
The signs are here  
Who needs virtual world  
When I can see it now  
I can see it now oh now oh now now  
No one goes no one cares  
No one seen it anywhere  
  
Shes breathing life into lonely dead stars  
Have you ever seen it  
I aint seen nothing at all  
  
Come see the water break my fall  
No one knows no one comes  
Have you ever seen the book  
The one on my help  
The one entitled selfdeath selfdeath  
How to earn a million pounds  
I can see it now oh the hearse  
  
Shes breathing down in a hole in my head  
In the dirty half light where  
Time means nothing at all  
  
Im calling out to some one  
Anyone wholl have me  
Does anyone need me  
Does anyone know how to cry  
What happens when I go  
What happens when it snows  
I bet you could if you wanted to end
