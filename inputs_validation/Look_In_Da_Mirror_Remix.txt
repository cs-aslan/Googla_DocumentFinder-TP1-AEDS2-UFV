Game strong like the arm on Marino  
I stack Cheetos and Doritos like casinos  
  
Fresh to death like Im buried in a tuxedo  
At times I look in the mirror to boost my fuckin ego  
I say its yo world Cole World to be exact  
With a flow thats so thorough  
No sir you cant reenact nigga  
  
Hundred fifty on my chain ballin but its not a game  
High thats why they call us planes  
All the bitches know my name  
I take em home fuck her get high and never call again  
  
And my niggas all the same now thats what you call a game  
Hundred thousand dollars and thats on champagne  
Bitches choose and they excuses my new cars to blame  
Wanna dump her nigga fuck a nigga with a lot of fame  
Dont want nothing from a nigga he all kinds of lame

Niggas takin shots dont know how to aim  
Dont know bout you but I see a real nigga
