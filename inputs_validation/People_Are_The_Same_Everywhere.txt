Set me aside youll find  
People are the same everywhere  
Hoist me from the herd and  
People are the same everywhere  
  
Then our creator had to stumble and stall  
And our creator had to make  
The biggest mistake of all  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Set me aside and find  
People are the same everywhere  
Stoode me from the group and  
Groups are the same everywhere  
  
Then our creator had to  
Stumble and stall and our creator  
Had to make the biggest mistake of all  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Its a shame its a shame but  
People are the same everywhere  
And land of the free and the home of the brave  
Exists nowhere  
  
Here in our loveless nation  
Were all in a rush to find a lovers touch  
And when its found you wonder  
Why it meant so much  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Its a shame its a shame  
That people are the same  
Its a shame its a shame but  
People are the same
