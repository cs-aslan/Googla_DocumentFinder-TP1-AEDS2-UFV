Just knocking around the zoo  
On a Thursday afternoon  
Theres bars on all the windows  
And theyre counting up the spoons yeah  
And if Im feeling edgy  
Theres a chick whos paid  
To be my slave yeah watch out James  
But shell hit me with a needle  
If she thinks Im trying to misbehave  
  
Now the keepers trying to cool me  
Says Im bound to be all right  
But I know that he cant fool me  
Cause Im putting him uptight yeah  
And I can feel him getting edgy  
Every time I make a sudden move  
Whoa yes its true  
And I can hear them celebrating  
Every time I up and leave the room  
  
Now my friends all come to see me  
They just point at me and stare  
Said hes just like the rest of us  
So whats he doing there  
They hide in their movie theaters  
Drinking juice keeping tight  
Watch that bright light  
Cause theyre certain about one thing babe  
That zoos no place to spend the night no  
  
Just knocking around the zoo  
On a Thursday afternoon  
Theres bars on all the windows  
And theyre counting up the spoons yeah  
And if Im feeling edgy  
Theres a chick whos paid to be my slave  
Watch out Kootch  
But shell hit me with a needle  
If she thinks Im trying to misbehave
