Im in a bar full of bikers  
And a handful of junkies  
Its a fifty fifty chance that theyre  
Plannin to jump me  
Anybody drinking here is lucky just to leave here alive oh  
  
Well my favorite little waitress has  
Ahold of my eyes  
But heres a shotgun  
Loaded hidden under the bar  
Her fingers on the trigger  
If anybody gets out of line  
  
Theres other places that are better to go  
But Im addicted to the red light show  
Feel like a king and shes my ace in the hole  
And I cant get enough of the things that she does  
  
Shes gonna be my midnight queen  
Locked and loaded  
Im ready to go  
Shes gonna like my pistol clean  
Shes got ahold of me and aint lettin go  
And I cant get enough of  
The things that she does alright  
  
Well she walks like a model  
And she talks like a trucker  
Doesnt want a lollipop  
But she sure loves a sucker  
They re closin in around her  
Im cutting to the front of the line  
Oh she grabbed a bottle of tequila  
And a lime for her lips  
Laid her body on the bar  
And put the salt on her hips  
Was lying when I told her  
That Im the only gonna lick her tonight  
  
Theres other places that are better to go  
But Im addicted to the red light show  
Feel like a king and shes my ace in the hole  
And I cant get enough of the things that she does  
  
Shes gonna be my midnight queen  
Locked and loaded  
Im ready to go  
Shes gonna lick my pistol clean  
Shes got ahold of me and aint lettin go  
  
Shes gonna be my sex machine  
And I can never get her under control  
Shes gonna climb all over me  
Im like a pony in my own rodeo  
And I cant get enough of  
The things that she does alright  
  
And I cant get enough of the things that she does  
Shes gonna be my midnight queen  
Locked and loaded  
Im ready to go  
Shes gonna like my pistol clean  
Shes got ahold of me and aint lettin go  
  
Shes gonna be my sex machine  
And I can never get her under control  
Shes gonna climb all over me  
Im like a pony in my own rodeo  
  
And I cant get enough of  
The things that she does alright
