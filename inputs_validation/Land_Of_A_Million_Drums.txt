Chorus  
In the land of a million drums  
There is always something going on on on on  
If you cant locate your thought off  
Might as well go on take your dead home home home home  
  
In the land of a million drums  
I catch a pattern that spit rings around you like Saturn  
Intergalactic tracks I make em like magstrulium  
This one for Scooby pass the doobie Imma do me one do me one  
Only you clean over  
I pick up the mic and rock it while Im sober  
For the rated G exposure if you listen to what Im tryin to told ya  
We fathers with seeds of our own  
Were talking about sons and daughters boy not roots and clones  
Now that the theory gone wrong  
An embryo with no soul  
Stuck in this green minivan with my lungs in a choke hold  
Shaggy pass the bombastic  
Daphne said Dont do that  
Freaky Fred smashed the gas and slammed us into traffic  
Now Scrappy want to box and throw them bows  
So I had to sic the pitbull on him before he could pass one blow  
ScoobyDoo ScoobyDoo ScoobyDoo ScoobyDoo ScoobyDoobieDoo  
  
In the land of a million drums  
There is always something going on on on on  
  
Chorus  
  
Woke up from a long night of hanging out with Shaggy  
Oh no lost my last baggy of Scooby snackies  
Shaggy wake up weve been had  
Our Scooby snacks they got the whole stash  
He said Who who I dont have a clue  
I suspect the thirteen ghosts of ScoobyDoo  
Call Vincent Price up on the Nextel  
Tell him to send another package right through the mail  
In the meantime Imma call Thelma to tell her  
To get the Mystery Machine ready  
Im twowayin Daphne and Freddy  
Me and Shaggy dressed in all black strapped  
Dippin through the flash tryin to get our stash back  
Roundin up suspects collectin clues  
I got a question where the hell is ScoobyDoo when you need em  
The hounds only found when you feed him  
In fact he probably got my sack  
Tell him holler back  
  
In the land of a million drums  
There is always something going on on on on  
If you cant locate your thought off  
Might as well go on take your dead home home home home  
  
Break it down break it down baby til the flow jumps off the ground  
Oh break it down lookin over yonder til the walls come tumblin down  
Oh yes lord why aint gotta tell me two times but you know I know  
Oh break it down break it down baby cause I want why yall all to know  
We rock the world  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat x5  
I could of got away with it if it wasnt for ya meddlin kids  
Oh no oh no
