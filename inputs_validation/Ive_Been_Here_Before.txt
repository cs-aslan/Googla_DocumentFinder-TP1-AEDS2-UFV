Ive tried so many times  
  
To Keep romance alive  
  
I guess I never really had true love  
  
Then you came my way  
  
And nothings been the same  
  
Now youre all Im ever thinking of  
  
  
If I had the say youd be staying  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
HeyIve been here before  
  
Looking in your eyes see just a little moreI said  
  
HeyIve been here before  
  
Someone must have sent you down to brighten up my life  
  
  
One in a million boy  
  
You fill me up with joy  
  
Sometimes I dont believe in accidents  
  
I know were meant to be  
  
Its so plain to see  
  
From here on out it where the fun begins  
  
  
If I have the say youll be staying  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
HeyIve been here before  
  
Looking in your eyes see just a little moreI say  
  
HeyIve been here before  
  
Someone must have sent you down to brighten up my life  
  
  
Sent you down to brighten up my life  
  
  
Bridge  
  
Sometimes the obvious is hard to see  
  
Now here you are standing right in front of me  
  
I could have missed my one and only  
  
Chance for love chance for loveoh  
  
  
HeyIve been here before  
  
Looking in your eyes see just a little moreI said  
  
HeyIve been here before  
  
Someone must have sent you down to brighten up my  
  
  
Sent you down to brighten up my life  
  
  
Chorus
