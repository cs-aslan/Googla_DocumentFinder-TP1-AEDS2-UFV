Got to work late cause my alarm was busted  
The boss chewed me out and everybodys disgusted  
Cause its just one of those days  
Its just one of those days  
  
I lost one of my socks in the drier  
I cant find my wallet and my hair is on fire  
Just one of those days  
Its just one of those days  
  
I just wrapped my Cadillac around a tree  
A big swarm of locusts is following me  
Theres not even anything good on TV  
Its just one of those days  
Its just one of those days  
  
Left all my Beatles records out in the sun  
Got a Coke bottle stuck on the end of my tongue  
Its just one of those days  
Gonna be one of those days  
  
The Nazis tied me up and covered me with ants  
And I spilled toxic waste on my brand new pants  
Just one of those days  
Ever have one of those days  
  
The bank called me up and told me Im overdrawn  
Some freaks are burnin crosses out on my front lawn  
And I cant believe it all the Cheetos are gone  
It justjust one of those one of those days  
Just one of those one of those days  
  
The FBI has got a tap on my phone  
Those darn Russian spies wont leave me alone  
Shouldnt have got up this morning shoulda known  
Its just one of those days  
Its just one of those days  
  
A 747 crashed into my den  
And theres nothin but tater tots for dinner again  
Its just one of those days  
Never mind its just one of those days  
  
Big steamroller just ran over my mom  
And I cut myself shaving and theyre dropping the bomb  
Its just one of those days  
Thats all its just one of those days  
  
Then late at night just before I go to bed  
The world blows up and now everybodys dead  
You just cant deny it its just like I said  
Justjust one of those one of those days  
Just one of those days one of those days
