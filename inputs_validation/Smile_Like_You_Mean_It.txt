Save some face you know youve only got one  
Change your ways while youre young  
Boy one day youll be a man  
Oh girl hell help you understand  
  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
  
Looking back at sunsets on the East side  
We lost track of the time  
Dreams arent what they used to be  
Some things sat by so carelessly  
  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
  
And someone is calling my name  
From the back of the restaurant  
And someone is playing a game  
In the house that I grew up in  
And someone will drive her around  
Down the same streets that I did  
On the same streets that I did  
  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
  
Oh no oh no no no  
Oh no oh no no no
