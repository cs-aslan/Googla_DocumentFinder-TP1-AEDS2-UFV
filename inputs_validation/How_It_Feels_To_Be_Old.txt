Lately all the songs I write  
Are slow and on the mellow side  
I used to stand on MTV  
But now they bring a chair for me  
Let me get a tube of ointment  
Lets rub my achy joints  
And turn my hearing aid loud  
And throw Depends into the crowd  
This must be how it feels  
This must be how it feels  
To get old  
If I try to play hard rock  
Itd probably put me into shock  
Dont expect no big drum fills  
The drummers lost his motor skills  
So lets get to the point  
Im as mellow as the Doobies  
And when I head to the commode  
I just pray that I can go  
And this must be how it feels  
To be old
