You may not recall the moment that you asked me  
But your invitation was clear  
Youll pretend youve never met me but its far to late  
Now Im here  
  
Cause Im the one who knows what scares you  
Im the one who loves you best  
Im the thirteenth at the table  
Im the uninvited guest  
Im the Banquo at your banquet  
Im the cuckoo in your nest  
Im your fifteenstone firstfooter  
Im the uninvited guest  
  
I was there when you said insincere I love yous  
To a woman who wasnt your wife  
And I fronted you the money  
That you ran away and blew  
On the biggest regret of your life  
  
Cause Im the one who knows what scares you  
Im the who loves you best  
Im the thirteenth at the table  
Im the uninvited guest  
Im the Banquo at your banquet  
Im the cuckoo in your nest  
Im your New Years resolution  
Im the uninvited guest  
  
Im the face you hoped youd never see  
But always knew you would  
Im the one thing you knew you shouldnt do  
But did because you could  
  
Im the evil in your bloodstream  
Im the rash upon your skin  
And you made a big mistake all right  
The day you let me in  
And you can fly to the other side of the world  
You know youll only find  
Ive reserved the seat behind you  
We can talk about old times  
  
Cause Im the one who knows what scares you  
Im the who loves you best  
Im the thirteenth at the table  
Im the uninvited guest  
Im the Banquo at your banquet  
Im the cuckoo in your nest  
Im your fifteenstone firstfooter  
Im the uninvited guest  
Let me in  
Im your New Years resolution  
Im the uninvited guest
