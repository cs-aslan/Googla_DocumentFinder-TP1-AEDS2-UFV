Oooh Yeah  
Tell me baby what cant you see  
That Im feeling down  
If you open your eyes youd see  
  
That Im wearing a frown  
Youd think about yourself  
If you thought I was dead  
Aw yeah  
  
Baby baby you walk around  
Like you own this town  
You whole life is a fantasy  
And Im playing the clown  
  
You talk behind my back  
And spend up all my bread  
  
Is there any love in your heart ooh yeah  
Is there any love in your heart ooh  
  
Babe you say Im the only one  
But youre fucking all my friends  
Baby all that you care about  
Is gucci and Mercedes Benz  
  
Youre just the kind thats up on all the latest trends  
Is there any love in your heart oo yeah  
Is there any love in your heart oo
