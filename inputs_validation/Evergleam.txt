Evergleam and I know why God is good and Jesus loves me  
Heaven lives and I know where  
  
Sounds to me a not so easy chair falling free and living down  
Stringing out and over and happy  
  
Evergleam and I know why it isnt real and Im not going to break  
Not going to break  
  
Dont die dont give in to it no way no way  
Please dont leave me  
  
Evergleam and I know how pulling hair and breaking voices  
Spin the wheel it will give you now  
  
Spinning wills dont give you choices  
Give away the spark inside you give away the shining prize  
Evergleam and I know how it isnt real and Im not going to break  
  
Im not going to break  
No way Im not gonna break  
Im not gonna break  
No way  
  
Evergleam everywhere ever weird everyone  
Evergleam everywhere everything  
Im not going away not going away not going away  
No way Im not gonna break not gonna break  
No way Im not gonna break  
I wont see you there Im not going away  
No way no way no way
