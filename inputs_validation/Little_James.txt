Little James were all the same  
They always seem to look to us  
But we werent meant to be grown ups  
Thank you for your smile  
You make it all worthwhile to us  
  
You live for your toys even though they make noise  
Have you ever played with plastercine  
Or even tried a trampoline  
Thank you for your smile  
You make it all worthwhile to us  
  
Im singing this song for you and your mum thats all  
cause it wont be long before everyone is gone  
  
Sailed out to sea your mum you and me  
You swam the ocean like a child  
Life around us was so wild  
Thank you for your smile  
You make it all worthwhile to us  
  
Im singing this song for you and your mum thats all  
And it wont be long before everyone is gone
