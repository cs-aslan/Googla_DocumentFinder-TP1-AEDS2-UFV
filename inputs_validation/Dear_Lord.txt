Dear lord this is a prayer  
Just let me know if youre really there  
Dear lord come gain control  
Oh lord come save my soul  
  
Give me dignity restore my sanity  
Oh lord come rescue me  
Dear lord my vanity is killing me  
Oh lord its killing me its killing me  
  
If you give your soul to heaven  
And your soul begins to bleed  
Remember all the sevens  
Dont turn up when you need  
  
If you do believe in glory  
Then please believe a fact  
Give your soul to heaven  
You wont get it back  
  
Im down deep and i need your help  
Theres no one to turn to and i cant help myself  
Dear lord hear this call  
Oh lord save my fall

Dear lord help me out  
I despair my lord my prayer my lord

Oh lord im on my knees  
Oh lord please please beware

Give me dignity  
Restore my sanity  
My vanity is killing me  
  
If you give your soul to heaven  
And your soul begins to bleed  
Remember all the sevens  
Dont turn up when you need  
  
If you do believe in glory  
Then please believe a fact  
Give your soul to heaven  
You wont get it back
