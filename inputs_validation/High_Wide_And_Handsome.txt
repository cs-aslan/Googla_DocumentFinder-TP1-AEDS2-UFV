High Wide and Handsome  
Down from the great white north  
More than enough and then some  
Swept her up on his own  
  
Tumbleweeds were meant to  
Get stuck up on a fence  
Heaven must have sent you  
Youve got no wire to roll against  
  
Keep her steady cowgirl  
Dont let go of the reigns  
You are ready now girl  
Never mind the growing pains  
  
Worlds out there are waiting  
Big and wild as the sky  
No more hesitating  
Its now or never do or die  
  
Keep her steady cowgirl  
Dont let go of the reigns  
You are ready now girl  
Never mind the growing pains  
  
As hard as you imagined  
It being without me  
Well both be wishing it were that easy  
Dont give me a pull give me some room  
When this round up is through Ill be coming back home  
  
Wide open spaces  
Between these two prairie hearts  
Wondering where their place is  
In a world so far apart  
  
Keep her steady cowgirl  
Dont let go of the reigns  
You are ready now girl  
Never mind the growing pains  
  
Keep her steady cowgirl  
Dont let go of the reigns  
You are ready now girl  
Never mind the growing pains
