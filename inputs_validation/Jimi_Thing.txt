Lately Ive been feeling low  
A remedy is what Im seeking  
Take a taste of whats below  
Come away to something better  
What I want is what Ive not got  
But what I need is all around me  
Reaching searching never stop  
And Ill say  
  
If you could keep me floating just for a while  
Til I get to the end of this tunnel Mummy  
If you could keep me floating just for a while  
Ill get back to you  
  
Take a Jimi Thing  
Just to keep me swingin  
Id like to show you whats inside  
I shouldnt care if you dont like it  
Brother chaos rules all about  
Sometimes I walk there  
Sometimes God knows I take a bus there  
I shouldt care I shouldnt care bereaved as  
Im feeling  
  
Day is gone Im on my back  
Staring up at the ceiling  
I take a drink sit back relax  
Smoke my mind makes me feel  
Better for a short time  
What I want is what Ive not got  
What I need is all around me  
Reaching searching never stop  
And Ill say  
  
If you could keep me floating just for a while  
Til I get to the end of this tunnel Mummy  
If you could keep me floating just for a while  
Ill get back to you
