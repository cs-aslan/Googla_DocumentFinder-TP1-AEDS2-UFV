By Bob Dylan and Helena Springs  
  
We have got to come together  
How long can we stay apart  
You may get it maybe never  
But its coming from the heart  
  
Your life is full of indecision  
You cant make up your mind  
We must get it in position  
And move it on down the line  
  
Cause the road is long its a long hard climb  
I been on that road too long of a time  
Yes the road is long and it winds and winds  
When I think of the love that I left behind  
  
Make me up a bed of roses  
And hang them down from the vine  
Of all my loves youve been the closest  
Thats ever been on my mind  
  
Please dont talk about tomorrow  
Im really not one to care  
This world is filled with too much sorrow  
That nobodys heart should bear  
  
Cause the road is long its a long hard climb  
I been on that road too long of a time  
Yes the road is long and it winds and winds  
When I think of the love that I left behind  
  
Please please give me indication  
Stop and talk to me  
Like a river that is flowing  
My love will never cease to be  
  
You will always be my honey  
No one could take your part  
Our love cant be bought with money  
Cause its coming from the heart  
  
Cause the road is long its a long hard climb  
I been on that road too long of a time  
Yes the road is long and it winds and winds  
When I think of the love that I left behind
