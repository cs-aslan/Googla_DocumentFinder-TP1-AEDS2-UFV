When I see him I feel him  
Theres an intenseness  
In him in his eyes  
He wants me to be with him  
He wants me with him now  
  
She just seems to be missing  
How could that happen anyhow  
  
So how can you say  
Well I dont know what love is  
You havent and you have no time for it  
You feel completely indifferent  
You feel pushed up against the wall  
And then one day it just almost goes away  
You spend lots of time alone  
Sometimes you spend years  
And you just miss those arms that used to go around you  
  
Night after night  
No questions asked and  
Who cares the cold wind of it all every time  
Well its hard to be civil and its  
Real hard to be nice  
But you did it my love every time  
  
So how can you say well I cant see you  
Not now not tomorrow not until its right  
Not until  
None of us is pushed up against the wall  
I dont know the cold wind doesnt get you anymore  
  
So today she says well Ive changed my mind  
Thats a womans right they say  
Well Im frightened and Im lost and I  
Cant give you up not now I need you now  
Im broken hearted broke down  
Like a little girl  
Well I need you now well Im broken hearted  
Well I broke down like a little girl  
  
I need you now no questions asked  
Well I broke down like a little girl  
I need you now no questions asked  
I broke down like a little girl  
Need you now no questions asked  
I broke down like a little girl  
Well like a little girl  
Need you now no questions asked  
Like a little girl  
Like a little girl
