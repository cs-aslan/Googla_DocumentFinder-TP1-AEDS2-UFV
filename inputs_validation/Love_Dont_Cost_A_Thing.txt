You think you gotta keep me iced  
You dont  
You think Im gonna spend your cash  
I wont  
Even if you were broke  
My love dont cost a thing  
Think I wanna drive your Benz  
I dont  
If I wanna floss I got my own  
Even if you were broke  
My love dont cost a thing  
  
When you rolled up in the Escalade  
Saw that truck you gave to the valet  
Knew that it was game when you looked at me  
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rolley bling  
Saw you later in the corner booth  
Raising up a toast so I would notice you  
But your hearts a mess  
Think you outta know  
Doesnt matter if youre balling out of control  
  
All that matters is  
That you treat me right  
Give me all the things I need  
That money cant buy yeah  
  
You think you gotta keep me iced  
You dont  
You think Im gonna spend your cash  
I wont  
Even if you were broke  
My love dont cost a thing  
Think I wanna drive your Benz  
I dont  
If I wanna floss I got my own  
Even if you were broke  
My love dont cost a thing  
  
When I took a chance  
Thought youd understand  
Baby credit cards arent romance  
So youre tryna buy whats already yours  
What I need from is not available in stores  
Seen a side of you that I really feel  
Doing way too much never keep it real  
If it doesnt change gotta hit the road  
Now Im leaving wheres my keys  
Ive got to go  
  
All that matters is  
That you treat me right  
Give me all the things I need  
That money cant buy yeah  
  
You think you gotta keep me iced  
You dont  
You think Im gonna spend your cash  
I wont  
Even if you were broke  
My love dont cost a thing  
Think I wanna drive your Benz  
I dont  
If I wanna floss I got my own  
Even if you were broke  
My love dont cost a thing  
  
A thing a thing a thing  
Yeah yeah yeah  
You think the money that you make  
Can substitute the time you take  
Take the keys here to my heart  
Then you can win my heart and get whats in my heart  
I think you need to take some time  
To show me that your love is true  
Theres more than dollar signs in you  
Then you can win my heart and get whats in my heart  
  
You think you gotta keep me iced  
You dont  
You think Im gonna spend your cash  
I wont  
Even if you were broke  
My love dont cost a thing  
Think I wanna drive your Benz  
I dont  
If I wanna floss I got my own  
Even if you were broke  
My love dont cost a thing  
  
You think you gotta keep me iced  
You dont  
You think Im gonna spend your cash  
I wont  
Even if you were broke  
My love dont cost a thing  
Think I wanna drive your Benz  
I dont  
If I wanna floss I got my own  
Even if you were broke  
My love dont cost a thing
