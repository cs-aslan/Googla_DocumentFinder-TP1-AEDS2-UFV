When youre in prison dont turn the other way  
Keep your back against the wall  
When youre in prison dont turn the other way  
Do not bend at all  
  
Oh dont pick up the soap pick up the soap  
Its bad for you  
  
Oh dont pick up the soap pick up the soap  
Someone will be waiting there for you  
  
When youre in prison be sure to stay awake  
Always lie upon your back  
  
When youre in prison be sure to stay awake  
Keep you from attack  
  
Oh dont be no ones bitch be no ones bitch  
Its bad for you  
  
Oh dont be no ones bitch be no ones bitch  
They wont help you make it through  
  
When youre in prison dont turn the other way  
Follow what I say to do  
  
When youre in prison dont turn the other way  
You can make it through  
You can make it through  
You can make it through
