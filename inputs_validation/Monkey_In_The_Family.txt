Its delicious the way your walking go easy on your toes  
Theres a million and one different dances who do you know  
That knows theres a monkey in the family it was trained by Adam and eve it
was so  
  
Your great granddad and grandma and decided it wouldnt leave  
I had to make the grass more greener I had to make the sky more blue  
I had to put a stop to the jungle jive team so they dont do these with  
You when you grow up youll moon stomp mi lady to moon stomp is in your blood  
Youll have to make a keen decision but youll  
Know everything about love theres a monkey in the family swings  
Tree to tree it never stops to see how your doing  
It just has time to feed its delightful  
The way your walking be steady on those feet stay away  
From the peppermint twist where the humpty humpey
