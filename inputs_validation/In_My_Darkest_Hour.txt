In my hour of need  
Ha youre not there  
And though I reach out for you  
Wouldnt lend a hand  
Through the darkest hour  
Grace did not shine on me  
It feels so cold very cold  
No one cares for me  
Did you ever think I get lonely  
Did you ever think that I needed love  
Did you ever think to stop thinking  
Youre the only one that Im thinking of  
Youll never know how hard I tried  
To find my space and satisfy you too  
Things will be better when Im dead and gone  
Dont try to understand  
Knowing you Im probably wrong  
But oh how I lived my life for you  
Still youd turn away  
Now as I die for you  
My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name  
All there years I thought I was wrong  
Now I know it was you  
Raise your head raise your face your eyes  
Tell me who you think you are who  
I walk I walk alone into the promised land  
Theres a better place for me  
But its far far away  
Everlasting life for me in a perfect world  
But I gotta die first  
Please God send me on my way  
Time has a way of taking time  
Loneliness is not only felt by fools  
Alone I call to ease the pain  
Yearning to be held by you  
Alone so alone Im lost consumed by the pain  
The pain the pain the pain  
Wont you hold me again  
You just laughed ha ha bitch  
My whole life is work built on the past  
But the time has come when all things shall pass  
The good has passed away  
In my darkest hour
