When my heart runs dry and theres no song to sing  
No holy melody no words of love within  
I recall the height from which this fragile heart has slipped  
  
And Ill remember You I will turn back and do  
The things I used to do for the love of You  
Lord Ill remember You I will turn back and do  
The things I used to do for the love of You  
  
You are my souls desire You are the hope within  
You bring my heart to life You make my spirit sing  
I recall the height from which this fragile heart has slipped
