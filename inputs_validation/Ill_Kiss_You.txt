Went down to the local gypsy  
And I handed her the same line  
You know what I want from you  
So honey wont ya gimme number nine  
Cause you know lately I aint feelin so great  
Last time she gave me love potion number eight  
And you know pretty baby how I think youre pretty smart  
But one sip from this bottle and Ill tear you all apart  
  
The gypsy told me that the first thing  
That would happen youd get dizzy  
Second thing you better make sure  
That your boyfriend isnt busy  
Cause you wont want to eat  
And you wont want to drink  
You wont want to talk  
And you wont want to think  
My mother used to tell me not to kiss on this first date  
This time when I see you you know I aint gonna wait  
  
Ill kiss you  
Gonna corner you and not let you go  
Ill kiss you  
Dont tell me nothing I dont want to know  
Twidely dee and twidely dumb  
Ill kiss you Ill kiss you Ill kiss you  
  
Hopped into a taxi told the driver  
Got to get me cross town  
Killed the bottle started seeing double  
When the driver turned around  
And though I was a failure with love potion number eight  
Number nine was different and the hours getting late  
Now Im standing on the corner  
Everyone looks great to me  
And if you come and get me take me where I want to be  
  
Ill kiss you  
Gonna corner you and not let you go  
Ill kiss you  
Dont tell me nothing I dont want to know  
Twidely dee and twidely dumb  
Ill kiss you Ill kiss you Ill kiss you  
  
Cause you know lately I aint feelin so great  
Last time she gave me love potion number eight  
And you know pretty baby how I think youre pretty smart  
But one sip from this bottle and Ill tear you all apart  
  
Ill kiss you  
Gonna corner you and not let you go  
Ill kiss you  
Dont tell me nothing I dont want to know  
Twidely dee and twidely dumb  
Ill kiss you Ill kiss you Ill kiss you  
  
Oh you know lately I aint feelin so great  
Last time she gave me love potion number eight  
And you know pretty baby oh  
I dont want to talk and I dont want to think  
I kiss you I kiss you I kiss you  
Oh twidely dee and twidely dumb  
I kiss you I kiss you I kiss you  
Oh I dont want to talk and I dont want to think  
I was a failure with love potion number eight  
But number nine was different and the hours getting late  
I kiss you I kiss you  
I dont want to talk and I dont want to sleep  
I kiss you I kiss you
