I seen you in your pajamas  
Drinking coffee at the house of pies  
You was flipping for the check  
And talking like your tongue was paralyzed  
You were saying something  
That I dont understand  
Bout looking other places  
While youre holding my hand  
Lets stop  
Lets not  
Talk shop  
In front of all these guys  
Chorus  
Lets not  
Talk shop  
Shop talk  
Shop talk is talking something  
That you dont realize  
Loose lips sink ships shake hips  
Bad tips draw spies  
I want you when I can get you  
But you only want me on the rise  
Well I thought I had your number  
But your numbers too loud  
Now youre standing on the table  
And were drawing a crowd  
Lets stop  
Lets not  
Talk shop  
In front of all these spies
