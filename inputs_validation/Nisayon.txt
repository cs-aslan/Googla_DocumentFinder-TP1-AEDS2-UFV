Lyrics Leah Goldberg  
Music Achinoam Nini  
  
Transliteration  
Lecha nishbaati El elion  
Velo eda haakayem  
Eich aamod banisayon  
Nisyon haosher hashalem  
  
Eichah tachil eyni haor   
Yaday rafot yaday hozot   
Eychah esa velo eshbor  
Simchah kazot brachah kazot   
  
Mikoved ol eich lo epol  
Eich lefaneicha etyatsev  
Zkufah gdolah noset beol  
Shel osher enoshi shalev  
  
Translation  
I swore to you oh Lord  
But unsure of my ploy  
How can I bear the burden  
Of a perfect joy  
  
Can my eyes contain the light  
Im delirious and weak  
How to keep from shattering  
The happiness that all men seek  
  
How can I keep my feet on board  
neath a weight as great as this  
I want to stand up tall oh Lord  
And bear the yolk of perfect bliss
