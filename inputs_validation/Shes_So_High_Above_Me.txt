Shes blood flesh and bone  
No tucks or silicone  
Shes touch smell sight taste and sound  
But somehow I cant believe  
That anything should happen  
I know where I belong  
And nothings gonna happen yeah  
  
Cause shes so high high above me shes so lovely  
Shes so high like Cleopatra Joan of Arc or Aphrodite  
Do do do do do  
Shes so high high above me  
  
A first class and fancy free  
Shes high society  
Shes got the best of everything  
What could a guy like me ever really offer  
Shes perfect as she can be  
Why should I even bother  Aha  
  
Cause shes so high high above me shes so lovely  
Shes so high like Cleopatra Joan of Arc or Aphrodite  
Do do do do do  
Shes so high high above me  
  
She comes to speak to me  
I freeze immediately  
Cause what she says sounds so unreal  
Somehow I cant believe  
That anything should happen  
I know where I belong  
And nothings gonna happen yeah ah ah  
  
Cause shes so high high above me shes so lovely  
Shes so high like Cleopatra Joan of Arc or Aphrodite  
Oh yeah ah ah
