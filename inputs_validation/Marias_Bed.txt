Been on a barbed wire highway forty days and nights  
I aint complainn thats my job and it suits me right  
I got a sweet soul fever rushin around my head  
Im gonna sleep tonight in Marias bed  
  
Got on a dead mans suit and smilin skull ring  
Lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing  
I keep my heart in my work my troubles in my head  
And I keep my soul in Marias bed  
  
I been up on sugar mountain cross the sweet blue sea  
I walked the valley of love and tears and mystery  
I got run outa luck and gave myself up for dead  
Then I drank the cool clear waters from Marias bed  
  
She give me candy stick kisses neath a wolf dog moon  
One sweet breath and shell take you mister to the upper room  
  
I was burned by the angels sold wings of lead  
Then I fell in the roses and sweet salvation of Marias bed  
  
I been out in the desert doin my time  
Siftin through the dust for fools gold lookin for a sign  
Holy man said Hold on brother theres a light up ahead  
Aint nothin like the light that shines on me in Marias bed  
  
Well I take my blessings at the river head  
Im living in the light of Marias bed
