I feel like a boy with a problem  
I cant believe what weve forgotten  
And I even slapped your face and made you cry  
  
Its the last thing I want to do  
Pull the curtains on me and you  
Pull the carpet from under love  
Pull out like young lovers do  
  
You swore you wouldnt shout  
If its not your punch then its your pout  
Days in silence try my temper  
Nights spent drinking to remember  
How memories are always tender  
  
I crept out last night behind your back  
The little they know might be the pieces I lack  
Came home drunk  
Talking in circles  
The spirit is willing but I dont believe in miracles  
Ive got a problem but lets go to bed  
I can roll over and I can play dead  
But here I am in the doghouse instead  
  
I feel like a boy with a problem  
I cant believe all youve forgotten  
Sleeping with forgiveness in your heart for me
