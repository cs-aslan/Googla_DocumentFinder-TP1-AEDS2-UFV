I woke up this morning with a funny taste in my head  
Spackled some butter over my whole grain bread  
Something tastes different maybe its my tongue  
Something tastes different suddenly Im not so young  
  
Im just a stranger even to myself  
A rearranger of the proverbial bookshelf  
Dont be a fool girl tell him you love him  
Dont be a fool girl youre not above him  
  
I never thought I could love anyone but myself  
Now I know I cant love anyone but you  
You make me think that maybe I wont die alone  
Maybe I wont die alone  
  
Kiss the boys as they walk by call me their baby  
But little do they know Im just a maybe  
Maybe my baby will be the one to leave sore  
Maybe my baby will settle the score  
  
I never thought I could love anyone but myself  
Now I know I cant love anyone buy you  
But you make me think that maybe I wont die alone  
Maybe I wont die alone  
  
What have I become  
Something soft and really quite dumb  
Because Ive fallen oh cause Ive fall fallen oh cause Ive fallfall
fallen  
So far away from the place where I started from  
  
I never thought I could love anyone  
I never thought I could love anyone  
I never thought I could love anyone  
But you  
But you  
But you  
But you  
But you but you make me think that maybe I wont  
Die alone  
Maybe I wont die alone
