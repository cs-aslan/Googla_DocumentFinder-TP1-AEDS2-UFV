Verse 1 Fabolous  
Nah I aint slip one bit  
But now a days you got to watch who you sip one with  
You get the clip one hit  
And dont see what they put in the blunt  
The newspapersll have ya face put on the front  
Like He was just in the club gettin tipsy  
Then they found him dead and patipsy  
Wont be me tryin to get me a free fill  
While a bitch drop a E Pill  
In my refill  
Im supposed to have the toast with me  
I cant let em get closer than they supposed to be  
Nigga fall back  
Before you wake up with a body cast on  
Face look like you got a hockey mask on  
Teflon Don Gotti passed on  
You dont want to be who the shottys blast on  
Hey kid walk straight pass then say hi  
Before your mom be lookin for a casket to buy  
Im sippin champagne and swingin Coronies  
I got them bitches them niggas is lonely  
These niggas is phonies  
I shoot up the club like when Frank Lopez hit them niggas for Tony  
Yeah
