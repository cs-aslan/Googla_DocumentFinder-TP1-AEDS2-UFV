Grass has been greater  
Skies have been bluer  
I know my soul is down in the sewer  
  
You say that I am selfish  
Well you know that that is true  
I dont care what you say pretty mama  
And I dont care what you do  
  
I dont care about anyone except myself  
I dont care about anyone except myself  
In the land of the brave  
And the home of the free  
I dont care about anyone except for me  
  
If you are unhappy and  
You have not won your race  
Well there aint no mercy in this world  
And there aint none out in space  
  
So welcome to the nineties  
I hope that you make it through  
But if you get in trouble honey  
This is what I say to you  
  
I dont care about anyone except myself  
I dont care about anyone except myself  
In the land of the brave  
And the home of the free  
I dont care about anyone except for me  
  
This is not the era of roses peace and love  
I must admit Im the only one  
That Im thinking of  
  
Well I just make my honey  
And I put it in the bank  
I buy myself some presents  
With no one but myself to thank
