Ive loved everything about you that hurts so  
Let me see your moves  
Let me see your moves  
Lips pressed this close to mine  
True Blue  
  
But the prince of any failing empire knows that  
Everybody wants everybody wants  
To drive on through the night  
If its a drive back home  
  
Things arent the same anymore  
Some nights they get so bad  
You almost pick up the phone  
  
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns  
I sleep with your old shirts  
And walk through this house in your shoes  
You know its strange  
Its a strange way of saying  
Im supposed to love you  
Im supposed to love you  
  
Ive already given up on myself twice  
Third time is the charm third time is the charm  
Threw caution to the wind  
But Ive got a lousy arm  
  
And Ive traced your shadows on the wall  
Now I kiss them whenever Im down  
Whenever Im down  
Figured on not figuring myself out  
  
Things arent the same anymore  
Some nights they get so bad  
I almost pick up the phone  
  
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns  
I sleep with your old shirts  
And walk through this house in your shoes  
You know its strange  
Its a strange way of saying  
That I know Im supposed to love you  
Im supposed to love you  
  
Born under a bad sign but you saved my life  
That night on the roof of your hotel  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
Splintered from the headboard in my eye  
Photoproofed kisses I remembered so well  
  
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns  
I sleep with your old shirts  
And walk through this house in your shoes  
You know its strange  
Its a strange way of saying  
That I know Im supposed to love you  
Im supposed to love you  
  
Now press repeat
