Ive been crawling around in the dark for a while  
Sprawled out across the floor  
Not collecting dust anymore  
Define me a parasite Define my host  
Trapped beneath the floor  
I slowly waste away  
Now I pull my frail body into the chair  
And look me in the face  
Oh disappointments so disappointing  
This may be my last one  
Its gonna be good and hard  
It might be a touch out of key  
  
When this thing breaks I will be you you will be me  
Im afraid that this is really happening  
Lets hope this is short lived and riddled with dizzy  
  
Oh God the noise Is ringing in my ear  
Its so unclear I hear them talking  
But cant make out the words  
Speak up Speak clear  
  
God where have I been  
Im terrible company With zero apologies  
  
While I sink to the bottom  
Ill sing out as it fills with water  
I hope Ive done enough  
  
Im worn out  
Im worn thin  
I will never break through  
Let me out
