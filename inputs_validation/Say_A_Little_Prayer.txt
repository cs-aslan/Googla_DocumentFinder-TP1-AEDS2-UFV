Mr Moonlightshine bright  
Show me my Mr Right  
Lights camera action  
I want to be his sole distraction  
  
Cupid draw your bow  
Shoot it nice and slow  
Send it straight to his heart  
Love dont let him go  
You must let him know  
This is love from the start  
  
Chorus  
Say a little prayer  
Say a little prayer for me tonight  
Say a little prayer  
Say a little prayer for my hear tonight  
  
Mama always told me  
sometimes  
What you get is not what you see  
Im not taking any chances  
No more broken romances  
  
Cupid draw your bow fetch  
Chorus x2  
I promise to always love and care for him  
And I promiseto do my very best for him  
I promiseto cherish him for all of my life  
  
I promiseto always love and care for him  
And I promiseIll always be there for him  
I promiseto love him for the rest of my life  
  
Chorus out
