Didnt know what time it was and the lights were low  
I leaned back on my radio  
Some cat was layin down some rock n roll lotta soul he said  
Then the loud sound did seem to fade  
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase  
That werent no DJ that was hazy cosmic jive  
  
Theres a starman waiting in the sky  
Hed like to come and meet us  
But he thinks hed blow our minds  
Theres a starman waiting in the sky  
Hes told us not to blow it  
Cause he knows its all worthwhile  
He told me  
Let the children lose it  
Let the children use it  
Let all the children boogie  
  
I had to phone someone so I picked on you  
Hey thats far out so you heard him too  
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two  
Look out your window I can see his light  
If we can sparkle he may land tonight  
Dont tell your poppa or hell get us locked up in fright  
  
Theres a starman waiting in the sky  
Hed like to come and meet us  
But he thinks hed blow our minds  
Theres a starman waiting in the sky  
Hes told us not to blow it  
Cause he knows its all worthwhile  
He told me  
Let the children lose it  
Let the children use it  
Let all the children boogie  
  
Theres a starman waiting in the sky  
Hed like to come and meet us  
But he thinks hed blow our minds  
Theres a starman waiting in the sky  
Hes told us not to blow it  
Cause he knows its all worthwhile  
He told me  
Let the children lose it  
Let the children use it  
Let all the children boogie
