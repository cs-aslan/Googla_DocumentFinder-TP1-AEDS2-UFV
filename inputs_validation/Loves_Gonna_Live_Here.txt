Buck Owens  
  
Oh the suns gonna shine in my life once more  
Loves gonna live here again  
Things are gonna be the way they were before  
Loves gonna live here again  
  
Loves gonna live here  
Loves gonna live here  
Loves gonna live here again  
  
No more loneliness  
Only happiness  
Loves gonna live here again  
  
I hear bells a ringing  
I hear birds a singing  
Loves gonna live here again  
  
I hear bees a humming  
And I know the days a coming  
Loves gonna live here again
