Dont tie me up and take my time  
Waiting years and wondering why  
I love old songs and what they know  
Just turn em up and let em go  
  
I ask myself what I need  
Homesick blues and melodies  
This old tunes what I desire  
Its hot as hell it burns like fire burns like fire  
  
Chorus  
How bout you How bout you  
I wonder where youre going to  
Flyin by and out of view  
Ill keep looking how bout you  
  
I love old lights from the radio  
Nowadays I just dont know  
Theres less and less for me to prove  
Just more folks to prove it to to prove it to  
  
 Chorus   
  
Telephones wont let me be  
They never sound like what I need  
Up all night and listenin to  
The things you say and never do never do  
  
 Chorus
