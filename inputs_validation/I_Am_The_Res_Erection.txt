Hello hello hello  
  
Yokos cutting keys in Soho  
Ive been there and I should know oh face it  
Ill stick up for Aunty Sally  
Worzels just a dirty scally fragrant  
Mia Farrows patching marrows down at the place where all the face fit  
Robin Cousins doing dozens on a little pudding so he rakes it  
  
Im the reserection  
I may steal your soul  
I am fairly evil  
I live for rock and roll  
  
Shirley Basseys playing Lassie up a pole in Tallahassee hates it  
Norris Mcwhirters doing furters in a little place hows he fake it  
Its another appetiser I can go and buy a Tizer laced fit  
I dont know where Ive been but I know where Ive been is near a lake  
  
I am an erection  
I may steal your soul  
I am fairly evil  
I live for rock and roll  
  
Sock it to me daddy  
  
I am an erection  
I may steal your soul  
I am fairly evil  
Only for rock and roll  
  
Dance dance  
yeah yeah  
  
Hello hello
