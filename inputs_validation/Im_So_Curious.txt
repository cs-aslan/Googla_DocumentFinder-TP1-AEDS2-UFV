Im so curious  
About our love  
I dont understand  
Why you dont take my hand  
And tell me you care You care

But if you want to be mine dont leave me up in the air Oh baby

Chorus  
Im so curious  
Do you love me  
Do you wonder the way that I do I do

Or do you feel the same as I do

Why dont you set my heart free  
  
And tell me goodbye goodbye  
But if its for real
