Dedicated to Irving Layton  
  
So well go no more aroving  
So late into the night  
Though the heart be still as loving  
And the moon be still as bright  
For the sword outwears its sheath  
And the soul outwears the breast  
And the heart must pause to breathe  
And love itself have rest  
Though the night was made for loving  
And the day returns too soon  
Yet well go no more aroving  
By the light of the moon
