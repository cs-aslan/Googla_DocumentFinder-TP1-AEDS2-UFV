I would die for you  
Lay down my life for you  
The only thing that means everything to me  
Cause when youre in my arms  
  
You make me prouder  
Than anything I ever could achieve  
And you make everything that used to seem so big  
Seem to be so small since you arrived  
  
On Angels Wings an angelical formation  
Angels wings like letters in the sky  
Now I know no matter what the question  
Love is the answer its written on Angels Wings  
  
And I often wonder why someone as flawed as I  
Deserves to be as happy as you make me  
So as the years roll by  
Ill be there by your side  
  
Ill follow you wherever your heart takes me  
Cause you make everything that used to be so big  
Seem to be so small since you arrived  
  
On Angels Wings an angelical formation  
Angels wings like letters in the sky  
Now I know no matter what the question  
Love is the answer its written on Angels Wings  
  
Now anyone whos felt the touch of heaven in their lives  
Will know the way Im feeling looking in my babys eyes  
Thats why I cant bear to be too far away  
I know that God must love me cause he sent you to me on Angels Wings
