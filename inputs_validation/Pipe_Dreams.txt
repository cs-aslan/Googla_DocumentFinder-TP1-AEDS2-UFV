I read it all every word  
And I still dont understand a thing  
What had you heard  
What had you heard  
Was it love was it take another walk in the dark  
  
Youll never learn  
Id pray to God if there was heaven  
But heaven seems so very far from here  
And it all boils down to the same old thing  
Just a yin and a yang or a couple of pipe dreams  
And it all boils down to the same old pain  
Whether you win or lose isnt gonna change a single thing  
  
I stood in line and a thought crossed my mind  
I had been dreaming but I didnt mind  
I signed the line and the woman looked right through me  
She didnt smile  
  
Id pray to God if there was heaven  
But heaven seems so very far from here  
And it all boils down to the same old thing  
Just a yin and a yang or a couple of pipe dreams  
And it all boils down to the same old pain  
Whether you win or lose isnt gonna change a single thing  
  
Id pray to God if there was heaven  
But heaven seems so very far from here  
And it all boils down to the same old thing  
Just a yin and a yang or a couple of pints please  
And it all boils down to the same old pain  
Whether you win or lose isnt gonna change a single thing  
  
And it all boils down to the same old feat  
Just a link in a chain just a puppet on a string  
And it all boils down to the same old pain  
  
Whether you win or you lose  
Whether you win or you lose  
Whether you win or you lose  
Whether you win or you lose
