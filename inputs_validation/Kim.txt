Aw look at daddys baby girl  
Thats daddy baby  
Little sleepy head  
Yesterday I changed your diaper  
Wiped you and powdered you  
How did you get so big  
Cant believe it now youre two  
Baby youre so precious  
Daddys so proud of you  
Sit down bitch  
If you move again Ill beat the shit out of you  
  
Okay  
Dont make me wake this baby  
She dont need to see what Im about to do  
Quit crying bitch why do you always make me shout at you  
How could you  
Just leave me and love him out the blue  
Oh whats a matter Kim  
Am I too loud for you  
Too bad bitch your gonna finally hear me out this time  
At first Im like all right  
You want to throw me out thats fine  
But not for him to take my place are you out youre mind  
This couch this TV this whole house is mine  
How could you let him sleep in our bed  
Look at Kim  
Look at your husband now  
  
No  
I said look at him  
He aint so hot now is he  
Little punk  
Why are you doing this  
Shut the fuck up  
Youre drunk youre never going to get away at this  
You think I give a fuck  
Come on were going for a ride bitch  
No  
Sit up front  
Well I cant just leave ey alone what if she wakes up  
Well be right back  
Well I will youll be in the trunk  
  
Chorus x2  
So long bitch you did me so wrong  
I dont want to go on  
Living in this world without you  
  
You really fucked me Kim  
You really did a number on me  
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me  
But we was kids then Kim I was only eighteen  
That was years ago  
I thought we wiped the slate clean  
Thats fucked up  
I love you  
Oh God my brain is racing  
I love you  
What are you doing

In your living room haha

Fuck you you did this to us  
You did it its your fault  
Oh my God Im crackin up  
Get a grip Marshall  
Hey remember the time we went to Brians party  
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie  
That was funny wasnt it  
Yes  
That was funny wasnt it  
Yes  
See it all makes sense doesnt it  
You and your husband have a fight  
One of you tries to grab a knife  
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adams apple sliced  
No  
And while this is goin on  
His son just woke up and he just walks in  
She panics and he gets his throat cut  
Oh my God  
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat  
So now its double homicide and suicide with no note  
I should have known better when you started to act weird  
We couldve hey where you going get back here  
You cant run from me Kim  
Its just us nobody else  
Youre only making this harder on yourself  
Ha ha got you  
Ah  
Ha go ahead yell  
Here Ill scream with you  
Ah somebody help  
Dont you get it bitch no one can hear you  
Now shut the fuck up and get whats comin to you  
You were supposed to love me  
Now bleed bitch bleed  
Bleed bitch bleed bleed  
  
Chorus
