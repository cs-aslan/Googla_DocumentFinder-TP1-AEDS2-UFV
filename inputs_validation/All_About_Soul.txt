She waits for me at night she waits for me in silence  
She gives me all her tenderness and takes away my pain  
And so far she hasnt run though I swear shes had her moments  
She still believes in miracles while others cry in vain  
  
Its all about soul  
Its all about faith and a deeper devotion  
Its all about soul  
Cause under the love is a stronger emotion  
Shes got to be strong  
Cause so many things getting out of control  
Should drive her away  
So why does she stay  
Its all about soul  
  
She turns to me sometimes and asks me what Im dreaming  
And I realize I must have gone a million miles away  
And I ask her how she knew to reach out for me that moment  
And she smiles because its understood there are no words to say  
  
Its all about soul  
Its all about knowing what someone is feeling  
The womans got soul  
The power of love and the power of healing  
This life isnt fair  
Its gonna get dark its gonna get cold  
Youve got to be tough but that aint enough  
Its all about soul  
  
There are people who have lost every trace of human kindness  
There are many who have fallen there are some who still survive  
She comes to me at night and she tells me her desires  
And she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive  
  
Its all about soul  
Its all about joy that comes out of sorrow  
Its all about soul  
Whos standing now and whos standing tomorrow  
Youve got to be hard  
Hard as the rock in that old rock n roll  
But thats only part you know in your heart  
Its all about soul
