Your voice it might say no  
But the heart has a will of its own  
Your voice it might say no  
But the heart has a heart of its own  
Its not your birthday anymore  
Theres no need to be kind to you  
And the will to see you smile and belong has now gone  
Its not your birthday anymore  
Did you really think we meant  
All those syrupy sentimental things  
That we said  
  
It cannot be given  
And so it must be taken  
It cannot be given  
And so it must be taken  
  
All of the gifts that they gave cant compare in any way  
To the love I am now giving to you  
Right here right now on the floor  
All of the gifts that they gave cant compare in any way  
To the love I am now giving to you  
Right here right now on the floor  
  
Its not your birthday anymore  
Theres no need to be kind to you  
And the will to see you smile and belong has now gone  
Its not your birthday anymore  
Did you really think we meant  
All those syrupy sentimental things  
That we said yesterday
