What  
Could you hope to achieve  
When Im cryin and you know why  
How  
Do you find your reasons  
In my deepest darkest night  
I keep givin you up  
  
I remember when  
You were my only friend  
Now Im not sure you can  
Feel like that again  
I keep givin you up  
  
And my  
You know my minds made up  
This time  
Theres no goin back to find  
What we had  
And I know  
Theres no light left to shine  
Theres no wrong  
But theres no right  
So enough  
Im givin you up  
  
All the things that you said  
Well you seem to forget  
They surround in my head  
Every night  
And theres a battle within  
That Ill never win  
Cause its me  
That Im up against  
Cause its my heart  
Versus common sense  
Can I give you up  
  
And my  
You know my minds made up  
This time  
Theres no goin back to find  
What we had  
And I know  
Theres no light left to shine  
Theres no wrong  
But theres no right  
So enough  
Im givin you up  
  
Strip the layers  
Make me better  
Help me get out clean  
Show your colors  
Im slipping under  
Help me through this  
Pleaseee  
  
And my  
You know my minds made up  
This time  
Theres no goin back to find  
What we had  
And I know  
Theres no light left to shine  
Theres no wrong  
But theres no right  
So enough  
Im givin you up  
  
Yeahhhhh  
My minds made up  
Yeahhhhhh  
Im giving you up  
Im giving you up  
Im giving you up
