Marius recovering from his wounds imagines hes back at the abc cafe  
  
Marius  
Theres a grief that cant be spoken  
Theres a pain goes on and on  
Empty chairs at empty tables  
Now my friends are dead and gone  
  
Here they talked of revolution  
Here it was they lit the flame  
Here they sang about tomorrow  
And tomorrow never came  
  
From the table in the corner  
They could see a world reborn  
And they rose with voices ringing  
And I can hear them now  
The very words that they had sung  
Became their last communion  
On the lonely barricade  
At dawn  
  
Oh my friends my friends forgive me  
  
The ghosts of those who died on the barricade appear  
  
That I live and you are gone  
Theres a grief that cant be spoken  
Theres a pain goes on and on  
  
Phantom faces at the window  
Phantom shadows on the floor  
Empty chairs at empty tables  
Where my friends will meet no more  
  
The ghosts fade away  
  
Oh my friends my friends dont ask me  
What your sacrifice was for  
Empty chairs at empty tables  
Where my friends will sing no more
