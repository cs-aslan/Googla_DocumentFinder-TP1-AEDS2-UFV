If your love for me is just temporary  
Id rather not know  
Just let me make believe a while  
  
And if Im not in your plans for a lifetime  
Id rather not know  
Just let me make believe a while  
  
Just like a child at play  
Ill make believe youll stay  
And if you go away  
Ill always miss my best playmate  
  
So if your sweet kiss is just for the moment  
Id rather not know  
Just let me make believe a while  
Just let me make believe a while
