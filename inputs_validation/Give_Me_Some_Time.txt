Slow down girl whats the hurry  
Love can wait if youre worried  
Then Ill try to ease your mind  
You say were losing time  
  
But Ive got to find  
A way to convince you  
Ive got cause to be wary  
For so long Ive had to carry  
  
The weight of another soul  
You say I wont let go  
But how do you know I can  
Give me some time now  
Ive just got to find how  
Im going to forget her  
And talk myself into believing  
  
That she and I are through  
Then maybe Ill fall for you  
Youre just what Ive needed  
But Id be unfair and conceited  
  
To say youre the only one  
Woman Im on the run  
From something I have begun  
And cant seem to finish  
Although it hasnt been recent  
I still think it wouldnt be decent  
  
To let you believe in me so soon  
Ive got to make you see  
What she meant to me  
So please  
  
Give me some time now  
Ive just got to find how  
Im going to forget her  
And talk myself into believing  
That she and I are through  
Then maybe Ill fall for you  
  
Maybe Ill fall for you  
Maybe Ill fall for you  
Maybe Ill fall for you  
Maybe Ill fall for you
