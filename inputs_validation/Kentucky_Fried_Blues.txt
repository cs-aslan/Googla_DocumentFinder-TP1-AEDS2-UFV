I got no time to eat  
I got no time to sleep  
I got a truck full of stuff  
Shouldve been there last week  
Ive been livin in truck stops  
My body feels used  
Got the hamburger thats right yeah  
The kentucky fried blues  
  
Flyin high in my cab  
Got my foot on the gas  
Got to get there tonight  
Showin nothin but a pass  
Tired of livin in truck stops have mercy  
My body feels used  
Got the hamburger thats right yeah  
Kentucky fried blues  
  
Even in the fast lane  
Seems to slow down my brain  
Got one hell of a deadline  
Riggers do not complain  
Tired of livin in truck stops  
Lord my body feels used  
Got the hamburger thats right yeah yeah yeah  
Kentucky fried blues
