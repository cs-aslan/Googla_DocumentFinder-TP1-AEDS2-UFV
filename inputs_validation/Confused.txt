Ive been through so many changes I dont know which way to go  
Yet Ive got it so together I can see with my eyes open or with my eyes  
Closed  
Late at night I cry and wonder why my lifes goin goin nowhere  
But during the day everything is okay Im having it my way I say  
My teachers tell me that I am a lost soul in a black hole  
But my mind it tells me that Im doing just fine  
Oh if everything is peachy why cant anybody reach me  
Ive always said I dont need anybody else  
Chorus  
Im so confused  
So confused  
And Im destined to lose  
Unless I follow another way  
Spent all my time lookin for something never knew what for  
Tried out all the options just to find that more pain and hurt was in store  
Been through it all but the one thing that I still run from is you  
Still I remember bout all the things my momma said that you could do  
She said that if I only let you in my life  
You could take away the sorrow and the emptiness inside  
But to be true the life Im living its hard to let it go  
Though Ive spent my whole life learning theres so much that I dont know  
Chorus X2  
I hear you calling telling me to leave it all behind  
If I could only find the answers to the questions in my mind  
I wonder could it be my minds not meant to understand  
Maybe I should go with my heart and put my life in your hands  
Surrender to you  
chorus out
