I may have been gazing out too late at night  
I see a deeper window into my eyes  
Every day they screech outside my window  
The crashing cars never seem to collide  
  
Sometimes when Im staring out my window  
To catch the stars I watch as they go by  
Ive been getting messages from outer space  
They expire light in the window in the sky  
There goes my mind  
  
If we dare walk onto my window  
I could hear them if I open my eyes  
  
Sometimes flashing lights seem soulful in the window  
You may have seen them circle me at night  
I keep sending signals into outer space  
They expire by your window in the sky  
There goes my mind  
  
Every day when restlessness takes over me  
I cant see it as Im closing my eyes  
I keep sending signals into outer space  
They expire light in the window in the sky  
  
Sometimes when Im staring out my window  
To catch the stars I watch as they go by  
Ive been getting messages from outer space  
They expire light in the window in the sky  
  
By your window in the sky
