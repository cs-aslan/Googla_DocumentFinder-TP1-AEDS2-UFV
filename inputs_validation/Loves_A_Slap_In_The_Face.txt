I been up down  
And all around  
Tell you what Im feelin  
I been hurt and Ive found  
Been pushed around  
Its how I got this feelin  
I never thought I could hurt so good no no  
I never thought I could lose myself  
But I just cant hide it  
They never let you down easy  
Now listen  
Sometimes love is like a slap in the face  
You been burned and still  
Its the same old mistake  
If you want my opinion  
Ill give it to you straight  
Love is like a slap in the face  
Singin na na na na na na na na na  
na na na na na na na na na  
Loves got a hold on me  
I cant believe it  
But its plain to see  
Turns me upside down and inside out  
Dont know why it never fails  
To make you scream and shout  
I never knew I could fool myself no no  
I never thought I could hurt so good  
But I just cant hide it  
Guess Im feelin no pain  
Now listen  
Sometimes love is like a slap in the face  
You been burned and still  
Its the same old mistake  
If you want my opinion  
Ill give it to you straight  
Love is like a slap in the face  
Singin na na na na na na na na na  
na na na na na na na na na  
I never knew I could hurt so good no no  
I never thought Id say nonono no no  
But Im here babe  
I got a secret inside  
Sometimes love is like a ball and chain  
Keeps you up at night why is it always the same  
If you want to know the truth  
Its something I cant explain  
Yeah love is like a ball and chain  
Yeah na na na na
