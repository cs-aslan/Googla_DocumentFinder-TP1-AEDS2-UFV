Union Jack is back with a hole in his head  
Hes gettin badly burned every time  
Hes laughin at me and dancin on my sneakers  
And his sixties songs are blowin up my speakers  
  
I say you got no respect  
Respect for authority  
Youre just playing your dirty tricks  
And then come cryin to me  
  
Chorus  
Hit and run hit and run  
Its just a hit and run  
Another hit and run  
  
The bulldog lost his bite and his breath has gone bad  
And the whole damn world is really laughin mad  
  
Chorus  
  
Hit it  
Oh bring it down  
Oh you bring it down  
  
I say you aint got no respect  
I say you aint got no respect  
No you aint got no respect  
And you hit me when Im down  
  
Hit and run hit and run  
Its just another hit and run  
I said its just another hit and run  
  
Oh yeah hit and run  
Oh yeah hit and run  
Oh yeah hit and run  
Oh yeah hit and run  
Oh yeah hit and run  
Its just another hit and run  
Hit and run
