There aint no poor man  
Born with a silver spoon  
And there aint no wise man  
Who learned it all in school  
A politicians promise  
Can make you feel like a fool  
But when they get the power  
Theyre the first to break the golden rule  
We work that 40 acres like riders on a mule  
Climb that mountain  
Reach the sky  
Hangin on for a good laugh  
For a piece of that American pie  
Hey nothins easy  
Nothins for free  
In the world of dog eat dog  
Oh people thats a poor mans dream  
Hey Mr Walton  
Lend me a dime  
You know Ill repay ya  
But its gonna take me some time  
Im standing at the crossroads  
Just about to roll the dice  
I got a dream in my heart  
  
Whatever it takes  
I know I gotta pay the price  
We work that 40 acres like riders on a mule  
Climb that mountain  
Reach the sky  
Hangin on for a good laugh  
For a piece of that American pie  
Hey nothins easy  
Nothins for free  
In the world of dog eat dog  
Oh people thats a poor mans dream  
We work that 40 acres like riders on a mule  
Climb that mountain  
Reach the sky  
Hangin on for a good laugh  
For a piece of that American pie  
Hey nothins easy  
Nothins for free  
In the world of dog eat dog  
Oh people thats a poor mans dream  
Hey nothins easy  
Nothins for free  
In the world of dog eat dog  
Oh people thats a poor mans dream  
Oh  
Its a poor mans dream
