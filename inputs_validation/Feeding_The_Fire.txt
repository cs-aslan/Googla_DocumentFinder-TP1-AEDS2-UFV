You are terrified by the smallest sound  
Because you live your life in such a sheltered world  
As do those who surround you  
Well I have seen you stung by poisonous flies  
And you suffer much too much from their bites  
There you sit in your comfort watching other people get caught by the  
Storm  
  
Many a thing that used to be a secret  
Has become so talked about  
Not worth a second thought  
Theres different kinds of secrets now  
Times change its not enough to say  
It seemed a good idea a hundred years ago  
You think its not your problem  
It really doesnt matter at all  
  
Every stone thats thrown must fall to the ground  
But you dont give a thought to where they might come down  
You are feeding the fire over which youll be roasted  
  
Anywhere that they dont speak the same  
In any place that they dont think the same  
You think its not your problem  
No no  
  
You think its not your problem  
It really doesnt matter at all  
Oh  
  
Maybe its not your fate to be a leader of men  
But you just leave it all to someone else and complain  
You could be so much stronger but it really doesnt matter any longer  
Cause youre feeding the fire over which youll be roasted  
Cause youre feeding the fire over which youll be roasted
