Finally Ive met you  
The day has come  
Youre more than beautiful  
And youre my son  
  
I dont deserve this  
I never thought it could be  
Quite like the moment  
When you first smiled at me  
A toothless wonderful feeling  
Like Id never seen  
  
Its you Noah its you  
  
And when you lie down to sleep  
Ill protect you  
From the demons of the night  
While Im watching you grow  
  
Ill pray  
Theres so much I could teach you  
If you only have the time  
Pray  
Theres so much God can teach you  
If you only have the time  
  
So will you tell me the little things  
What does God look like  
And angels wings  
I dont remember these things  
So would you teach them to me  
So for the moment  
Ill watch you breathe  
  
And when you wake up in the morning  
And I pour the coffee  
Youre always smiling sweetly
