Fly to fly like a bird  
To heavens above  
On the wings of love  
Shine to shine like the sun  
And warm up my life  
And make it all worthwhile yeah  
  
Hand in my heart it tears me apart  
When Im away  
When I come home  
Dont wanna be on my own  
I said baby maybe Im in love  
  
Life to have and to hold  
To cherish the love  
That we could share together  
High as high as the moon  
The stars in the sky  
Beyond them Id take you and i  
  
Hand in my heart it tears me apart  
When Im away  
When I come home  
Dont wanna be on my own  
I said baby just maybe Im in love  
  
Yeah blow blow blow blow  
  
Yeah all the way  
  
Fly to fly like a bird  
To heavens above  
On the wings of love  
  
Hand in my heart it tears me apart  
When Im away  
When I come home  
Dont want to be all alone  
I said baby oh baby Im in love  
With you  
  
Im in love with you
