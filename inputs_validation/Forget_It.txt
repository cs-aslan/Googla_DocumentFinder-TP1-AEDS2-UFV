I gave myself some good advice forget it its gonna drive me crazy if I let it  
I forgot the line as soon as I had said it but its good advice for you and me
forget it  
Another day another place its another year  
We crossed too many bridges that brought us here  
We both had too much fun to now regret it its good advice for you and me
forget it  
  
A man has mornings when he thinks hell find it  
Oh its just a little mountain I can climb it  
So if some night your phone should ring just let it  
Its good advice for you and me forget it  
Another day another place
