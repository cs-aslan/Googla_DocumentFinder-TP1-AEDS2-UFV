Verse  
Dear Santa  
Its me Ariana  
I know its been awhile but I really need  
Your help this year  
Let me make this clear  
See I really love him  
And its been kinda tough cause  
Hes only in town for the holidays  
Tomorrow hes flying away  
Away from me  
  
PreChorus  
I dont need another gift  
I just have one wish  
This year can you  
  
Chorus  
Just make it snow in california  
Ill even settle for rain  
Dont want him to go tomorrow morning  
Give me something to make him stay  
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace  
Will be the perfect gift  
Let it snow let it snow let it snow  
Let it snow  
In California  
  
Verse 2  
Dear Santa  
What happened to the plan we had  
I checked the news and it said  
Itd be a sunny day  
Make it go away  
See I I really need him to stay  
For a couple more days  
Cant you make his  
Five oclock flight delay  
Wont you find a way

I dont need another gift  
I just have one wish  
This year can you

Just make it snow in california  
Ill even settle for rain  
Dont want him to go tomorrow morning  
Give me something to make him stay  
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace  
Will be the perfect gift  
Let it snow let it snow let it snow  
Let it snow  
In California  
  
Bridge  
I know Im asking for the impossible  
But I believe in miracles  
I need my baby right here with me  
So please please  
  
Chorus  
Just make it snow in california  
Ill even settle for rain  
Dont want him to go tomorrow morning  
Give me something to make him stay  
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace

Let it snow let it snow let it snow  
Let it snow  
In California
