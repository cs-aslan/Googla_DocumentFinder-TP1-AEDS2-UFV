Put you in a room  
You aint gotta leave  
You aint gotta leave  
But you cant sleep with me  
  
Verse 1  
Every time I come to fuck with you  
You make up all the rules  
You ought to do it  
Just because our cars moving  
Are you in my fucking corner for real  
Oh are you plotting to kill  
I tell you just how I feel  
But you never hear  
Oh why you take it like that  
Now you wanna leave and never come back  
I dont control you I aint never say that  
Cant give up on you baby we go way back

Verse 2  
Every time I try to fuck with you  
Nothing aint ever enough for you  
And I had all this hope for you  
But all you do is open wounds  
I could be fucking with them other niggas  
I know you aint them other niggas  
I dont fuck with a lot of bitches  
Just my real bitches  
Why you keep talking about it you keep talking and you gon get me pissed off  
Motherfuckers who be wanting that bitch to go crazy if she could cut her wrist

I aint gonna lie no I aint gonna lie like it was just his fault  
But I know if a nigga lose me then nigga Ooee thats his loss young nigga
