Go ahead and cry and weep and moan   
You know the blame is all your own  
You paid your money and you made a choice  
A world out theres waiting to be shown  
Stuck in conformity something wrong with that  
Searching for sanity Im not falling in that trap  
The way youre going youll travel alone  
cause Ill never stay in the comfort zone  
You didnt roll the dice you didnt take the shot  
Youre all wrapped up in what you got  
Youre crying about the way you feel  
To the music of your spinning wheels
