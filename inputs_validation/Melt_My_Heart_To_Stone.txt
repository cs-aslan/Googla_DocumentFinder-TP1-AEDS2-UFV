Right under my feet theres air made of bricks  
Pulls me down turns me weak for you  
I find myself repeating like a broken tune  
And Im forever excusing your intentions  
That I give in to my pretendings  
Which forgive you each time  
Without me knowing  
They melt my heart to stone  
  
Chorus  
And I hear your words that I made up  
You say my name like there could be an us  
I best tidy up my head Im the only one in love  
Im the only one in love  
  
Each and every time I turn around to leave  
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed  
So desperately I try to link it with my head  
But instead I fall back to my knees  
As you tear your way right through me  
I forgive you once again  
Without me knowing  
Youve burnt my heart to stone  
  
And I hear your words that I made up  
You say my name like there could be an us  
I best tidy up my head Im the only one in love  
Im the only one in love  
  
Why do you steal my hand  
Whenever Im standing my own ground  
You build me up then leave me dead  
  
I hear your words you made up  
I say your name like there should be an us  
I best tidy up my head Im the only one in love  
Im the only one in love
