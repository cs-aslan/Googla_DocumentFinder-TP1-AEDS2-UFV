In denial no  
My lifes a trial  
Im not denying  
That every little bit hurts  
Its a problem  
That Im not solving  
Dont mind admitting  
I feel like quitting this job  
For a while getting away  
Before it gets any worse today  
  
Youre in denial  
And that is final  
Youre not admitting  
You should be quitting  
All these  
Queens and fairies  
And muscle Marys  
The rough trade boyfriend  
Who in his pathetic own way  
Denies hes gay  
Why cant you see  
This is a fantasy world  
  
Think Im going mad  
How do you know if youre  
Going mad  
  
Look at me Im lonely  
  
Look at me Im sad  
  
Im not denying  
I could be trying  
A little harder  
To deal with some of this stuff  
  
Know what Im thinking  
Less drugs and drinking  
No cigarettes and youd feel  
A little less rough  
  
Is that enough  
My life is absurd Im living it  
Upside down  
Like a vampire working at  
Night sleeping all day  
A dad with a girl who knows  
Hes gay  
  
Can you love me anyway
