Before you started tokin  
You used to have a brain  
But now you dont get even the simplest of things  
I can draw a little picture  
  
Or even use my hands  
I try to explain but you just dont understand  
Man youre really losin it  
And youve really done a lot of junk now  
  
But you keep abusin it  
What in the world happened to you  
Its bad enough you do it to yourself  
But taking someone with you well you know thats something else  
  
I say Im not that kind of person  
Im not that kind of man  
I try to explain but you just dont understand  
I might be sympathetic or cut a little slack  
  
If I thought that you were willing to give a little back  
But you do it in the morning  
You do it in the night  
You lie to refrain from just facing your life  
  
So Ill see you man tomorrow  
Youll be gackin up again  
Ill see you in a coffin by the time your wad is spent  
I think of all the times that I tried to lend a hand  
  
I try to explain but you just dont understand  
  
Chorus
