Walk in silence  
Dont walk away in silence  
See the danger  
Always danger  
Endless talking  
Life rebuilding  
Dont walk away  
Walk in silence  
Dont turn away in silence  
Your confusion  
My illusion  
Worn like a mask of selfhate  
Confronts and then dies  
Dont walk away  
People like you find it easy  
Naked to see  
Walking on air  
Hunting by the rivers  
Through the streets  
Every corner abandoned too soon  
Set down with due care  
Dont walk away in silence  
Dont walk away
