My mans gone now  
Aint no use a listenin  
For his tired footsteps  
Climbin up the stairs  
  
Old man sorrows  
Come to keep me company  
Whisperin beside me  
When I say my prayers  
When I say my prayers  
  
He come aroud  
He come up he come around  
Aint that I mind workin  
Workin means travelers  
Journeyin togheter  
To the promised land  
  
But old man sorrow  
Mountin all the way with me  
Tell me that Im old now  
Since I lose my man  
Since I lose my man  
  
Since I lose my man
