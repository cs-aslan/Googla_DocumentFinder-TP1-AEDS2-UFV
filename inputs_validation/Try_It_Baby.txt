Now youre moving on up pretty baby  
Youre leaving me behind  
Everybody seems to love you  
Ooh youre doing just fine fine fine  
  
Take away your good looks  
And all your fancy clothes

And youll see  
That nobody loves you but me  
Now what do you think about that  
  
Hey Melvin  
Now you tell me that you so busy  
Ooh baby you aint got much time  
Oh how will I remember babe  
When all your time was mine mine mine

In my arms again

For all your love afraid  
But take your name from the bad list  
And tear me your arms through
