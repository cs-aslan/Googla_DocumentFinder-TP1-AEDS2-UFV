No matter what I say or do  
I just cant seem to get inside your heart  
What have I done wrong  
Lately youre so far away  
You just dont seem to hold me like you used to  
Somethings going on  
Ive got that old feeling youre leaving  
Im so tired of goodbye  
I cant wait on your love forever  
While you change your mind  
Morning finds us face to face  
I feel you staring through me while Im talking  
Familiar looks I recognize the same old looks that said goodbye the last time  
Something Im used to  
Ive got that old feeling youre leaving  
Im so tired of goodbye  
I cant wait on your love forever  
While you change your mind
