Well I just saw you out with another  
And I watched as you held his hand  
It seems funny to see you with him instead of me  
Funny but Im not laughing  
  
Then I heard you say its all over  
That you never loved me anyway  
That the things we had done were only in fun  
Funny but Im not laughing  
  
Then I turned away so my eyes couldnt see  
His arms were around you where mine used to be  
  
You would have laughed if youd have only seen me  
Yes I guess I was a funny sight to see  
Standing there on the street  
With my heart at my feet  
Funny but Im not laughing  
  
Funny but Im not laughing
