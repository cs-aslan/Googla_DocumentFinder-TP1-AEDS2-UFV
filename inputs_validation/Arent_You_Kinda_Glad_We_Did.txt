Oh it really wasnt my intention  
To disregard convention  
It was just an impulse  
That had to be obeyed  
Beacon Hill behavior weve been scorning  
But Ill still not go in mourning  
Though my reputation  
Is blemished Im afraid  
Whats done is done  
But wasnt and isnt it fun  
Honestly I thought you wouldnt  
Naturally you thought you couldnt  
And probably we shouldnt  
But arent you kind of glad we did  
Actually it all was blameless  
of course it was  
Nevertheless theyll call it shameless  
I suppose  
So the lady shall be nameless  
thank you  
But arent you kind of glad we did  
Socially youll be an outcast  
Obviously we dined alone  
On your good name there will be doubt cast  
With never a sign of any chaperone  
No matter how they may construe it  
itll be the wrong way  
Whether or not we have to rue it  
we will  
Whatever made us do it  
Say arent you kind of glad we did  
Honestly I thought I couldnt  
Naturally I thought I wouldnt  
And probably I shouldnt  
But arent you kind of glad we did  
Dinner was quite above suspicion  
Milk in the glasses when theyd clink  
Listening to a tired musician  
But what is it Mrs Grundys going to think  
That Im a bounder a rounder a cad a Boston blighter  
When speaking of me shell be no politer  
Oh lets turn to something brighter  
Whatever we did were glad we did
