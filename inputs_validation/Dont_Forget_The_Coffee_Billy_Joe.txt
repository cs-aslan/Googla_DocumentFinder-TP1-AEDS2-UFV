It snowed the night before and it had frozen on the ground  
We didnt have a car and we lived seven miles from town  
And I can hear my daddys voice so many years ago  
Saying  
Dont forget the coffee Billy Joe  
Mama needs her medicine shes got that real bad cough  
Well get our check on Monday tell ol Sam well pay him off  
You can catch a ride when you get to the blacktop road  
Dont forget the coffee Billy Joe  
Me and Quentin went back on the hill and we cut some wood  
Burnin in that ol warm mornin stove it sure smelled good  
Daddy couldnt get work then and I was just a child  
And God was on vacation for awhile  
Well if you see Fred you tell him Ill come help him kill them hogs  
And ask him if hed still be interested in my dogs  
Dont hang around that pool room all day we might get more snow  
And dont forget the coffee Billy Joe  
Well they wonder why there aint no rabbits left this day and time  
To tell the truth I guess we ate em all in 49  
Was that yesterday or was it over 20 years ago  
Dont forget the coffee Billy Joe  
Mama needs her medicine shes got that real bad cough  
Well get our check on Monday tell ol Sam well pay him off  
You can catch a ride when you get to the blacktop road  
Dont forget the coffee Billy Joe  
Now pay attention son  
Dont forget the coffee Billy Joe
