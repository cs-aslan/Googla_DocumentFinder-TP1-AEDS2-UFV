Shocka called me up to do this thing for Soundbombing  
And I figured that Id do it cause it wasnt no harmin  
Shine a little bit in case somebody was forgettin  
About that Queens motherfucker yall need to take cover  
Ima take position and yall best to take shahida  
Cause the shit that I spit is hot as hellfire hotter  
Sendin this to Cross Meniski and Bay Vigi  
Doug Pretty Tone and the one that shoot the vidi  
Yall stay in my heart while I dabble with the charts  
Fuck the fame and my aim find the clarity in art  
This cowards got it once cause he kept his lips zippin  
Now he in the news and he wettin and Im livin  
This Southern cowards life who I used to do my clues with  
Subliminally this is me I try not to assume shit  
Lets not forget the king of Internet  
Will assume another name while he tarnishes ya rep  
And calls you Ziggy Starters but who the major charm  
Who starts to elevate out the reach of his arm  
  
Its a great day fuck it  
Ya probably hear the bundles overflowin out of Ruckers  
The name is Abstract dont confuse without description  
Cause you lil gremlins envy so just cut the fuckin weak shit  
Ride off in the night V8 lost power  
From a soundbomb killin the lone ranger drillin  
You eager with ya mouth then just be a big proactive  
Ya actin with ya heart then start preachin with ya fatness  
The clear voyage psychic MC is a minion  
You cornered and you bagged in so where you gon run to  
Used to get my mothers switches now I grant her wishes  
Never superstitious breakin mirrors with the pitches  
Ya man is insane with that dodo on his chain  
Funkin up the joint he pain that aint a bling thats a blang  
Besides can he rap about a real life vision  
Success lies a struggle thats what most of yall are missin  
Got so many sons I wish I had as many ones  
Clown niggas raps get converted into guns  
Illuminati president its a government official  
They dogs and they henchmen is comin out to get you  
The age of Aquarius the change is goin on  
We gotta keep strivin movin on  
  
Ya dead wrong ya wrong ya know ya wrong  
Ya know ya wrong for that  
Now why ya gotta go and do that  
Ya dead wrong ya wrong ya know ya wrong  
And you know you know you are ooh  
And you know you know you are
