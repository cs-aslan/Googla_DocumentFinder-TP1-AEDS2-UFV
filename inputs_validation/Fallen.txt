Run for cover my sense of fear is running thin  
Undercover just like a candle in the wind  
  
Tell everybody tell everybody  
Brothers sisters the ending is coming  
  
Oh we are fallen we are fallen  
Oh we are fallen we are fallen  
Now were just gonna ride it out  
  
Every morning Im staring shadows in the eye  
Oh good morning will you just wait until I die  
  
Tell everybody tell everybody  
Brothers sisters the ending is coming  
  
Oh we are fallen we are fallen  
Oh we are fallen we are fallen  
Now were just gonna ride it out  
  
Tell everybody tell everybody  
Tell everybody we are fallen  
Oh we are fallen we are fallen  
Oh we are fallen we are fallen  
Now were just gonna ride it out  
  
I just want to take it in  
Even when your fire runs out  
Will you start it up again  
We are fallen
