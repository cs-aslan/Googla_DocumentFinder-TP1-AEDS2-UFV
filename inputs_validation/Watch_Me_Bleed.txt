Heaven comes to he who waits  
But I know Im getting nowhere  
And all the deeds of yesterday  
Have really helped to pave my way  
Though theres no one near me now  
How come everyone can touch me  
You see the torture on my brow  
Relates to neither here nor now  
  
Watch me bleed  
Bleed forever  
Although my face is straight it lies  
My body feels the pain and cries  
  
Here the table is not bare  
I am full but feeling empty  
For all the warmth it feels so cold  
For one so young I feel so old  
  
Watch me bleed  
Bleed forever  
Its not allowed to be unkind  
But still the hate lives in my mind  
  
Ill make no noise  
Ill hide my pain  
Ill close my eyes  
I wont complain  
Ill lie right back and take the blame  
And try to tell myself Im living  
And when its all been said or done  
Where do I go  
Where do I run  
Whats left of me or anyone when weve denied the hurting
