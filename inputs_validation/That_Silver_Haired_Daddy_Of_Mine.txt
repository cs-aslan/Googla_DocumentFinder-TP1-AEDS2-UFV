In a vine covered  
Shack in the mountains  
Bravely fighting  
The battle of time  
Theres a dear one  
Whos wept  
Through lifes sorrows  
Its that silver  
Haired daddy of mine  
  
If I could recall  
All the heartaches  
Dear ole daddy  
Ive caused you to bear  
If I could erase  
Those lines from your face  
And bring back  
The gold to your hair  
If God would but  
Grant me the power  
Just to turn back  
The pages of time  
I would give all  
I own just to put a tone  
To that silver  
Haired daddy of mine
