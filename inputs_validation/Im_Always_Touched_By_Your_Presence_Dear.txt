Was it destiny  
I dont know yet  
Was it just by chance  
Could this be kismet  
Something in my consciousness told me youd appear  
Now Im always touched by your presence dear  
When we play at cards you use an extra sense  
Its really not cheating you know  
You can read my hand Ive got no defence  
When you send your messages whispered loud and clear  
Im always touched by your presence dear  
Floating pass the evidence of possibilities  
We could navigate together psychic frequencies  
Coming into contact with outer entities  
We could entertain each one with our theosophies  
Stay awake at night and count your REMs  
When youre talking with your super friends  
Levitating lovers in the secret stratosphere  
I am still in touch with your presence dear  
I am still in touch with your presence dear
