What is so rare as a day in June  
Till now we have never been told  
The old questions answered by one that is new  
What is so rare dear as you  
  
So rare youre like the fragrance of blossoms fair  
Sweet as a breath of air  
Fresh with the morning dew  
So rare Youre like the sparkle of old champagne  
Orchids in cellophane  
Couldnt compare to you  
You are perfection youre my idea  
Of angels singing the Ave Maria  
For youre an angel I breathe and live you  
With every beat of the heart that I give you  
So rare This is a heaven on earth we share  
Caring the way we care  
Ours is a love so rare  
  
So rare You have the warmth of a Schubert air  
Charming and debonaire  
Those are the words for you  
So rare You have a way thats beyond compare  
That one in a million air  
In everything you do  
You have that something that certain manner  
You thrill me more than the Star Spangled Banner  
You stage a love scene so sweetly tender  
And in that love scene I gladly surrender  
So rare to have a future like yours to share  
Sweetheart the way we care
