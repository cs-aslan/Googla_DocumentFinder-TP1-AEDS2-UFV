Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
  
Its too sad to point the finger  
I told the boy to look at me  
But what you say it never lingers  
Its not what you say but what you see  
  
Boy look at me  
I couldnt look no better see  
  
Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
  
Its too sad that love would sting you  
You told the girl that it would be  
A kind of love thats deep within you  
A boys a boy but did they say hed be  
  
For eternity  
Or just a mystery  
  
Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
  
Mystery boy  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Mystery mystery mystery boy  
  
Its too sad to point the finger  
I told the boy to look at me  
Its too sad that love might sting you  
You told the girl that it would be  
Some kind of love thats deep within you  
Some dream thats hard to see  
  
Mystery boy
