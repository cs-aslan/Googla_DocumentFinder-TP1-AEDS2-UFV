When you feel so far away  
Though youre close to everything  
And the feeling of estrangements  
Creeping up on spiders legs  
Even in these days of wonder  
Even in the age of faith  
There are some who goin under  
There are some who got it made  
In the middle of the night  
When the last of god has died  
And the only thing youve got  
Is the tic toc of the clock  
Im here by your side  
In these days full of wonder  
So you passed so many years  
In a labyrinth of traces  
Running round and round they led  
To no one but yourself
