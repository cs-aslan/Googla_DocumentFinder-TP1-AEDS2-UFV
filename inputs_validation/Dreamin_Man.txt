Im a dreamin man yes thats my problem  
I cant tell when Im not being real  
In the meadow dusk I park my Aerostar  
With a loaded gun and sweet dreams of you  
  
Ill always be a dreamin man  
I dont have to understand  
I know its alright  
  
I see your curves and I feel your vibrations  
You dressed in black and white you lost in the mall  
I watch you disappear past Club Med Vacations  
Another sleepless night a sun that wont fall  
  
Ill always be a dreamin man  
I dont have to understand  
I know its alright  
  
Now the night is gone a new day is dawning  
And our homeless dreams go back to the street  
Another time or place another civilization  
Would really make this life feel so complete  
  
Ill always be a dreamin man  
I dont have to understand  
I know its alright  
  
Dreamin man  
Hes got a problem  
Dreamin man  
Dreamin man  
Hes got a problem  
Dreamin man
