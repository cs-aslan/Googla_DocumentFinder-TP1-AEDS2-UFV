I remember Sunday mornings walking on the beach  
And that place wed stop for breakfast with the old red vinyl seats  
The hours of the tide chart  
The way the sunlight dance upon your face  
  
That antique roller coaster you just had to ride  
I remember how you laughed at the terror in my eyes  
The color and the detail  
Just like it was yesterday  
  
And I remember how you held me the night my father died  
I didnt have to tell you  
I just broke down and cried  
Youre sewn into the fabric the pieces of my life  
And I just cant remember why we said goodbye  
  
Up and down this boardwalk lonely people sit  
I know it wasnt perfect but nothin ever is  
The sails out in the harbor  
Are searching for the wind  
  
I just had to call you I had to hear your voice  
And tell you I still love you we still have a choice  
Youre sewn into the fabric the pieces of my life  
And I just cant remember why we said goodbye  
  
Everything I do  
Leads back to you  
I know I just cant let us go  
  
There must have been a reason but I cant remember now  
I know if I could hold you we could work it out  
Youre sewn into the fabric the pieces of my life  
And girl lets give it one more try  
Cause I just cant remember why we said goodbye
