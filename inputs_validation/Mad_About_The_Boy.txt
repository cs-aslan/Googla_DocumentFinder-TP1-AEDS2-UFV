She never has to worry and she never has to try  
Shes never in a hurry and I know the reason why  
Shes got her Daddys and her fingers in some pies  
She makes a double of a trouble with her lies  
  
She says Oh Im mad about the boy  
She says Oh Im mad about the boy  
She says Oh Im mad about the boy  
  
Shes always late to meet me and she always has to go  
To make another entry at another coolie show  
She is a dirty little lady but I know  
She only has to say the chorus and I go  
  
She says Oh Im mad about the boy  
She says Ohohoh Im mad about the boy  
She says Oh Im mad about the boy  
  
Dont tell me your troubles  
Ive got troubles that would make you scream and shout  
Dont tell me your troubles  
Ive got troubles I will tell you all about  
No I dont take a drink no I wont take a drink  
But I sure take some ups and some downs  
You makes me so weary  
You pick me up to put me down  
Dont tell me your troubles  
Ive got troubles that would make you scream and shout  
Dont tell me your troubles  
Ive got troubles I will tell you all about  
No I dont take a drink no I wont take a drink  
But I sure take some ups and some downs  
You makes me so weary  
You pick it up and put me down  
You never have to worry and you never have to try  
Youre never in a hurry and I know the reason why  
You got your Daddies and your fingers in some pies  
You makes a double of a trouble with your lies  
  
You say Oh Im mad about the boy  
You say Ohohoh Im mad about the boy  
You say Oh Im mad about the boy
