Full moon in a dirty sky  
Thats all we can hope for yeah  
  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
  
Dont be surprised  
By the way it is  
Ive broken bones for less yes  
  
I took a voyage took a voyage  
On the deep blue sea deep blue sea  
But I had to swim away  
I swam away that day  
  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
  
I took a voyage  
On the deep blue sea wont come back  
  
Innocence is what we want  
Now even children think that way yeah  
  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
Full moon in a dirty sky  
  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
  
I took a voyage yeah  
On the deep blue sea  
  
I took a voyage yeah  
On the deep blue sea
