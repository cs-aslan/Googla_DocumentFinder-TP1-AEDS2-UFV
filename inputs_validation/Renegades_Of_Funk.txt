Were the renegades of this time and age  
This is the time and age of renegades  
Renegades of this time and age  
This is the time and age of renegades  
  
Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece  
Right down through the Middle Ages  
Planet earth kept going through changes  
And then no renaissance came and times continued to change  
Nothing stayed the same but there were always renegades  
Like Chief Sitting Bull Tom Paine  
Dr Martin Luther King Malcom X  
They were renegades of their time and age  
The mighty renegades  
  
Were the renegades of funk  
Were the renegades of funk  
Were the renegades of funk  
Were the renegades of funk  
  
From a different solar system many many galaxies away  
We are the force of another creation  
A new musical revelation  
And were on this musical mission to help the others listen  
And groove from land to land singin electronic chants like  
Zulu nation  
  
Revelations  
Destroy all nations  
Destroy all nations  
Destroy all nations  
Destroy all nations  
Destroy all nations  
Destroy all nations  
  
Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies  
They change the course of history  
Everyday people like you and me  
Were the renegades were the people  
With our own philosophies  
We change the course of history  
Everyday people like you and me  
  
Cmon

Were teachers of the funk  
And not of empty popping  
Were blessed with the force and the sight of electronics  
With the bass and the treble the horns and our vocals  
Cause every time I pop into the beat we get fresh  
  
There was a time when our music  
Was something called the Big Street beat  
People would gather from all around  
To get down to the big sound  
You had to be a renegade those days  
To take a man to the dance floor  
  
Repeat x2  
Say jam sucker jam sucker

Say move sucker move sucker  
Say groove sucker move sucker  
Say dance sucker dance sucker  
Say dance sucker dance sucker  
Now move sucker move sucker
