While the rich get their kicks with their affluent antics  
Mr Black sits and ponders their fate  
He just sits in the gloom of his dimlylit room  
Waiting for them to swallow the bait  
  
While the rich run their rackets he sits in his attic  
And casually clocks their defeat  
While the politicians cover up mistakes that theyve made  
And all the promises the lies and deceits  
  
A military coup has been long overdue  
Now theres fighting and panic in the streets  
Amid the mass disillusion disorder and confusion  
He will rise now his plan is complete  
  
But me Im only standing here  
Watching it all go on and Im watching it all go wrong  
And its painfully clear that the battle is near  
And I wish I could just disappear  
  
While Flash and his men drink champagne in their den  
And debase life with crude ostentation  
The poor cry for more but theyre reaching the point  
Where the people cant stand any more  
  
But me Im only standing here  
Watching it all go on and Im watching it all go wrong  
And its painfully clear that the battle is near  
And I wish I could just disappear
