Walk in my shadow  
My throat is dry  
My knees are weak  
Its so damned hot  
I cant even speak  
  
Walk in my shadow  
I cant take it anymore  
When I get you in the shadows  
I gonna show you what its for  
  
Yes I know baby  
Thats a shady kind of deal  
I just want to find out  
How you feel  
  
Walk in my shadow  
I aint gonna take it anymore  
When I get you in the shadow  
Im gonna give you whats in store  
  
Yes I know you say Im stupid  
It just wouldnt be cool  
Well I can tell baby that  
I aint no fool  
  
Walk in my shadow  
I cant take it anymore  
When I get you in the shadow  
Im gonna lay you on the floor  
  
When I get you in the shadow  
Im gonna give you whats in store
