Hey I used to go on tour ya know and Id be a prisoner I used to be a  
Prisoner on tour cause I would go on tour and tour youre supposed to enjoy

Maintain this ya know emmaculate sounding voice but thats not realistic ya  
Know reality is sometimes I stay up late and this is what I sound like when I  
Wake up the next day and ya know its a voice ya know and to me the the more I  
Uh focus less on myself the more I realize I can be used to spread a message  
Because when I am I used to be so ya know oh my god if I sound ya know harsh  
And rhaspy I cant go out there thats a lie ya know I just sound like a  
Singer with a lot of stuff in her throat
