Born to lose Ive lived my life in vain  
Every dream has only brought me pain  
All my life Ive always been so blue  
Born to lose and now Im losing you  
  
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear  
How I long to always have you near  
Youve grown tired and now you say were thru  
Born to lose and now Im losing you  
  
Born to lose my every hope is gone  
Its so hard to face an empty dawn  
You were all the happiness I knew  
Born to lose and now Im losing you  
  
Theres no use to dream of happiness  
All I see is only loneliness  
All my life Ive always been so blue  
Born to lose and now Im losing you
