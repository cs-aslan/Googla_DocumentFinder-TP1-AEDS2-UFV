Im going to take you to  
My special place  
Its a place that you  
Like no one else I know  
Might appreciate  
I dont go there with anyonebut  
Youre a special case  
For my special place  
For my secret place  
  
People talk to tell you something  
Or to take up space  
Guess Im only talking  
To be talking to  
Your pretty face  
I dont talk much to anyone but  
Youre a special case  
For my special place  
My secret place  
  
I was born and raised  
In New York City  
Im just getting used to Colorado  
Oh street bravado  
Carry me  
Why did you bring me to  
A place so wild and pretty  
Are there pigeons in this park  
Muggers after dark  
In these golden trees  
In the secret place  
  
Im going to take you to  
My special place  
Its a place no amount of hurt and anger  
Can deface  
I put things back together there  
It all falls right in place  
In my special space  
My special place  
  
Once I saw a film  
In New York City  
That was shot in Colorado  
Girl meets desperado  
In the trembling mountain trees  
Out of all of the girls that you see  
In bleachers and cafe windows  
Sitting flirting with someone  
Looking to have some fun  
Why did you pick me  
For the secret place
