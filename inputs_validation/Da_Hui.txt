A haole with heart thats all Ill ever be

A haole with heart thats all Ill ever be  
Cause Im not a part of the North Shore royalty  
Stuck on the shoulder Im not complaining  
Digging for scraps Im a kook in line  
  
A haole with heart thats all Ill ever be  
Cause Im not a part of the North Shore society  
Stuck on the shoulder thats where youll find me  
Digging for scraps with the kooks in line
