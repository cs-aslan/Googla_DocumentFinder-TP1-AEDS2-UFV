Ive been all around the world  
Ive been a new sensation  
But it doesnt really matter  
In this generation  
The sophomore slump is an uphill battle  
And someone said that in my scene  
Cause they need a new song  
Like a new religion  
Music for the television  
I cant do the long division  
Someone do the math  
For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer  
Got to find another way to live the life of leisure  
So I drop my top  
Mix and I mingle  
Is everybody ready for the single and it goes  
  
Chorus  
Ha La La La La  
Now listen closer to the verse I lay  
Ha La La La La  
Its all about the wordplay  
Ha La La La Love  
The wonderful thing it does  
Because because  
I am the wizard of oohs and ahs and falalas  
Yeah the Mister AZ  
They say Im all about the wordplay  
  
And its time to get ill I got your remedy  
For those who dont remember me  
Well let me introduce you to my style  
I try to keep a jumble  
And the lyrics never mumble  
When the musics makin people tonguetied  
You want a new song  
Like a new religion  
Music for the television  
I cant do the long division  
Someone do the math  
For the poeple write me off like Im a onehit wonder  
Got to find another way to keep from goin under  
Pull out the stops  
Got your attention  
I guess its time again for me to mention  
The wordplay  
  
Chorus  
  
I built a bridge across the stream of consciousness  
It always seems to be a flowin  
But I dont which way my brain is goin  
Oh the ryhmin and the timin  
Keeps the melodies inside me  
And theyre comin  
Til Im running out of air  
Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head  
Are you listening to a single word Ive said  
  
Listen closer to the words I say  
Were sticken to the wordplay  
Ha La La La Love  
The wonderful thing it does  
Because because  
I am the wizard of oohs and ahs and falalas  
Yeah the Mister AZ  
They say Im all about the wordplay  
  
Im all about the wordplay  
Stickin with the wordplay  
Ha La La La Love  
I love the wonderful thing it does  
Because because  
The ohs and ahs and falalas fall back in love  
For the Mister AZ they say  
Is all about the wordplay
