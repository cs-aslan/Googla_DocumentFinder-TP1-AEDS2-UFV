Im laughing and clowning  
Just to keep from crying  
Im laughing and clowning  
Just to keep from crying  
  
Im trying to hide the fact  
That Ive got a worried mind  
  
Being the life of the party  
Seems to be my role  
Ever since you left me girl  
Being the life of the party  
Seems to be my role  
  
Im trying to hide my feelings  
And Im trying to hide my soul  
Yes I am  
  
Well listen one more thing  
  
I stand in the doorway  
Watching all the girls go through  
I stand in the doorway  
Watching all the girls go through  
  
Yes I do  
  
Im trying to find me somebody  
To make my mind off of you  
  
Pick it for me son  
  
Whoa I keep laughing and clowning  
To make my mind off of you girl
