Hey You You too  
I could make the choice for you  
Just sticks close to you its all around me  
Everything I try to do  
I cant even seem to find the room to move  
  
But you think youre number 1 hey  
Act as tho them dinners gone  
  
You Carried in a room for one You too  
Darkness when the lights are on  
Turn me on for good its so exciting  
Slogans on the wall dont need no underlining  
I cant even seem to find the room to move  
  
Tackles you in fantasy Hey  
Hoping for some time to breathe  
You Some might get your corpse to easy You too  
I just want some time to breathe  
Just sticks close to you its all around me  
Everything I do theyre always trying to crowd me  
I cant even seem to find the room to move  
  
Watching every move you make Hey  
Choice of one thats hard to take You  
In fact its just a big mistake You too  
In fact they make it feel like you  
Maggots swarm inside the line Hey  
Ready for the perfect crime  
Say you there is no right or wrong You too  
I dont know whats right or wrong  
I dont know whats right or wrong
