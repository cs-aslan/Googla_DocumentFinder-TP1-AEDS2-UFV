Funny you can hold it in your hand  
And never cause youre afraid to play  
And you can feel your dreams  
Softly slipping through your fingers  
Till theyre so far away  
  
Sitting there surrounded  
By your many lifes possessions  
Feeling so much more than all the load  
You realized youve learned one more  
Of livings many lessons  
Loves worth more than all youll ever own  
  
Chorus  
What Id give if you were here beside me  
We could spend forever here alone  
Oh what Id give what would I give  
Just that moment  
Just everything Ill ever own  
  
Funny when I really had it all  
I never knew  
Cause I just couldnt see  
The wealth I hoped to find  
Couldnt even hold a candle  
To the love you gave to me  
  
Ive taken love for granted  
And Ive taken love for pleasure  
Never taking time to understand  
Now I know that loving you  
Has been my greatest treasure  
And I let it slip right through my hands  
  
Chorus
