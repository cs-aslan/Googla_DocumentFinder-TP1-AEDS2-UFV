I wake up every evening  
With a big smile on my face  
And it never feels out of place  
And youre still probably working  
At a 9 to 5 pace  
I wonder how bad that tastes  
  
When you see my face  
I hope it gives you hell I hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
I hope it gives you hell I hope it gives you hell  
  
Now wheres your picket fence love  
And wheres that shiny car  
Did it ever get you far  
You never seem so tense love  
I never seen you fall so hard  
Do you know where you are  
  
And truth be told I miss you  
And truth be told Im lying  
  
When you see my face  
Hope it gives you hell Hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
Hope it gives you hell Hope it gives you hell  
If you find a man thats worth the damn and treats you well  
Treats you well  
Then hes a fool youre just as well hope it gives you hell  
Hope it gives you hell  
  
Tomorrow youll be thinking to yourself  
Yeah Where did it all go wrong  
But the list goes on and on  
  
And truth be told I miss you  
And truth be told Im lying  
  
When you see my face  
Hope it gives you hell Hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
Hope it gives you hell Hope it gives you hell  
If you find a man thats worth the damn and treats you well  
Treats you well  
Then hes a fool youre just as well hope it gives you hell  
  
Now youll never see  
What youve done to me  
You can take back your memories  
Theyre no good to me  
And heres all your lies  
You can look me in the eyes  
With the sad sad look  
That you wear so well  
  
When you see my face  
I hope it gives you hell I hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
I hope it gives you hell I hope it gives you hell  
If you find a man thats worth the damn and treats you well  
Treats you well  
Then hes a fool youre just as well hope it gives you hell  
  
When you see my face  
I hope it gives you hell I hope it gives you hell  
hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
I hope it gives you hell I hope it gives you hell  
hope it gives you hell  
When you hear this song and you sing along well youll never tell  
youll never tell  
Then youre the fool Ive just as well I hope it gives you hell  
gives you hell  
When you hear this song I hope that it will give you hell  
give you hell  
You can sing along I hope that he will treat you well
