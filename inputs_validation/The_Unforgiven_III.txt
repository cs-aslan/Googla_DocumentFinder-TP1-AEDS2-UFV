How could he know this new dawns light  
Would change his life forever  
Set sail to sea but pulled off course  
By the light of golden treasure  
  
Was he the one causing pain  
With his careless dreaming  
Been afraid  
Always afraid  
Of the things hes feeling  
He could just be gone  
  
He would just sail on  
He would just sail on  
  
How can I be lost  
If Ive got nowhere to go  
Searched the seas of gold  
How come its got so cold  
How can I be lost  
In remembrance I relive  
How can I blame you  
When its me I cant forgive  
  
These days drift on inside a fog  
Its thick and suffocating  
This seeking life outside its hell  
Inside intoxicating  
Hes run aground  
Like his life  
Waters much too shallow  
Slipping fast  
Down with the ship  
Fading in the shadows now  
A castaway  
  
Blame  
All gone  
Away  
  
Blame gone away  
  
How can I be lost  
If Ive got nowhere to go  
Search for seas of gold  
How come its got so cold  
How can I be lost  
In remembrance I relive  
And how can I blame you  
When its me I cant forgive  
  
Forgive me  
Forgive me not  
Forgive me  
Forgive me not  
Forgive me  
Forgive me not  
Forgive me  
Forgive me why cant I forgive me  
  
Set sail to sea but pulled off course  
By the light of golden treasure  
How could he know this new dawns light  
Would change his life forever  
  
How can I be lost  
If Ive got nowhere to go  
Search for seas of gold  
How come its got so cold  
How can I be lost  
In remembrance I relive  
So how can I blame you  
When its me I cant forgive
