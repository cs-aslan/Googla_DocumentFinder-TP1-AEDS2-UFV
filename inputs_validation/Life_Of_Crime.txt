Lying and cheating  
Taking all I can get  
Always wanting more  
Its time to even the score  
  
Winners and losers  
Always come and go  
As soon as I get it  
I gotta let it go  
  
I can hear you say  
I can hear you say  
  
Ladies of the night  
Give me what youve got  
I aint looking for love  
Just want some action  
  
Were headed for a life of crime  
Keep running till the day we die  
Were headed for a life of crime  
But its too late now  
Weve already crossed the line  
  
This nowhere train youre riding  
Is going nowhere fast  
You better watch your step  
Or youre gonna burn in hell  
  
I can hear them say  
I can hear them say  
  
Were headed for a life of crime  
Keep running till the day we die  
Were headed for a life of crime  
But its too late now  
Weve already crossed the line
