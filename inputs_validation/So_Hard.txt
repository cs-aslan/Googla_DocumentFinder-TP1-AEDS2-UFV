I doublecross you  
And you get mysterious mail  
Ive tried hard not to shock you  
Its hard not to with the things I could say  
Tell me why dont we try  
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves  
Why dont we try  
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves  
  
You lock your letters in a box  
And youve hidden the key  
I go one better Im indebted  
To a contact magazine  
Tell me why dont we try  
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves  
Why dont we try  
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for us  
  
Everybodys got to live together  
Just to find a little peace of mind there  
If you give up your affairs forever  
I will give up mine  
But its hard  
So hard  
  
Im always hoping youll be faithful  
But youre not I suppose  
Weve both given up smoking cause its fatal  
So whose matches are those  
Tell me why dont we try  
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves  
  
We make it so hard  
  
Tell me why dont we try  
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves  
Tell me why dont we try  
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves  
Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves  
We make it so hard for ourselves  
We make it so hard  
So hard  
We make it so hard
