When the mellow moon begins to beam  
Every night I dream a little dream  
And of course Prince Charming is the theme  
The he for me  
Although I realize as well as you  
It is seldom that a dream comes true  
To me its clear  
That hell appear  
  
Some day hell come along the man I love  
And hell be big and strong the man I love  
And when he comes my way  
Ill do my best to make him stay  
  
Hell look at me and smile Ill understand  
And in a little while hell take my hand  
And though it seems absurd  
I know we both wont say a word  
  
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday  
Maybe Monday maybe not  
Still Im sure to meet him one day  
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day  
  
Hell build a little home just meant for two  
From which Ill never roam who would would you  
And so all else above  
Im waiting for the man I love
