Tired of riding freeways  
Tired so tired of fighting the crowd  
Repetition ecstatic trips flow   
  
Im tired of my best friends  
Tired of feeling used  
Talkin small talk movin slow  
  
Tired of feeling guilty  
Im tired Im tired of standing still  
I had big dreams whered they go  
Tell me where did my dreams go  
  
Doin business dressed in gray  
Try to make it payday to payda  
Doin business here to stay  
  
Im tired of the program  
Tired tired of playing the game  
Television radio  
Tell me where did the dreams go  
  
Doin business in control  
Life on a schedule heart and soul  
Doin business its to go
