All you hoes be cryin for these bitches  
All you niggas be cryin for these hoes  
  
Both hands clusty Ghost Pullin out gats  
Double barreled Meth Blew off the burner kinda dusty  
We back dont test Raekwon Bring it to em proper potnah  
Comin from the thirtysix chamber  
Math let the plate spin Many brothers yall be sparkin  
Stray shots all on the block that stays hot  
If ya fuck with Wu we gots ta fuck witchu  
  
Who the fuck knocked our buildings down  
Who the man behind the World Trade massacres step up now  
Where the four planes at huh is you insane bitch  
Fly that shit over my hood and get blown to bits  
No disrespect thats where I rest my head  
I understand you gotta rest yours true nigga my peoples dead  
America together we stand divided we fall  
Mr Bush sit down Im in charge of the war  
  
Yes yes yall the INS bless yall  
Stop hearts like cholesterol lets brawl  
Never fall tear it down like a wreckin ball  
Role call where my niggas thats one for all  
And all for one we draw the guns on impulse  
Cash in the envelope spend it on kinfolk  
Then smoke a ounce as we count mills  
Providin you pure ecstasy without pills  
  
Chorus  
Yall know the rules we dont fuck with fools man  
How the fuck did we get so cool man  
Never ever disrespect my crew  
If ya fuck with Wu we gots ta fuck witchu  
  
Yall dogs better guard ya grills its all real  
We live from  its the God IReelz  
Yo wonderful spark the blillz  
Let me build with the people for the mills  
Im rollin with the Rebel IIll from Killa Hill peace to Brownsville  
Brothers thatll kill for the will of the righteous  
Twentyfive to lifers true and livin snipers  
You wait like Sixth Sense til hard to kill  
  
How you livin StreetLife Im surrounded by criminals  
Serial killers tote guns without the serial  
Hightech street intellect all digital  
Project original sheisty individual  
New Yorks bravest always supply you with the latest  
We hall of famers and still hit you with the greatest  
Took a year hiatus now you wanna hate us  
Thanks to all you haters for all the cream you made us  
  
Chorus  
  
Sendin letters to  my cousin in Wendys on Viacom  
At home its worth money I adorns  
Order drinks all real niggas order your minks yo  
We got the fitteds on lookin all fink  
Daddy everybody get money from now on  
Payday flash Visas livin like Easter everyday  
Dont fuck Benz rather a 430  
That shit that float through water eyeball come up drop birdies yo  
  
We can eat right or we can clap these toys  
Im with StreetLife aint never been a Backstreet Boy  
Who yall kiddin Tryin to act like my shoe fittin  
Confused with ya head up yo ass like whos shittin  
Its Hot Nixon same team same position  
Battin average threefiveseven and still hittin  
Yall still bitchin still lame and still chicken  
Im still here one leg missin and still kickin  
Cause Im hard Hard like a criminal  
Love like a tennis shoe throw slug to finish you  
Its the Method Man for short Mr Meth  
I can tell this motherfucker aint Wu look at his neck  
  
Comin from the thirtysix chamber  
Bring it to em proper potnah  
Wu Tang Wu Tang  
  
Its WuTang rushin yo gang crushin the game  
Pretty thugs clutchin they chain hand cuppin they thing  
Who get strange gassed up playin with flames  
Let a nigga take off his shades see what Im sayin is  
  
Chorus
