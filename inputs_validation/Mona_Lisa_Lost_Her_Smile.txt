Chorus  
Mona Lisa lost her smile  
The painters hands are trembling now  
And if shes out there running wild  
Its just because I taught her how  
The masterpiece that we had planned  
Is laying shattered on the ground  
Mona Lisa lost her smile  
And the painters hands are trembling now  
Verse I  
And the eyes that used to burn for me  
Now they no longer look my way  
And the love that used to be  
Why it just got lost in yesterday  
And if she seems cold to the touch  
Well there used to burn a flame  
I gave too little took too much  
Til I erased the painters name
