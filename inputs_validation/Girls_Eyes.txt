Girls eyes butterflies how she cries cant get through to you  
She knows all the charts breaks her heart thinks a lot of you  
Each time you play a melody it means the earth to this little girl  
Can you be cruel and break her heart tear her small world apart  
  
Shes there eyes aglow very front row dont throw sticks at her  
Please dont look her way see her way dont care anyway  
  
Its you who led her on I see  
Just leave her down in her misery  
She dont want help from you and me  
Cant tell a note from a symphony  
  
Its you who led her on I see
