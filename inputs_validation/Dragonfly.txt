Everybodys worried about time  
But I just keep that shit off my mind  
People living on twenty four hour clocks  
Everybodys worried about time  
But I just keep that shit off my mind  
People living on twenty four hour clocks  
But were on a ride that never stops  
  
Hey Mister Bee the world change but you remain the same  
And I wonder how youll survive with the environment going down the drain  
Hey Miss Dragonfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes  
You must be wondering what type of creature am I  
  
A dog looked at me and said Ziggy why cant we trust man  
Puss and me get together so why cant you all just understand  
An old tree stood there silently listening to every word we said  
As a tear fell he cried what type of creature is man  
  
I said hey Mister Tree the world change but you remain the same  
And I wonder how you survive with the environment going down the drain  
Hey Miss Butterfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes  
You must be wondering what type of creature am I  
You must be wondering what type of creature am I  
  
Everybodys worried about time  
But I just keep that shit off my mind  
People living on twenty four hour clocks  
But were on a ride yes were on a ride were on a ride that never stops  
  
Hey Mister Bee the world change but you remain the same  
And I hope youll survive while the environment is going down the drain  
Hey Miss Dragonfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes  
You must be wondering what type of creature am I  
You must be wondering what type of creature is man
