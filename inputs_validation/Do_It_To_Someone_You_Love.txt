The words I love you come easy to the lips of a liar or a fool  
If love talking is what youre thinking of then do it to someone you love  
Do it to someone you love  
Some little things to let them know theyre all youre thinking of  
This day and time a little thing you do could mean so much  
So do it to someone you love  
  
A smile comes easy to a strange hello to someone that you never met  
But an old love dont need that smile it glows with just a touch  
So do it to someone you love  
Do it to someone you love
