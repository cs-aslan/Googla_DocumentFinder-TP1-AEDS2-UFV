Well I was born at a party in a barn  
With a guitar strapped across my arm  
So I learned to play in a different style  
Everyone knows that Im hog wild  
  
Well I pick it high and I pick it low  
Pick it with my teeth and pick it with my toe  
You can hear me play for a country mile  
Everybody knows that Im hog wild  
Everybody knows that Im hog wild  
  
Well I laid around on the farm too long  
Me and them city folks couldnt get along  
My momma said Youre a destined child  
They all know yous born hog wild  
  
So I traveled all over this land  
And I found myself a backwoods band  
You could hear us play for a country mile  
Everybody knows that were hog wild  
Yeah everybody knows that were hog wild  
  
Everybody knows that were hog wild  
Everybody knows that were hog wild  
Everybody knows that I play loud  
Everybody know everybody knows everybody knows  
Everybody knows that were hog wild  
  
Make it wild make it wild  
Make it wild make it wild  
Make it wild make it wild  
Rootin around town
