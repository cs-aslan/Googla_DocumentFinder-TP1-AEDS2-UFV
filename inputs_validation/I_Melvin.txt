  
Mascara hides the sleepless nights  
Years of abuse the downs and highs  
A lonely drunk staggers on stage  
Weathered and worn battered and broken I feel my age  
Like a puppet on strings look he strums and he sings I feel like a cartoon  
Im alone on the stage Im the man on the moon  
Im the deer in the headlights Im the fish in the bowl  
Im on automatic pilot I am remote controlled  
Just a second guitarist playing on the 3rd string  
Im the disclaimer Im a walking routine  
Im happily a cog stand me up plug me in  
Like a robot I play all the songs with a grin  
I am Eric Melvin
