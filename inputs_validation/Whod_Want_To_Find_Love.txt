Who whod want to find love  
Its not as if we know what to look for  
Looking out but not sure  
Who whod want to find love  
Maybe cause its not come around yet  
Still I really dont care  
Who whod want to find love  
Dont worry cause your drink isnt drunk  
So better let the rest go  
Shes a lover with a chemical heart  
Only ever talks about the obvious part  
The place was empty not its body heat heart  
Only hear a few words telling me what it felt like  
In the morning shes as good as unaffected  
But her face moves less than it out to  
And everyones just gone quiet  
Only in it for the postcard picture  
Only in it for the smoke of the gun  
Chorus  
Im not worried if the look doesnt last  
And theres something in the kiss  
I dont need to see past  
Theres a speech bubble on the top of my head  
That everyone sees no matter what I just said I  
Think about it too much  
Talk about it too much  
Cry about it too much  
Too much were spinning in circles  
Only in it for the postcard picture  
Only in it for the smoke of the gun  
Chorus  
So better let the rest go
