Shes out of my life  
Shes out of my life  
And I dont know whether to laugh or cry  
I dont know whether to live or die  
And it cuts like a knife  
Shes out of my life  
  
Its out of my hands  
Its out of my hands  
To think for two years she was here  
And I took her for granted I was so cavalier  
Now the way that it stands  
Shes out of my hands  
  
So Ive learned that loves not possession  
And Ive learned that love wont wait  
Now Ive learned that love needs expression  
But I learned too late  
  
Shes out of my life  
Shes out of my life  
Damned indecision and cursed pride  
Kept my love for her locked deep inside  
And it cuts like a knife  
Shes out of my life
