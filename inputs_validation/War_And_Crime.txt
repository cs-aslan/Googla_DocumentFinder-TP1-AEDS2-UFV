Every where in the world  
People are fighting for freedom  
Nobody knows what is right  
Nobody knows what is wrong  
The black man say its the white man  
The white man say its the black man  
Indians say its the colors  
Colors say its everyone  
  
Your mother didnt tell you the truth  
Cause my father didnt tell me the truth  
Nobody knows what is wrong  
And what is right  
How long is this gonna last  
Cause weve come so far so fast  
  
When it started you and I were not there so  
Why dont we  
Bury down apartheid  
Fight down war and crime  
Racial discrimination  
Tribal discrimination  
  
You and I were not there when it started  
We don t know where its coming from  
And where its going  
So why dont we  
  
Im not saying this  
Because Im a coward  
But Im thinking of the lives  
That we lose every time we fight  
Killing innocent people  
Women and children yeah  
Who doesnt know about the good  
Who doesnt know about the wars  
Your mother didnt tell you the truth  
Cause my father did not tell me the truth  
Yeah  
  
Black man say it s the white man  
White man say it s the black man  
Indians say it s the coloreds  
Coloreds say it s everyone  
  
When it started we were not there  
We know where we come from  
But we don t know where we re going  
So why don t we  
  
Bury down apartheid  
Fight down war and crime  
Racial discrimination  
Tribal discrimination
