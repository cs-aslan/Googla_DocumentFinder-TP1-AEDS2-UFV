Theres a scene  
Theres a scene  
Indelible it hangs before my eyes  
Indelible it hangs before my eyes  
In our teens incredibly  
In our teens incredibly  
Together with no ties  
Together with no ties  
  
That was a life enough for me  
That was a life enough for me  
One lifes enough for me  
One lifes enough for me  
  
Throw back your head  
Throw back your head  
Let your body curve  
Let your body curve  
Into the long grass of the bed  
Into the long grass of the bed  
Pull me down into your hair  
Pull me down into your hair  
  
And Ill push and swerve  
And Ill push and swerve  
As we both gasp in the evening air  
As we both gasp in the evening air  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Throw back your head  
Throw back your head  
Let your body curve  
Let your body curve  
Into the long grass of the bed  
Into the long grass of the bed  
Pull me down into your hair  
Pull me down into your hair  
And Ill push and swerve  
And Ill push and swerve  
As we both gasp in the evening air  
As we both gasp in the evening air
