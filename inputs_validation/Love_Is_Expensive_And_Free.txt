You can talk to me about powderkegs  
And how Im sittin on one right now  
You can warn me about candles  
With both ends burning  
From the outside in  
  
But dont tell me about true love  
Because I dont think you really know  
  
You need to pay the cost  
You need to feel the loss  
Cause love is expensive and free  
Love is expensive and free  
  
Talk to me about appearances  
Ill tell you lately they mean less and less  
Do your best to keep me occupied  
Its hard to concentrate  
I must confess  
  
Dont you tell me about heartbreak  
cause it aint written in the stars  
  
You need to pay the cost  
You need to feel the loss  
Love is expensive and free  
Love is expensive and free  
Love is expensive and free  
  
Alright  
You got me  
  
Dont you worry bout my baby  
Her eyes are open all the time  
I could never dare deceive her  
Much less remove her from my mind  
I didnt talk to you about true love  
I didnt think youd understand  
  
We need to pay the cost  
We need to feel the loss  
Love is expensive and free  
Love is expensive and free  
Love is expensive and free
