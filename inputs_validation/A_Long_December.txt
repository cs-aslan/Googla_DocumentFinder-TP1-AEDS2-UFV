A long December and theres reason to believe  
Maybe this year will be better than the last  
I cant remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin  
Now the days go by so fast  
  
And its one more day up in the canyons  
And its one more night in Hollywood  
If you think that I could be forgiven I wish you would  
  
The smell of hospitals in winter  
And the feeling that its all a lot of oysters but no pearls  
All at once you look across a crowded room  
To see the way that light attaches to a girl  
  
And its one more day up in the canyons  
And its one more night in Hollywood  
If you think you might come to California I think you should  
  
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two am  
And talked a little while about the year  
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower  
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her  
  
And its been a long December and theres reason to believe  
Maybe this year will be better than the last  
I cant remember all the times I tried to tell my myself  
To hold on to these moments as they pass  
  
And its one more day up in the canyon  
And its one more night in Hollywood  
Its been so long since Ive seen the ocean I guess I should  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
