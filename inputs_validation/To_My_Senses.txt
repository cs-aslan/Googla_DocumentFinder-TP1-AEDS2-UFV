Well its cold here in the quiet  
Drowning in the silence  
Of everythign I wish we used to be  
So many chances wasted  
And kisses left untasted  
So much that still burns inside of me  
  
I kept reaching out only to be shut down  
But now the truth is giving me away  
  
Ive been running yeah Ive been running  
But now Im coming to my senses  
  
I am humble by your splendor  
Awash in sweet surrender  
A thousand miles beyond the road to gone  
Well Im tired of being lonely  
And youre longing to show me  
All that Ive been missing much too long  
  
And like a warm and tender wind  
Im spellbound as I breathe you in  
And I know that you can see  
  
Chorus  
  
You and I could spend forever  
Making up for time together  
  
Pull me in and dont you fight it  
You and I yeah were both inside it  
  
Make my broken heart reborn  
Take me over like a raging storm  
  
Say goodbye time to surrender  
Follow me to the edge of forever
