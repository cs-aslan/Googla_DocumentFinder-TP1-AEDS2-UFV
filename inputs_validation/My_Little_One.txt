My little one as the years go by  
There may be times when your heart will cry  
And if your in need of a word of cheer  
You can always turn to me  
  
My little one though I love you so  
Therell come a day I must let you go  
But youll have my love for eternity  
Little one you are everything to me  
  
My darling I love you so much  
So much theres nothing in the world nothing that I wouldnt do for you  
And it gives me such a wonderful feeling to know your mine  
Fills me with more happiness than Ive ever known before  
And each night as you slip off to dream land  
I thank heaven for giving me you  
spoken verse ends  
  
My little one though I love you so  
Therell come a day I must let you go  
But youll have my love for eternity  
Little one you are everything to me
