If the fish swam out of the ocean  
And grew legs and they started walking  
And the apes climbed down from the trees  
And grew tall and they started talking  
  
And the stars fell out of the sky  
And my tears rolled into the ocean  
Now Im looking for a reason why  
You even set my world into motion  
  
Cause if youre not really here  
Then the stars dont even matter  
Now Im filled to the top with fear  
That its all just a bunch of matter  
  
Cause if youre not really here  
Then I dont wanna be either  
I wanna be next to you  
Black and gold black and gold black and gold  
  
I looked up into the gray sky  
And see a thousand eyes staring back  
And all around these golden beacons  
I see nothing but black  
  
I feel the weight of something beyond them  
I dont see what I can feel  
If vision is the only validation  
Then most of my life isnt real  
  
Cause if youre not really here  
Then the stars dont even matter  
Now Im filled to the top with fear  
That its all just a bunch of matter  
  
Cause if youre not really here  
Then I dont wanna be either  
I wanna be next to you  
Black and gold black and gold black and gold  
  
Cause if youre not really here  
Then the stars dont even matter  
Now Im filled to the top with fear  
That its all just a bunch of matter  
  
Cause if youre not really here  
Then I dont wanna be either  
I wanna be next to you  
Black and gold black and gold black and gold  
Black and gold black and gold  
Black and gold black and gold
