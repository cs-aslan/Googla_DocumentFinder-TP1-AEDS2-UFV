Baby I know youre hurting  
Right now you feel like you could never  
Love again  
Now all I ask is for a chance  
To prove that I love you  
  
From the first day  
That I saw your smiling face  
Honey I knew that we would  
Be together forever  
Ooh when I asked you out  
You said no but I found out  
Darling that youd been hurt  
You felt like youd never love again  
I deserve a try honey just once  
Give me a chance and Ill prove this all wrong  
You walked in you were so quick to judge  
But honey he s nothing like me  
  
Chorus x2  
Ill never break your heart  
Ill never make you cry  
Id rather die than live without you  
Ill give you all of me  
Honey thats no lie  
  
As time goes by  
You will get to know me  
A little more better  
Girl thats the way love goes baby baby  
And I I know youre afraid know youre afraid  
To let your feelings show feelings show  
And I understand  
Girl its time to let go girl its time to let go because  
I deserve a try try honey  
Just once once  
Give me a chance chance and Ill prove this all wrong wrong you walked  
You walked in you were so quick to judge quick to judge  
But honey hes nothing like me  
Darling why cant you see  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Bridge  
No way no how Ill never break your heart girl Ill never make you cry  
I swear Oh I oh I I swear  
No way no how Ill never break your heart girl Ill never make you cry  
  
Chorus x3
