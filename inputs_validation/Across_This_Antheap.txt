Soldiers workers slaves and farmers  
Nurses queens and drones  
Wish theyd leave my head tonight  
Let me rest my bones  
  
Ziggedy zig zag just look at em Ziggedy zag hey hey  
  
A billion feet sound just like a billion drums  
A bed is creaking as the messiah comes  
The cars are crashing and the bacon is hacked  
The coffins lowered and the lunches get packed  
Still segregating cause we insects are too proud  
Doesnt matter what colour of cat you are theres no dogs allowed  
  
And the screaming sky wont let me sleep  
The stars are laughing at us  
As we crawl on and on across this antheap  
  
War planes go over but no wages go round  
A sign goes up to say hey were twin towned  
The dough is rising but no bread will be baked  
The fur is genuine but the orgasms faked  
Were spending millions to learn to speak porpoise  
When human loneliness is still a deafening noise  
  
And the screaming sky wont let me sleep  
The stars are laughing at us  
As we crawl on and on across this antheap  
  
Soldiers workers slaves and farmers  
Nurses queens and drones  
Wish theyd leave my head tonight  
And let me rest my bones  
  
And all the worlds babies are crying still  
While all the police cars harmonize with power drills  
As jets and kettles form a chord with screeching gulls  
Accompanied by truncheons keeping time on human skulls  
  
And the screaming sky wont let me sleep  
The stars are laughing at us  
As we crawl on and on past lovers wholl leap  
On and on past widows wholl weep  
On and on no more than skin deep  
On and on across this antheap
