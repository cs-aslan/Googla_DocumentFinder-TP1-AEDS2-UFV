Like a bubble thats floating  
On high above  
I wont break down  
I wont cry  
But the colors are melting  
I am fragile  
  
Ive been acting so coldly  
And hope some day  
That you will forgive me  
  
You are the one  
That knows me for who I really am  
Itll all be gone in the morning  
We are lucky  
Owe it all to fortune  
  
Golden heart  
Tears of love  
Shining  
Will glow  
  
Theres a light at  
The end of the tunnel  
I am crawling slowly  
I am small  
  
Whats been up with me lately  
Hardly know me  
Whos that in the mirror  
  
You are the one  
That knows my moods of joy and anger  
Youve been coping and lonely  
We are lucky  
Owe it all to fortune  
  
Golden heart  
Tears of love  
Shining  
Will glow  
  
Golden heart  
Tears of love  
Shining  
Will glow  
  
Golden heart  
Tears of love  
Shining  
Will glow
