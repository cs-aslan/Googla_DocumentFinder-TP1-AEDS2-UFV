She stares through my shadow  
She sees something more  
Believes theres a light in me  
She is sure  
And her truth makes me stronger  
Does she realize  
I awake every morning  
With her strength by my side  
  
I am not a hero  
I am not an angel  
I am just a man  
A man whos trying to love her  
Unlike any other  
  
In her eyes I am  
  
This world keeps on spinning  
Only she stills my heart  
Shes my inspiration  
Shes my northern star  
  
I dont count my possessions  
But all I call mine  
I will give her completely  
Til the end of all time  
  
I am not a hero  
I am not an angel  
I am just a man  
A man whos trying to love her  
Unlike any other  
  
In her eyes I am  
  
In her eyes I see the sky  
And all Ill ever need  
In her eyes time passes by  
And she is with me  
  
I am not a hero  
I am not an angel  
I am just a man  
A man whos trying to love her  
Unlike any other  
  
In her eyes I am  
In her eyes I am
