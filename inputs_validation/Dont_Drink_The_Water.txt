This a religion  
No this a drag  
That man over there is smoking sweet cigarettes  
Hey look at that fag   
  
I had a dream  
I saw you swim  
Sink to your grave  
Down to Davy Jones locker  
Under the waves  
Dont say  Thank God for simple truths  
  
Take me to your leader  
Take me for a ride  
The shutters were never open  
The day I used to hide  
All of the things  
I never knew  
I should have said  
When you looked like Frida Kahlo  
Curled up in bed  
Dont say  Thank God for simple truths   
Dont drink the water baby  
Dont drink the water baby  
  
So much emotion these eyes a strange kind of blue  
Deep as the ocean they named a sea after you  
Dont say  Thank God for simple truths   
  
Dont drink the water baby Repeat x4
