Ice Cube with The Lench Mob I got it goin on  
A nigga thats livin in the city of the criminal zone  
One time cant keep the law in order  
cause everybodys goin crazy for a quarter  
Youre tuned in to the number one crew in the area  
The way Im talkin Im scarin ya  
Im darin ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag  
or beat down for ya flag  
cause if you is or you aint a gang banger  
Keep one in the chamber  
cause youll get them things put on ya son  
Ice Cube has got the 411  
All the ol school house fellows are crooks  
So I get jealous looks  
They keep thinkin did my hair grow  
Will the boys n the hood have to beat down Ice Cube  
Hell no Ill static son youll see its okay  
I keep my 9 anyway  
for the day one of my homies want to squab  
Im still rollin wit The Lench Mob  
  
AmeriKKKas most wanted  
  
Back in the day I dip my shirt in dirt  
Sometimes I got away clean sometimes people got hurt  
But if you know me you know that Im liable  
to bust a cap cause its all about survival of the fittest  
Im a menace crook  
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book  
From the shit I took from people  
I reap all your fat shit jack  
Back to the criminals sect  
I leave crew after crew but they cant catch me yet  
cause Im slick as slippery  
They cant get wit me cops aint shit to me  
I cant dig a pig so I drop the dogs  
and sweat em like sweat hogs  
and get mad mad cause Im the nigga that flaunt it  
AmeriKKKas most wanted  
  
Hey yo heres what the poster read  
Ice Cube is wanted dead  
Thats all it said  
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green  
Hear shots and sireens  
When I feet first they yo rings now they my rings  
So give it up punk and then I just  
put another jack in progress  
Its the American way  
cause Im the GANGSTA  
Ice Cube a motherfuckin clepto  
and tried to catch the early bird but they slept so  
who gets the worm  
And if Im caught in a trap  
you know Ima beat the wack  
with a payoff cop gotta lay off  
FBI on my dick stay off  
Im not a rebel or a renegade on a quest  
Im a nigga with a S on his chest  
so get the Kryptonite cause Im a rip tonight  
cause Im scarin ya wanted by America  
  
Hey yo Cube man they on your ass  
  
Word but who the fuck has heard  
Its time to take a trip to the suburbs  
Let em see a nigga invasion  
Point blank for the Caucasian  
Cock the hammer then crackle smile  
Take me to your house pal  
Got to the house my pockets got fat see  
Crack the safe got the money and the jewelry  
Three weeks later Im at the PAD  
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me  
Sittin in a dig yo it couldnt be  
What up G Saw my face on TV  
Damn oh shit I didnt know I lucked out  
Struck out I gotta get the fuck out  
Pack my bags and tried to hit the dough when  
the ol bitch down the street mustve turned me in  
cause the feds was out there ten deep  
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat  
I think back when I was robbin my own kind  
The police didnt pay it no mind  
But when I start robbin the white folks  
Now Im in the pen wit the soaponarope  
I said it before and Ill still taught it  
Every motherfucker with a color is most wanted
