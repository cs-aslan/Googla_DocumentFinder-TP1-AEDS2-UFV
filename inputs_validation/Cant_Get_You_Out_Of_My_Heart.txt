Chorus  
Cant get you out of my heart cant get you out of my soul  
When I get next to you all I get is out of control  
Cant get you out of my head Ive memorized every word you ever said  
Youve been here from the start cant get you out of my heart  
  
Sometimes I feel like breakin up with you  
Im tired of bein true tired of bein blue  
Still youre the one I give my best love to  
No other girl would do the things to me you do and I  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes I think I might be better off free  
No strings attached to me yeah thats how it should be  
But just about the time that I get goin  
You read me like a poem you keep me comin home and I  
  
Chorus  
  
I look at you sometimes I see the woman I love  
But I can be so blind the good times I sometimes lose sight of  
  
Chorus x3
