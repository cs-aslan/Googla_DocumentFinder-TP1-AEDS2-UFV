Light of the candle bright ones soul shined  
Woke up new morning feeling better than ever fine  
Chest no hurt no more something feel better  
Whats all the hate for now something feel better  
  
To Zion goes I To Zion goes I To Zion goes I To Zion goes I  
Walk through the valley and Ill follow the stars  
I feel it so close now it cant be that far  
Time some grow lonely but time isnt done  
  
Its time to go home now youre not on the run  
To Zion goes I To Zion goes I To Zion goes I To Zion goes I  
To Zion goes I To Zion goes I To Zion goes I To Zion goes I  
One step forward and I crossed the line again  
  
One step forward and I crossed the line again  
Standing on the edge of a civilization  
No ones around  
Standing on the edge of a civilization  
  
And no ones around and I aint heard a sound yeah  
The path is snowed over the path lies ahead  
Soon well be down there and nothing is said  
Theres no need to fear love dont let love hide  
  
Conquer the mountains way down by the riverside  
To Zion goes I To Zion goes I To Zion goes I To Zion goes I  
To Zion goes I To Zion goes I To Zion goes I To Zion goes I
