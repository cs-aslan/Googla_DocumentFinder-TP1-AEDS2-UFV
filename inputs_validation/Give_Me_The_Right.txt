Give me the right  
To hold you tonight  
The tears that Ive cried over you  
Give me the right  
You cant say no  
When I need you so  
I want you back in my arms  
Give me the right  
If you looked deep in your heart  
Like I looked into mine  
Youll find that nothing has changed  
Our love was there all the time  
Why make me plead  
For something you need  
I want to bring back the thrill  
Give me the right  
Give me the right
