I will never let you go  
I will never  
I will never let you go  
I will never  
Ive got to hold on every day  
In every way but the things you will say  
Just couldnt be that way  
Youll never ever reach  
If you dont try  
Instead you keep on telling all  
Those dreadful lies  
Just wait and see  
How things could be  
When I am free  
Dont worry bout me  
Dont worry bout me cus  
I will never let you go  
I will never  
I will never let you go  
I will never  
repeat chorus  
Ive got to hold on every day  
In every way but the things you will say  
Just couldnt be that way  
Youll never ever reach  
If you dont try  
Instead you keep on telling all  
Those dreadful lies  
Just wait and see  
How things could be  
When I am free  
Dont worry bout me  
Dont worry bout me cus  
Ive never let you go  
Ill always try  
And Ive got so much soul  
Youll wonder why  
Its just because  
Im so true  
Youll be feeling blue  
When I get through  
There is nothing you can do  
repeat last verse
