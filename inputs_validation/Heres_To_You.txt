Here she comes to ruin my day again  
Right away shes start with shouting  
Making this the best week ever  
If only she could scream forever  
Here she comes to pick at my faults again  
Right away shes punching kicking  
Making this the best week ever  
Better off dead than together  
Stab your dagger right through my heart and twist  
Does this turn you on  
Follow it up by punching my face with your fists  
Does this turn you on  
Now on the ground cut open both of my wrists  
Does this turn you on  
Say you love me and suffocate me with a kiss  
Whatever turns you on  
Heres to me calling off this war  
Heres to me walking out that door  
Heres to the only casualty  
Heres to the mess that you made of me  
Here she comes to ruin my perfect game  
Doctor says shes borderline insane  
I dont know what I like better  
Being comatose or just being with her  
Here she comes to point her fingers down at me  
With all ten of her personalities  
I dont know what I like better  
Saying goodbye or saying that I hate her  
Stab your dagger right through my heart and twist  
Does this turn you on  
Follow it up by punching my face with your fists  
Does this turn you on  
Now on the ground cut open both of my wrists  
Does this turn you on  
Say you love me and suffocate me with a kiss  
Whatever turns you on  
You always get to me  
Heres to me calling off this war  
Heres to me walking out that door  
Heres to the only casualty  
Heres to the mess that you made of me  
You always get to me  
Always get to you  
Always do your worst to get the best of me  
Me always pushing you  
Always pushing me  
Always manage to being the worst in you  
Heres to me calling off this war  
Heres to me walking out that door  
Heres to the only casualty  
Heres to the mess that you made of me
