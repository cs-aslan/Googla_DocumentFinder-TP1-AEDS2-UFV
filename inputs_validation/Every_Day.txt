You couldve bowed down gracefully  
But you didnt  
You knew enough to know  
To leave well enough alone  
  
But you wouldnt  
I drive myself crazy  
Tryin to stay out of my own way  
The messes that I make  
  
But my secrets are so safe  
The only one who gets me  
Yeah you get me  
Its amazing to me  
  
Chorus  
How every day  
Every day every day  
You save my life  
  
I come around all broken down and  
Crowded out  
And youre comfort  
Sometimes the place I go  
Is so deep and dark and desperate  
I dont know I dont know  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes I swear I dont know if  
Im comin or goin  
But you always say something  
Without even knowin  
  
That Im hangin on to your words  
With all of my might and its alright  
Yeah Im alright for one more night  
Every day  
  
Every day every day every day  
Every day every day  
You save me you save me oh oh oh  
Every day  
Every every every day  
  
Every day you save my life
