Ive been havin trouble puttin my cigarettes out and Ive been having
trouble with her so I shut upor talk too loud the cigarettes smolder and
smell but they light up the room so many times I think of romance but I
think I should leave you alone when I get home Im gonna hang that picture
where it supposed to be then I think Ill get up and watch the sun go
down watch the sun go down watch the sun go down watch the sun go down
watch the sun go down I wish I wasnt grownup so I could cry myself to
sleep and Id like to follow you home but its awful hard on the bus
everybodys got the right to wrong they come home and say Im sorry but
Im gone for 6 months at a time and youre tired of the reason why when I
grow up Im gonna make something out of myself then I think Ill get up
and watch the sun go down watch the sun go down watch the sun go down watch
the sun go down when the sun goes down
