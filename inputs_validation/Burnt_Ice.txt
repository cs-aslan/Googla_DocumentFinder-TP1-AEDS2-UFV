He said hed try just a little bit  
He didnt want to end up like them  
And now he blames the voices of a toothless wonder  
Pounding on the door to make the next score  
  
Anything for a hit any sin to pay for it  
For that next bowl hed sell his soul  
  
Spiral to destruction its too late to break the spell  
He wants the ride to stop on the freight train straight to hell  
Without the truth hell never find in a dungeon of his lies  
His cause of death high speed on burnt ice  
  
Always looking at the ground a broken beaten man  
Memories of his family are calling after him  
He can hardly thing hardly walk  
Phone keeps ringing he cant talk  
With just one hit the pain would go away  
But hes dead if he does  
  
Shadow people follow him everywhere he goes  
Looking over his shoulder the paranoia grows
