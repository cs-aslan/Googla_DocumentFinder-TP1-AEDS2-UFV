Chorus  
Its your thing do what you want to do  
I cant tell you who to sock it to  
  
If you want me to love you maybe I will  
Believe me woman it aint no big deal  
You need love now just as bad as I do  
Makes me no difference now who you give your thing to  
  
Chorusx2  
  
Im not trying to run your life I know you want to do whats right  
Give your love now to whoever you choose  
How can you lose with the stuff you use now
