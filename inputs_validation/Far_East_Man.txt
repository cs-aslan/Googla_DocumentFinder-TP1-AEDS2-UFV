While the world wages war  
It gets harder to see  
Who your friends really are  
I wont let him down  
  
Got to do what I can  
I wont let him drown  
Hes a far east man  
  
All these ups and those downs  
Makes me question what love is  
Is it a lie or worthwile  
I wont let him down  
  
Got to do what I can  
I wont let him drown  
Hes a far east man  
  
Sometime is so short  
But it takes so long  
Wondering if it is  
Or if Im wrong  
  
Even then my heart seems  
To be the one in charge  
Can only do what it tells me  
  
We cant let them down  
Weve got to do what we can  
We cant let him drown  
Hes a far east man  
  
Looks like right here on earth  
God its hellish at times  
But I feel that a heavens in sight  
And I cant let him down  
  
Got to do what I can  
I cant let him drown  
Hes a far east man
