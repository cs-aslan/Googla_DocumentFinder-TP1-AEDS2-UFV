Its time again for the holidays  
Pain and sorrow miles away  
But in my spirit Ive got to say  
Theres no Christmas without You  
With caroling and mistletoe  
Children playing in the snow  
But in their hearts the world must know  
Theres no Christmas without You  
Your gift of love  
Such a sacrifice for me  
Sent from above  
So that we shall forever see  
  
So with our voices lifted high  
And praises that reaches to the sky  
Jesus Youre the reason why  
Theres no Christmas without You  
  
There is no Christmas time  
Without you Jesus
