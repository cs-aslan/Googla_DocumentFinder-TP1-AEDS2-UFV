I dont know you you are I dont know who you want to be  
When I carbonate the test tube then you wont see me  
Ive got a twin cab diesel combo it takes me where I want to go  
And all the nuphies are happy they know of a fungus that grow  
So when you see Hoeckes mind screw dont come running to me  
Or I will scream and set aflame marble tulip juicy tree  
  
Marble tulip juicy tree its where I want to be  
When I gnaw on the tulip itll wish that it was me  
  
Every morning I put my shoes on and I think about she  
Who controls the four seasons inhaling kitties in the see  
Its like a noodle in a salad little birdy wants to be set freeee  
I drill the corpse lobe with my mommy marble tulip juicy tree  
So this songs about the loving thing that you are to me  
Just stay away from my adenoids and marble tulip juicy tree  
  
Marble tulip juicy tree its where I want to be  
When I gnaw on the tulip itll wish that it was me
