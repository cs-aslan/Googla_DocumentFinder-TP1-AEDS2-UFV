Dont despair youre there  
From beginning to middle to end  
Dont despair  
Youre there through my wasted days  
Youre there through my wasted nights  
  
Oh despair youve always been there  
Youve always been there  
Youve always been there  
Youre there through my wasted years  
Through all my lonely fears no tears  
Run through my fingers tears  
Theyre stinging my eyes no tears  
  
If its all in my head theres nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear inside  
Through the darkness and the light  
Some sun has got to rise  
  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
  
Oh despair you were there through my wasted days  
Youre there through my wasted nights  
Youre there through my wasted years  
Youre there through my wasted life  
  
Youve always been there  
Youve always been there  
Youve always been there  
There through my wasted years  
Through all of my lonely fears no tears  
Run through my fingers tears  
Theyre stinging my eyes no tears  
Were all on the edge theres nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear inside  
  
Through the darkness and the light  
Some sun has got to rise  
  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
  
Some sun has got to rise  
  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
  
Some sun has got to rise
