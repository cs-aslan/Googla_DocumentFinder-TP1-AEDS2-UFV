2 3 4 1 drank all my fuckin brew  
And I aint gots no more  
Feeling so damn tired  
Running on desperate fumes  
For the end is always near now  
Empty handed its always soon  
Psychocise me terrify me  
Jeopardizing all thats mine  
Megolamize me certify me  
On my knees until I cry  
Lord only knows where Ive gone  
Lord only knows where Ive been  
In a world of trouble again worries  
Streaming round the bend  
Treat me like a dog now  
Knowing I wont turn  
Blind me like a slave now  
Cast down no concern
