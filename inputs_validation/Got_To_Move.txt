Youve got to move you cant stay here no more  
Youve got to move you cant stay here no more oh yes  
Youre my baby I love you so  
But still youve got to go  away from here  
You wont cook you wont wash  
You wont iron you wont sew  
Oh no you wont even scrub the floor  
Youre my baby I love you so  
But still youve got to go away from here  
Well Id rather be dead and in my grave  
Then to see another man here to take my place  
Oh yes youve got to move yeah  
Youre my baby I love you so  
But still youve got to go away from here  
  
Well Id rather be dead and in my grave  
Then to see another man here to take my place  
Umm yes youve got to move yeah  
Youre my baby I love you so  
But still youve got to go away from here  
You got to move away from here  
Oh yes you got to move away from here  
Youre my baby I love you so  
But still youve got to go away from here
