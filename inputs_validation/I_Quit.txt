When you said you were leavin  
I said here we go again  
I aint even breakin even  
In this game I just cant win  
  
The cards are stacked against me  
Your aces beat my twos  
Seems like bad luck travels with me  
Like I was born to lose  
  
Chorus  
I quit  
Ive had enough of fallin in and out of love  
Im done Im through thats it  
If I cant have you I quit  
  
You were my only sunshine  
In a world of pouring of pouring rain  
So this will be my last time  
I cant go through this again  
  
Chorus  
  
Im done Im through thats it If I cant have you I quit
