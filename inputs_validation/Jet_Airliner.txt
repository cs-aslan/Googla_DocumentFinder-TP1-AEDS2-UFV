Leavin home out on the road  
Ive been down before  
Ridin along in this big ol jet plane  
Ive been thinkin about my home  
But my love light seems so far away  
And I feel like its all been done  
Somebodys tryin to make me stay  
You know Ive got to be movin on  
  
Oh oh big ol jet airliner  
Dont carry me too far away  
Oh oh big ol jet airliner  
Cause its here that Ive got to stay  
  
Goodbye to all my friends at home  
Goodbye to people Ive trusted  
Ive got to go out and make my way  
I might get rich you know I might bet busted  
But my heart keeps calling me backwards  
As I get on the 707  
Ridin high I got tears in my eyes  
You know you got to go through hell  
Before you get to heaven  
  
Big ol jet airliner  
Dont carry me too far away  
Oh oh big ol jet airliner  
Cause its here that Ive got to stay  
  
Touchin down in New England town  
Feel the heat comin down  
Ive got to keep on keepin on  
You know the big wheel keeps on spinnin around  
And Im goin with some hesitation  
You know that I can surely see  
That I dont want to get caught up in any of that  
Funky shit goin down in the city  
  
Big ol jet airliner  
Dont carry me too far away  
Oh oh big ol jet airliner  
Cause its here that Ive got to stay  
  
Oh oh big ol jet airliner  
Dont carry me too far away  
Oh oh big ol jet airliner  
Cause its here that Ive got to stay  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Big ol jet airliner  
Dont carry me too far away  
Oh oh big ol jet airliner  
Cause its here that Ive got to stay  
  
Oh oh big ol jet airliner  
Carry me to my home  
Oh oh big ol jet airliner  
Cause its there that I belong
