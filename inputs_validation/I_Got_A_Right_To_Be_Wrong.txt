Ohuhoh oooh  
I got a right to be wrong  
I got a right to be lonely when youre gone  
Whoa Ill get out around tear up my own home town  
Get mocked up locked up wind up in the lost and found  
Oh I got a right to be wrong  
Well its so easy to give advice  
When you aint the one who got to pay the price  
Sit up there on your hill telling me I got to sink or swim  
Well it might thrill you to make me want to kill ya  
I cant believe youre leavin me for him  
I got a right to be wrong  
  
Chorus  
Oh loan me a dollar and watch me follow you around  
You got all the moves youre puttin me through school  
Oh I give you my best but I guess Im still your fool  
Babe I got you down in my song  
I got a right to be wrong  
  
Ive been conflicted evicted restricted  
Served with a letter sent to whom it may concern  
Still around Lord Im still in town  
A lesson hard learned nearly got me down  
Its a cryin shame you dont even know my name  
A low down lonesome song  
I got a right to be wrong  
  
Chorus  
I got a right to be wrong
