Theres a cowboy that I know ridin in the rodeo  
Hes a feller that Im fondest of  
I love him and he loves me and thats the way it ought to be  
But he drives me crazy when were makin love cause he always starts to yodel
yodel  
Well he always squeezed me at night while the moon was shinin bright  
And I knew I was under his spell  
He was gazin in my eyes and I was breathing pretty sighs  
Then like Tarzan hed let out a great big yell And he started into yodel
yodel  
Well when he led me down the isle I wore such a pretty smile  
And my handsome cowboy wore a buckskin suit  
When the parson said will you promise always to be true  
My lover smiled and gently cleared his throat and he started to yodel yodel
