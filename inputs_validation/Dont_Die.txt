Yeah yeah  
Check me out man yeah  
  
Original gangsta black clothes and bangers  
Bullet shells and chambers fill the Ls up  
We stay low from the rangers  
Cause they tryin to tame us but we brainless  
And just think Im one sell out record away from being famous  
Shit I guess I aint it  
You could paint it how you may  
But I remain this gangsta til the day I lay  
Where the worms stay  
I spit it for my niggas sake  
I spit it for myself a long time ago  
Got a few houses few whips few condos  
Im so straight Im pointin  
The game is hurtin and baby boy the ointment  
Baby boy the president now  
Shit you gotta make an appointment  
Two record labels  
You should come join em  
Do check the label  
And make sure its yellow or Roze  
fore you bring it to my table  
  
Chorus  
Ganstas dont die  
They get chubby and they move to Miami I move to Miami

Ganstas dont die

And dont think about the past  
A little water came now we floatin on everything  
Niggas doing about anything killin while they hustlin  
Niggas puttin it in for the change  
So we headed to the game Culpepper gettin his roll on

And outside got them thangs  
Them Phantoms out there we do it up switchin lanes  
  
Chorus

Stunner get me to work and Im runnin that off  
Im comin back with it and let my team split it  
With a swagger you cant get na you cant get it  
Shit bitch I pop like Diddy  
I pop like when he goin stop When its empty  
And you still drawing Leonardo DVinci  
  
Trap me Im in there early gettin money ridin dirty  
Uptown puttin in down blowin out the pound  
Duffel bag full of cash when I come around  
The lil homie got the game so I put him down  
Hold my town world wide wearin a crown

Like father like son niggas stand their grounds  
Like father like son nigga fuck them clowns
