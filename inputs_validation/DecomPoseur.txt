Shes a painting outta focus with no good sense of intention shes authentic  
Shes a model of disaster with a heart of revolution  
Shes so innocent but guiltys her plea  
Everybody wants to save her from herself they really want to save themselves  
  
Shes got the grace of a tourist with the charm of demolition  
Shes a poem without a meter or rhyme a random design  
Of a flower like a rose no one really knows  
Shes a master piece deserving restoration or condemnation time will tell us  
If shes a lifer or a decomposuer shes the rose no one really knows
