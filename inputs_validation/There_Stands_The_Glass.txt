There stands the glass fill it up to the brim  
Till my troubles grow dim its my first one today  
There stands the glass that will ease all my pain  
That will settle my brain darling Im on my way  
I wonder where you are tonight I wonder if you are all right  
I wonder if you think of me in my misery  
There stands the glass fill it up to the brim  
Till my troubles grow dim darling Im on my way  
I wonder where you are tonight
