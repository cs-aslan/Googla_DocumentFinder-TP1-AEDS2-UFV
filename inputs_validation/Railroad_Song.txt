I jumped off a boxcar down around Tennessee  
I was cold tired and dirty hungry as I could be  
But I had my guitar and a hundred railroad songs  
So I asked the policeman  
Can I stay here long  
He said Mr Hobo you got to go now  
We dont want you around  
See Im trying to build a respectable town  
And we dont need a hobo like you around  
  
So I left that town Lord with my guitar in my hand  
Still cold and tired kinda mad at the man  
But this life that I chose to live sometimes strange  
See Im trying to learn about the old music from ridin the train  
Im a hobo I know but thtas the price I pay  
Guess Ill write me another song while Im on my way  
Catch me another train and this is what Ill say  
Mr Choochoo train take me away  
  
Im goin to ride this train Lord until I find out  
What Jimmie Rogers and the Hag was all about  
See I play this rock n roll and I think thats fine  
But I want to go back a little further in time  
Im a hobo I know but thats the price I pay  
Guess Ill write me another song while Im on my way  
Catch me another train and this is what Ill say  
Mr Choochoo train take me away
