I cant believe it guess Ill never understand  
Seems to me Im lookin at someone whos  
an unchanged man  
Tell me whatve I gotta do  
To make you see that shes always loved you  
Right there waitin in the wings  
Unaware of the foolish things you do think about it  
  
Chorus  
She would never do a thing to hurt you  
And there is nothing shed ever need to hide  
Youre takin everything she gives for granted  
You got it all and still I dont know why  
Youre lovin on the side  
  
If somebody told her bout your secret ways  
Do you think youd ever find another  
who could take her place  
Id give everything I own  
Just to have what you got at home  
But still you are never satisfied  
Why do you keep lovin on the side when you know  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell me what Ive gotta do  
To make you see that she always loved you  
Right there waitin in the wings  
Unaware of the foolish things you do  
well think about it  
Youre lovin on the side  
Lovin on the side  
  
Chorus
