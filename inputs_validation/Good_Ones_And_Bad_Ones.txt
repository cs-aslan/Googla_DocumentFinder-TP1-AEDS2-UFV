Some come from Heaven and some crawl from Hell  
And the good fight the bad for your soul  
But its hard to tell the lie from the truth  
When you find one that easy to hold  
Theres no way of knowing which one youve been lovin  
Till you leave em or you lose her for good  
By then its too late you just mark it off to fate  
Either way you end up a fool  
Its a fine line between Heaven and Hell  
When the good makes you feel like you should  
Its a fine line between Heaven and Hell  
When the bad makes you feel just as good  
A good one will love you for all that shes worth  
A bad one will take you for more  
A good one will cherish the key to your heart  
And a bad one a key to your door  
A good one will love you for richer or poorer  
But that makes the bader one worse  
A good one will love you till death do you apart  
And a bad one makes sure you go first  
Its a fine line between Heaven and Hell  
When the good makes you feel like you should  
Its a fine line between Heaven and Hell  
When the bad makes you feel just as good  
Its a fine line between Heaven and Hell  
When the good makes you feel like you should  
Its a fine line between Heaven and Hell  
When the bad makes you feel just as good
