You cant put a butterfly in a jar  
If the efforts too high no matter who you are  
You cant catch the moon or the sun or the stars  
It doesnt matter who you are  
Iced honey iced honey  
  
Now me Ive tried a million tricks  
To make life cold and make it stick  
Not running heat that flames then out  
But the proud piece of ice that always floats  
Iced honey iced honey  
  
If I cant trap a butterfly or a bee  
If I cant keep my heart where I want it to be  
If no matter how much soul and heart  
I put to the wood  
If a flaming heart is not that good  
Iced honey iced honey  
  
If you cant put a butterfly in a jar  
If violence mars your final hour  
If you make others feel like jam  
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb  
  
If its all mixed up and you cannot shout  
And your oxygen starts to run out  
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong  
And instead of hello you say so long  
If your energy starts to leak out  
And people wonder what youre all about  
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart  
The story of love gives them all a start  
  
And me Ive always been this way  
Not by choice just this way  
I cant put my honey pot in a jar  
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy  
  
If you cant put a butterfly in a jar  
No wonder no need to wonder where you are  
It might seem like hell the River Styx  
Your affection never sticks  
  
No matter what you say no matter what you do  
A butterfly heart flies right past you  
Theres nothing to say nothing to do  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
Iced honey ah ah ah iced honey  
Iced honey iced honey  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
Iced honey iced honey  
Oh iced honey  
See if the  
See if the ice will melt for you  
Iced honey  
Iced honey
