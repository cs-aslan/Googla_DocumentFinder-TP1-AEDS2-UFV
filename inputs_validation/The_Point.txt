Love Blood War  
Desire Deceit Control  
Its killing you for everyone  
Just stick around until Im gone  
I love you so it hurts  
For whatever that is worth  
  
And no time will fade away  
The rumors and the lies  
And no one will remember  
If you even said goodbye  
  
Whats the point in dying  
When the world thinks youre already dead  
Whats the point in crying  
With the rain beating down on your head  
  
Greed Hate Lust  
Divide Disgust Distrust  
Happiness comes in a pill  
From a fifteenstory windowsill  
Youll love me till I die  
Or at least until I try  
  
The after words dont mean a thing  
The problems still persist  
Dont think about the stories  
And the bullshit that you missed  
  
Whats the point in dying  
When the world thinks youre already dead  
Whats the point in crying  
With the rain beating down on your head  
Whats the point in lying  
If no one believes what you say  
Whats the point in dying  
If youre already dead anyway  
  
If youre already dead anyway  
If youre already dead anyway  
  
I hope you will remember me  
At least say so to comfort me  
You say goodbye so easily  
Its now or never  
It may seem really pitiful  
But life became too beautiful  
The pain of love unbearable  
Its now or never  
Gone forever
