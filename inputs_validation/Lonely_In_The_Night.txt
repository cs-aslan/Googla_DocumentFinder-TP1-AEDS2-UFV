Im runnin tired of this deception  
I have no wish to play this game  
Too many times a bad connection  
And youre still holding me away  
Were living under false pretenses  
Foolin ourselves believe the lies  
I could not take one more rejection  
You wanted more but would not try  
  
Somethings gone wrong with us  
Something aint right  
Why are we lonely in the night  
Why are we lonely in the night  
  
Were trapped within our own defenses  
The walls we made all look the same  
There is no love without affection  
Weve come to far to break the chain  
  
Somethings gone wrong with us  
Something aint right  
Why are we lonely in the night  
Why are we lonely in the night  
  
Im growing tired of this deception  
We fall apart and wonder why  
Our hearts now pull in new directions  
We dont know how to say goodbye  
  
Somethings gone wrong with us  
Something aint right  
Why are we lonely in the night  
Why are we lonely in the night  
  
Somethings gone wrong with us  
Something aint right  
Why are we lonely in the night  
Why are we lonely in the night
