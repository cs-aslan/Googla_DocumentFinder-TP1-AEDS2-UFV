The day I found You  
You made my world brand new  
And You covered it with love  
Changed my direction  
And now Im heaven bound  
Im running to You  
Once lost but now Im found in You  
Once shipwrecked now Im grateful these days  
I live for You  
Like a river You flood my soul with love  
Overflowing into joy  
Like a downpour Your spirit raining down  
Let it fall Let it fall  
Im living for the King  
I live for You
