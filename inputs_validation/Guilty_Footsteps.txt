The key turns in the door the boards squeak on the floor  
And guilty footsteps linger on the hall  
Id fight but Im too weak pretending Im asleep  
While hearing guilty footsteps in the hall  
  
Guilty footsteps always wake me up at night when she comes in  
Guilty footsteps tiptoe through my mind they tell me where shes been  
True love has no pride but hes not satisfied  
Unless he has her at his beck and call  
I know now how he works so Ill fight dirt with dirt  
To stop those guilty footsteps in the hall  
  
Guilty footsteps always wake me up at night when she comes in  
Guilty footsteps tiptoe through my mind they tell me where shes been  
The next time she comes home shell find herself alone  
Then she can read the writing on the wall  
I wonder if shell take it or if shell try to fake it  
When she hears my guilty footsteps in the hall  
Oh when she hears my guilty footsteps in the hall
