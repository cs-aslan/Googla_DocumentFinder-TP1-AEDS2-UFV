There were times I wasnt kind  
And there were times I wasnt even around  
And there were times I made you cry  
So many times I had to say goodbye  
When you want to talk  
Im on the phone  
But now baby I am here for you alone  
  
Im gonna stand by my woman now  
Im gonna stand by my woman now  
Cause I cant live my life alone  
Without a home  
  
There were times I didnt understand  
And there were times I wouldnt hold your hand  
But baby now Im here for you  
Cause baby I am so in love with you  
  
Im gonna stand by my woman now  
Im gonna stand by my woman now  
Cause I cant live my life alone  
Without a home  
  
Im gonna stand by my woman now  
Im gonna stand by my woman now  
Cause I cant live my life alone  
Without a home  
  
Im gonna stand by my woman now  
Im gonna stand by my woman now  
Cause I cant live my life alone  
Without a home  
Stand by my woman now  
Im gonna stand by my woman now  
  
Cause I cant live my life alone  
Without a home  
Without a home
