Why are you so frightened  were getting in the mood  
Body breaking volume  we are loud and rude  
Laser piercing lighting  megasonic sound  
The first day of your lesson  upheaval in the ground  
  
Were forging straight ahead now  its not a dream  
Never ever lose the power  were as hard as steel  
Dont you feel the fire  the burning in your soul  
Just come and join the fantasy  it will make you free  
  
So cut the crap out  its for you  
Feel so damn proud  of this rocking crew  
Well break the world down  tear up all the rules  
Reality is clear now  the future is for you  
  
So shout it out  just let it out  
So shout it out  as loud as you can  
So shout it out  just let it out  
So shout it out  as loud as we all can  
  
Nows the final showdown  its time to be released  
Our weapons are so deadly  were armed up to the teeth  
Electrostatic sound waves  you cannot hide  
Gonna execute our metal shock  straight between the eyes  
  
Shout  shout  shout  shout  
Shout  shout  shout  shout
