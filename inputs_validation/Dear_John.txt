Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you  
Counting my footsteps  
Praying the floor wont fall through again  
My mother accused me of losing my mind  
But I swore I was fine you paint me a blue sky  
And go back and turn it to rain  
And I lived in your chess game  
But you changed the rules every day  
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone  
Tonight well I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why  
  
Dear John I see it all now that youre gone  
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with  
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I shouldve known  
  
Well maybe its me and my blind optimism to blame  
Maybe its you and your sick need to give love then take it away  
And youll add my name to your long list of traitors who dont understand  
And Ill look back and regret how I ignored when they said run as fast as you
can  
  
Dear John I see it all now that youre gone  
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with  
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home  
  
Dear John I see it all now it was wrong  
Dont you think nineteen is too young  
To be played by your dark twisted games when I loved you so  
I shouldve known  
  
You are an expert at sorry  
And keeping the lines blurry  
Never impressed by me acing your tests  
All the girls that youve run dry  
Have tired lifeless eyes  
Cause you burned them out  
But I took your matches before fire could catch me  
So dont look now Im shining like fireworks over your sad empty town  
  
Dear John I see it all now that youre gone  
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with  
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home  
  
I see it all now that youre gone  
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with  
The girl in the dress wrote you a song  
You shouldve known you shouldve known  
Dont you think I was too young You shouldve known
