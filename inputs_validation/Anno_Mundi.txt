Can you see me are you near me  
Can you hear me crying out for life  
Can you tell me wheres the glory  
Ride the days and sail the nights  
When its over youll find the answer  
Running in the whispering rain  
Anno Mundi can you wonder  
Truth of thunder life or blame  
  
Do you see a vision of a perfect place  
Does it make you laugh put a smile on your face  
Do you need a mirror do you see it well  
Does the hand of God still toll the bell  
There are people laughing  
Theyre all laughing on you  
If only they could see what youre saying is true  
Still generals fighting making war on the world  
Dont they know dont they know  
No no no  
  
Chorus  
The wind in the night blows cold  
Your eyes are burning  
As the sands of our time grow old  
Anno Mundi  
  
Do you follow the path that so many tread  
Are you among the blind so easily lead  
Do you join the war do you fight for the cause  
Depend on another to fight it alone  
  
Chorus  
  
Can you see me now can you hear me now  
Can you tell me wheres the glory  
Ride the days and sail the nights  
When its over youll find the answer  
Runnin in the rain  
  
Theres a hope thats growing and a vision too  
All those angry hearts now reach out for you  
Do you look to the dawn see a new day begun  
No longer the fool the vision is done
