Girl it should be me  
Driving to your house  
Knocking on your door  
Kissing you on the mouth  
Holding on your hand  
Dancing in the dark  
Cause I was the only one who loved you from the start  
  
But now when I see you with him it  
Tears my world apart  
  
Because  
Ive been waiting  
All this time to finally say it  
But now I see your hearts been taken  
And nothing could be worse  
Baby I loved you first  
Had my chances  
Couldve been where he is standing  
Thats what hurts the most  
Girl I came so close  
But now youll never know  
Baby I loved you first I loved you first loved you first  
  
Girl it should be me  
Calling on your phone  
Saying youre the one and that Ill never let you go  
I never understood what love was really like  
But I felt it for the first time looking in your eyes  
But now when I see you with him  
My whole world falls apart  
  
Because  
Ive been waiting  
All this time to finally say it  
But now I see your hearts been taken  
And nothing could be worse  
Baby I loved you first  
Had my chances  
Couldve been where he is standing  
Thats what hurts the most  
Girl I came so close  
But now youll never know  
Baby I loved you first  
  
The first touch  
The first kiss  
First girl to make me feel like this  
Heartbreak  
Its killing me  
I loved you first why cant you see  
  
Ive been waiting all this time to finally say it  
But now I see your hearts been taken  
And nothing could be worse  
Baby I loved you first  
  
Had my chances  
Couldve been where he is standing  
Thats what hurts the most  
Girl I came so close  
But now youll never know  
Baby I loved you first  
  
Baby I loved you first  
Baby I loved you first  
Oh yeah  
Baby I loved you first
