Things have changed in the modern world  
It makes it kinda crazy for a boy and girl  
All a lot of noise on the radio  
It really dont rock  
It really dont roll  
  
Well a kid come along make the young girls swoon  
They all put his picture in their pink bedrooms  
They all hail the brand new king  
Everybodys waiting for the next big thing  
  
Chorus  
Big cigars diamond rings  
Ridin all around in a limousine  
When you finally hit the top  
Man you know what that means  
Everybodys ready for the next big thing  
  
For a little while  
You can do no wrong  
Live it up son  
Cause it dont last long  
  
Theres always somebody  
Waitin in the wings  
Thinking theyre going to be the next big thing  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill get a cowboy hat  
Some real tight jeans  
Lose a little weight and  
Get a bellybutton ring  
  
You can stand back Im a lean machine  
Maybe Im gonna be the next big thing  
  
Chorus  
  
Everybodys ready for the next big thing
