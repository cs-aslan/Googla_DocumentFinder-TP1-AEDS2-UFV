Aint no way  
To get you out of me  
Baby there aint no way  
In the whole wide world  
  
Im about to see  
By and by  
Youre all I ever need  
Baby when I forget how good life is  
  
You bring it home to me  
And I say hey  
  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
  
Hey Hey  
Aint no way  
Good time come  
Aint no doubt on it  
  
Tomorrow sure looks somethin else  
No matter where I sit  
Good time here  
Big plum without no pit  
  
And baby there aint no way to forget  
That youre the why of it  
And I say hey  
  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
  
Hey Hey  
Aint no way  
And I say hey  
  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
Come on hey  
  
Aint no way  
Hey Come on hey

Come on hey  
  
Aint no way
