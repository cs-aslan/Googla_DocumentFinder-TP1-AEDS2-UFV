I feel like Ive been locked up tight  
For a century of lonely nights  
Waiting for someone to release me  
Youre lickin your lips  
And blowing kisses my way  
But that dont mean Im gonna give it away  
Baby baby baby Baby baby baby  
  
Ooh my bodys sayin lets go  
Ooh but my heart is sayin no  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby theres a price to pay  
Im a genie in a bottle  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
If you wanna be with me  
I can make your wish come true  
You gotta make a big impression Oh yeah  
Gotta like what you do  
  
Im a genie in a bottle baby  
Gotta rub me the right way honey  
Im a genie in a bottle baby  
Come come come on and let me out  
  
The musics fading and the lights down low  
Just one more dance and then were good to go  
Waiting for someone  
Who needs me  
Hormones racing at the speed of light  
But that dont mean its gotta be tonight  
Baby baby baby Baby baby baby  
  
Ooh my bodys sayin lets go  
Ooh but my heart is sayin no but my heart is sayin no  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby theres a price to pay  
Im a genie in a bottle Im a genie in a bottle  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
If you wanna be with me Oh  
I can make your wish come true Your wish come true oh  
Just come and set me free baby  
And Ill be with you  
  
Im a genie in a bottle baby  
Gotta rub me the right way honey  
Im a genie in a bottle baby  
Come come come on and let me out  
  
Im a genie in a bottle baby  
Gotta rub me the right way honey  
If you wanna be with me

You gotta rub me the right way
