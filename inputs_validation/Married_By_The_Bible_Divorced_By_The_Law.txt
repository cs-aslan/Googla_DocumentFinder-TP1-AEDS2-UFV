What a strange world we live in  
What a shame oh what a shame  
Someones always quarrellin  
The marriage dont remain  
Divorces by the thousands  
Is the human race insane  
I always thought that marriage  
Should be a sacred thing  
  
Chorus  
Married by the bible divorced by the law  
Evry day theres more and more  
The worst I ever saw  
Things have changed theyre not the same  
As the days of ma and pa  
They were married by the bible  
No divorces by the law  
  
Steps are often taken  
Without thinking twice  
And oft times theres a child or two  
Whos left to pay the price  
Those little hearts so innocent  
They dont know whos to blame  
No mom and dad to love them  
What a shame oh what a shame  
  
Chorus
