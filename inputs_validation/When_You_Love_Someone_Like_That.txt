I think it was me it must have been me  
I guess I did something wrong  
I tried too hard  
Wanted too much  
I guess thats why its gone  
  
I lost my pride I fought and cried  
I felt like a little kid  
Whats wrong with me  
Still cant believe  
I did the things I did  
  
I couldnt change him  
He was gonna break my heart  
I saw it coming  
Yeah I knew it from the start  
  
Chorus  
When you love when you love  
When you love someone like that when you give what you cant take back  
When you love when you love  
With all your heart and soul its so hard to let it go  
When you love someone like that when you love someone like that  
  
Girl it aint right it just aint right  
Dont tell yourself that it was you  
You followed your heartyou gave it your best  
Theres nothing more you can do  
  
Guys like him are like the wind  
And you know its just too bad  
They blow in and out again and never know what they had  
  
Girl I can tell ya  
Hell do the same to someone else it aint about you  
So dont be so hard on yourself  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh weve all loved and lost  
Its happened to us all  
I hear what youre saying but I feel like the only one  
You might feel right but youre not  
Youre alright Im alright  
Youre OK Im OK  
Youre gonna make it anyway both  
  
When you love when you love  
With all your heart and soul its so hard to let it go  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre alright Im alright  
Youre OK Im OK  
When you love someone like that When you love
