Saturday afternoon  
The sunshine pours like wine  
Through your window  
But I know that golden june can turn an empty grey  
gainst your window  
And I feel like  
Im on the outside of a circle  
  
And if I walk by the trees  
I catch the falling leaves  
If the wind blows  
But I know that all this means  
Is whiling on the hours  
Watching sideshows  
  
And I feel like  
Im on the outside of a circle  
  
Will I turn my coat to the rain  
I dont know  
But Im going somewhere  
I can warm my bones  
  
Fare you well  
Ill carry me away  
And sing to those I know  
Upon their birthdays  
  
I wont feel like like Im on the outside  
I wont feel like like Im on the outside  
I wont feel like like Im on the outside of a circle
