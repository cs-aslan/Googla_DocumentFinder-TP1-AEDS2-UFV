Heifer whines could be human cries  
Closer comes the screaming knife  
This beautiful creature must die  
This beautiful creature must die  
A death for no reason  
And death for no reason is MURDER  
  
And the flesh you so fancifully fry  
Is not succulent tasty or kind  
Its death for no reason  
And death for no reason is MURDER  
  
And the calf that you carve with a smile  
Is MURDER  
And the turkey you festively slice  
Is MURDER  
Do you know how animals die   
  
Kitchen aromas arent very homely  
Its not comforting cheery or kind  
Its sizzling blood and the unholy stench  
Of MURDER  
  
Its not natural normal or kind  
The flesh you so fancifully fry  
The meat in your mouth  
As you savour the flavour  
Of MURDER  
  
NO NO NO ITS MURDER  
NO NO NO ITS MURDER  
Ohand who hears when animals cry
