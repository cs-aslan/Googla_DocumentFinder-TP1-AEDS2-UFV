They say if you took it all away  
This love would fall apart  
I say no way  
You dont know the size of my heart  
Vicious suspicious  
It doesnt matter what I say  
Users and losers  
Theres nothing here to make me stay  
Bloodstain on a blue vein  
Take it with no shame  
Love tracks on a loose train  
Bloodstain  
No gain with no pain  
My scars are deeper than you think  
Tie me try me  
One more time before I sink  
Big lies big times  
This love is not what were about  
Its too late and Im too straight  
Its time to blow this fire out  
Bloodstain on a blue vein  
Take it with no shame  
Love tracks on a loose train  
Bloodstain on a blue vein  
Take me softly  
Im going crazy for your touch  
Bloodstain on a blue vein  
Blue blood blue blood blue blood  
Take it with no shame  
No take no take no take  
Im alone  
And dissatisfied  
And someone else is alone  
And dissatisfied  
You are alone
