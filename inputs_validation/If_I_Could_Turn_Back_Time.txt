If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
Id take back those words thatll hurt you and youd stay  
I dont know why I did the things I did  
I dont know why I said the things I said  
Loves like a knife it can cut deep inside  
Words are like weapons they wound sometimes  
  
I didnt really mean to hurt you  
I didnt want to see you go  
I know I made you cry but baby  
  
Chorus  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
Id take back those words thatd hurt you  
And youd stay  
If I could reach the stars  
Id give em all to you  
Then youd love me love me like you used to do  
If I could turn back time  
  
My world was shattered I was torn apart  
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart  
You walked out that door I swore that I didnt care  
But I lost everything darling then and there  
  
Too strong to tell you I was sorry  
Too proud to tell you I was wrong  
I know that I was blind  
And darling  
  
Chorus  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
Id take back those words thatll hurt you  
And youd stay  
If I could reach the stars  
Id give them all to you  
Then youd love me love me like you used to do oh  
  
If I could turn back time  
If I could turn back time  
If I could turn back time whoa baby  
  
I didnt really mean to hurt you  
I didnt want to see you go  
I know I made you cry but baby  
  
Chorus  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
Id take back those words that hurt you  
If I could reach the stars  
Id give em all to you  
Then youd love me love me like you used to do  
  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
Then maybe maybe maybe  
Youd stay  
If I could reach the stars  
Id give em all to you
