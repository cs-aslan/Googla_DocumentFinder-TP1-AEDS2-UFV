I want a little girl call my own  
She must be someone whos all alone now  
Say I want a little girl to fall in love with me oh yeah  
  
I want a little girl but she may not look  
Just like a picture in a story book  
If she can cook chicken yeah shell suit me to a T  
  
And she dont have to wave her hair  
Or even wear fancy clothes I wouldnt even care  
She dont wear nylon hose oh  
  
I want a little girl to love a lot  
You know that Id give her everything I got  
I want a little girl to fall in love with me
