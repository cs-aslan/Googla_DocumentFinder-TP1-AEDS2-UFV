Verse 1 J Cole  
Visionary play your position no missionary  
But yet I pack Gospel in the quotes I spoke  
You listening to the most high like the Pope on dope  
Now picture that  
My poetrys deep now fish for that  
Only real nggas catch something phoney nggas fail  
Sht you gotta feel like its only read in braille  
Both did the crime but his homie didnt tell  
So he fcking btches while he sitting lonely in a cell  
Thinking well what the hell I been on  
They gave a ngga five then they threw another ten on  
By the time Im back on the streets like a bachelor  
I gotta play the clubs like an old ass woman  
Life is a movie pick your own role  
Climb your own ladder or you dig your own hole  
Sit around crying thats like sitting round dying  
You wanna touch the sky btch you figure out flying  
  
Chorus  
Ngga how high so high that I could touch the sky  
How sick so sick that I could fck yo btch  
Ngga please my squad stack plenty of Gs  
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees  
  
Ngga how high so high that I could touch the sky  
How sick so sick that I could fck yo btch  
Ngga please my squad stack plenty of Gs  
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees  
  
Verse 2 J Cole  
Hey as the troubles of the world unfurl  
My nggas hit the trees like squirrels  
Tryna get a nut with your girl  
Think I need to quit trying fore some ngga out there try to hit mine  
Karma for the karma sutra  
A lot calmer when the ganjas through ya  
You need ya armour cause them nggas out here tryna shoot ya  
Kinda crucial police piranha gon snatch you out that Honda  
For stashing that marijuana  
Yes ya honour I feel ashamed  
I broke the law but look Ill never smoke or steal again  
In your courtroom wylin out I dont mean to keep smiling  
But right now Im high enough to probably steal a plane  
Man just look at me what if I couldnt read  
Would you throw the book at me  
What if Im feeling sad am I supposed to look happy  
Its been a long time coming  
Tell my ngga roll me up something  
  
Chorus  
  
J Cole  
No I dont smoke maybe once in a blue  
When the tention gets thick than theres nothing to do  
Through the windows of my soul open the blind  
My eyes get shut but I open my mind  
  
How high la la la la  
How high hey hey hey  
How high yeah yeah yeah yeah  
How high la la la la  
  
Verse 3 J Cole  
Is that a shot that you threw little man  
I understand you frustrated career aint going how you planned  
Make it worse youre friends now when they talk rap  
All you hear is J Cole this and J Cole that  
It must be hard for your projects to take all that  
I know your weak heart gotta break off that  
Boy look Cole World this is your worst fear  
Im burning you nggas and Im only in first gear  
Im serving you nggas this is only the first beer  
12 months from now youll be having the worst year  
No tears for the haters Im still counting money  
Cole aint dropping thats real fcking funny  
Grade A dummy sleeping on a ngga raps  
Something like a mummy  
But Im a wake yo ass up  
Something like your mommy on school day  
I smoke two ls with ya girl this is Cool J  
  
How high  
How high  
How high yeah  
How high yeah  
  
Whats love got to do got to do with it  
I get a little taste then Im through with it  
Yeah I send it right back to you with it
