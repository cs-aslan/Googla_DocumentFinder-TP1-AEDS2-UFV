I got my work  
I got my work  
The profit of doom is walking the beach  
With a psychotic breakdown cardboard sign  
Everythings faked and theres nothing to teach  
And theres no point in running crying  
  
And Im lost lost  
Im lost lost  
Im lost lost  
Im lost lost  
In a garden of evil  
In a garden of evil  
In a garden of evil  
In a garden of evil  
Evil  
  
I walk through the filthy sterile wasteland  
When Im no good theyll dump me on a scrap heap to die  
Giant American tyrannosaur  
Even the animals are running away  
  
Im lost lost  
Im lost lost  
Im lost lost  
Im lost lost  
Lost lost  
In a garden of evil  
In a garden of evil  
In a garden of evil  
In a garden of evil  
Evil  
  
Evil baby  
I got my work  
Yeah  
I walk through the filthy sterile wasteland  
When Im no good theyll dump me on a scrap heap to die  
Giant American tyrannosaur  
Even the animals are running away  
  
Im lost lost  
Im lost lost  
Im lost lost  
Im lost lost
