Usher speaking  
Yo  
Whats sup  
Hey  
My name is Usher  
You can trust there aint  
No punks in this house  
And if you really wanna know what my name is  
Just Call Me A Mack  
Word  
Right  
Just call me the mack  
Anytime baby  
Cause I aint confused  
Usher singing  
I maybe got some  
But I got a  
Whole lot on manly in me  
So Im afraid  
That I cant complain Huh ha  
I dont mind  
If you wanna come by my crib  
And chill  
But just be sure  
That you call me first  
Because the last girl that tried  
To just be droppin on by Oh no  
Learned how to play a player  
And do you know why  
Because the mack  
Hook  
Just Call Me A Mack  
Cause I got it like that  
You gotta play by the rules  
Or Ill get back with you  
Its a well known fact  
That I got it like that  
You gotta play by the rules  
Just Call Me A Mack  
Now baby I aint dumb  
And all those silly  
Games that you play  
I see right through  
So let me kick it to yah To yah  
I dont have a lot of girls  
But I gotta know  
Ill get the respect that I give  
Thats just the way I live  
Because the last girl  
I had was moving  
Things too fast Slow down  
She tried to pull a fooler  
And do you know  
What had happened  
Hook twice  
Ushers Rap  
The mack is right here  
And yes I care as much  
Just giving a little love  
Its spreading everywhere  
You see its  
Here  
Here  
And here  
Catch a feeling  
Im having a little trouble  
I know my girl will always  
Hit it  
Pit it  
Like an orange  
Cause it looks  
Like numbness  
My lovin and  
Hugin  
And bitterness  
My peeps keep  
Pumpin  
Humpin  
On stage  
Im engaged  
And yes  
The truth is it  
You see an  
Ugly woman  
You better change  
Usher singing  
Oh yes  
Like Ushers my name  
I cant go changing  
My ways Oh no  
As long as Im chillin  
Then baby  
You can call me the mack  
Hook 3 times
