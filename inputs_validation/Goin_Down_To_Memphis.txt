Goin down to Memphis  
Maybe get my ashes hauled  
I can drive me a car  
But I dont need no car at all  
I believe Ill ride that Memphis cannon ball  
  
She runs so fast  
You cant catch her from behind  
Ah she runs so fast  
You cant catch her from behind  
But Ill be there waitin  
For that little Memphis girl of mine  
  
Why I left  
Guess Ill never know  
Why I left  
Man I guess Ill never know  
Sittin here thinkin  
Im one dumbass so and so  
  
Im headed back  
That Memphis train  
She leaves real soon  
The Memphis train  
Sound like she leaves real soon  
Got nothin to guide me  
Cept the color of the moon  
Hangin over Memphis  
  
Headed down  
Where the Mississippi runs  
Boys Im headed home  
Back where the Mississippi runs  
I hear theres some lovin there  
Try to get me some  
  
Headed down to Memphis  
Maybe get my ashes hauled  
Just dont know  
Why I ever left at all  
Im gettin on that train man  
I aint even gonna call  
Be there fore the break of day
