Now there  
There speaks a true friend  
There speaks a friend for life  
  
You told me all the things  
That you think are wrong with me  
I just wish youd stayed around and helped me put them right  
But nevertheless  
  
Theremm  
There speaks a true friend  
There speaks a friend for life  
  
You listed all the things  
That people cannot stand about me  
I just wish youd stayed around and helped me to improve  
Because Ive tried Ive tried  
Oh Ive really really tried  
  
You say I dont know how to live  
And thats true  
You say I dont deserve to live  
Oh where would I be without my friends to help me  
I just cant imagine where Id be can you  
No
