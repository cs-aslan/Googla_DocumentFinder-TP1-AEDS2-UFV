I have no reason to lie to her  
Ive been a pig  
Im a coward out of character  
Heres what I did  
I stole money from out of her purse  
Then I got drunk  
And just to make matters worse  
I then fell in love  
Is it too late to unload that gun  
Is it too late to change her mind  
Is it too late to kick me in the teeth  
Is it too late knock them down my throat  
Hope I choke on them forever this time  
Is it too late is it too late is it too late  
  
Now my cards are all on the table  
My fish is cooked  
Now someone else has rocked my cradle  
Funerals been booked  
I feel so rotten to have done this  
But now its been done  
And drink was my only accomplice  
And we fell in love  
  
I have no reason to lie again  
Once is enough  
I played my best hand and lost the game  
Losing is tough  
I barked and wagged my tail in the air  
I got off the lead  
I had all the fun of the fair  
That Ill ever need
