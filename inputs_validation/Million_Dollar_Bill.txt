Oh oh oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Came in the door  
Checked in my coat  
And who Im looking for  
Is staring in my face  
  
They played our song  
We hit the floor  
He held me strong  
And we danced the night away  
  
I can see the way that he is making feel  
This way about his love  
Ive been looking for something like this  
Im saying ooh oh oh oh ooh oh oh  
  
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill  
Say oh oh oh say oh oh oh  
If you go left right up down  
Make you spinning round and round  
Say ooh oh oh oh say ooh oh oh oh  
  
Its been a long long time  
Since I fell fell  
Love has found my way oh oh oh  
Ive been looking looking  
Ive been searching searching  
For the man to touch this place oh ooh oh yeah  
  
Cant deny the way that he is making feel  
This way about his love  
Ive been searching for something like this  
Im saying oh oh oh oh say ooh oh oh oh  
  
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill  
Say oh oh oh say oh oh oh  
Makes you go left right up down  
Makes you spinning round and round  
Say oh oh oh oh say ooh oh oh oh  
  
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill

Makes you go left right up down  
Makes you spinning round and round
