Years ago they took from me  
The only thing I ever loved  
For Ive returned hear me say  
Theres nowhere to run  
  
Vengeance is mine snap of your spine  
Tracking the wolfs at your throat  
  
Succulently the beast so silent feeding  
Into Hell you go speeding  
Your lifes at stake  
The abominable Dr Phibes rises again  
By the moon crypt doors open  
Every last bone was broken  
Murder without a clue  
For Dr Phibes rises again  
  
Oh my wife again youll live  
The gift of life be mine to give  
First theres things that I must do  
Make them pay for killing you  
  
My patients my prey all flesh torn away  
Nurse scalpel please skinned to the bone  
Killed on the phone what a shame no one home  
  
Succulently the beast so silent feeding  
Into Hell you go speeding  
Your lifes he takes  
The abominable Dr Phibes rises again  
By the moon crypt doors open  
Killed before one words spoken  
Murder without a clue  
For Dr Phibes rises again  
  
Ancient Egyptian river  
Once upon life will give her  
And there well ride oh  
Anton Phibes oh rises again rises again  
  
Down down the river of life  
No more pain no more strife  
And we can be together again yeah  
  
Oh to be oh forever to be  
Oh oh it is my dream  
It is our destiny oh oh oh  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
The beast so savage feeding  
From his brow sweat is beading  
Make no mistake  
For Dr Phibes rises again  
All of the lives Ive taken  
For you my heart was breakin  
No one survives when  
Dr Phibes rises again  
As we sit on the river  
Breath of life make me shiver  
Open your eyes my dear  
Rise from the grave  
Now that my tasks completed  
For I have death defeated  
Gone without a trace  
Anton Phibes oh rises again rises again  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Rises again  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
