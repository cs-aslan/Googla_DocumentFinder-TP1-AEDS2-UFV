Ready for the party 10987654321 go  
Go go go ready for the victory go go go  
  
Youre in our hearts  
Just from round to round  
And you will be the champion  
The king without a crown  
Like a fireball like a fireball  
You never never give up never give up  
Hear the engine call hear the engine  
Waiting for a start waiting waiting  
  
Chorus  
Cant you see were ready for the victory  
Its clear youre the hero just for you and me  
I feel were in the pole position team  
Oh cant you see its like a dream  
From Australia to USA  
And from Italy to Germany  
And from San Marino to Canada  
He is our biggest star  
  
Ready for the party 10987654321  
Oh you cannot lose if you have a lucky hand  
And you will be the hero you have many friends  
Oh dreams we cannot buy cannot buy  
But you will win again win again  
Nobody does it better does it better  
Through passion and through in  
  
Chorus
