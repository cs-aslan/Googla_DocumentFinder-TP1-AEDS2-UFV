Every sleepy dawn wakes to find you goneand its lonely  
All my sunny days laugh and run away its lonely  
Oh so lonely  
  
The sun dont really shineits lonely  
Always to remind me that its only another day  
To feel this wayits lonelyLonely  
  
I am lonely all the time youre not mine  
Without you I findits lonely  
Each new starry sky smiles and says goodbyeits lonely  
Dreams we used to share tell me you dont care its lonely  
  
The moon has lost its glow its lonely  
It is there to show me that its only another night  
I cant hold you tight its lonelyLonely  
  
I know why I cry for all the world to see  
Youre not here with me its lonelyLonelyLonely
