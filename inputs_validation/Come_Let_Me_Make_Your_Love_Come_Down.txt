Theres a girl in my life about 4 10  
Shes the one who brings me morning joy  
And brings me joy when my day ends  
She says my life will never have no problems  
That her love cannot fix  
Every time she goes into her love bag of tricks  
  
Shes got everything I want  
Everything I need  
And if she aint got it  
She knows how to find the remedy  
  
And she tells me  
  
Repeat x7  
Come let me make your love come down  
  
She says youll never worry in your life  
As long as you come and let me  
Make your love come down  
I call her Miss Satisfaction  
Cause she keeps me satisfied  
She gets my automatic smile  
When she whispers Stevland  
I love you I love you I love you  
  
Such a lovely world is my life  
Since that girl has come inside  
And everyday that I live  
Im gonna do my best to keep her satisfied  
  
Our love will never have no problem  
That the both of us cant fix  
Cause like glue to a stamp  
Like gum on a shoe  
She and I are gonna stick  
  
Shes got everything I want  
Everything I need  
And if she aint got it  
She knows how to find the remedy  
  
And she tells me  
  
Repeat x7  
Come let me make your love come down
