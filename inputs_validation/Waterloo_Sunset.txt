Dirty old river must you keep rolling  
Flowin into the night  
People so busy making me dizzy  
Taxi light shines so bright  
But I dont need no friends  
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset  
I am in paradise  
Every day I look at the world from my window  
But chilly chilly is the evening time  
Waterloo sunsets fine  
Waterloo sunsets fine  
  
Terry meets Julie at Waterloo Station  
Every Friday night  
But I am so lazy I dont like to wander  
I stay at home at night  
But I dont feel afraid  
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
