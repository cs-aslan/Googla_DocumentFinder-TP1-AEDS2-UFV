Midnight falls on the snowlit trees  
And as I stand inside I know that I  
Cant watch life through a window  
My indecision is blocking the door  
Its like a religion  
That I never ask for more  
I might stumble and fall  
  
Whats someone like me  
Doing in a life like this  
I cant see  
What someone like me  
Is doing in a life like this  
Slipping back into the past  
  
Sun comes up and streams  
Through the blinds  
And as I throw my clothes on  
Do my hair wrong  
Stare into my mirror  
Telling myself that everyone falls  
Take the first step  
Thats the trick of it all  
Bounce back like a ball  
  
Whats someone like me  
Doing in a life like this   
  
My mind is filled with  
Runaway dreams  
I cant wake up  
I dont know what it means  
You see I fell asleep  
With the television on  
When I woke up it was gone  
I read my horoscope  
To see whats in store  
I get a little lazy but  
I want more I want more  
  
Whats someone like me  
Doing in a life like this   
I cant see  
What someone like me  
Is doing in a life like this
