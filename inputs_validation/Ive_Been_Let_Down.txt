Ive been let down  
And I still comin round  
Ive been put down  
And Im still comin round for you  
Comin round for you  
  
Take away everything that feels fine  
Catch a shape in the circles of my mind  
Make me feel like I belong to you  
Make me feel even if it aint true  
  
Catch a train on a silver afternoon  
A thousand miles and Im getting there too soon  
Take me there when I should be going home  
Tell me why I still feelin all alone  
  
Ive been let down  
And Im still coming round  
Ive been put down  
And Im still comin round for you  
Comin round for you
