Thompson Girl Im stranded at the Unique Motel  
Thompson Girl winterfighters shot on the car as well  
Looks like Christmas at 55 degrees  
This latitude weakens my knees Thompson Girl  
  
Grunt work somewhere between dream and duty  
Poking through with all them shoots of beauty  
  
Thompson Girl walking from Churchill  
Across the icy world with polar bears its mostly uphill  
But when she saw that nickel stack  
She whistled hard and I whistled back Thompson Girl  
  
Grunt work time between dream state and duty  
Poking through with all them shoots of beauty  
Grunt work somewhere between dreams and duty  
Poking through with all them shoots of beauty  
  
Thompson Girl were down to the dead houseplants  
Thompson Girl weve jettisoned every thing we can  
She says springtimes coming  
Wait til you see  
It poking through with them shoots of beauty  
Its the end of rentamovie weather  
Its time to end this siege together Thompson Girl  
Thompson Girl  
Thompson Girl
