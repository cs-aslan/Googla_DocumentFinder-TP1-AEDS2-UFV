Hanging by a thread problems in my head  
Dont know what I said living to be dead on the run  
Corporation greed television need  
Overdose and bleed pornograph obscene Im a liar  
  
Theres no brakes on me as Im running down the track  
Theyll be waiting for me but Im never coming back  
  
Im going down  
To a place where I can see all there is to see in me  
  
Bullets in the gun gonna have some fun  
Think Ill take a ride to the other side till Im done  
Hole is in the vein  
Feel it numb the brain take away the pain  
Never be the same till I die  
  
Theres no brakes on me as I come around the track  
Theres no gauge to read  
Peg the needle as I hit the black  
  
Im going down  
To a place where I can see all there is to see in me  
  
Population freeze  
Modern day disease  
Brings us to our knees see them stand in line for a cure  
Profit in the wind  
Pushing back the time that we wait in line  
Pushing back the time its a sin  
  
Theres no brakes on me as Im running down the track  
Theyll be waiting for me but Im never coming back  
  
Im going down
