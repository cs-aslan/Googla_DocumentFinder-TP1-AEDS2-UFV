Bryan  
Your lifes hard enough  
And your not strong enough  
To be bleeding from your heart  
The strain has got to much  
I feel your losing touch  
You let your inner beauty slide  
And if Im gone tomorrow  
Would you feel my sorrow  
Dont you know that Ill be there  
Till the bitter end  
Wont you be my baby coz  
Chorus  
I wont let you down I only want to be a part of you  
No I wont let you downIll do everything you want me to  
Ill never let you downEach day Im falling more in love with you  
You dont know my mind  
But your on it all the time  
Mark  
Must have been a fight  
To Keep your dreams alive  
When your as far into his wounds  
And if hes gone tomorrow  
I wont feel no sorrow  
Dont you know Ill bring you  
Woah a better ending  
To your helpless story because  
Chorus  
I wont let you down I only want to be a part of you  
No I wont let you downIll do everything you want me to  
Ill never let you downEach day Im falling more in love with you  
You dont know my mind  
But your all the other time  
Mark  
You dont know my mind  
But it dont make no difference  
Running all the time  
No no no  
No Ill never let you down  
No Ill never let you down  
Mark  
And if hes gone tomorrow  
I wont feel no sorrow  
Dont you know Ill bring you  
Woah a better ending  
To your helpless story because  
Chorus  
I wont let you down I only want to be a part of you  
No I wont let you downIll do everything you want me to  
I wont let you downEach day Im falling more in love with you  
Ill never let you down
