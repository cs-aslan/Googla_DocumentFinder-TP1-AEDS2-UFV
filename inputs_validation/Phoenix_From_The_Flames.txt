Silence shields the pain  
So you say nothing  
Feel theyve rigged the game  
And youre done with lovin  
Only you can see the darkness in the northern lights  
  
Phoenix from the Flames  
We will rise together  
They will know our names  
Can you feel it  
Shelter me from pain  
I always wanna feel this way  
Oh yeah  
Just like a Phoenix from the Flame  
  
Wish theyd take you back  
Cos you miss heaven  
Too many bags to pack  
So leave them where they are  
Tonight youre flying on a golden dream  
  
Phoenix from the Flames  
We will rise together  
They will know our names  
Can you feel it  
Shelter me from pain  
I always wanna feel this way  
  
Everybodys talking  
Nobodys listening  
Too busy thinking about what youve  
Been missing  
Everybody said youre gonna take it  
Too far baby now  
Well come on  
  
When youre done with lovin  
It comes down to nothing  
Can you feel it  
Can you feel it  
Can you feel it  
  
Phoenix from the Flames  
We will rise together  
They will know our names  
Can you feel it  
Shelter me from pain  
I always wanna feel this way  
Oh yeah  
Just like a Phoenix from the Flame  
  
Phoenix from the Flames  
We will rise together  
They will know our names  
Can you feel it  
Shelter me from pain  
I always wanna feel this way  
Oh yeah  
Just like a Phoenix from the Flame  
  
Why dont you come and deny it  
You know you cant deny it  
I always wanna feel this way  
Just like a Phoenix from the Flames
