Here I go into blue  
You think Id learn  
To stay away from you  
But baby here I go  
Here I go back into blue  
I cant believe what I do  
Did I really think  
That youd come through  
Oh baby here I go  
Here I go back into blue  
  
Into blue  
Here I go again  
Im falling off the end for you  
No matter what I do  
Im always back into blue  
  
Some people learnsome will lose  
Some people never see a single clue  
But baby here I go  
Here I go back into blue  
Only love makes a fool  
Out of me over you  
Oh baby here I go  
Here I go back into blue  
  
Into blue  
Here I go again  
Im falling off the end for you  
No matter what I do  
Im always back into blue  
  
Some people learn to protect their hearts  
They say no when the feeling starts  
But some fools live their lives in the dark  
For you for you for you  
  
Yes its true Im a fool  
To ever take a chance on you  
Oh baby here I go  
Here I go back into blue  
Oh baby here I go  
Here I go back into blue
