You were the freak king of the piercing shop  
All the girls thought that they could sing  
But theyre really not  
Shit I dont get it  
Youre looking like a man youre talking like a baby  
How the fuck is your song  
In a coke commercial crazy  
I dont get it  
Your taste once exquisite  
  
What happened to Brooklyn  
What happened to New York  
What happened to my scene  
What happened to punk rock  
  
You called me the queen  
Of the downtown scene babe  
How the fuck would you go  
Switch it up and then replace me  
I dont get it  
Im so legit  
  
Tell me was it cause I wasnt  
Platinum in jewels  
That perhaps you thought  
I was a little bit even uncool  
Kid was that it  
Stefani you suck  
I know youre selling 20 million  
Wish they couldve seen you  
When we booed you off in Williamsburg  
Youre hurt  
I know my words dont hurt yeah  
Oh girl I see you walking round  
In your pearls  
Thinking that youre number  
Youre so funny  
Coz honey youre not  
  
What happened to Brooklyn  
The last frontier  
They said you can make it anywhere  
If you can make it here  
But where no magic in the air  
  
What happened to Brooklyn  
What happened to our scene baby  
Have we all gone Gaga crazy  
Remember when the streets used  
To be dangerous and we were born bad  
And we were born bad  
  
Punk rock punk rock  
The boys used to punch each other in the face  
And girls were walking round wasted  
Everyone had a good night  
Came back when sunlight  
Punk rock rock rock
