Cant get no this  
And I cant get no that  
Cant get no you know  
I dont even know where its at  
Aint got the smoke and uh aint no booze  
Got them lowdown driedout desert blues yes I do  
Um a George Carlin said I had to go  
Just what he wanted I did not know  
Im over here dug in so far from home  
Lookin all around try and see whats going on  
I got the sand in my collar  
Got the sand in my hair  
Got it in my pockets  
Got it everywhere  
I got sand in my shirt  
Got it in my shoes  
Got them lowdown driedout desert blues yes I do how how how  
Joined up in the army  
Where it was hard to find  
End up over here got my ass on the line  
But Ill be right here until my work is done  
If I get back home I hope I never see no more guns  
Here across the ocean  
I left some of my good friends behind  
I hope somebodys thinking about me  
Especially that sweet little woman of mine  
Cant get no this  
And I cant get no that  
Cant get no you know  
I dont even know where its at  
Sand in my collar  
Got the sand in my hair  
Got it in my pockets  
Got it everywhere  
I got sand in my shirt  
Got it in my shoes  
Got them lowdown driedout desert blues  
Yes I do
