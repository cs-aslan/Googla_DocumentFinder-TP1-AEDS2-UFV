Hey man them aint high heeled sneakers  
And they sure dont look like cowboy boots  
And that aint rock and roll your playin  
And it sure aint country or rhythm and blues  
Your singing a song about making love to your drummer  
Well gay guitar pickers dont turn me on  
And we dont all get in to Donna summers  
Do you happen to know any old Hank Williams songs  
  
Cause you see Im a dinosaur  
I should have died out a long time before  
Have Pitty on a dinosaur  
Hand me my hat excuse me maam  
But wheres the door  
  
Used to be I had a lot of fun in the old hangout  
Wed get stoned at the jukebox to stay out of fights  
Now and then wed light a little smoke  
In the truck out back  
And a little old Jim Beam and wed get right  
And you know these flashing lights sure make me dizzy  
And this discos very strange to my ears  
Looks like they turned the longhorn into a spaceship  
And Ill be leaving just a soon as I finish this beer  
  
Cause you see Im a dinosaur  
I should have died out a long time before  
Have Pitty on a dinosaur  
Hand me my hat excuse me mam  
But wheres the door  
  
Give us our hats  
Excuse Me mam  
Where the door
