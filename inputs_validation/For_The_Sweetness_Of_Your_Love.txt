Whats your name  
Girl whats your number  
I think I fell in love the first time I ever saw you  
And I couldnt get you off my mind  
You reminded me of candy  
So you be my Mary Jane  
And Ill be your Sugar Daddy  
And we can make sweet love all the time  
  
Id travel to the farthest star  
For the sweetness of your lovin  
Cause sweeter than the sugar in a candy bar  
Is the sweetness of your love  
My rocket would only stop  
For the sweetness of your lovin  
And all I ever think about  
Is the sweetness of your love  
  
If you call for it Ill deliver  
Ill bring you anything  
So fast itll make you shiver  
Whatever it is from A to Z  
Hey let me prove that I can love you  
Ill do a dance for you  
Anything that I can to get a chance to love you  
Of whomever you dream I wanna be  
  
Id take my money out the bank  
For the sweetness of your love  
Id buy you a great big diamond ring  
For the sweetness of your love  
Cause Ooo baby Id do anything  
For the sweetness of your lovin  
  
Id go ten rounds with Sugar Ray  
For the sweetness of your love  
And Id eat my Wheaties everyday  
For the sweetness of your love  
BANG ZOOM And he would fly away  
For the sweetness of your lovin  
  
You could be lost in danger with a stranger  
Caught up in mystery  
A one night insanity girl  
And quite an emotional tragedy it would be  
Then Id come running just to save you  
Id be your hero guy  
In a flash in a minute Id be there in no time  
And youd be forever loving me
