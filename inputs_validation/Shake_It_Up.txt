Dont like waiting  
Dont like waiting  
Lets go right now  
Gotta hit the ground  
Dancing before the music  
Slows down  
  
What Im sayin  
What Im sayin  
If theres something to fix  
Take it to another level  
This is the remix  
  
Everybody everybody  
Get out on the floor  
It can get a little crazy  
When the kick hits the floor  
  
Make a scene  
Make a scene  
Nobody can ignore  
Dont knock it til you rock it  
We cant take it no more  
  
Bring the lights up  
Bust the doors down  
Dust yourself off  
Shake it up  
Shake it up  
DJ set it off  
Take it up a notch  
All together now  
Shake it up  
Shake it up  
  
Shake it up  
Break it down  
Break it down  
Ive got something to say  
When youre dancin with me  
Its like we go MIA  
  
Make a scene  
Make a scene  
Nobody can ignore  
Dont knock it til you rock it  
We cant take it no more  
  
Bring the lights up  
Bust the doors down  
Dust yourself off  
Shake it up  
Shake it up  
DJ set it off  
Take it up a notch  
All together now  
Shake it up  
Shake it up  
  
Shshshshake it up  
You gotta change it up  
And if the days not right  
Just brush it off tonight  
Put on the attitude  
Your in my pocket mood  
And when youve had enough  
Shshshshake it up  
  
Bring the lights up  
Bust the doors down  
Dust yourself off  
Shake it up  
Shake it up  
DJ set it off  
Take it up a notch  
All together now  
Shake it up  
Shake it up  
  
Bring the lights up  
Bust the doors down  
Dust yourself off  
Shake it up  
Shake it up  
DJ set it off  
Take it up a notch  
All together now  
Shake it up  
Shake it up
