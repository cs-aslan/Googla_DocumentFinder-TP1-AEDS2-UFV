another falls in place  
you wonder if youre only human  
its blood dust and paste  
were held together by a single thread  
must be a reason for us to justify it  
but no one will defy it  
  
what is it with this place  
or is it that Im missing something  
you want to see my face  
when I cant even see it for myself  
must be a reason for us to justify it  
but no one will defy it  
  
I dont want a game that I dont no how to play  
just go away  
and I dont want to know how to play  
cant I make it just go away  
  
I dont want a game that I dont no how to play  
just go away  
and I dont want to know how to play  
cant I make it just go away  
  
dont you understand what these problems will demand  
make it just go away  
I dont want a game that I dont know how to play  
just go away  
  
must be a reason for us to justify it  
but no one will defy it
