Well youd better not tell Ive had a good night  
Me and this bird shes a bit of alright  
Dancing to the sounds as the arches get searched  
She is the business for a bit of old skirt  
Its so dirty when its in the right mood  
Give it some brandy and some chinese food  
Take her for a spin with your stereo jack  
Tell her shes the best girl youve ever had  
Give it some gold to put round its neck  
Bet here old man puts you on the deck  
But its so dirty with me  it so dirty with me  
Its so dirty with me  its so dirty with me  
  
Well youd better watch out here comes a tornado  
Youll end up looking like a mashed potato  
If her old man gets word of whats going on here  
Youll end up at the bottom of someones next beer  
  
Well Ive got a bud aint frightened by shooters  
So lets have a drink for a couple of troopers  
No her old man wont know Ive been giving it some  
Unless you tell him the news but we know that aint done
