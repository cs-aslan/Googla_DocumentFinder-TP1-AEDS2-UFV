Sing Michael singon the route of the nineteen bus  
Hear them sayin  
How you get a rude and a reckless  
Dont you be so crude and a feckless  
You been drinking brew for breakfast  
Rudie cant fail  
  
So we reply  
I know that my life make you nervous  
But I tell you that I cant live in service  
Like the doctor who was born for a purpose  
Rudie cant fail  
  
I went to the market to realize my soul  
Cause what I need I just dont have  
First they curse then they press me till I hurt  
We say Rudie cant fail  
  
We hear them sayin  
Now first you must cure your temper  
Then you find a job in the paper  
You need someone for a savior  
Oh Rudie cant fail  
  
We reply  
Now we get a rude and a reckless  
We been seen lookin cool an a speckless  
We been drinking brew for breakfast  
So Rudie cant fail  
  
Okay  
So where you want to go today  
Hey boss man  
Youre looking pretty smart  
In your chicken skin suit  
  
You think youre pretty hot  
In your pork pie hat  
ButRudie cant fail  
Look out look out  
Sky juiceten cents a bottle
