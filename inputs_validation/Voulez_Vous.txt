People everywhere  
A sense of expectation hanging in the air  
Giving out a spark  
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark  
And here we go again we know the start we know the end  
  
Chorus  
Masters of the scene  
Weve done it all before and now were back to get some more  
You know what I mean  
Voulezvous ahha  
Take it now or leave it ahha  
Now is all we get ahha  
Nothing promised no regrets  
Voulezvous ahha  
Aint no big decision ahha  
You know what to do ahha  
La question cest voulezvous  
  
Voulezvous  
I know what you think  
The girl means business so Ill offer her a drink  
Feeling mighty proud  
See you leave your table pushing through the crowd  
Im really glad you came you know the rules you know the game  
  
Chorus  
  
And here we go again we know the start we know the end  
  
Chorus  
  
Im really glad you came you know the rules you know the game  
  
Chorus  
  
Voulezvous  
Ahha ahha ahha  
Ahha ahha ahha  
Voulezvous ahha ahha ahha
