I think this intro should be more dramatic  
Ah man  
Its LL season lets ride  
  
Hands up hands up  
Hands up slip into the bath salt  
  
Push it never cuz I have to  
Push it its because Im a bastard  
Push it and I got the game mastered  
Push it ear drums dealing with harassment  
Push it we back to the basement  
Hand on my nuts thats product placement  
The game lost its flavor I wonder where the taste went  
Push it I said I wonder where the taste went  
Push it slip into the bath salt  
Push it slip into the bath salt  
Push it slip into the bath salt  
Push it real good  
  
Uh boss of all bosses  
Face in the car make a young girl noxious  
Yea this beat salad when I toss this  
Never go against me you lack resources  
What I skywalk with the forces  
Back in the 80s I was playin in Porsches  
Money aint a problem I toll my losses  
Maserati coup take galloping horses  
Nah theres never been one like me  
Theyre looking for a new me as if there might be  
Even with a love song thats unlikely  
If L aint the dope may lightning strike me  
Uh killin Queens all day  
I got what you want what you willin to pay  
Your boy ladies love sound clean on the track  
Slip into the bath salt wash my back come on  
  
Push it never cuz I have to  
Push it its because Im a bastard  
Push it and I got the game mastered  
Push it ear drums dealing with harassment  
Push it we back to the basement  
Hand on my nuts thats product placement  
The game lost its flavor I wonder where the taste went  
Push it I said I wonder where the taste went  
Push it slip into the bath salt  
Push it slip into the bath salt  
Push it slip into the bath salt  
Push it real good  
  
Honestly I was scared to come back  
It was ugly not knowing how the game would react  
Said my old gym teacher he supposed to rap  
But now I teach class put back Tony  
You see it in my eyes transparent like glass  
Giving all for my soul to have another smash  
Yea LL Cool J  
30 years later be me for a day  
Same day just a daddy she love me anyway  
So I told er what to read and I showed er how to pray  
Cats on my team got NBA  
But its my black from the web we stay  
I dont whack my suicides I act my age  
Never try to sound like a rapper I raised  
Roared as a tiger cant grow no brains  
But the moneys coming in in 360 ways  
  
Push it never cuz I have to  
Push it its because Im a bastard  
Push it and I got the game mastered  
Push it ear drums dealing with harassment  
Push it we back to the basement  
Hand on my nuts thats product placement  
The game lost its flavor I wonder where the taste went  
Push it I said I wonder where the taste went  
Push it slip into the bath salt  
Push it slip into the bath salt  
Push it slip into the bath salt  
Push it real good  
  
Lookin kinda salty over there  
Lookin kinda salty over there  
Lookin kinda salty over there  
Lookin kinda salty over there  
Lookin kinda salty over there  
Lookin kinda salty over there  
Lookin kinda salty over there  
Theys are kinda salty over there
