Verse  
Keep that light on in your window  
Undo the locks and let me in  
Ive come seeking my salvation  
The one whos lost in search of it  
The one whos lost in search of it  
  
Chorus  
Let me in and I will save you from the madness  
Let me in and I will keep you from storm  
With every motion every moment that weve owned  
Ill be here to break the fall

Keep that love light in your window  
Till I get back home to you  
Lift my heart and set your soul free  
Tell me loves the only truth  
Tell me loves the only truth  
  
Chorus  
Let me in and I will save you from the madness  
Let me in and I will keep you from storm  
Theres an open book of stories to be told  
And Ill be here to tell them all  
  
Bridge  
Oooooo Oooooo  
Oooooo Oooooo  
Oooooo Oooooo  
Oooooo  
  
Chorus  
Let me in and we can fill our lives with magic  
Let me in and we can keep each other warm  
With every motion every moment that we hold  
Ill be here to break the fall  
Im always here to break the fall
