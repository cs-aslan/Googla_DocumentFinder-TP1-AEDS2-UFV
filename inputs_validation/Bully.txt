Yo check it out its fucked up and I dont see either one of us budging  
  
Im withholding my anger  
Though Id like to be the strangler  
Of this punk ass little pussys puny neck  
Its my right to insist  
That he acknowledge my existence  
But he just displays complete lack of respect  
Thats what he says to himself  
As he uses magazines to trash me  
As he sits with both feet up at his desk  
Smokes a bag of his weed  
And starts imagining things  
And he just cant see that hes manically depressed  
And in his jealousy and envy  
It just whirls him in a frenzy  
As he turns on MTV and sees my face  
He dont exist in this world  
So he just twists and he twirls  
Spirals and spins till he runs himself in a rage  
And its destroying him slowly  
Cause he does not even know me  
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes  
So he just tortures himself  
He has no fortune and wealth  
So he extorts someone else to get his dough  
And now hes acting like a bully  
So he tries to push and pull me  
But he knows that he cant pull me so hes mad  
He has no choice but to scream  
And raise his voice up at me  
Cause it annoys him to see that I aint scared  
  
You aint no motherfucking bully  
And I aint bowing to no motherfucking bully  
I wont allow it aint no coward to no bully  
Ill be damned if I dont stand up to a bully  
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully  
  
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionally  
  
Now Im not trying to make no more enemies  
No more unfortunately  
Theres so many motherfuckers that just are  
They just keep pounding at me  
Now that Im down with 50  
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja laughter  
But his ass is such a puppet  
Irv could shove his whole hand up it  
And just make him say what he wants him to say  
But Suge has Irvs on a string  
And Irvs so nervous that he  
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay  
So now Ja thinks that hes so tough  
And Murder Incs the big bad wolf  
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down  
But our buildings made out of bricks  
So you aint taking out shit  
I know you just did a song with Bobby Brown  
So now you try to pull a race card  
And it backfires in your face hard  
cause you know we dont play that black and white shit  
Plus this guy that you fucked  
When you was ecstasied up  
Was just a man whos dressed up as a white bitch  
  
You must be taking to much E  
  
Now what bothers me the most  
About hiphop is we so close  
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac  
We just lost Jam Master J  
Big L got blasted away  
Plus we lost Bugs Slayed Son and Freaky Ta  
Its like a neverending cycle  
That just seems to come full circle  
Everyones gotta be so fucking hard  
Im not excluding myself  
cause I been stupid as well  
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart  
But as we grow as men  
We learn to let shit go but then again  
Theres only so much bullshit we can really stand  
We all got reps to uphold  
When someone steps on our toes  
Its no exception it goes for every man  
But if Irv really gave a fuck  
About Ja like he claims he does  
Hed wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs  
But he just keeps feeding him pills  
So if that E doesnt kill him  
Someone from GUnit will and I aint buzzed  
Dawg Im talking to you straight  
If the situation escalates  
Any worse were gonna lose another soldier to this game  
And if I get killed for this rap  
I got a million in cash  
That says I will get you back in Halies name  
  
Irvine get your boy off that E  
  
Get at me dawg  
Holla
