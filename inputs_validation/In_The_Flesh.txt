So ya  
Thought ya  
Might like to  
Go to the show  
  
To feel the warm thrill of confusion  
That space cadet glow  
Ive got some bad news for you sunshine  
Pink isnt well he stayed back at the hotel  
And they sent us along as a surrogate band  
And were going to find out where you fans  
Really stand  
  
Are there any queers in the theater tonight  
Get em up against the wall  
Theres one in the spotlight  
He dont look right to me  
Get em up against the wall  
  
That one looks Jewish  
And that ones a coon  
Who let all this riffraff into the room  
Theres one smoking a joint and  
Another with spots  
  
If I had my way Id have all of them shot
