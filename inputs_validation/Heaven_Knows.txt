Youre no dame Im no duke  
Somehow love is a fluke  
Weve survived thick and thin  
Taking knocks on the chin  
In the eyes of the sad  
We may be barking mad  
But the truth has been ceased  
We are like chalk and cheese  
You wind me up and I drive you mad  
Its a fact of life it goes hand in hand  
And I know that look its read like a book  
And I realize  
  
I dont care what the world has to say  
You should know that I love you  
I love you  
I love you today  
  
When the boat starts to rock  
Then my ears start to block  
All the words that you say  
Through the night through the day  
Where theres muck there is brass  
And the storm soon will pass  
Then its back to the norm  
All the cold turns to warm  
  
Sometimes I think life crawls like a snail  
And all of our dreams become the wind in your sails  
Without wealth its true who cares what you do  
And I realize  
  
I can feel the eyes behind us as we walk  
I can see the ears that listen when we talk
