I fought so hard for your heart on the way down  
And I thought that I could save you from destruction  
  
But I was never in controool never in control  
Fighting another war  
No I was never in controool never in control  
Fighting another war  
  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Now I aint boxing anymore  
Im letting go and its beautiful  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Is a losing battle  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
But I wont fight it anymore  
Im letting go and its beautiful  
  
I was hurting I couldnt let go I couldnt leave you  
And I told myself though it was hell that wed push through  
  
But I was never in controool never in control  
Fighting another war  
No I was never in controool never in control  
Fighting another war  
  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Now I aint boxing anymore  
Im letting go and its beautiful  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Is a losing battle  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
But I wont fight it anymore  
Im letting go and its beautiful  
  
But I was never in controool never in control  
Fighting another war  
No I was never in controool never in control  
Fighting another war  
  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Now I aint boxing anymore  
Im letting go and its beautiful  
Fist fighting a sandstorm

Was fist fighting a sandstorm
