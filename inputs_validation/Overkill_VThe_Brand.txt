Ride the wind son  
Through my eyes  
Youll see where you must stand  
  
Remember what your purpose is  
And that you were the brand  
  
Awaken in me if you can  
The deaths by ones own hand  
Remember where you came from  
And that you wear the brand  
You wear the brand  
  
Blatant born in fire  
With little more to say  
Than action speaks the loudest  
And yield the only way  
To quench the thirst  
Desire swifter than the hand  
In bloody fascination  
His pride to wear the brand  
  
Bend and twist and tear the will  
Show them where youve been  
A tribute to your Overkill  
A multitude of sin  
  
Awayaway no time to stay  
The union it still stands  
Willingness donation  
We all display the brand
