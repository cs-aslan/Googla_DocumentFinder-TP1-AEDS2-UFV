One two three four  
  
Wakey wakey  
Rise and shine  
Its on again off again on again  
Watch me fall  
Like dominos  
In pretty patterns  
Fingers in the blackbird pie  
Im tingling tingling tingling  
Its what you feel now  
What you ought to what you ought to  
Reasonable and sensible  
Dead from the neck up  
Because Im stuffed stuffed stuffed  
We thought you had it in you  
But no no no  
For no real reason  
  
Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles  
Take a bow take a bow take a bow  
Its what you feel now  
What you ought to  
What you ought to  
An elephant thats in the room is  
Tumbling tumbling tumbling  
In duplicate and duplicate  
Plastic bags and  
Duplicate and triplicate  
Dead from the neck up  
Guess Im stuffed stuffed stuffed  
We thought you had it in you  
But no no no  
Exactly where do you get off  
Is enough is enough is enough  
I love you but enough is enough enough  
A last stop  
Theres no real reason
