You knew we had to come back like this right man  
Its too hot in New York man yeah

Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses  
No ambulance no police sirens to interrupt my silence aha  dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day  
Playin my guitar Im sitting on the beach  
Im sippin margaritas as the water splash my feet  
Its too hot in New York I had to get away  
So heres a ticket meet me on the beach in the shade  
  
When I was young they called me Robin Hood  
Cause I stole from the rich and I gave to the poor  
Went back home mama whooped on my ass  
Said Ill be damned if I let you live like that  
Meanwhile next door neighbors jumpin  
Beatin on his wife while the kids were watchin  
Later that day we was out on the porch  
And fantasize we was out of New York we woke up in  
  
Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses  
No ambulance no police sirens to interrupt my silence aha  dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day  
Playin my guitar Im sitting on the beach  
Im sippin margaritas as the water splash my feet  
Its too hot in New York I had to get away  
So heres a ticket meet me on the beach in the shade  
  
Im in your hood like your neighbors were Spiderman  
Im in the club fore I entered the stadium  
I bring the vibe like the days of the Tribe  
Before I had the fame I was servin the fries  
So who better to know about a ninetofive  
Wakin up at five with the cold in my eyes  
Now my daddy he can rest in peace  
From the belly of the beast to the sunniest beach lets go  
  
Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses  
No ambulance no police sirens to interrupt my silence aha  dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day  
  
Playin my guitar used to daydream at the stars  
Prayin if I ever make it Im gon help my family make it  
From the streets of Brooklyn to the Jersey    
Im a stand on stage and play this guitar till I fall  
Santana let me get some help  
Santana let me get some help  
  
Eh this one goes out to those who work follow and   
Keep your head up cause if I made it you can make it too one day  
  
Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses  
No ambulance no police sirens to interrupt my silence aha  dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day  
Playin my guitar Im sitting on the beach  
Im sippin margaritas as the water splash my feet  
Its too hot in New York I had to get away
