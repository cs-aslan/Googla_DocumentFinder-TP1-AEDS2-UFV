People gettin judged by the skin tone  
  
It wasnt like this way back with the Flinstones  
  
Some times I get kept back because Im half black  
  
People cant except that YO except me for what I am

Because noneof us give a damn  
  
All they want is to drive a Mercedes  
  
Half a million dollars
