Ill catch a moonbeam to make you a gown  
Snowflakes to wear in your hair like a crown  
And youll wear them well  
Noelle Noelle  
  
Rainbows will make you a ring for your hand  
Stardust will carpet your own wonderland  
There youll always dwell  
Noelle Noelle  
  
Youre the smallest miracle  
That I will ever see  
But youre the greatest thing  
That ever happened to me  
  
Angels will whisper to bring you a breeze  
Ill make you music from their melodies  
This I can foretell  
For you for you  
Noelle
