Another dawn another day another dollar to be made  
I got a pocket in my soul where a little rock a little roll assimilate  
And I dont care what you think you know  
Bout who I am and how it goes  
I made it easy to be me so yeah Its easy to be me  
And its why I say  
Chorus  
I know you cant stand me cause I make you so angry more and more each day  
Hey hey hey  
The way you dont love me kind of makes you look ugly and the words you say  
Hey hey hey  
Come up and see me I kind of like the abuse  
Hey hey hey  
Theres no room in my bed  
But while youre here just bow your head and you can shine my shoes  
Shine my shoes  
Get outta my lane boy youre not in my league  
Some are born to thrive and some to underachieve  
Heres something thatll make you sick  
Im as happy as a pig in Sh  
Ive been amused Ive been about Ive been amazed Ive been betrayed  
Thats why I say  
Chorus  
I know you cant stand me cause I make you so angry more and more each day  
Hey hey hey  
The way you dont love me kind of makes you look ugly and the words you say  
Hey hey hey  
Come up and see me oh oh oh if you can take the abuse  
Hey hey hey  
Theres no room in my bed  
But while youre here just lend a hand and you can shine my shoes  
Shine my shoes  
Kneel down boy  
Chorus  
Its why you cant stand me you make me so angry more and more each day  
Hey hey hey  
The way you dont love me kind of makes you look ugly every the words you say  
Hey hey hey  
Come up and see me oh oh oh I kind of like the abuse  
Hey hey hey  
Theres no room in my bed  
But while youre here then bow your head and you can shine my shoes  
Shine my shoes  
Shine my shoes  
Until I see my face
