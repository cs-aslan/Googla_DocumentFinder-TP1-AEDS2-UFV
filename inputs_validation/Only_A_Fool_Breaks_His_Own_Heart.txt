Why do I go on fooling myself When I know you love somebody else  
Only a fool breaks his own heart  
I pretend I dont see you walking with him on the street  
Only a fool breaks his own heart  
  
I have to admit even though it hurt me so I cant forget  
If Im a man Ill let you go  
Theres no sense in holding on to an old love thats gone  
Only a fool breaks his own heart  
  
I have to accept even though it hurt me so I cant forget  
If Im a man Ill let you go  
Theres no sense in holding on to an old love thats gone  
Only a fool breaks his own heart  
Only a fool breaks his own heart
