Standing at the crossroads world spinning round and round  
Know which way Im going you cant bring me down  
Dont you try and teach me no original sin  
I dont need your pity for the shape Im in  
  
I dont wanna change the world  
I dont want the world to change me  
I dont wanna change the world  
I dont want the world to change me  
  
Tell me Im a sinner I got news for you  
I spoke to God this morning and he dont like you  
You telling all the people the original sin  
He says he knows you better than youll ever know him  
  
I dont wanna change the world  
I dont want the world to change me  
I dont wanna change the world  
I dont want the world to change me  
  
You know it aint easy  
You know it aint fair  
So dont try to please me  
Because I really dont care  
  
Dont tell me stories cause yesterdays glories  
Have gone away so far away  
Ive heard it said theres a light up ahead  
Lord I hope and pray Im here to stay  
  
Tell me Im a sinner I got news for you  
I spoke to God this morning and he dont like you  
Dont you try and teach me no original sin  
I dont need your pity for the shape Im in  
  
I dont wanna change the world  
I dont want the world to change me  
I dont wanna change the world  
I dont want the world to change me  
  
I dont wanna change the world  
I dont want the world to change me  
I dont wanna change the world  
I dont want the world to change me
