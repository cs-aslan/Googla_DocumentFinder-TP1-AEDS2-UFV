In your message you said you were goin to bed  
But Im not done with the night  
So I stayed up and read but your words in my head  
Got me mixed up so I turned out the light  
  
And I dont know how to slow it down  
My minds racing from chasing pirates  
  
Well the man in there swings while the silliest things  
Floppin around in my brain  
And I try not to dream but them possible schemes  
Swim around wanna drown me insane  
  
And I dont know how to slow it down  
Oh my minds racing from chasing pirates  
  
And I dont know how to slow it down  
Oh my minds racing from chasing pirates  
  
My minds racin from chasing pirates  
My minds racin from chasing pirates
