Theres noone watching over me tonight and Im afraid to turn out the lights  
If I close my eyes itll all go away and I dont wanna see it end this way  
  
There was a time when truth and trust meant so much more to each of us  
And all the dreams that once we had have seen the sun and left us feeling bad  
  
Now the changing of the guard has left us feeling so damn hard  
Ill keep my business but Im a little bit afraid  
Through the years one thing hasnt changed  
  
Yeah yeah yeahhey  
I would run through fields of fire  
I would crawl on broken glass  
Just to swin in your sea of devotion just to have a second chance  
Thats all I ask  
  
Now feeling good is not good enough I know theyve changed but not that much  
Midnight time has left us feeling beaten up I never was one who needs to give
enough  
I aint a hero who gets the girl but if I had my chance to save the world  
I wont blow it now I guess Ill understand  
This boy becoming a man  
  
Yeah yeah yeahhey  
I would run through fields of fire  
I would crawl on broken glass  
Just to swim in your sea of devotion just to have a second chance  
Thats all I ask  
  
Well look at your hands if you hear what I said  
Can you count on your fingers each of your real friends  
I know that Im lucky I know Im right  
Fingerst turn into fists were here to take on the night  
Thats right  
  
Now Im staring at an open door weve had a lot and I want much more  
You can keep all the money and the streets thats painted gold  
If someone gives me back my soul  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahhey  
  
I would run through fields of fire  
I would crawl on broken glass  
Just to swim in your sea of devotion just to have a second chance  
I would run through fields of fire  
I would run through fields of fire  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah I would run  
All the way back home I would run  
Baby come along
