A tatooed madman Im hell on wheels  
Born a wicked child left alone in the fields  
My father was the wind my mother was fire  
Raised by the wolves and I grew up wild  
A kamakazi man a hollering Banzai  
Never crash and burn never gonna die  
ya cannibal its me ya scream and shout  
Ill chew ya up and spit ya out  
  
Storms i gotcha comin and its gonna be me  
Here comes Trouble with a capital T tatata  
  
Cause Im a mean mother fucking man  
I gotta scream thats what I am  
All the way all the way  
Cause Im a mean mother fucking man  
Riding the wind and know Ill be damned  
All they way all the way all the way  
  
Chewbacca in the rye the water of fire  
A terror in the flesh a killer for hire  
California man Im white line Homer  
The unruly one they call the Blond Bomber  
Scooter gypsy Im a renegade  
An orphan on the road a live hand greande  
Never gonna quit before my time  
When the moon gets high then Ill be blind  
Mad dog 2020s kingooh  
I drink that stuff and start getting obscene  
  
Cause Im a mean mother fucking man  
I gotta scream thats what I am  
All the way all the way  
Cause Im a mean mother fucking man  
Riding the wind and know Ill be damned  
  
Im a motorcycle man  
Dont ever give a damn  
I lie when the truth serves better  
The Marquis de Sade I cheatsteal and rob  
A heavy metal creature  
All the way all the way all the way  
  
Cause Im a mean mother fucking man  
I gotta scream thats what I am  
All the way all the way  
Cause Im a mean mother fucking man  
Riding the wind and know Ill be damned  
All they way all the way all the way
