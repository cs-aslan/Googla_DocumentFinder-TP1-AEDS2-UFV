Fools game to risk perfection  
Out here alone on a wire  
Unsuspecting victim of desire  
You wear a thousand faces  
A master of disguise  
And Im addicted to the madness in your eyes  
  
Chorus  
You will always be the one I dream about  
And I know my heart wont beat the same again  
You will always be the shadow of a doubt  
Now I go crazy wondering what we might have been  
  
Your charms have made me suffer  
Why do I care where you are  
Im afraid my dignity has strayed too far  
Cant read what youre writing  
Unable to make the call  
Do you want me desperately  
Or not at all  
  
Chorus  
  
Cant read what youre writing  
Unable to make the call  
Do you want me desperately  
Or not at all
