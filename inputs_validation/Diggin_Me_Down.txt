Youre saving the saved  
Men and women enslaved  
Propagating the messiah conception  
The rich getting richer  
Paint you into the picture  
Give the poor immaculate deception  
  
Where are you Father  
Why dont you save us  
The fallen are dying alone  
How can you shut off their cries  
Ignore a new genocide  
So come on Jesus  
Were all here waiting just for you  
  
How long must we keep on waiting  
The faithful and blind are keepin me keepin me down  
How long Cause my faith is breaking  
The pure and divine are diggin me diggin me down  
  
Do you live in the light  
Or in the dead of the night  
Sanctimonious promises broken  
Hypocritical sin  
Dying slowly within  
Is the sacred truth forever unspoken  
  
Life ever after  
Bohemian rapture  
Beware the dark side of the sun  
Youre just a selfmade messiah  
Selling brimstone and fire  
So come on Jesus  
Dont keep us waiting just for you  
  
How long must we keep on waiting  
The faithful and blind are bringin me bringin me down  
How long Cause my faith is breaking  
The pure and divine are diggin me diggin me down  
  
How will I know you Mr Jesus Christ  
Have you already been here once or twice  
The son of man are obsolete facade  
How will I know that youre the son of God  
Yeah
