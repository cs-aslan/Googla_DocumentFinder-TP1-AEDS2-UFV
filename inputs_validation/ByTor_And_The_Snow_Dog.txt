I At the Tobes of Hades  
The Tobes of Hades  
Lit by flickering torchlight  
The Netherworld is gathered in the glare  
Prince ByTor takes the cavern  
To the north light  
The sign of Eth is rising in the air  
ByTor knight of darkness  
Centurion of evil  
Devils prince  
  
II Across the Styx  
Across the River Styx  
Out of the lamplight  
His nemesis is waiting at the gate  
The Snow Dog ermine glowing  
In the damp night  
Coalblack eyes shimmering with hate  
ByTor and the Snow Dog  
Square for battle  
Let the fray begin  
  
III Of the Battle  
  
Instrumental  
  
IV Epilogue  
The battles over  
And the dust is clearing  
Disciples of the Snow Dog sound the knell  
Rejoicing echoes  
As the dawn is nearing  
ByTor in defeat  
Retreats to Hell  
Snow Dog is victorious  
The land of the Overworld  
Is saved again
