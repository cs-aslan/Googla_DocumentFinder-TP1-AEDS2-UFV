The moon was shining on the lake at night  
The Slayer tshirt fit the scene just right  
Smeared mascara I looked into your eyes I saw a light  
  
You told me stories about your chickadees  
They didnt like BB guns or stupid archery  
You charmed the lifeguard to let them use the pool all day for free  
  
Then the conversation stopped and I looked down at my feet  
I was next to you and you were right there next to me  
And I said girl  
If youre wondering if I want you to I want you to I want you to  
So make a move Make a move cause I aint got all night  
  
The rest of the summer was the best we ever had  
We watched Titanic and it didnt make us sad  
I took you to Best Buy you took me home to meet your Mom and Dad  
  
Your Mom cooked meatloaf even though I dont eat meat  
I dug you so much I took some for the team  
Your dad was silent his eyes were fixed on what was on TV  
  
Then the conversation stopped and I looked down at the ring  
Your folks were next to you and you were right there next to me  
And I said girl  
If youre wondering if I want you to I want you to I want you to I want
you to  
I swear its true I swear its true without you my heart is blue  
Girl  
If youre wondering if I want you to I want you to I want you to  
So make a move Make a move cause I aint got all night  
  
So much pain may come our way  
There may come a day when we have nothing left to say  
When the conversation stops and were facing our defeat  
Ill be next to you and youll be right there next to me  
  
Then Ill say girl  
If youre wondering if I want you to I want you to I want you to I want
you to  
I swear its true I swear its true without you my heart is blue  
Girl  
If youre wondering if I want you to I want you to I want you to  
So make a move Make a move cause I aint got all night
