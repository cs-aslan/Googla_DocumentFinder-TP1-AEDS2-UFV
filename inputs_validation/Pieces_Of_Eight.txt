Its six oclock  
Good morning sounds are everywhere  
The warmth of spring a gentle breeze blows through my hair  
  
I hurry through my life never stopping to see  
How beautiful it was meant to be  
  
Im just a prisoner in a kings disguise  
Broken dreams as we shuffle by  
  
Its six oclock its quitting time Im done for the day  
Out on the streets I overheard a lady say  
We now have everything or so people say  
But now this emptiness haunts me every day  
We seek the lions share never knowing why  
Come alive spread your wings and fly  
  
Pieces of eight  
The search for the money tree  
Dont cash your freedoms in for gold  
Pieces of eight  
Cant buy you everything  
Dont let it turn your heart to stone
