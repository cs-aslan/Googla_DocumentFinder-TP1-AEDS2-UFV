I dont buy your true life stories  
cause Ive seen the way you lie  
but I dont mind the things you tell me  
because I know well say anything to get by  
  
but when were together  
somehow I feel better  
my disease always tricks me  
I believe you can fix me  
  
youre insane  
I love the drama  
tell the truth  
you love it too I know you do  
  
reason strikes  
we fight and break up  
cause it seems  
the easiest thing to do  
  
but when I dont get your call  
I go into withdrawal  
you consume every thought  
but if you called I would tell you to get lost  
  
I need you like a drug  
I need you I need you like a  
I need you I need you like a  
drug  
  
it turns me on  
to say I love you  
but deep inside I know  
its lust not love at all  
  
one day we will leave each other  
but we pretend the ends not inevitable  
I require protection from my own obsession  
in the object of you  
  
one day I will rise above you  
  
I need you I need you like a drug  
I need you I need you like a  
I need you I need you like a drug  
I need you I need you like a  
  
until then well stay together  
I guess things could be much worse  
I guess things could be much better  
but I dont really want to write another verse  
  
cause when were together  
somehow I feel better  
my disease always tricks me  
I believe you can fix me  
  
I need you I need you like a drug  
I need you I need you like a  
I need you I need you like a drug  
I need you I need you like a drug
