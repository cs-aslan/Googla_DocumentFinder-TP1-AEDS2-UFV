Ive seen two time losers running everywhere  
Shouting and screamin I was never there  
With their hands in the air  
Hands in the air  
  
Ive seen bad news messengers avoiding kings  
Cheating spouses twisting their rings  
With their hands in the air  
Oooh got their hands in the air  
As guilty as the wind out on the sea  
Affecting who we are and who well be  
  
Theres a desperation a real despair  
Even the good people are starting to declare  
Ive got my hands in the air  
Ah my hands are in the air  
  
Theyre surrendering theyre giving in  
Theyll do anything not to go through this again  
Theyve got their hands in the air  
Ooh their hands in the air  
  
And theyre sinking in the quicksand like a stone  
Broken to the marrow of the bone oh  
  
The dealers are dividing up their tips  
The gamblers theyre all cashin in their chips  
  
Theres a man in the middle of a parking lot  
Wondering which way he should go  
Theres a star on the horizon  
Sinking low low  
  
All you death wish addicts you corrupters of truth  
You killers of the spirit you marauders of youth  
Get your hands in the air  
I want to see your hands in the air  
  
If youre selling these lies these impossible dreams  
You can keep on washin but youll never get clean  
Get your hands in the air  
Let me see your hands in the air
