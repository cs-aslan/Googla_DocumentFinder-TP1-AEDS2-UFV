Most of the time  
Im advising my friends  
About whats wrong or right  
When they call me at night  
  
Now Im confused  
Cause my mind says Im a fool  
That its time to say goodbye  
But my tears cannot lie  
And my heart says I will lose if I try  
  
What if I would sacrifice my life for you  
What if I would say Id give up my dreams too  
What if you were meant to be my destiny  
But what if love was never meant for you and me  
  
Im trying real hard  
Cause I know that a friend is something you cant be  
Our love is too deep  
Or is this our fate  
Just a never ending battle no one else can see  
I refuse to give in  
But Im afraid to start something we cant win  
  
What if I would sacrifice my life for you  
What if I would say Id give up my dreams too  
What if you were meant to be my destiny  
But what if love was never meant for you and me  
  
Love is magic  
Love is irresistible  
But love is fearless and not able to see  
Love is gorgeous  
Love is unpredictable  
But love is brainless and sometimes so are we  
  
What if I would sacrifice my life for you  
What if I would Id give up my dreams too  
What if you were meant to be my destiny  
But what if love was never meant for you and me  
  
And our love was never meant for you and me  
No our love was never meant for you and me
