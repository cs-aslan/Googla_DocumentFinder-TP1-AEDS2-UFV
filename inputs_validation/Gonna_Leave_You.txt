Wait by the phone  
Late alone  
He cant help you  
But I know I could  
  
Free is too long  
You know this is wrong  
Everything scars the skin  
Push it in break it off  
  
Im gonna leave  
Im gonna leave you  
  
I gave it starts  
I stomped on your hearts  
This the is the end  
No more pictures we aint friends  
Its raining in my room  
Theres blood in my spoon  
Youre out of my highchair  
Im out of your womb  
  
Im gonna leave  
Im gonna leave you  
  
Free is too long  
You know this is wrong  
Everything scars the skin  
Push it in push it in break it off  
  
Im gonna leave  
Gonna leave you  
  
Im gonna leave  
I dont need you
