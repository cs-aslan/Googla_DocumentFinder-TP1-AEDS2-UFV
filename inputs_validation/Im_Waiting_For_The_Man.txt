Feel sick and dirty more dead than alive

Hey white boy what you doin uptown  
Hey white boy you chasin my women around  
Pardon me sir its furthest from my mind  
Im just waitin for a deardear friend of mine  
Im waiting for my man come on  
  
Here he comes hes all dressed in black  
Pr shoes and a big straw hat  
Hes never early hes always late  
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait  
Im waiting for my man  
  
Up to a brownstone up three flights of stairs  
Everybodys pinned you and nobody cares  
Hes got the works gives you sweet taste  
Then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
