There aint no reason you and me should be alone  
Tonight yeah baby  
Tonight yeah baby  
Ive got a reason that you who should take me home tonight  
  
I need a man that thinks its right when its so wrong  
  
Tonight yeah baby  
Tonight yeah baby  
Right on the limits where we no we both belong tonight  
  
Its hard to feel the rush  
To push the dangerous  
Im gonna run right to to the edge  
Where we can both fall over in love  
Im on the edge of glory  
And Im hanging on the moment of truth  
Im on the edge  
The edge x6
