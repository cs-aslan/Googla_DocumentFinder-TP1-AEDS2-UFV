Sittin here and rinkin Hey thats my favright song  
Whats that that Ihear ringin Would someone get the phone  
Wondrin if shell ever come home  
Ive had no sleep sad songs Im stoned  
Our love a fadin memry as I chase another down  
My eyes are gettin heavy and my heads spinnin round  
Stil wondrin if shell ever come home  
Ive had no sleep sad songs Im stoned  
Closing time I drive for home not feelin any pain  
Thoughts of her drift back tome through the fallin rain  
Not caring if she ever come shome  
Ive had no sleep sad songs Im stoned  
Ive had no sleep sad songs Im stoned
