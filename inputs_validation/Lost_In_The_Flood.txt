The ragamuffin gunner is returnin home like a hungry runaway  
He walks through town all aloneHe must be from the fort he hears the high
school girls say  
His countrysides burnin with wolfman fairies dressed in drag for homicide  
The hitandrun plead sanctuary neath a holy stone they hide  
Theyre breakin beams and crosses with a spastics reelin perfection  
Nuns run bald through Vatican halls pregnant pleadin immaculate conception  
And everybodys wrecked on Main Street from drinking unholy blood  
Sticker smiles sweet as Gunner breathes deep his ankles caked in mud  
And I said Hey gunner man thats qucksand thats quicksand that aint
mud  
Have you thrown your senses to the war or did you lose them in the flood  
  
That pure American brother dulleyed and emptyfaced  
Races Sundays in Jersey in a Chevy stock super eight  
He rides er low on the hip on the side hes got Bound for Glory in red
white and blue flash paint  
He leans on the hood telling racing stories the kids call him Jimmy the Saint  
Well that blazeandnoise boy hes gunnin that bitch loaded to blastin
point  
He rides head first into a hurricane and disappears into a point  
And theres nothin left but some blood where the body fell that is nothin
left that you could sell  
Just junk all across the horizon a real highwaymans farewell  
And I said Hey kid you think thats oil Man that aint oil thats blood  
I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm or was he just lost in
the flood  
  
Eighth Avenue sailors in satin shirts whisper in the air  
Some storefront incarnation of Maria shes puttin on me the stare  
And Bronxs best apostle stands with his hand on his own hardware  
Everything stops you hear five quick shots the cops come up for air  
And now the whizbang gang from uptown theyre shootin up the street  
And that cat from the Bronx starts lettin loose but he gets blown right off
his feet  
And some kid comes blastin round the corner but a cop puts him right away  
He lays on the street holding his leg screaming something in Spanish still
breathing when I walked away  
And somebody said Hey man did you see that His body hit the street with
such a beautiful thud  
I wonder what the dude was sayin or was he just lost in the flood  
Hey man did you see that those poor cats are sure messed up  
I wonder what they were gettin into or were they just lost in the flood
