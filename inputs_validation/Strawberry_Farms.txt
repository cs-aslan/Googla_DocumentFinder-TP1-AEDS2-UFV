Summer comes laughing to Strawberry Farms  
Have you ever been there where the wind never blows  
Summer comes early to Strawberry Farms  
Oh the sun always shines but an orphan cant go  
  
My mother is dead she doesnt care where I go  
My father left a long long time ago  
I had me a frog he never whined or cried  
I kept him in my pocket and he died  
Summer comes laughing to Strawberry Farms  
Have you ever been there where the wind never blows  
Summer comes early to Strawberry Farms  
Oh the sun always shines but an orphan cant go  
  
Bobby had a brother he got killed in the war  
I asked him but he didnt know what for  
My mother was pretty she had long black hair  
Once she promised me a teddy bear  
  
Summer comes laughing to Strawberry Farms  
Have you ever been there where the wind never blows  
Summer comes early to Strawberry Farms  
Oh the sun always shines and things dont die
