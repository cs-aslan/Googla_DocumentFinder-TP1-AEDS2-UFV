I wash my hands of this situation  
Of this complication that you call a relationship  
Scrub these walls I might even repaint em  
Cause your memory stained them  
And this colour just aint it  
Scratch that idea take this mess right here  
Watch it burn burn  
  
Cause a loss in love is a lesson learned  
Oh Im so much better for it  
Im so much better for dusting you off my shoulders  
Knowing that I dont need you no more  
Im so much better for it  
  
And Im movin cleanin out my closet  
And Ima get rid of all of this  
All of what you left in here  
Uh youve been officially evicted  
Cause you just dont get it  
So let me make it nice n clear  
Baby no more games  
Love and respect and truthin  
You must learn learn  
  
But a loss in love is a lesson learned  
Oh Im so much better for it  
  
Im so much better for dusting you off my shoulders  
Knowing that I dont need you no more  
Im so much better for it  
Im so much better for it  
Im so much better for dusting you off my shoulders  
Knowing that I dont need you no more  
Im so much better for it  
  
And Im better for no longer giving you  
Im gonna shoot me down out of the blue  
Better for finally realisin the truth  
That I can do so much better than you  
  
Oh Im so much better for it  
Im so much better for dusting you off my shoulders  
Knowing that I dont need you no more  
Im so much better for it  
Im so much better for it  
Im so much better for dusting you off my shoulders  
Knowing that I dont need you no more  
Im so much better for it  
Im so much better for it  
Im so much better for it
