Casper the friendly ghost  
The friendliest ghost you know  
Though grownups might  
Look at him with fright  
The children all love him so  
  
He always says hello Hello  
And hes really glad to meetcha  
Wherever he may go  
Hes kind to every living creature  
  
Grownups dont understand  
Why children love him the most  
But kids all know  
That he loves them so  
Casper the friendly ghost
