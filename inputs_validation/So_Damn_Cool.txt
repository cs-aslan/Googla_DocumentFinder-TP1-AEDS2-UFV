I want to know why the people are everywhere and  
I want to know where to go if I get scared and  
I want to be in a place where no one cares and  
  
I I I want to know you  
Cause youre so damn cool  
Yeah youre so damn cool  
  
I want to feel like Im floatin in the air and  
I want to know if the sunss gonna bleach my hair and  
I want to know why lifes so unfair and  
  
I want to know you  
Because youre so damn cool  
Yeah youre so damn cool  
  
Who knows what Im feelin inside of me  
And who knows if Im feelin all right  
Who knows what Im feelin inside of me  
Who knows what is runnin around in my brain  
  
Now that Im done and I seen it  
And dont think that Im tryin to complain  
Dont think Im lyin cause I mean it  
N all you people out there dont look at me to lay  
All of your blame cause you need me  
And you want me to go down  
In flames with the rest  
But Im so sick of denyin  
What is runnin around in my brain
