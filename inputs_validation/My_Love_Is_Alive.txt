Well I think its time to get ready  
To realize just what I found  
I have lived unaware of what I am  
Its all clear to me now that  
  
My heart is on fire  
My souls like a wheel thats turning  
My love is alive my love is alive  
  
Well theres something inside  
Thats makin me crazy  
Tryin to keep it together  
Cause what Im saying I have been saving  
And now could be forever  
  
My love is alive my hearts on fire  
Soul is like a wheel like a hot wire  
My love is alive my hearts on fire  
Souls like a wheel like a hot wire  
  
Theres a mirror inside my mind  
Reflectin the light that shines on me  
Hold on to the feeling  
Let it be let it grow  
My heart is on fire my love is alive  
  
Fire in my heart souls like a wheel thats turning  
My love is alive
