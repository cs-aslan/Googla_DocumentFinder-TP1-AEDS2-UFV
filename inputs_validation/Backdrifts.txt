Were rotten fruit  
Were damaged goods  
What the hell weve got nothing more to lose  
One gust and we will probably crumble  
Were backdrifters  
  
This far but no further  
Im hanging off a branch  
Im teetering on the brink  
Oh honey sweet  
So full of sleep  
Im backsliding  
  
You fell into our arms  
You fell into our arms  
We tried but there was nothing we could do  
Nothing we could do  
  
All evidence has been buried  
All tapes have been erased  
But your footsteps give you away  
So youre backtracking  
  
Ah ah ah  
You fell into our arms  
You fell into our arms  
We tried but there was nothing we could do  
Nothing we could do  
You fell into our ah  
You fell into a  
  
Were rotten fruit  
Were damaged goods  
What the hell weve got nothing more to lose  
One gust and we will probably crumble  
Were backdrifters
