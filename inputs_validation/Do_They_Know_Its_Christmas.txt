Its Christmas time theres no need to be afraid  
At Christmas time we let in light and we banish shade  
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy  
Throw your arms around the world at Christmas time  
  
But say a prayer pray for the other ones  
Oh at Christmas time its hard but when youre having fun  
Theres a world outside your window  
And its a world of dread and fear  
Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears  
And the Christmas bells that ring  
Are the clanging chimes of doom  
Well tonight thank God its them instead of you  
  
And there wont be snow in Africa this Christmas time  
The greatest gift theyll get this year is life  
Where nothing ever grows no rain or rivers flow  
Do they know its Christmas time at all  
  
Heres to you raise a glass for everyone  
Heres to them underneath that burning sun  
Do they know its Christmas time at all  
  
Feed the world  
Feed the world  
  
Feed the world let them know its Christmas time  
And feed the world let them know its Christmas time  
And feed the world let them know its Christmas time  
And feed the world let them know its Christmas time
