Well I want to shake that thing witcha all night long  
Yeah youre a princess baby you can do no wrong  
Said youre a beacon of light when the sun is gone  
Yeah youre a princess baby you can name that song  
  
Well they just couldnt touch you with a ten foot pole  
And they just couldnt  
You got so much juice you make the telephone ring  
You make me jump right up I want to shake that thing  
  
Witcha all night long  
Youre the princess of the universe  
Youre a princess baby you can do no wrong  
Youre the princess of the universe  
  
Well I aint seen nothing like it since the Sha got the rope  
You got a legion of liggers that would shame the Pope  
You just say the word and they run like hell  
You gotta take a cold shower so your head dont swell  
  
But you can do no wrong  
Youre the princess of the universe  
Youre a beacon of light when the sun is gone  
Youre the princess of the universe  
  
Well you aint got a man who can touch what you got  
But youre looking for a subject that can fill that slot  
When the count is down I want to step in time  
And when your fingers pop I want to tow that line
