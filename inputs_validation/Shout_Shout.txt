Correct me if you think that Im mistaken  
I wouldnt want to overstate my case  
But while Im the one bringing home the bacon  
Ive got a right to be heard around this place  
  
You seem to think that life dealt you a bad deal  
On the day we both pronounced the words I do  
You yell at me for hours about what bugs you  
Well thats a waste of time cause I can do that too  
  
Shout shout dont leave a doubt  
Smash up the place or throw things about  
You wont change a thing by doing that  
Rant rave pull out your hair  
Turn on the tears I still wont care  
You dont move me an inch when you do that  
  
Im trying my best to be your husband  
And a father to our little baby girl  
And Id rather rely on my own judgment  
Than the vagaries and fashions of this world  
  
If you wanted a doctor or a lawyer  
You should have married one of them instead of me  
Or some other guy who would ignore you  
When hed make a point and you would disagree  
  
Shout shout dont leave a doubt  
Smash up the place or throw things about  
You wont change a thing by doing that  
Rant rave pull out your hair  
Turn on the tears I still wont care  
You dont move me an inch when doing that  
  
And now Ill make my confessing  
I love to row as much as you  
But while it might be fun in the long run  
Its not going to change a thing we do  
  
Again I make my confession  
I love to row as much a you  
But while it might be fun in the long run  
Its not going to change a thing we do  
  
Shout shout dont leave a doubt  
Smash up the place or throw things about  
You wont change a thing by doing that  
Rant rave pull out your hair  
Turn on the tears I still wont care  
You dont move me an inch when you do that  
  
Shout shout dont leave a doubt  
Smash up the place or throw things about  
You wont change a thing by doing that  
Rant rave pull out your hair  
Turn on the tears I still wont care  
You dont move me an inch when you do that
