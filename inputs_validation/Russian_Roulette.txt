Back street dive down in New Orleans  
Gambler shows his face  
The place was full of jacks and queens  
But I never came up with that breadwinning ace  
Whiskys cheap at twice the price  
When it kills the pain of bad tumbling dice  
The scenes all set for an IOU  
Give it one more spin then thats me Im through  
The wheels like a chamber in Russian roulette  
Im takin a chance and Im gunnin for red  
The wheels like a chamber in Russian roulette  
Im takin a chance and Im gunnin for red  
Lost my shirt headed for the bar  
Gonna drown my sorrows in a whisky jar  
Head hung low because I got beat  
I see a hundred dollar bill layin at my feet  
chorus  
Headed for the tables Im wearin my shades  
Got to find me a lucky green top  
Cant be one Ive played  
My hands are shakin dont wanna lose my cool  
Should I keep the big see or gamble like a fool  
chorus
