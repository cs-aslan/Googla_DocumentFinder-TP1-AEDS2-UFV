I thought I knew the magic of you  
And then you kissed me  
Dear when you kissed me  
I simply stood there and gazed completely amazed  
I walked around both feet on the ground  
And then you kissed me  
Dear when you kissed me  
I found myself on a cloud apart from the crowd  
I had nothing to glow about  
You came by  
Now I know all theres to know about  
Things like stars in the sky  
I will confess I thought for awhile  
That youd resist me  
But then you kissed me  
And now Im in love  
I will confess I thought for awhile  
That youd resist me  
But then you kissed me  
And now Im in love  
You kissed me  
And now Im in love
