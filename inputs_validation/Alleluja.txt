The shadow dance  
Is ready now to take us over  
I dont know why  
I dont know why  
  
The moons alive  
The sun has gone and run for cover  
Burning blind  
Burning blind  
  
Darkness waits  
Im dancing with the devils lover  
To pass the time  
To pass the time  
  
And all of this is just a game  
We tell each other  
Alleluja  
Shell always try to rule ya  
  
Shell be laughing at the night  
But dont you let that fool ya  
She said she came from far away  
To find a lover  
  
I dont know why  
I dont know why  
She said she knew  
That we would always be together  
  
And then she cried  
And then she cried  
I spend my nights in wonder  
If Ill ever know her  
  
Shes in my mind  
Shes in my mind  
She laughs and turns smiles  
And blushes like a flower  
  
Alleluja  
Shell always try to rule ya  
Shell be laughing  
Lauging at the night  
  
Alleluja  
Youll need to find the answer  
Bur neon doesnt shed  
That kind of light  
  
But dont you let that fool ya
