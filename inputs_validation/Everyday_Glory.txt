In the house where nobody laughs  
And nobody sleeps  
In the house where love lies dying  
And the shadows creep  
A little girl hides shaking  
With her hands on her ears  
Pushing back the tears til the pain disappears  
  
Mama says some ugly words  
Daddy pounds the wall  
They can fight about their little girl later  
Right now they dont care at all  
No matter what they say  
No matter what they say  
  
Everyday people  
Everyday shame  
Everyday promise  
Shot down in flames  
  
Everyday sunrise  
Another everyday story  
Rise from the ashes  
A blaze of everyday glory  
  
In the city where nobody smiles  
And nobody dreams  
In the city where desperation  
Drives the bored to extremes  
  
Just one spark of decency  
Against a starless night  
One glow of hope and dignity  
A child can follow the light  
No matter what they say  
No matter what they say  
  
If the futures looking dark  
Were the ones who have to shine  
If theres no one in control  
Were the ones who draw the line  
Though we live in trying times  
Were the ones who have to try  
Though we know that time has wings  
Were the ones who have to fly
