Black boys employ Selassie  
We kiss we define  
White hands white hearts  
The gender  
How can I make you mine  
  
Take me to God  
In a world of blank kisses  
Who breaks the colors  
I know what this is  
A one man show  
Thats how we know  
Thats how we know  
Your white does the blood flow  
  
Chorus  
Your white dance like an enemy  
Your white dance like an enemy  
Your white dance like an enemy  
  
White boys fall out  
In a whirl of decisions  
Show me what is  
Then show me what isnt  
A heart too slow  
Thats how we know  
Thats how we know  
Your white does the blood flow  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre so white  
Youre so white  
White boy Repeat x6  
  
White boy dance  
Do something sweet  
Like pull my heart  
Like use your feet  
Like steal some culture  
Lets fake this dance  
A white boy kiss  
A white boy chance  
Dont take me over  
Abuse my heart  
When I change color Im here stop start  
  
Hey devil kiss me  
Im taking chances  
Not faking my culture  
The rhythm it dances  
I love your wisdom  
I love your mind  
White boys are babies not my kind  
This lust in fashion  
Thats my sin  
By falling out  
Were falling in  
Now Im broken  
Watch it flow  
Im taking over  
Cant let go falling out with the bad boys
