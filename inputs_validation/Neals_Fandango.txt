Well a travelin mans affliction makes it hard to settle down  
But Im stuck here in the flatlands while my heart is homeward bound  
Goin back Im too tired to roam Loma Prieta my mountain home  
On the hills above Santa Cruz in the place where I spent my youth  
Well it was Neal Cassady that started me to travelin  
All the stories that were told I believed them every one  
And its a windin road Im on you understand  
And no time to worry bout tomorrow when youre followin the sun  
  
Papa dont you worry now and mama dont you cry  
Sweet woman dont forsake me Ill be comin by and by  
  
Goin back Im too tired to roam Loma Prieta my mountain home  
On the hills above Santa Cruz in the place where I spent my youth
