So fine  
So fine yeah  
And babe youre mine  
You make me walk  
You make me talk  
About you  
Oh theres nothing in this world that I wouldnt do for you  
Because youre  
So fine  
So fine  
And every time we meet  
My heart skips a beat  
Youre in my first cup of coffee  
Gonna be my last cup of tea  
Because youre  
So fine  
And babe youre mine  
You make me walk  
You make me talk  
About you
