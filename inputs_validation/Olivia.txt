Verse 1 Niall  
Remember the day we were giving up when you told me I didnt give you enough  
And all of your friends were saying Ill be leaving you  
Shes lying in bed with my tshirt on just thinking how I went about it wrong  
This isnt the stain of a red wine Im bleeding love  
  
PreChorus Liam  
Please believe me dont you see  
The things you mean to me  
Oh I love you I love you  
I love I love I love Olivia  
  
Chorus Harry  
I live for you I long for you Olivia  
Ive been idolising the light in your eyes Olivia  
I live for you I long for you Olivia  
Dont let me go dont let me go  
  
Verse 2 Liam  
Say what youre feeling and say it now cause I got the feeling youre walking
out  
And time is irrelevant when Ive not been seeing ya  
The consequences are falling now theres something Im having nightmares
about  
And these are the reasons Im crying out to be with ya  
  
PreChorus Liam  
Please believe me dont you see  
The things you mean to me  
Oh I love you I love you  
I love I love I love Olivia  
  
Chorus Harry  
I live for you I long for you Olivia  
Ive been idolising the light in your eyes Olivia  
I live for you I long for you Olivia  
Dont let me go dont let me go  
  
Bridge Harry  
When you go and Im alone you live in my imagination  
The summertime and butterflies  
All belong to your creation  
I love you its all I do I love you  
  
Chorus All  
I live for you I long for you Olivia  
Ive been idolising the light in your eyes Olivia  
I live for you I long for you Olivia  
Dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go
