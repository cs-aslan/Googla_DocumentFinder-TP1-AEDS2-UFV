In my eyes indisposed  
In disguises no one knows  
Hides the face lies the snake  
And the sun in my disgrace  
Boiling heat summer stench  
Neath the black the sky looks dead  
Call my name through the cream  
And Ill hear you scream again  
  
Black hole sun  
Wont you come  
And wash away the rain  
Black hole sun  
Wont you come  
Wont you come Wont you come  
  
Stuttering cold and damp  
Steal the warm wind tired friend  
Times are gone for honest men  
And sometimes far too long for snakes  
In my shoes a walking sleep  
And my youth I pray to keep  
Heaven sent hell away  
No one sings like you anymore  
  
Black hole sun  
Wont you come  
And wash away the rain  
Black hole sun  
Wont you come  
Wont you come  
  
Black hole sun  
Wont you come  
And wash away the rain  
Black hole sun  
Wont you come  
Wont you come Black hole sun Black hole sun  
  
Wont you come Black hole sun Black hole sun  
Wont you come Black hole sun Black hole sun  
Wont you come Black hole sun Black hole sun  
  
Hang my head drown my fear  
Till you all just disappear  
  
Black hole sun  
Wont you come  
And wash away the rain  
Black hole sun  
Wont you come  
Wont you come  
  
Black hole sun  
Wont you come  
And wash away the rain  
Black hole sun  
Wont you come  
Wont you come Black hole sun Black hole sun  
Wont you come Black hole sun Black hole sun  
Wont you come Black hole sun Black hole sun  
Wont you come Black hole sun Black hole sun  
Wont you come Black hole sun Black hole sun  
Wont you come Black hole sun Black hole sun  
Wont you come  
Wont you come
