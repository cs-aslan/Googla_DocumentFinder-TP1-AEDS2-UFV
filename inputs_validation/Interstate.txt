Children are laughing  
In the sun  
I count the voices  
One by one  
But Im not there  
To share the fun  
Im out on the interstate  
I can hear  
A soft voice calling  
Calling me  
To bring my guitar home  
  
Im happy singing  
In a crowd  
The lights are bright  
The musics loud  
I like to look  
In every face  
But out on the interstate  
I can hear  
A soft voice calling  
Calling me  
To bring my guitar home  
  
Out in the dusty  
Desert wind  
The fox goes looking  
For a friend  
She sees a light  
Around the bend  
Im out on the interstate  
I can hear  
A soft voice calling  
Calling me  
To bring my guitar home
