Well there was a boy from Arkansas who wouldnt listen to his Ma  
When she told him that he should go to school  
Well Hed stay away in the afternoon take a little walk and pretty soon  
Youd find him at the local auction barn  
Well hed stand and listen carefully until at last he began to see  
How the auctioneer could talk so rapidly

Well the time went by and he did his best and all could see he did not jest  
He practiced calling bids both night and day  
Till his pappy found him behind the barn just working up an awful storm  
As he tried to imitate the auctioneer  
And his pop said Son we just cant stand to have a mediocre man  
Selling things at auction using our good name

And from that boy that went to school there grew a man who played it cool  
He come back home a full fledged auctioneer  
And the people would come from miles around  
Just to hear him make that rhythmic sound  
That filled their hearts with such a happy cheer  
And his fame spread out from shore to shore hed all that he could do and

He had to buy a plane to get around  
Well now hes the best in all the land lets pause and give that man a
