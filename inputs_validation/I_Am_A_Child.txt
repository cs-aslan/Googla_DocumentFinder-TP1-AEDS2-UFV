I am a child I last a while  
You cant conceive of the pleasure in my smile  
You hold my hand buff up my hair  
Its lots of fun to have you there  
  
I gave to you now you give to me  
Id like to know what youve learned  
The sky is blue and so is the sea  
What is the color when black is burned  
What is the color  
  
You are a man you understand  
You pick me up and you lay me down again  
You make the rules you say whats fair  
Its lots of fun to have you there
