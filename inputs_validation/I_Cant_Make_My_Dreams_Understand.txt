I kiss him goodnight and tell him I love him then I keep my rendezvous  
Knowing that when I go to sleep Im gonna dream about you  
I cant make my dreams understand that its wrong  
To dream about you when with him I belong  
Ive made vows to God and Ive made vows to man  
But I just cant make my dreams understand  
 guitar   
My fingers are crossed when I say Im happy but lying just dont make it right  
And each night when I go to sleep I dream you are holding me tight  
I cant make my dreams
