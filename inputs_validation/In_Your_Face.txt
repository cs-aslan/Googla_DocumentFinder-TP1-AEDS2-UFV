Ill never cut my hair  
Ill never shed my skin  
I wont give in  
cause thats the original sin  
  
Now I Know I dont belong  
Cant do right if I cant be wrong  
You wont catch me  
SInging the same old song  
No you wont  
  
Ask me no questions  
And Ill tell you no lies  
I never say never  
Yeah I never say die  
  
Dont push me to the limit  
Wouldnt want to be in your place  
Better look out  
Cause the ACE is in your face  
  
In your face  
I know I always go too far  
In your face  
Oh yeah but Ive been  
Saved by my guitar  
In your face  
They say I come from  
Another place  
In your face  
Oh yeah Im the man  
From outer space  
  
Now ask me no questions  
And Ill tell you no lies  
I never say never  
I never say die  
  
You might be hallucinating  
I cant tell if you are on glue  
What I cant have  
Is what I want  
I think you know its true  
  
In your face  
I know I always go too far  
In your face  
Oh yeah but Ive been  
Saved by my guitar  
In your face  
Everyone knows I come from  
Outer space  
In your face  
Just dont forget  
Ill always be there  
In your face  
  
Thats right  
Im the man  
Thats right curly  
Thats right  
Im the ace
