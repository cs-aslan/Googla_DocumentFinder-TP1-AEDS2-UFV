Remind me to tell you  
Bout the old silver miner  
Name of hard rock Pete  
Had his house built on a slope  
They say one of his legs  
Lived in Calico  
Theres a rumor going round  
That the other lived in hope  
So I walked in the room  
And I stopped  
I turned around  
And looked over my shoulder  
And a voice close beside me said  
Youd better watch your head  
The partys over  
  
It wasnt long before  
The waitress came over and said  
Can I freshen up your drink  
And have you heard of these boys  
And if you feel included  
To buy some cowboy boots  
Well its not that bad  
We can talk above the noise  
So I sucked on my beer  
Shut my eyes  
And tried to listen to the words  
I know I missed the meaning  
But the message  
Was something Id already heard  
  
Johnny Ringos voice  
Is getting deeper  
And now hes going to put  
Another lock on the door  
The night is getting later  
My head is getting lighter  
The mood is getting darker  
Tequilas being poured  
So I smile  
At the old gunslinger  
In his frame on the wall  
As he pushed back his hat  
And its all coming back  
Id cut a long story short  
But its much too late for that  
  
Somebody stole my guitar  
They took it from  
The back seat of my car  
  
I was sleeping in Memphis  
In my hotel room  
And somebody stole my guitar
