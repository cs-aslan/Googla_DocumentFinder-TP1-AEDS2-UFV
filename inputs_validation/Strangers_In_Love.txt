Strangers in love must a star fall from the sky  
Its stranger than most and stranger when we try  
To understand it all why we fall  
As strangers in love  
Strangers in love  
Straight from the farm and a world apart and ready for  
Someone to take her arm shes never seen a movie  
  
What an innocent face what an innocent place  
Its natural its an easy thing to do  
Natural its an easy thing to do  
Strangers in love and a star fell from the sky  
Dont know which way to turn dont know which boat to burn  
Dont know which way to turn dont know which boat to burn  
Strangers in love
