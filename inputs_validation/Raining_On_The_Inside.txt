When all goodbyes  
Are said and done  
And nighttime finds you home  
Are you all right  
To spend a night  
Of being all alone  
And do you hide  
Between the lines  
Of conversations past  
A wall of words  
A heart unheard  
That hides behind a mask  
Im raining on the inside  
My heart wells up with tears that start to pour  
Im raining on the inside  
But then your cries of love break through  
And I fall in love with you once more  
When friends who care  
Cant be there  
To ease away my pain  
And peace of mind  
Its hard to find  
Like sunlight in the rain  
God sees my heart  
The deepest part  
Inside this lonely me  
And reachin in  
His love begins  
To heal the heart in me  
Im raining on the inside  
Oh my heart wells up with tears that start to pour  
Im raining on the inside  
But then your cries of love break through  
And I fall in love with you once more  
Sometimes were raining on the inside  
And our hearts well up with tears that start to pour  
But when were raining on the inside  
Let his cries of love break through  
Know that he loves you once more  
Sometimes Im raining on the inside  
But then your cries of love break through  
And I fall in love with you once more
