Ive been here a while  
Staring at this screen wondering what Ill write  
Things I cant explain  
But shouldve tried to say when I had the time  
  
You were inspiration  
When no one else believed  
You showed me strength in my skin  
That no one else could see  
  
Lets just keep driving on  
All the stars jumping in through the windows  
Lets go where we belong  
Headed fast as we can for the unknown  
  
I remember how  
Like a telescope you could always find  
You could always find  
Something worth a wish  
You said every days a gift and well be alright  
Well be alright  
  
And something took you from me  
I cant understand why  
But wherever youre resting Im carrying  
Im carrying your line  
  
Lets just keep driving on  
All the stars jumping in through the windows  
Lets go where we belong  
Headed fast as we can for the unknown  
  
You can stay there  
And its not fair  
Those were the days when we laughed all the while  
When the fireflies  
Lit up our skies  
Those were the nights when the world made us smile  
  
My only hope  
Youre my telescope  
My only hope  
Youre my telescope  
My only hope  
Youre my telescope  
My only hope  
Youre my telescope  
  
Lets just keep driving on  
Lets go where we belong  
  
Lets just keep driving on  
All the stars jumping in through the windows  
Lets go where we belong  
Headed fast as we can for the unknown  
  
You can stay there  
And its not fair  
Those were the days when we laughed all the while  
When the fireflies  
Lit up our skies  
Those were the nights when the world made us smile  
  
My only hope  
Youre my telescope  
My only hope  
Youre my telescope  
My only hope  
Youre my telescope  
My only hope  
  
My only hope  
Youre my telescope
