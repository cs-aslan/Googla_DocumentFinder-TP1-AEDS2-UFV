They wanna sell it out buy it up  
And dumb it down  
A good god is hard to find  
Ill join the crowd that wants to see me dead  
Right now I feel I belong for the first time  
Multiply your death divide by sex  
Add up the violence and what do you get  
We are all just stars and were waiting  
We are all just scarred and were hating  
We are all just stars on your burning flag  
  
You can point your gun at me  
And hope it will go away  
But if God was alive  
He would hate you anyway  
  
My right wing is flapping  
The left wing is grey  
Lets hear it for the kids but nothing they say  
They gyrate and Grate on Election Day  
We got our ABCs and our FUCK  
FUCK  
FUCK  
  
Multiply your death divide by sex  
Add up the violence and what do you get  
We are all just stars and were waiting  
We are all just scarred and were hating  
We are all just stars on your burning flag  
  
You can point your gun at me  
And hope it will go away  
If God was alive  
He would hate you anyway  
  
We are all just stars and were waiting  
We are all just scarred and were hating  
We are all just stars on your burning flag  
Stars on your burning flag  
Stars on your burning flag  
Stars on your burning flag  
Stars on your burning flag  
Stars on your burning flag
