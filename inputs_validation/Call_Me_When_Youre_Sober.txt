Dont cry to me if you loved me  
You would be here with me  
You want me come find me  
Make up your mind  
  
Should I let you fall lose it all  
So maybe you can remember yourself  
Cant keep believing  
Were only deceiving ourselves  
And Im sick of the lie  
And youre too late  
  
Dont cry to me if you loved me  
You would be here with me  
You want me come find me  
Make up your mind  
  
Couldnt take the blame sick with shame  
Must be exhausting to lose your own game selfishly hated  
No wonder youre jaded  
You cant play the victim this time  
And youre too late  
  
Dont cry to me if you loved me  
You would be here with me  
You want me come find me  
Make up your mind  
  
You never call me when youre sober  
You only want it cause its over its over  
  
How could I have burned paradise  
How could I  
You were never mine  
  
So dont cry to me if you loved me  
You would be here with me  
Dont lie to me just get your things  
Ive made up your mind
