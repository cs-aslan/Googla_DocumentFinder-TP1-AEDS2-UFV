Oh me oh my Whatll I do  
I can find an elephant to tie my shoe  
But I know what and so do you  
I dont need an elephant to tie my shoe  
No you dont need an elephant to tie your shoe  
  
Oh me oh my Whatll I do  
I can find a lumberjack to pour my milk  
But I know what and so do you  
I dont need a lumberjack to pour my milk  
No you dont need a lumberjack to pour your milk  
  
Oh me oh my Whatll I do  
I can find a dinosaur to eat me up  
But I know what and so do you  
I dont need a dinosaur to eat me up  
No you dont need a dinosaur to eat you up  
  
Oh me oh my Whatll I do  
I dont have a radio to sing a song  
But I know what and so do you  
I dont need a radio to sing a song  
No you dont need a radio to sing a song
