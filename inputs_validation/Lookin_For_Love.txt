Chorus  
Lookin for love in all the wrong places  
Just to find someone that can erase  
The hurt you feel if you could youd get a potion  
The love of God it flows deeper than an ocean  
Lookin for love you know that I can show you  
Cause what I got goes on and on and on  
Your heart is broken and youre wondering  
What you can do to ease the hurt and pain you feel  
Youre letting these no ones get in closer  
Than they need to cause youre looking for love  
Oh I got a feeling no ones told you  
No ones bothered at all to give you what you need  
So youre out searchin for something to hold on to  
But you dont know its right there if youd only see  
On your own now doing your own thing  
Say you dont need nobodys help to make it through  
But youre really wasting your time youre still lonely  
And you know that youre gonna find that youre only  
Left more empty than you were before oh but Im telling you  
Oh you dont have to look around  
Let me tell you bout the love that I have found  
Everything that our heart needs its just right here  
Right here waiting  
Oh you dont have to look no more  
Real love is knocking on your door  
Everything that your soul needs its just right here  
Right here waiting for you  
Bridge  
Oh my friend Im telling you Ive been there myself a time or two  
When I was just running round to find a place for my heart that  
Was beaten down  
Theres something you need to see the One who made you  
Loves you please believe  
Hes all you need to get by you know youre somebody so tell me why youre  
repeat chorus
