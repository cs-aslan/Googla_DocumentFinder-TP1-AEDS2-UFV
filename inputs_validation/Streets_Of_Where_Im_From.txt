Ive been down Ive been down too far to care  
I keep getting in my car but Im not going anywhere  
And Ive been had well at least thats how it looks  
And its not funny like on TV and its not smart like it is in books  
And I wonder yeah I wonder how the world keeps spinnin around  
Wheres a boy with bad intentions gonna settle down  
And I dont know what youve been told  
The streets of where Im from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
Yeah the streets of where Im from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
I recall when I was twentythree  
Wondering how anyone could fall in love with me  
But now Im old hell Im well past twentyfive  
And I cant seem to fall in love no matter how I try  
And I wonder where Ill wind up but Im headed west I know  
Wind my way through Texas and into New Mexico  
And I dont know what youve been told  
The streets of where Im from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
Yeah the streets of where Im from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
And I dont know what youve been told  
The streets of where Im from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
Yeah the streets of where Im from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
Yeah the streets of where Im from are paved with hearts instead of gold
