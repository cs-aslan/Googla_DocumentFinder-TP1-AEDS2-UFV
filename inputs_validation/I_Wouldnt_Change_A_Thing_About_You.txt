Ive always loved you because youve been so true  
Youve always been so kind youve never made me blue  
Youre the girl of my dreams and I think its time you see  
That I cant live without you I wouldnt change a thing  
About you but your name  
Dont answer too quick please think it over dear  
I swear Id love you forever and the year  
Youre the only love Ive known I know wed have a happy home  
No I cant live without you I wouldnt change a thing  
About you but your name  
  
I wouldnt change a thing about you but your name  
And I cant wait until theyre both the same  
For your hearts so good and true to your pretty eyes of blue  
No I cant live without you I wouldnt change a thing  
About you but your name
