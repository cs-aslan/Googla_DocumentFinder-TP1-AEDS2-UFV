Yeh yeh we need the rain  
Yeh yeh to wash the trains  
Endless nights  
Tortured days  
Trains of no return  
  
Loel ani akro aneni  
Avka bachol lailo aneni  
Ten tal umotor aneni  
Ho aneni  
  
Dont let them grow again  
Oh no not again  
Dont let them roll again  
The trains of no return  
  
Yeh yeh we need the rain  
Yeh yeh to wash the trains  
Endless nights  
Tortured days  
Trains of no return  
  
Loel ani akro aneni aneni aneni  
Sham zaaku kolot anenu  
Baaru orot anenu  
Hu lo yeshaker  
  
Kol haor kol hachoshe  
She yofer mikol rayou eich  
Din haelohim molech  
Hem gam me vakshim  
  
Yeh yeh we need the rain  
Yeh yeh to wash the trains  
Endless nights  
Tortured days  
Trains of no return  
  
Dont let them grow again  
Oh no not again  
Dont let them roll again  
The trains of no return  
Dont let them grow again  
Oh no not again  
Dont let them roll again  
The trains of no return  
Yeh yeh we need the rain
