I hope that I wont be that lone anymore  
Maybe Ive learned this time  
I hope that I find what Im reaching for  
The way that is easin my mind  
  
Some day Ill get over you  
Ill live to see it all through  
But Ill always miss  
Dreamin my dreams  
With you  
  
But I wont let it change me not if I can  
Id rather believe in love  
Ill give it away as much as I can  
To those that Im fondest of  
  
Some day Ill get over you  
Ill live to see it all through  
But Ill always miss  
Dreamin my dreams  
With you  
  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
Some day Ill get over you  
Ill live to see it all through  
But Ill always miss  
Dreamin my dreams  
With you  
  
But Ill always miss  
Dreamin my dreams  
With you
