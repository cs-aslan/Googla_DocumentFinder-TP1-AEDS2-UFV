Now I aint sayin them LA ladies dont know what theyre doin  
And I been in love with New York City a time or two  
I had some Seattle coffee some Chicago wind  
Some Kansas wheat fields Id love to see again  
But the fireflies play where the cattails grow  
And them southern girls they talk nice and slow with  
  
Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey  
Little bit crazy like New Orleans  
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny  
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans  
Dont you know  
Aint nothing in the whole wide world  
Like a southern girl  
  
Southern girl rock my world  
Hazel eyes and golden curls  
Put on a country song  
Will dance all night long  
  
A southern girls mama probably taught her how a lady should act  
But a southern girls probably got a barn somewhere reared out back  
Shell get a little hay in her hair her thighs in the mud  
Shes been caught in the rain and washed in the blood  
Likes jiggers in her coke takes a little sip  
Comes over to me with them sunburned lips and them  
  
Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey  
Little bit crazy like New Orleans  
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny  
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans  
Dont you know  
Aint nothing in the whole wide world  
Like a southern girl  
  
Southern girl rock my world  
Hazel eyes and golden curls  
Put on a country song  
Will dance all night long  
  
If youve ever seen savannah heat up when the stars come out  
Well then fellows come on you know what Im talkin about  
  
Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey  
Little bit crazy like New Orleans  
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny  
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans  
Dont you know  
Aint nothing in the whole wide world  
Like a southern girl  
  
Southern girl rock my world  
Put on a country song  
  
Southern girl rock my world  
Hazel eyes and golden curls  
Will dance all night long  
  
Southern girl rock my world  
Hazel eyes and golden curls  
Put on a country song  
Will dance all night long  
  
Southern girl rock my world  
Hazel eyes and golden curls  
Put on a country song  
Will dance all night long  
  
Southern girl rock my world  
Hazel eyes and golden curls  
Put on a country song  
Will dance all night long
