I seen you walk along the riverside  
I seen you walk along at ease  
And in the air I feel a silence  
It whispers perfect on the breeze  
And theres a voice that keeps me company  
It takes me closer to the stream  
And in the break of any suffering  
It makes me feel like theres no pain  
Finally finally finally Im getting closer  
To the dream  
To my dream I believe  
Im up a creek and youre my paddle  
Where there is you there is my soul  
Another dream where Im the witness  
I am the witness to your goal  
Finally finally finally Im getting closer  
To the dream  
To my dream I believe
