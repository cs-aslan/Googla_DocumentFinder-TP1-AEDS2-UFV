Well I quit my job down at the car wash  
Left my mama a goodbye note  
By sundown Id left Kingston  
With my guitar under my coat  
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis  
Got a room at the YMCA  
For the next three weeks I went huntin them nights  
Just lookin for a place to play  
Well I thought my pickin would set em on fire  
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man  
Well I nearly bout starved to death down in Memphis  
I run outta money and luck  
So I bought me a ride down to Macon Georgia  
On a overloaded poultry truck  
I thumbed on down to Panama City  
Started pickin out some o them all night bars  
Hopin I could make myself a dollar  
Makin music on my guitar  
I got the same old story at them all night piers  
There aint no room around here for a guitar man  
We dont need a guitar man son  
So I slept in the hobo jungles  
Roamed a thousand miles of track  
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama  
At a club they call Big Jacks  
A little fourpiece band was jammin  
So I took my guitar and I sat in  
I showed em what a band would sound like  
With a swingin little guitar man  
Show em son  
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean  
Find yourself down around Mobile  
Make it on out to a club called Jacks  
If you got a little time to kill  
Just follow that crowd of people  
Youll wind up out on his dance floor  
Diggin the finest little fivepiece group  
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico  
Guess whos leadin that fivepiece band  
Well wouldnt ya know its that swingin little guitar man
