Feat Dr Dre  
  
III gotta make make my way  
Way through all these people  
I didnt put all this money  
Just so so I I can see ya  
Im about to act a fool  
I used to dawg on you  
Im about to bon bon  
Chicky bon bon bon me  
Run it back  
  
I got technology  
XRay vision anything  
I can see through  
I get static every time you speak  
Frequency got to be equal  
Im tired of playing  
Cant even hear the shit you saying  
Its like make the noises Lol  
  
Hologram Im pushing up close  
But its hard to get to ya  
Hologram theres a glitch  
In the system tell me  
What I gotta do now  
Oh damn  
Illusion confusion  
Im losing ground Oh oh oh  
Hologram

You want me to flip the switch  
So I I can be your victim  
I aint gotta slip up  
Like going it outside in the rain  
With no umbrella  
What the hell you take me for  
Ima take a different route  
Im about to bon bon  
Chicky bon bon bon me  
Run it back  
  
Bang bang choochoo train  
Baby put that thing on me  
Youd rather see my main frame  
Not the cage  
You about to see another side of me  
And shed be like T minus 7  
Before my system shut us down  
Matter of fact I think  
Im about to shut down right now

Right now I think your times up  
Giving mixed signals

Im losing my mind  
Perfect model before my time  
Download to my instant data  
Give me a socket I can plug in

Oh damn  
Illusion confusion
