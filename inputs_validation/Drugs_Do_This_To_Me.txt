Verse 1  Paul Cain  
Damn ma  
I love you like a lie  
I get a rush from your touch sort of like a high  
I used to adore your presence but now Im like goodbye  
Kept it a hundred with you what give you the right to lie  
We in two different spaces and you done turned gemini  
Completely changed faces  
You wouldnt understand even if we trade places  
Youll never find another me face it  
  
Broadway  
My life aint sweet  
I dont know who told you that  
My shoes might want to tiptoe in that  
Walk slow with that  
Im the same aint changed  
But the hate where home is at  
Got me like damn where my homies at  
Fuck it its just me  
Cant hold me back  
You just cant bite the hand that feeds you  
Especially when the hands illegal  
I got you cold  
Consider it a lesson learned  
Im guessing it was just my turn  
To learn the hard way  
You cant always trust the ones you love  
  
Hook

Verse 2  fabolous  
You got to take the good with the bad  
Love what you got remember what you had  
Always forgive but never forget  
Learn from mistakes but never regret  
I feel like its coming it just aint never done yet  
You wanna take off go head rev up the jet  
Aint gotta act like our paths should had never met  
Lets be happy apart instead of together upset  
I got the least out of something I put the most into  
Its fucked up when assholes are who we toasting to  
You remind me of somebody that I used to know  
Me and that other you werent introduced before  
And I dont like that bitch  
We go from belly  
I dont like that shit

Thats still a case  
Ben franks the only familiar face

You look so familiar too  
But you just wouldnt do this to me  
I know you just wouldnt do this to me  
Not you Im sorry I must have you confused  
Cause that cant be love  
You took advantage of a good thing  
And that aint a good thing  
Take it how you want  
  
Verse 3  
I guess she forgot how I used to hold her  
The nights she was goin through it  
Crying on my shoulder  
And did a 360 its like she got colder  
Im starting to regret all the things that I showed her  
But Im a rider  
She used to be my roller  
I guess the general just lost his best soldier  
I thought I felt some type of bond and got close to her  
She mean to me more  
Cuz ya boy a ghost to her  
  
Hook

I know you just wouldnt do this to me  
Not you Im sorry I must have you confused
