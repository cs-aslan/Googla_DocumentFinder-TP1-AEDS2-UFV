Time has told me  
Youre a rare rare find  
A troubled cure  
For a troubled mind  
  
And time has told me  
Not to ask for more  
Someday our ocean  
Will find its shore  
  
So Ill leave the ways that are making me be  
What I really dont want to be  
Leave the ways that are making me love  
What I really dont want to love  
  
Time has told me  
You came with the dawn  
A soul with no footprint  
A rose with no thorn  
  
Your tears they tell me  
Theres really no way  
Of ending your troubles  
With things you can say  
  
And time will tell you  
To stay by my side  
To keep on trying  
Til theres no more to hide  
  
So leave the ways that are making you be  
What you really dont want to be  
Leave the ways that are making you love  
What you really dont want to love  
  
Time has told me  
Youre a rare rare find  
A troubled cure  
For a troubled mind  
  
And time has told me  
Not to ask for more  
Someday our ocean  
Will find its shore
