I hate a lot of things  
I hate a lot of people that are lame  
I like to hate stuff  
Cause then I dont havae to try and make  
  
A change  
I hate teachers  
I hate school  
I hate the cheerleaders  
  
And anyone whos cool  
I hate the office  
I hate the Quad  
Dont want to learn nothing  
I want to be a slob  
  
Its cool to hate  
Its cool to hate  
I dont like nothing and I like that fine  
Liking somethings just a waste of time  
  
Its cool to hate  
Its cool to hate  
I dont like nothing and I like that fine  
Liking somethings just a waste of time  
  
I dont like nothing and like that fine  
Liking somethings just a waste of time  
Yeah I hate everything  
I even hate you too  
So fuck you  
  
Im always thinking bad  
I never have nothing good to say  
Id rather tear things down  
Than build them up  
  
Its easier that way  
I hate the jocks  
And I hate the geeks  
I hate the trendies  
  
But I also hate the freaks  
I hate Dr Martens  
And Muscle Ts  
Im only happy when Im in my misery  
  
Ill cut you down and give you lip  
Being positives so unhip  
Ill cut you down cause Im a fool  
Being positives so uncool  
  
I hate the jocks  
And I hate the geeks  
I hate the trendies  
But I also hate the freaks  
  
I hate your band  
And I hate TV  
Im only happy when Im in my misery
