Ears twitch like a dog  
Breaking eggs in a dish  
Do not mock me when I say  
This is not a lie  
  
Its funny thing half serious  
With our hands on our ears  
Living dreams with mouths ajar  
Wide awake we go to sleep  
  
However absurd however absurd  
It may seem  
However absurd however absurd  
It may seem  
  
Something special between us  
When we made love the game was over  
I couldnt say the words  
Words wouldnt get my feelings through  
So I keep talking to you  
  
However absurd however absurd  
It may seem  
However absurd however absurd  
It may seem  
  
Custom made dinosaurs  
Too late now for a change  
Everything is under the sun  
But nothing is for keeps  
  
However absurd however absurd  
It may seem  
However absurd however absurd  
It may seem
