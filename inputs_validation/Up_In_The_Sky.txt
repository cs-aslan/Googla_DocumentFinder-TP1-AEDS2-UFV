Hey you Up in the sky  
Learning to fly  
Tell me how high  
Do you think youll go  
  
Before you start falling  
Hey you Up in a tree  
You want to be me  
But that couldnt be  
  
Cause the people here they dont hear you calling  
How does it feel  
When youre inside me  
Hey you wearing the crown  
  
Making no sound  
I heard you feel down  
Well thats too bad  
Welcome to my world  
  
Hey you Stealing the light  
I heard that the shines  
Gone out of your life  
Well thats just too bad  
  
Welcome to my world  
Youll need assistance with the things that you have never ever seen  
Its just a case of never breathing out  
Before youve breathed it in  
  
How does it feel  
When youre inside me  
Hey you Up in the sky  
Learning to fly  
  
Tell me how high  
Do you think youll go  
Before you start falling  
Hey you Up in a tree  
  
You want to be me  
But that couldnt be  
Cause the people here they dont hear you calling  
How does it feel  
  
When youre inside me  
Youll need assistance with the things that you have never ever seen  
Its just a case of never breathing out  
Before youve breathed it in  
  
How does it feel  
When youre inside me
