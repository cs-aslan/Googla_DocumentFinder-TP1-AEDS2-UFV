Chorus  
Well I got here at eight and Ill be here till two  
Ill try my best to entertain you and  
Please dont mind me if I get a bit crude  
Im your late night evening prostitute  
  
So drink your martinis and stare at the moon  
Dont mind me Ill continue to croon  
Dont mind me if I get a bit loon  
Im your late night evening prostitute  
  
And dance have a good time  
Ill continue to shine  
Yes Dance have a good time  
Dont mind me if I slip upon a rhyme  
  
Chorus  
Well I got here at eight and Ill be here till two  
Ill try my best to entertain you and  
Please dont mind me if I get a bit crude  
Im your late night evening prostitute Repeat x2
