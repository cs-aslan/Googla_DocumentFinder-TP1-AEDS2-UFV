If I passed you on the street  
Would you look the other way  
Afraid that we would meet  
Could it be that its down to tears  
After all the love we knew  
It was so hard losing you  
Now I feel it coming on  
That emptiness again  
  
Cause Ive been living without your love  
Just making believe I can still get by  
Paying the price inside oh  
God knows the hardest thing Ill ever do  
Losing you ooh oh  
  
I try to put the thoughts away  
But I see your face before me  
As you turn to walk away  
And I can force a smile  
Cause it turned out so wrong  
After feeling so right so long  
And Im just not ready for another day alone  
  
Cause Ive been living without your love  
Just making believe I can still get by  
Paying the price inside oh  
God knows the hardest thing Ill ever do  
Losing you  
  
Yeah yeah  
I feel it coming on  
That emptiness again  
  
Cause Ive been living without your love oh  
Just making believe I can still get by  
Paying the price inside  
Lord knows the hardest thing Ill ever do  
Losing you  
  
Im just living  
Oh living without your love  
Ill get by  
But Im paying yeah  
Without your love  
I cant get back to much more love  
Oh no  
Im not ready for  
Im not ready for  
Love and loneliness  
Living oh yes Im living without your love  
Ill just get by  
Im just getting by  
I cant stand it much longer  
Ah living living without
