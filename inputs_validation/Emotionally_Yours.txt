Come baby find me come baby remind me of where I once begun  
Come baby show me show me you know me tell me youre the one  
I could be learning you could be yearning to see behind the closed door  
But I will always be emotionally yours  
  
Come baby rock me come baby locl me into the shadows of your heart  
Come baby teach me come baby reach me let the music start  
I could be dreaming but I keep believing youre the one Im living for  
And I will always be emotionally yours  
  
Its like my whole life never happened  
When I see you its if I never had a thought  
I know this dream it might be crazy  
But its the only one I got Okay  
  
Come baby shake me come baby take me I would be satisfied  
Come baby hold me come baby help me my arms are open wide  
I could be unraveling wherever Im traveling even to foreign shores  
But I will always be emotionally yours
