Here we are  
Late in the hours that start another day  
Here am I  
Skirting around what I really want to say  
  
Brothers  
Well they hold a place in your heart  
Theyre something apart  
But then  
Lovers  
Well thats a different thing to talk about  
  
All this world  
You know Id give you my love  if there were more  
But these words  
Cover the roads that weve walked so long before  
Thats another feeling  
Thats a different story  
When weve really nowhere to start  
Thats another feeling  
Thats another place in your heart  when I say brothers  
  
Weve got really nowhere to start  
Thats another feeling  
Thats a different story  
Theyre simply just two worlds apart  
Thats another feeling  
Thats another place in my heart  when I say brothers  
  
When ever we two get talking about love  
It always ends up  
Ends up in tears  
I would have thought by now youd know me  
So please stop cryin  
And wasting those tears
