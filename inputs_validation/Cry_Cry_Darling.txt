Cry cry darling thats what I do if youd leave me with the blues  
Cry cry darling thats all I do if its you I should lose  
For me thered be no moonlight if ever we should part  
Cry cry darling thats what I do cause youre the one in my heart  
  
Cry cry darling my eyes will cry and never dry if you should go  
Cry cry darling when shadows creep Ill just weep all night I know  
You know how much Id miss you if ever we should part  
Cry cry darling thats all I do cause youre the one in my heart
