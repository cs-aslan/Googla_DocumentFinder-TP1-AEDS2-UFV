Mr ten dollar man  
Let me tell where youre bound  
Drink your green liqour Lord  
Youll roll to the ground  
But you come around here  
With your money in your hand  
Taste of my woman  
Well you die where you stand  
  
Snake mountain blues  
Got me down low  
I could die in the morning  
But no one would know  
When my woman come around  
My body shed find  
Go down to Dundee  
Have her a time  
  
Snake mountain gonna crumble  
And fall from the sky  
Before that woman of mine  
Stops tellin her lies  
If Id die Lord shed weep  
Shed weep and shed mourn  
Soon as Is buried  
Forget Id been born  
  
Love of blackskin woman  
She wont do you no wrong  
Slow to start moaning  
She dont moan for long  
Yellow headed woman  
Brings nothing but pain  
Take all you give her  
She leaves only shame  
  
My daddy Lord he rides  
On a long holy train  
First winds of winter  
I see him again  
In this farewell to this  
Yellow headed misery Ive known  
Snake mountains calling  
Calling me home  
  
Snake mountain blues  
Got me down low  
I could die in the morning  
But no one would know  
When my woman come around  
My body shed find  
Go down to Dundee  
Have her a time
