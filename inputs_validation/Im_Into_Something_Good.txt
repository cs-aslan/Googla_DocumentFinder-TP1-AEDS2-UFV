Woke up this mornin feelin fine  
Theres somethin special on my mind  
Last night I met a new guy in the neighbourhood whoa yeah  
Somethin tells me Im into something good  
  
Hes the kind of guy whos not too shy  
And I can tell hes my kind of guy  
He danced close to me like I hoped he would whoa yeah  
Somethin tells me Im into something good  
  
We only danced for a minute or two  
He stuck to me the whole night through  
Last night we fell in love  
Hes everything Im dreamin of  
  
Somethin tells me Im into something good  
  
We only danced for a minute or two  
He stuck to me the whole night through  
Last night we fell in love  
Hes everything Im dreamin of  
  
He walked me home and I held his hand  
I knew it couldnt be just a onenight stand  
So I asked to see him again and he said I could  
Somethin tells me Im into something good  
  
Somethin tells me Im into something good  
Something good whoa yeah something good  
Something good whoa yeah something good
