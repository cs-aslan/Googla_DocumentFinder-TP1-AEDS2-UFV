I feel Im burning up with fever  
The fires feeling really good tonight  
But its all right  
Cause Im gonna see Sahara Jack and Suntan Sally  
Somebody tells me even Tommys coming down  
Tonight If Gina says its all right  
  
Im gonna see those senoritas lying under the sun  
Yeah theyre greasing it up with their stereos on  
You know I want to be their blanket gonna tell every girl  
Hey baby youre the one  
  
Chorus  
Whoa tell the boys Im on my way  
I got the radio blasting in my old mans Chevrolet  
I got a party in my pocket  
And you know I just got paid  
And Im feeling fine its 99 in the shade  
  
When the sun goes down thats when the street heats up  
Senorita margarita fills your empty cup tonight  
She makes me feel so right  
A good time here doesnt cost much money  
Just a little sweet talking let the pretties in the party  
And youre set for life  
Or one hell of a night  
  
I can see those sons of beaches  
Out there livin it up  
In the surf and the sand  
Man that life aint so tough  
So get me in the action  
Let me tell every girl shes the one  
  
Chorus  
  
And Im feeling fine its 99 in the shade  
I can almost taste it   
  
99 99 99  
99 in the shade  
99 99  
99 in the whoa  
  
Chorus  
  
I got the radio cranked in my old mans Chevrolet
