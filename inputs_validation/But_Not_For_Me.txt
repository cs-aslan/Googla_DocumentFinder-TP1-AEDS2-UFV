Old man sunshine listen you  
Never tell me dreams come true  
Just try it and Ill start a riot  
  
Oprah Winfrey dont you dare  
Ever tell me she will care  
Im certain its the final curtain  
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas  
Who tell you fate supplies a mate its all bananas  
  
Theyre writing songs of love  
But not for me  
A lucky stars above  
But not for me  
With love to lead the way  
Ive found more skies of gray  
Than any Russian play  
Could guarantee  
  
I was a fool to fall  
And get that way  
Hi ho alas  
And also lack a day  
Although I cant dismiss  
The memory of her kiss  
I guess  
Shes not for me  
  
It all began so well  
But what an end  
This is the time  
A fella needs a friend  
The climax of the plot  
Should be a marriage knot  
But theres  
No knot for me  
  
Although I cant dismiss  
The memory of her kiss  
I guess  
Shes not for me
