Ive got a livin thats rough a future thats tough  
You know what I mean  
Blankers and boasters all the bluffers and posers  
Im not into that scene  
  
You can tell me that I got no class  
Look around youll see whos laughin last  
Dont give me speeches cause theyre oh so droll  
Leave me alone let me rock and roll  
  
Got an itchin to rock a hate for small talk  
Im funny that way  
Got my sights on the stars wont get that far  
But Ill try anyway  
I just like to please dont like to tease  
Im easy like that  
Dont like long rests I must confess  
Im an impatient cat  
  
I do the best that I can  
Im just what I am  
I do the best I can  
Well I know what I am  
  
Rock and rollins a scream makin millions my dream  
Well I do that a lot  
Ill just give it a try wont let good times pass me by  
Theyre all Ive got
