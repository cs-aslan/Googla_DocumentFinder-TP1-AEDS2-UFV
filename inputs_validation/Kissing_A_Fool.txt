You are far  
When I could have been your star  
You listened to people  
Who scared you to death  
And from my heart  
Strange that you were strong enough  
To even make a start  
But youll never find  
Peace of mind  
Till you listen to your heart  
  
People  
You can never change the way the feel  
Better let them do just what they will  
For they will  
If you let them  
Steal your heart from you  
People  
Will always make a lover feel a fool  
But you knew I loved you  
We could have shown them all  
We should have seen love through  
  
Fooled me with the tears in your eyes  
Covered me with kisses and lies  
So goodbye  
But please dont take my heart  
  
You are far  
Im never gonna be your star  
Ill pick up the pieces  
And mend my heart  
Maybe Ill be strong enough  
I dont know where to start  
But Ill never find  
Peace of mind  
While I listen to my heart  
  
People  
You can never change the way the feel  
Better let them do just what they will  
For they will  
If you let them  
Steal your heart from you  
People  
Will always make a lover feel a fool  
But you knew I loved you  
We could have shown them all  
We should have seen love through  
  
But remember this  
Every other kiss  
That youll ever give  
Long as we both live  
When you need the hand of another man  
One you really can surrender with  
I will wait for you  
Like I always do  
Theres something there  
That cant compare with any other  
  
You are far  
When I could have been your star  
You listened to people  
Who scared you to death  
And from my heart  
Strange that I was wrong enough  
To think youd love me too  
I guess you were kissing a fool  
You must have been kissing a fool
