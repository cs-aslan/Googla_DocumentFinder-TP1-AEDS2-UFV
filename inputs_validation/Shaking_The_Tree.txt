Souma Yergon Sou Nou Yergon We are shakin the tree  
Souma Yergon Sou Nou Yergon We are shakin the tree  
  
Waiting your time dreaming of a better life  
Waiting your time youre more than just a wife  
You dont want to do what your mother has done  
She has done  
This is your life this new life has begun  
Its your day  a womans day  
Its your day  a womans day  
  
Turning the tide you are on the incoming wave  
Turning the tide you know you are nobodys slave  
 1989 version  Find your Brothers and sisters   
 1990 version  Find your sisters and brothers   
Who can hear all the truth in what you say  
They can support you when youre on your way  
Its your day  a womans day  
Its your day  a womans day  
  
Souma Yergon Sou Nou Yergon We are shakin the tree  
Souma Yergon Sou Nou Yergon We are shakin the tree  
Souma Yergon Sou Nou Yergon We are shakin the tree  
  
 extra lyrics from 1989 12 remix   
  
Theres nothing to gain when theres nothing to be lost  
Theres nothing to gain if you stay behind and count the cost  
Make the decision that you can be who you can be  
You can be  
Tasting the fruit come to the Liberty Tree  
Its your day  a womans day  
Its your day  a womans day  
  
 end of extra lyrics from 12 remix   
  
Changing your ways changing those surrounding you  
Changing your ways more than any man can do  
Open your heart show him the anger and pain so you heal  
Maybe hes looking for his womanly side let him feel  
  
You had to be so strong  
And you do nothing wrong  
Nothing wrong at all  
Were gonna to break it down  
We have to shake it down  
Shake it all around

Souma Yergon Sou Nou Yergon We are shakin the tree
