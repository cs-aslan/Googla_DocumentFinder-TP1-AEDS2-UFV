Salty river  
Falls asleep in the bay  
Always gets there  
Never early never late  
  
Nothings happening  
Nothings happening by the sea  
  
White waves tumble down  
And gently roll back into blue  
On wooden seats outside the bar  
The couples make their rendezvous  
  
Nothings happening  
Nothings happening by the sea  
  
The trouble has been found  
Theres too far ups and too many downs  
I found a level that feels just right  
Theres no mistaking where Im going tonight  
  
Nothings happening  
Nothings happening by the sea
