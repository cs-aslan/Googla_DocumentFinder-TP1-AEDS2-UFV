Chorus  
Haters in the club back up  
Gold Diggers back up  
Broke niggaz back up  
I suggest I suggest that you back up  
Verse 1  
Im in the cut in the club  
Scopin the scene  
Cup half way full  
Smokin the green  
She got her hand on my nuts  
What does that mean  
Pointed at her friend  
And she said theyll tag team  
Now who said dreams dont come true  
Its like Im dreamin  
When I come through  
I always find something to run through  
Speak into the mike mami  
Mic check one two  
Drunk in the club  
Off the chain  
But who gives as fuck  
Thats why I came  
So pour it up  
And get down  
Yall have no choice  
But to listen to Pit now  
Chorus  
Put your ass in reverse baby back up  
It dont involve money then back up  
Dawg get from me and back up  
Everytime I fall I get right back up  
Haters in the club back up  
Gold diggers back up  
Broke niggaz back up  
I suggest I suggest that you back up  
Verse 2  
Everybody knows  
Pits got tight raps  
When Im in the club  
DJs bring it back  
With no questions asked  
But the number one question is  
Does he got cash  
Lil Jons at the bar  
While me and them eastside boys smoke out  
Roll another one  
No doubt  
Get a couple hoes  
Roll out  
Beef you dont want none  
To go down  
dumb diddy dumb dumb  
My times now  
The city Im from  
Is covered with federals  
Thatll make your crew run run  
Your crew run run  
Its next to come  
Chorus  
Put your ass in reverse baby back up  
It dont involve money then back up  
Dawg get from me and back up  
Everytime I fall I get right back up  
Haters in the club back up  
Gold diggers back up  
Broke niggaz back up  
I suggest I suggest that you back up  
Verse 3  
I convince mami to creep on the DL  
Even though my head spinning  
Like some sprewells  
Skip the details  
Its the vodka bottom line  
thats testin my patience like doctors  
Im not impressed by the cool shit  
Or those chains or that ice or them cars  
All thats bullshit  
If thats what your lookin for  
Keep lookin hoe  
Cause you got the wrong one bitch  
Ill let you know  
Mamis like damn  
That Cubans shot out  
Bitch I came to the club  
To wild out  
If you came to act up  
Then you need to get from me bitch  
And back up  
Chorus  
Put your ass in reverse baby back up  
It dont involve money then back up  
Dawg get from me and back up  
Everytime I fall I get right back up  
Put your ass in reverse baby back up  
It dont involve money then back up  
Dawg get from me and back up  
Everytime I fall I get right back up  
Haters in the club back up  
Gold diggers back up  
Broke niggaz back up

Haters in the club back up  
Gold diggers back up  
Broke niggaz back up
