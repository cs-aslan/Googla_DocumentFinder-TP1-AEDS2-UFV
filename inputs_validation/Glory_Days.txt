I had a friend was a big baseball player  
Back in high school  
He could throw that speedball by you  
Make you look like a fool boy  
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar  
I was walking in he was walking out  
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks  
But all he kept talking about was  
  
Glory days well theyll pass you by  
Glory days in the wink of a young girls eye  
Glory days glory days  
  
Well theres a girl that lives up the block  
Back in school she could turn all the boys heads  
Sometimes on a Friday Ill stop by  
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed  
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up  
I guess its two years gone by now  
We just sit around talking about the old times  
She says when she feels like crying  
She starts laughing thinking about  
  
Glory days well theyll pass you by  
Glory days in the wink of a young girls eye  
Glory days glory days  
  
Think Im going down to the well tonight  
And Im going to drink till I get my fill  
And I hope when I get old I dont sit around thinking about it  
But I probably will  
Yeah just sitting back trying to recapture  
A little of the glory well time slips away  
And leaves you with nothing mister but  
Boring stories of  
  
Glory days yeah theyll pass you by  
Glory days in the wink of a young girls eye  
Glory days glory days  
  
Yeah theyll pass you by  
Glory days in the wink of a young girls eye  
Glory days glory days
