Verse  
What about the children  
Look at all the children we can change  
What about a vision  
Be a visionary for a change  
Were the generation  
Whos gonna be the one to fight for it  
Were the inspiration  
Do you believe enough to die for it  
  
Chorus  
Whos got the heart Whos got it  
Whose heart is the biggest  
Wear it on your sleeve  
Bet we can make a difference  
Whos got the heart Whos got it  
Whose heart is the biggest  
Wear it on your sleeve  
Bet we can make a difference  
Oh yeah  
  
Whos got the heart  
Oh yeah
