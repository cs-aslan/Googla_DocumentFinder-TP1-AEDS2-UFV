Gaston  
  
Who does she think she is  
That girl has tangled with the wrong man  
  
Lefou  
  
Darn right  
  
Gaston  
  
No one says no to Gaston  
Dismissed Rejected  
Publicly humiliated  
Why its more than I can bear  
  
Lefou  
  
More beer  
  
Gaston  
  
What for Nothing helps  
Im disgraced  
  
Lefou  
  
Who you Never  
Gaston youve got to pull yourself together  
  
Lefou  
  
Gosh it disturbs me to see you Gaston  
Looking so down in the dumps  
Evry guy hered love to be you Gaston  
Even when taking your lumps  
Theres no man in town as admired as you  
Youre evryones favorite guy  
Evryones awed and inspired by you  
And its not very hard to see why  
  
No ones slick as Gaston  
No ones quick as Gaston  
No ones necks as incredibly thick as Gastons  
For theres no man in town half as manly  
Perfect a pure paragon  
You can ask any Tom dick or Stanley  
And theyll tell you whose team they prefer to be on  
  
Lefou and chorus  
  
No ones been like Gaston  
A king pin like Gaston  
  
Lefou  
  
No ones got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston  
  
Gaston  
  
As a specimen yes Im intimidating  
  
Lefou and chorus  
  
My what a guy that Gaston  
Give five hurrahs Give twelve hiphips  
  
Lefou  
  
Gaston is the best  
And the rest is all drips  
  
Chorus  
  
No one fights like Gaston  
Douses lights like Gaston  
  
Lefou  
  
In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston  
  
Bimbettes  
  
For theres no one as burly and brawny  
  
Gaston  
  
As you see Ive got biceps to spare  
  
Lefou  
  
Not a bit of hims scraggly or scrawny  
  
Gaston  
  
Thats right  
And evry last inch of mes covered with hair  
  
Chorus  
  
No one hits like Gaston  
Matches wits like Gaston  
  
Lefou  
  
In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston  
  
Gaston  
  
Im especially good at expectorating  
Ptoooie  
  
Chorus  
  
Ten points for Gaston  
  
Gaston  
  
When I was a lad  
I ate four dozen eggs  
Evry morning to help me get large  
And now that Im grown  
I eat five dozen eggs  
So Im roughly the size of a barge  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh ahhh wow  
My what a guy that Gaston  
No one shoots like Gaston  
Makes those beauts like Gaston  
  
Lefou  
  
Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston  
  
Gaston  
  
I use antlers in all of my decorating  
  
Chorus  
  
My what a guy Gaston
