I wake up crying after tossin and turnin  
And a yearnin the whole night long  
Pretty baby oh my love since you went away  
Havent spent a happy day  
I wake up crying after sobbin and sighin  
And a wonderin just what went wrong  
Pretty baby well I know I was good to you  
Whyd you go and make me blue  
I need your arms to hold me tight now  
I need your lips to kiss me goodnight  
Im so unhappy on my own  
Dont dont leave me sad and lonely  
Oh now now now well well well now baby  
I tell you I wake up crying after tossin and turnin  
And a yearnin the whole night long  
Pretty baby why dont you please come back to me  
And save me from this misery I want you to save me  
Ah save me baby  
Mhh
