Checkin out your widescreen while your hands up on the headrest

Tryin to come up with a melody that will turn you on  
On the MPC3000 tryin to come up with beats  
Thatll make come on over here and lay down here with me  
Im searchin for that special mind blowin melody  
And its gotta be sexy so Ill think it through carefully

In the Maybach doin what we do  
  
Chorus  
  
Um now I know a few friends of mine that has made love to this record

As I try to catch my breath and proceed
