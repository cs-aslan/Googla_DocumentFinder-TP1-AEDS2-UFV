I need some help  
Help to decide  
Whether its our love  
That steps out of time  
You say you need  
Time on your own  
Time to accept how  
Our love has grown  
And when you think about  
All of the bad in me  
Think about this too  
How me and you could forever be  
  
In need of help  
Help to expand  
With each others minds  
Together to plan  
Time in our lives  
Time on our own  
So one day well see  
Our love has grown  
  
And when that day arrives  
I dont know where well be  
But I hope that trust  
Can be for us  
And youll still love me  
  
I need some help  
Help to be found  
When you are alone  
I wont let you down  
We all need time  
Time on our own  
So we can step back  
And see how loves grown  
  
And when Im stepping back  
I hope that I will see  
That faith can play a part today  
For both you and me  
  
And if love needs help  
And if love needs time  
Give love the strength  
To walk a straight line
