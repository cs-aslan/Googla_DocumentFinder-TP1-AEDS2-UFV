Billy weve come along way together and through it all  
Youve been just like a brother to me  
And Billy weve had our share of ups and downs  
Froze our tails sleeping on the ground  
When the jobs were few and far between  
  
Weve been knocking around together so long  
Singing them same old songs  
Been out in the rain so long I swear were shrinking  
Billy lately I have done some thinking  
  
When I look back on our lives  
Weve sure had ourself a time  
But you know its been a wild world we traveled  
And its startin to unravel  
  
We leave so many loose ends behind  
Weve been bucked off and kicked so many times  
And the ground just keeps gettin harder  
Billy you know well as I we aint gettin no younger  
  
Billy another summers come and gone  
Now with winter coming on  
I know we planned on heading south  
But Billy I thought about it several days  
And these words Im about to say  
  
They dont taste good in my mouth  
But theres someone whos waiting back home  
Lord if shell still have me  
Guess Ill be saying so long you go on without me  
  
Aint no easy way of saying goodbye  
So be sure and tell em all down in Texas I said hi
