In all the time that Ive known you  
Youve been so edgy and nervous  
I never wanted to own you  
I was aware of the danger  
Of making a bid for your favours  
Youre such a natural stranger  
I made excuses and ran  
Youre an island  
But I cant leave you all out at sea  
Youre so violent with your silence  
Youre an island  
I cant sleep  
Wont you speak to me  
Im on dry land  
Wont you help me please  
In all the time that Ive known you  
There has been something between us  
I dont hink its my imagination  
I felt like I couldnt touch you  
But I had the feeling youd love to  
Tell me the truth if you could do  
I made excuses and ran
