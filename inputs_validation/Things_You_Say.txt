Oh baby oh baby yeah yeah yeah  
Such a pleasure loving you  
Its all mine  
  
I feel better knowing you  
Ooh youve got me thinking  
Its better to give and take  
I dont have to beg you too  
Youre so good to me  
Carries me from day to day  
I appreciate the things you do  
Ooh but theres one thing I had to tell you boy  
I dig your actions  
But a lot of things you say  
  
I listen to the things you say  
Who youre calling me oh oh  
I listen to the things you say  
To me baby  
In a poem on a card  
Serenade my heart  
I listen to the things you say  
Who youre calling me oh oh  
I listen to the things you say  
To me baby  
In a card of a song  
Say my name please  
  
Lovely letters come at times I know I dont deserve it  
Any weather youll come through  
Ooh youve got me gleaming  
I feel more than I worth  
Youre my treasure  
Ill take you  
Over anything  
Thats pleasing on this earth  
I appreciate the things you do  
But theres one thing I had to tell you boy  
I dig your actions  
But I love your words  
  
Chorus  
Every word that you say  
Makes a day much brighter  
Melody that you play  
I hear by the way and the love is lighter  
Speak to me  
  
Chorus
