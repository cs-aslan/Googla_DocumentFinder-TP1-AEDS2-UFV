Wholl be the next in line  
Wholl be the next in line for heartache  
Wholl make the same mistakes I made over you  
Wholl be the next in line  
Wholl be the next in line for you  
  
Wholl be the next in line  
Wholl be the next to watch your love fade  
All your affections finally fade away  
There will be no use inside  
Wholl be the next in line for you  
  
One day youll find out when Im gone  
I was the best one you had  
I was the one who gave you love  
  
Wholl be the next in line  
Wholl be the next in line for heartaches  
Who will make the same mistakes I made over you  
Wholl be the next in line  
Wholl be the next in line for you  
  
One day youll find out when Im gone  
I was the best one you had  
I was the one who gave you love  
  
Wholl be the next in line  
Wholl be the next in line for heartaches  
Who will make the same mistakes I made over you  
There will be no use inside  
Who will next in line for you  
  
For you for you for you  
For you for you for you  
For you
