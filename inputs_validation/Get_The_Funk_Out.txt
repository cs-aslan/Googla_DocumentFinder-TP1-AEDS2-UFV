If you dont like what you see here  
Nobody wants to take you prisoner  
So let me make it nice and clear dear  
The exit is right there  
I dont mean to be rude dude  
But youd better change your attitude  
  
I dont like what I see here  
  
Youre all invited to the party  
You know you didnt have to come  
No rotten apple gonna spoil my fun  
  
If you dont like what you see here  
Get the funk out  
We wont try to force feed you  
Get the funk out  
  
You cant please everybody  
But everybody cannot please me  
Thats why I do what I want to  
So why dont you do do it to do it to me hey  
So if you dont like what you see here  
You can always leave the country  
  
I dont like what I see here  
  
Youre all invited to the party  
You know you didnt have to come  
No rotten apple gonna spoil my fun  
  
If you dont like what you see here  
Get the funk out  
We wont try to force feed you  
Get the funk out  
  
All I see is pornograffiti  
All I hear pornograffiti  
Its a monster we all have within us  
The american dream  
I need more money  
I need more money  
Just a little more money  
Just a little more money  
Everybodys got a need  
Everybodys got to feed  
He man woman hater  
He man woman hater  
He man woman hater  
Dancing to the decadence dance
