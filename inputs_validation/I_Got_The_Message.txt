Im picking up on a signal  
Thats in the air tonight  
Its sparkin my receiver  
It feels like dynamite  
I got the message  
But I want to get it straight from you  
  
My mind is electric  
Im about to blow a fuse  
The cockpit is empty  
So shoot it down the tube  
I got the message  
But I want to get it straight from you  
  
Ive got to make a connection  
Im on needles and pins  
Workin up a printout  
And Im gonna zero in  
I got the message  
But I want to get it straight from you
