And they dont come any closer And they dont come  
Anyway  
On the rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the  
Rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the rebound  
On The rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the  
Rebound On the rebound on the rebound on the rebound on  
The Rebound on the rebound  
The chronicle hasnt changed for fifteen years The  
Apathetic outnumber volunteers The grime on buildings is  
Just a memory A shining face on the old academy  
Have a lovely day Aftermath okay Have a lovely day Wipe  
Your tears away  
The gaze of laughter an echo or a scream The  
Reinforcement of someone elses theme Turn and walk  
Without ever saying no Light and dark in an even ratio  
Have a lovely day Aftermath okay Have a lovely day Wipe  
Your tears away  
On the rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the  
Rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the rebound  
On The rebound  
And they dont come any closer And they dont come  
Anyway  
On the rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the  
Rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the rebound  
On The rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the  
Rebound On the rebound on the rebound on the rebound on  
The Rebound on the rebound  
On the rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the  
Rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the rebound  
On The rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the  
Rebound On the rebound on the rebound on the rebound on  
The Rebound on the rebound
