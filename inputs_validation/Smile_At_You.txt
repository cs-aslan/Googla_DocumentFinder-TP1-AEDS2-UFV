Go on save yourself  
Leave the key here  
You love someone else  
I shouldnt be here  
Dont ask me why  
You know the answer  
Shes so willing little one  
There was no chance there  
  
I have come to know  
This world of changing faces  
I cant fight the world  
I cant change it  
So be true to me  
My walls are flamin  
If shes so willing little one  
I wont be staying  
  
Ah ah  
Turned away and ran I shouldve turned away and ran  
Ah ah  
Fast as I can just as fast as I can  
Ah ah  
I shouldve turned away and ran I shouldve turned away and ran  
Ah ah  
Fast as I can just as fast as I can  
  
I am older now  
But I still remember  
I took the greatest fall  
I cant accept her  
So be true to me  
My walls are flamin  
If shes so willing little one  
I wont be staying  
  
Ah ah  
Turned away and ran I shouldve turned away and ran  
Ah ah  
Fast as I can just as fast as I can  
Ah ah  
I shouldve turned away and ran I shouldve turned away and ran  
Ah ah  
Fast as I can just as fast as I can  
  
Ah ah  
Turned away and ran I shouldve turned away and ran  
Ah ah  
Fast as I can just as fast as I can  
Ah ah  
I shouldve turned away and ran I shouldve turned away and ran  
Ah ah  
Fast as I can just as fast as I can  
  
What you did not need  
Was a woman who was stronger  
You needed someone  
To depend on you  
I could not be her  
I did not want to  
My first mistake  
Was to smile at you  
Smile at you  
  
Go on save yourself  
Leave the key here  
You love someone else  
I shouldnt be here  
Dont ask me why  
You know the answer  
If shes so willing little one  
There was no chance there
