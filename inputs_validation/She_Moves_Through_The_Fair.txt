I once had a sweetheart I loved her right well  
I loved her far better than my tongue can tell  
Her parents did slight me for the want of guile  
Adieu to all pleasure since I lost my dear  
  
She went away from me and moved through the fair  
Where handclapping dealers loud shouts rent the air  
The sunlight around her did sparkle and play  
Saying It will not be long love til our wedding day  
  
When dew falls on meadows and moths fill the night  
When glow from the greesach on halffroze halflight  
Ill slip from my casement and Ill run away  
Then it will not be long love til our wedding day  
  
I dreamed last night that my love came in  
She came in so easy her feet made no din  
She came stepping up to me and this she did say  
It will not be long love til our wedding day
