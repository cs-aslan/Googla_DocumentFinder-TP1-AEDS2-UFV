Driving all night too many miles to go  
Pedal tot he metal listenin to the radio  
I got three days to get from Cheyenne to San Antone  
Thats the life of a cowboy ridin the rodeo  
  
My back sides sore and Im movin kinda slow  
But when I hit Okie City theres a barrel racer that I know  
A little home cookin and some lovin to heal my bones  
Thats the life of a cowboy ridin the rodeo  
  
Ride cowboy ride hold on for your life  
Eight seconds is a long long time when youre sitting on dynamite  
You cant make money buddy if get thrown  
Thats the life of a cowboy ridin the rodeo  
  
Well I might get lucky down in San Antone  
Find a little Texas girl I could call my own  
That lone star lovins the best Ive ever known  
Thats the life of a cowboy ridin the rodeo  
  
Ride cowboy ride hold on for your life  
Eight seconds is a long long time when youre sitting on dynamite  
You cant make money buddy if get thrown  
Thats the life of a cowboy ridin the rodeo  
  
Thats the life of a cowboy ridin the rodeo
