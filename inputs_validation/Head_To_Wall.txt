Relax in time  
From the pain youve been  
I dont know anything  
But I can read whats on your face  
Just on moment  
Just one more to struggle  
We all want everything  
But we all cant fit in the door  
Seven tries  
Head to wall  
Hurts your head  
Sort of trust that youll get  
What you paid for soon  
Seven tries  
Head to wall  
Just to get cut  
And its only time  
Its what you make it  
I dont know what it brings  
Hope for the good hope from despair  
A second just on moment  
Just one more to trust  
Some time youll get to see  
You where you want to be  
Seven tries  
Head to wall  
Hurts your head  
Sort of trust that youll get  
What you paid for soon  
Seven tries  
Head to wall  
Just to get cut  
Its what you break down  
Its just a second  
A thrown in towel is the first thing  
Cant tell if its the time  
That your gonna throw  
Push through or youll never get  
To see what you gave up  
Passed on  
Seven tries  
Head to wall  
Hurts your head  
Sort of trust that youll get  
What you paid for soon  
Seven tries  
Head to wall
