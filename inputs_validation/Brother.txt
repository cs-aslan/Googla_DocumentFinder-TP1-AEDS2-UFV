The worlds goin crazy and  
Nobody gives a damn anymore  
And theyre breakin off relationships and  
Leavin on sailin ships for far and distant shores  
For them its all over  
But Im gonna stay  
I wouldnt leave anyway  
I know that someday well find a way  
Well be OK  
  
Cause Im your brother  
Though I dont even know your name  
Ive discovered that  
Deep down inside you feel the same  
Our friends are leavin  
Now they seem so far away  
But we shouldnt feel afraid  
Theres so much that we can say  
Youre my brother  
Though I didnt know you yesterday  
Im your brother  
Together we can find a way  
  
The worlds goin crazy and  
Nobody gives a damn anymore  
And theyre breakin off relationships and  
Leavin on sailin ships for far and distant shores  
The old worlds fadin  
Now it seems so far away  
Well Im not goin anywhere  
Theres so much that we can share  
Im your brother  
  
The worlds goin crazy and  
Nobody gives a damn anymore  
And theyre breakin off relationships and  
Leavin on sailin ships for far and distant shores  
Youre my brother  
Though I didnt know you yesterday  
Im your brother  
Together we can find a way
