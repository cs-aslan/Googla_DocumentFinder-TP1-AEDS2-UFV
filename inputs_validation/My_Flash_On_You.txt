I dont want to be in your company  
I dont need you take care of me  
Let me long let me long let me long wont you let me be  
Cause all I want in this world is to say Im a man as we  
  
People talk about the way i look  
I think that all the things they say have got enough to write a book  
But dont they know dont they know dont they know its a waste of breath  
Cause I dont want to be like them I just want to be myself  
Woke up   
  
Dont try and push your  trust my way  
Cause baby I lose my soul and thats where is gonna stay  
You try to put them down on the ground anywhere that you choose  
Get your kids from your fist cause baby this time you gonna lose  
Woke up
