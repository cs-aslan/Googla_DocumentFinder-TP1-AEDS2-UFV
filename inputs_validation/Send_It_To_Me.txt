Somebody got a magic touch  
Somebody just cant get enough  
Your pictures hanging in my car  
I love you for just who you are  
  
And dont you know I want you maybe  
Baby  
  
Get your motor running  
Cant you hear me coming  
And send it to me  
Put it in a letter  
If thatll make it better  
And send it to me haa  
Stick it in a bottle  
Its always getting hotter  
And send it to me haa  
Nothing gonna stop it  
So shoot it like a rocket  
And send it to me  
  
I sit behind a desk all day  
And dream of you to get away  
I got no money in the bank  
I dont need much got you to thank  
  
And dont you know I want you maybe  
Baby  
  
Oh get your motor running  
Cant you hear me coming  
And send it to me ah  
Put it in a letter  
If thatll make it better  
And send it to me haa  
Stick it in a bottle  
Its always getting hotter  
Send it to me haa  
Nothing gonna stop it  
So shoot it like a rocket  
And send it to me ahh  
  
Deep in the night I turn around  
And wish you were here with me  
I grab the sheets and make up a fantasy  
Cant you see  
That youre the one that I love  
  
Get your motor running  
Cant you hear me coming  
And send it to me ooh oh oh  
Stick it in a bottle  
Aint nothing gonna stop it  
So shoot it like a rocket  
Baby send it to me  
Ahh oh  
Get your motor running  
Cant you hear me coming  
And sent it to me ah ho
