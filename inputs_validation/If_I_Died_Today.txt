If I died today  
Whod turn off my coffee pot  
Would there be a street parade  
Would I just be an afterthought  
  
If I died today  
Would I still be a waiter  
Could I fly around like superman  
Would I make the Sunday paper  
  
Chorus  
I wonder who Id see  
Cryin standin over me  
Who would just send their regards  
Would anybody say that at least hes in a better place  
And who would get this old guitar  
  
If I died today  
Would my mama keep on prayin  
Would my buddies go out drinkin  
Would my alarm clock keep on blinkin  
  
And if I died today  
Would I need to be ashamed  
Would I be easy to forget  
Could I live with my regrets  
  
I wonder who Id see  
Cryin standin over me  
Who would just send their regards  
Would anybody say that the world will never be the same  
And who would get this old guitar  
  
If I died today  
Would I see my room from Heaven  
Would my family talk about me  
Every Christmas and Thanksgivin  
  
I wonder who Id see  
Cryin standin over me  
Who would just send their regards  
Would anybody say that what a good guy what a shame  
And who would get this old guitar  
  
If I died today  
Whod turn off my coffee pot
