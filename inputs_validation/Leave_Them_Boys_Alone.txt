Now they say Hank Jr has strayed away  
From all them songs that put his daddy in an early grave  
But his daddy would be proud if he could see Bocephus now  
Why dont you leave that boy alone let him sing his song  
  
Oh Waylon has been known to play half time  
He been known to get out of his mind  
Dont know whether hes right or wrong  
Hes got a string of hits about two miles long  
Why dont you leave that boy alone let him sing his song  
  
Why dont you leave them boys alone let em sing their song  
You know theyre gonna do whatever they want  
If you dont like the way they sing whos gonna cast the first stone  
Why dont you leave them boys alone let em sing their song  
  
Hank Williams was the king of country soul  
My dad took me to see him in Lubbock but he didnt show  
Now the people got mad and they all went home  
The first thing we did was put his records on  
I guess we should have left him alone and let him sing his songs  
  
Why dont you leave them boys alone let em sing their song  
You know theyre gonna do whatever they want  
If you dont like the way they sing whos gonna cast the first stone  
Why dont you leave them boys alone let em sing their song  
  
Why dont you leave them boys alone let em sing their song
