Way down in the delta  
Where the days move slow  
Theres a squeeze box player  
Name a Little Johnny O  
Hes got a four piece band  
And theyre playin real tight  
Make the people go crazy  
Every Saturday night  
  
Singing Hey Johnny O  
Lets FiedIAy  
On the ol bayou  
Hey Johnny O  
Well play the Tennessee Waltz  
And the Zydeco  
  
They like their Chuck Berry records  
And some Fats Domino  
But the thing they like the most  
Is hearin Little Johnny O  
Playin FiedleIOh  
Little Johnny O  
Playin FiedleIOh  
Thats right Johnny  
  
Well the Natches girls  
They like to stroll around town  
When Johnny starts a playin  
You see em come unwound  
Well the boys in the corner  
All loosin their minds  
Gonna make their move  
When Johnny gives the sigh  
  
Singing Hey Johnny O  
Lets FiedIAy  
On the ol bayou  
Hey Johnny O  
Play the Tennessee Waltz  
And the Zydeco  
  
They like their old country records  
Theyre the mill for the soul  
But the thing they like the most  
Is hearin Little Johnny O  
Playin FiedleIOh  
Little Johnny O  
Playin FiedleIOh  
Play it Hey Johnny  
Thats the ticket  
Lets get down girl  
  
Way down in the delta  
Where the big blue flows  
Theres a one little secret  
That everybody knows  
If you just cant sleep  
And youre feelin down  
Theres an allnight cure  
Outside of town  
  
And its Hey Johnny O  
Lets FiedIAy  
On the ol bayou  
Hey Johhny O  
Play the Tennessee Waltz  
And the Zydeco  
  
They like all those songs  
On the radio  
But the thing they like the most  
Is hearin Little Johnny O  
Playin FiedleIOh  
Little Johnny O  
Playin FiedleIOh  
Little Johnny O
