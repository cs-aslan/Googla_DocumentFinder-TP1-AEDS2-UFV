Shes good  
But not religious good  
Shes kind  
But not all the time  
She says funny things  
We get happy  
  
Shes bad  
But not religious bad  
She smiles  
But not all the time  
She puts funny things in my coffee  
She asks questions like  
How many beans make five  
Shes alright  
  
Sometimes she gets ugly  
Sometimes she looks ill  
Shes here to watch over me  
Her looks tend to kill  
  
Shes blind  
But not religious blind  
Shes wild  
But not all the time  
She drinks funny things  
We get touchy  
She screams and shouts a bit  
But she leaves me out of it  
Shes alright  
  
Sometimes she gets giggly  
She wont then she will  
Sometimes she gets giggly  
Sometimes she lies still  
  
Sometimes she breaks glasses  
Sometimes she breaks hearts  
Sometimes she gets messy  
Sometimes she gets smart  
Shes funny peculiar  
And funny Ha  Ha  
  
Shes good  
But not religious good  
Shes kind  
But not all the Timmy  
She says funny things  
Shes alright  
  
Shes bad  
But not religious bad  
She smiles  
But not all the time  
She does funny things  
Shes alright  
  
Shes blind  
But not religious blind  
Shes wild  
But not all the time  
She drinks funny things  
Shes alright
