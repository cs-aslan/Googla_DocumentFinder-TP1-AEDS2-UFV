Weve got two kinds here  
Those that bleed the blood  
And those that work to will it  
Cant believe the big screen  
Theres no justice in the hall  
Were all criminals waiting to be called  
  
Weve got shackles to keep the laws  
Made by men who bought and sold themselves with not a prayer to keep their
powers at bay  
They want us kinder and gentler at their feet  
  
They say dont step off the sidewalk  
And dont cross over the line  
But well serve time at night  
When the light begins to dim  
When the smoke seems to clear  
You can say what you want  
Were all criminals here  
  
How many times will the teeth bite the tongue looking for salvage in the
damage thats done  
I searched for you every place I thought I knew still were criminals looking
for something to do
