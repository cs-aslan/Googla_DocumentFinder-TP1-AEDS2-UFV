Ive got my mind on my man  
Ive got my man on my mind  
Hes everything to me hes somthin more special  
Than any amount of lookins gonna find  
  
Im not hooked on any her from an idle dream  
But Im idly dreaming of him  
Hes a lotus that opens and closes  
Notice he wont always let me in  
So my mind is on my man got my man on my mind  
  
Sometimes hes sleepy  
And I dont think he loves me  
I worry about his lovin  
Aint I crazy  
  
Hes a Northern baby and a Southern child  
Hes a gentleman lost at the fair  
Hes a cowboy gettin drunk at the Plaza  
He has a place in my heart anywhere  
And my mind is on my man got my man on my mind
