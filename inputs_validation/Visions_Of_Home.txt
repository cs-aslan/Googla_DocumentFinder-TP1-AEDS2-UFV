Visions of home the streets that I roamed its been a while  
Raised me like the father I aint never had Im still your child  
And though Ive grown in ways that you never known  
I ventured into the world I moved out all on my own  
Im doing this all for you I hate to leave you alone  
See shit you wouldnt believe I write em down in these poems  
And put em out for the world I know you listening too  
Heard you saying shit about me I hope the shit isnt true  
Man look at this shit I came from this narrow point of view  
How you hating on a nigga that wanted it more than you  
I ran through them spots with you and fcked the same bitches too  
And just because I rocked with you I scrapped with them niggas too  
Came back for them niggas too aint no trappin nigga its true  
Yet they play me on repeat cause I rap for them niggas too  
They see I started with nothing but passion and then I blew  
To the Roc damn the tops a spectacular fucking view  
  
Visions of home Visions of home  
Visions of home Visions of home Yeah  
Visions of home this is my zone  
This is my joy this is my pain this is my song  
  
This is for my cousin Ricky damn niggas its been too long  
Hate that my nigga Smitty slangin but to each his own  
Gotta feed yoself smoke a little weed just to ease yoself  
Fuck the whole world I dont need your help  
Youre the reason why momma had those rocks  
All my niggas never even had no pops  
Memba that you remember that  
If you dont double back  
Momma found a much better crib on a safe street  
But Im still where the trouble at  
Where the trouble at  
Thats cause my flows there  
What it look like if I dont go there  
Im dead wrong its been way too long long  
My folks there what it look like if I dont go there  
Im dead wrong its been way too long  
  
Visions of home visions of home  
Visions of home nigga visions of home  
Im coming home coming home  
Yeah Cole World  
You know what it is
