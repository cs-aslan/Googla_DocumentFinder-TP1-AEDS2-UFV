I should have known  
You were a strange one  
You should have said  
That you dont like to love  
But you never told me no lies  
Dont have to apologies  
When everythings said and done  
I was the strange one  
  
I should have known  
You were a strange one  
You should have said  
I dont want to love  
But I never told you no lies  
I dont want to apologies  
When everythings said and done  
What can I do   
That boys in love with you  
  
I should have seen it coming  
I should have known what to expect  
I could be off and running  
Looking for my respect  
You dont need to criticize  
You never did realize  
When everythings said and done  
You were a strange one  
  
You were a strange one  
You were a strange one  
You were a strange one
