Verse 1  
It aint even cold outside not where Im from  
Feeling like its midJuly under the sun  
My jacket dont get no love no hats and no gloves not even a chance to rain  
But my babys in town and were gonna do some winter things  
  
Chorus  
Ayo I wanna pretend were at the North Pole  
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday  
Made just for me and my baby ooh ooh  
My babys in town and were gonna do some winter things hey  
  
Verse 2  
Take me to the iceskating rink downtown No no no downtown  
Even though its 100 degrees gotta get out  
Aint no ice or no chills no snowmen to build most of our friends at the
beach  
But my babys in town and were gonna do some winter things  
  
Chorus  
Ayo I wanna pretend were at the North Pole  
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday  
Made just for me and my baby ooh ooh  
My babys in town and were gonna do some winter things hey  
  
Bridge  
Just imagine that were laughing  
In the cabin chilling by the fireside  
Even though this sun is blasting  
We can be wherever if we visualize  
  
Chorus  
Ayo I wanna pretend were at the North Pole  
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday  
Made just for me and my baby ooh ooh  
My babys in town and were gonna do some winter things hey
