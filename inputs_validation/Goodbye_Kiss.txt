Doomed from the start  
We met with a goodbye kiss I broke my wrist  
It all kicked off I had no choice  
You said that you didnt mind cause loves hard to find  
Maybe the days we had are gone living in silence for too long  
Open your eyes and what do you see  
No more laughs no more photographs  
  
Turning slowly looking back see  
No words can save this youre broken and Im pissed  
Run along like Im supposed to be the man I ought to  
Rock and roll sent us insane I hope someday that we will meet again  
Running wild  
Giving it everyone now thats all done  
  
Cause we burnt out thats what you do  
When you have everything it cant be true  
Maybe the days we had are gone living in silence for too long  
Open youre eyes and what do you see  
The last stand let go of my hand  
  
Turning slowly looking back see  
No words can save this youre broken and Im pissed  
Run along like Im supposed to be the man I ought to  
Rock and roll sent us insane I hope someday that we will meet again  
You go your way and Ill go my way  
No words can save us this lifestyle made us  
Run along like Im supposed to be the man I ought to  
Rock and roll sent us insane I hope someday that we will meet again
