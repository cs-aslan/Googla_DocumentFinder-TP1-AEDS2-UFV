Its a crazy life a hazy life  
A mixed up jumbled phasy life  
A crazy life for people who want to smile  
I just dont understand  
Why so hard to say hello before goodbye  
  
Its a coocoo life a lulu life  
A moody magic voodoo life  
A coocoo life for people who want to love  
I just dont understand why so green  
That its been hang ups day to day  
I gotta pack up get away  
  
Cause its a crazy life  
Yes its a crazy life  
Crazy life  
  
Its a stupid life elusive life  
A lonely stuck secluded life  
A stupid life for people who want to fly too high  
I just dont understand why so blue  
What to do  
Im gonna kiss my sky goodbye  
Im gonna jump way down and die  
  
Cause its a crazy life  
Yes its a crazy life  
Crazy life
