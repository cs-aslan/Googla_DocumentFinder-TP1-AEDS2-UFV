If I could stick my hand in my heart  
Spill it all over the stage  
Would it satisfy you  
Would it slide on by you  
Would you think the boy is strange  
Aint it straaange  
  
If I could win  
If I could sing  
A love song so divine  
Would it be enough for your cheating heart  
If I broke down and cried  
If I criiied  
I said Ah no Its only rock n roll  
But I like it  
Ah no its only rock n roll  
But I like it like it  
Yes I do  
I really really really really do dodo do do  
Hey  
  
Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields  
Sold in a market down in New Orleans  
Scarred old slaver knows hes doin all right  
Hear they whip the women just around midnight  
  
Brown sugar  
How come you taste so good  
Brown sugar  
Just like a young girl should  
  
I saw her today at the reception  
A glass of wine in her hand  
I knew she would make her connection  
By her feet was a footloose man  
  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes  
You might find  
You get what you need  
  
You need honkey tonk women  
Gimme gimme gimme the honkey tonk blues  
  
Under my thumb  
The girl who once had me down  
Under my thumb  
The girl who once pushed me around  
Its down to me  
Yes it is  
The way she talks when shes spoken to  
Down to me  
The change has come  
Shes under my thumb
