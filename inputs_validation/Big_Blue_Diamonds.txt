Blue diamonds big blue diamonds on her finger  
Instead of a little band of gold  
Big diamonds big blue diamonds tell the story  
Of the love that no one man could hold  
  
Oh she wanted more than I had money to buy  
So she left me sad and lonely I am told  
Big diamonds big blue diamonds  
Now shell trade them  
For a love behind a little band of gold  
  
Blue diamonds big blue diamonds how they sparkle  
But what can they do to warm your heart and soul  
When youre lonesome in the moonlight and you want loving  
Big blue diamonds dont they seem so reckless and bold  
  
I gladly do my part oh to mend a broken heart  
But a love thats warmed over soon grows cold  
Big diamonds big blue diamonds  
I dont want them no  
Oh for a love behind a little band of gold
