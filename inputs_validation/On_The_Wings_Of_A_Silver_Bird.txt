I know that Ive stayed away for too long  
Ive missed the sweet love you give me  
No other woman could warm me inside  
I need you much more  
Than I realized  
On the wings of a silverbird  
Im flying home to you  
On the wings of a silverbird  
Ill soon be holding you  
So wipe all those tears away  
Im coming home to stay  
Get ready my love  
Just look up above  
For the wings of a silverbird  
You send me letters to help time go by  
I call your name while Im dreaming  
I need to feel you I long for your touch  
I wanna tell you  
I love you so much  
On the wings   
Ill keep your picture  
To kiss and say good night  
But I wanna hold you forever  
So wipe all those tears away  
Im coming home to stay  
Get ready my love  
Just look up above  
For the wings of a silverbird  
So wipe all those tears away  
Im coming home to stay  
Get ready my love  
Just look up above  
For the wings of a silverbird
