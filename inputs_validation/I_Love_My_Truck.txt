Well itll just get you down  
If you let life get to you  
Cause everybodys saying something  
None of its true  
  
Well I just dont care  
When them times get hard  
Cause I got everything I need  
Right out in my yard  
  
Chorus  
I love my truck  
Shes right outside  
I aint got much love  
But I sure got a ride  
It dont matter who lived  
It dont matter who lied  
I got my truck right by my side  
  
You got Sally and you got Sue  
And I got a Chevrolet  
She takes me home after work  
Dont ever miss a day  
  
She dont care what I am  
She dont care what I aint  
But she aint no cheap pickup  
She just needs a couple coats of paint  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Yeah  
  
She dont care  
If I dont work a lick  
Shell start every time  
If the choke dont stick  
  
I know that she will  
Never doubt me  
Cause she never leaves home  
Without me  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I got my truck right by my side yeah  
I got my truck right by my side
