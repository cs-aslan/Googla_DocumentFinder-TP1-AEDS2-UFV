Bizzy Bone  
Let it go let it go Let yourself go  
I was passin til the cops come  
Big beef I was passin til the cops come  
Ready ready ready ready ready  
Big beefin with the mistress  
For the backs of the lions as we growl mutherfucker  
We all livin in the last motherfuckin day this is revalations  
If it dont go down now that mean nobody was wrong  
And you face yourself with that question for the answer  
The fuck do you believe in  
  
Lets take a pie to the badguy  
Zero well where my cateye dadeye  
My flavour frame the raddle  
Hot out hot out of problem  
My album hit the shelves we hustle for record sales  
If my niggas stole hear my niggas thirty thousand tales  
Get me squad cars excetera Excetera tell me my position as we yell Yell  
This isnt bullshit like pimples in the public  
Made gratafying  
If you dont like my bullets set hell ta pink faction  
L A Lugers start your mad punk  
They really got a smash on  
And they would probly blast you  
  
Puff Daddy  
Im married to the game and every years the same  
Bullets rain all season  
Heaven and Hell is only what you believe in  
Empty the shells and niggas give you the reason  
Everyone ones the type ta be stuckin duckin and weavin  
Probly breathin  
My stories no fairy tail rich niggas aint neva sell Ha ha ha  
From my buck to the world  
Gave my Glock to my girl  
Dont mix the kids with the Benz  
Baby it ends if she sells Come on woofin  
  
Chorus  
  
Bizzy Bone  
Ohh playa ohh nigga  
Gotta lot of shells to lock you down x4  
  
Puff Daddy  
Lookin theys bullets hit guerillas  
Expressions can mean a lot to my stressin and progressin  
You guessin I seen a lot  
The papers got it stressin and impressin  
We spin a lot  
Confessions get us blessins from the Lord  
We sin a lot  
Wonderin Will he let me in or not  
Is still tryin ta find a reason why  
Because Im a bad boy  
They wanna label me a bad guy  
Who am I  
  
Bizzy Bone  
Its P Diddy muthafucka  
  
Puff Daddy  
Do or die  
  
Bizzy Bone  
Dont give a fuck motherfucker  
  
Two strikes no chicken types  
Its the type he bucks ammunition  
Pistol shots buck bucks ammunition baby  
Hes got the flavour the kind that got me still down  
Run around me watch the hill down  
So buck the best Im hear now  
Yes best neva gone  
Fresh out the foster home  
If I had a just talked to the psychiatrist  
Tell him my head is just blow with a sciness  
Cant you come ride with me Come ride with me  
Bubbye me with a gun  
Slide the weed and rum  
Come get high wit me  
You dont talk weed wit me Bizzy Bone  
You dont leave me anymore  
Leave me bitch shit Ive slept on the floor Ha ha ha  
Who dat left before Blackout tears the stackhouse  
Criminals detention arent they always bad  
When Im thinkin dem Come on doctor  
  
Chorus x4  
  
Incetiest hiddyest grittiest shittiest  
In the club smack the prettiest in a mini  
Grittiest beef in with the mistress  
Diddy the city I pitty with little kids picking up pennys  
And niggas I thought I brought up with selling book for a living  
Making minimum wage like confetti its gotta be a mistake  
Yall oughta dont tell us and its just those seven elements  
Dont tell us its those seven elements  
Dippin on in our lips for money and it dont land upon that  
We ready like 45 scripture Yea  
Make money like that nigga you know what Im sayin  
  
Puff Daddy  
See what you niggas do to me I do to you  
And if Im who you came to see then do what you gotta do  
We can do it anywhere right here right there  
And if you sleep turn your dream to a nightmare  
Niggas gon creep  
No sleep til the heat  
They lookin at me funny fuck a hoe get this money Ha ha ha  
It time for the misfits niggas bring ya clips  
Boys on my mind  
Packin bullets from the mines my brothas  
  
Chorus x7
