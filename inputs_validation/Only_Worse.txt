I just dropped in cause I could use a friend  
And a little bit of consolation  
Im hanging by a thread from the southern end of my rope  
If you really want to know Ill do my best to explain my situation  
Maybe I can find the words  
If the tears dont get me first  
  
Chorus  
Its kinda like fallin from the sky  
When youre up a mile high  
And your parachute wont open  
Kinda like clingin to the bottom of the bottom  
When the bottom drops out  
The only way I know to say how bad her leaving hurts  
Its kinda like a heartache only worse  
  
It wasnt my first brush with love  
But this one was the deepest  
Yeah Ive been blue but this time its closer to black  
Swore Id never get hurt again  
But here I am in pieces  
When this was broke my heart that was just the start  
  
Chorus  
  
Its kinda like being cut open  
Kinda like being burned at the stake  
Kinda like drownin in the ocean knowin  
Knowin theres no help on the way  
  
Chorus  
  
Only worse
