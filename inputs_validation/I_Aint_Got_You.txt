For all night Dwight  
  
Got a 56 Cadillac  
With a spare tire on the back  
Got a charge account in my ol bank  
Said I aint got you  
  
Got a classic and a pool  
And a big hair ghoul  
No matter who I fool  
Said I aint got you  
  
Chorus  
Got a baby and a liquor store  
I played the number fourfortyfour  
Got a mojo and dont cha know  
Im all dressed up with no place to go  
Got women to the left of me  
Got women to the right of me  
I got chicks all around me  
Said I aint got you  
  
Chorus  
  
Mr Whitford  
You know I aint got you baby
