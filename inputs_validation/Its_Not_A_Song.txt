Day turns to night and I turn into bed  
Cant get to sleep somethings in my head  
Pacing the floor I try to force a rhyme  
Why do I fear this time  
  
Chorus  
Its not a song till it touches your heart  
Its not a song till it tears you apart  
After whats left of whats right and whats wrong  
Till it gets through to you  
Its not a song  
  
Now close your eyes look into your hand  
What do you see  
Life is our song to give and learn to take  
Time will not wait  
  
Oh wont you please come dance  
While the songs still playing  
Wont be long till the silence falls  
  
Chorus x4
