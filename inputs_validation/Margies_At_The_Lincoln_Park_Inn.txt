My names in the paper where I took the Boy Scouts to hike  
My hands are all dirty from working on my little boys bike  
The preacher came by and I talked for a minute with him  
My wifes in the kitchen and Margies at the Lincoln Park Inn  
  
And I know why shes there cause Ive been there before  
But I made a promise that I wouldnt cheat anymore  
  
I tried to ignore it but I know shes in there my friend  
My minds on a number and Margies at the Lincoln Park Inn  
  
Next Sunday its my turn to speak to the young peoples class  
They expect answers to all of the questions they ask  
What would they say if I spoke on a modern day sin  
And all of the Margies at all of the Lincoln Park Inns  
  
The bike is all fixed and my little boy is in bed asleep  
His little ol puppy is curled in a ball at my feet  
My wifes baking cookies to feed to the bridge club again  
Im almost out of cigarettes and Margies at the Lincoln Park Inn  
  
And I know why shes there
