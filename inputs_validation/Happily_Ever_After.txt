Happily ever after  
Look at me right where i want to be  
My life took a turn its a happy affair  
Im never alone even when hes not there  
Happily ever after happily ever after  
  
Happily ever after  
So carefree look whats come over me  
All my prayers have been answered he heard my cry  
Took all my troubles and threw them aside  
Threw them aside  
Happily ever after happily ever after  
  
Once in a lifetime  
I never thought i could be  
So carefree so carefree  
Happily ever after  
  
Happily ever after  
Him and me sunshine and laughter  
Were never alone when theres nobody there  
Were never alone we got love to share  
Lots of love happily ever after  
Lost of love happily ever after  
Weve got love happily ever after  
  
Lots of love happily ever after  
Just look at me right where i want to be  
  
Happily ever after
