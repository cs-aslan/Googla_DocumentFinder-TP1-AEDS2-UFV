Hindsight dont make it right  
She give me trouble enough  
And shes a ball of light  
Im in the tunnel of love  
With the American dream  
And I was born too soon  
A little good luck never stuck  
She got me climbing the walls  
Got me hard as a rock  
Within a city of sin she got a city block  
And she was barkin at the moon  
  
She likes to show  
So many sides to her  
And Id be the one to know  
  
Chorus  
When am I gonna go to your dimension  
When am I gonna go to where you are  
When am I gonna go to your dimension  
Dimensions of each other keep us goin strong  
  
Black knight take a bite  
She can double it up  
And shes a way of life  
And whether dead or alive  
She got a fix on me  
And I was dancin in the fire  
White steam never seen  
In every muscle and bone  
She was a love machine  
And she could wrestle me down  
And get a taste of me  
In her web of desire  
  
She changed my world  
How can the body know  
Its touchin me or her  
  
Chorus
