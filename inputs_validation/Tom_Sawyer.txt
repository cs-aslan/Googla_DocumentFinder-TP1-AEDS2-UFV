A modern day warrior  
Mean mean stride  
Todays Tom Sawyer  
Mean mean pride  
  
Though his mind is not for rent  
Dont put him down as arrogant  
His reserve a quiet defense  
Riding out the days events  
The river  
  
What you say about his company  
Is what you say about society  
Catch the mist catch the myth  
Catch the mystery catch the drift  
  
The world is the world is  
Love and life are deep  
Maybe as his skies are wide  
  
Todays Tom Sawyer  
He gets high on you  
And the space he invades  
He gets by on you  
  
No his mind is not for rent  
To any God or government  
Always hopeful yet discontent  
He knows changes arent permanent  
But change is  
  
What you say about his company  
Is what you say about society  
Catch the witness catch the wit  
Catch the spirit catch the spit  
  
The world is the world is  
Love and life are deep  
Maybe as his eyes are wide  
  
Exit the warrior  
Todays Tom Sawyer  
He gets by on you  
And the energy you trade  
He gets right on to the friction of the day
