Come all you merry makers  
You wine drinkers and heart breakers  
Pass me the bottle one more round  
Come all of you love makers  
All you cheaters and lie makers  
Fill me with happiness and bring on the clowns  
  
Theres a place around the corner and I cant wait to go  
I cant stay away from there when Im feeling low  
Running from my problems cheating on my wife  
Acting like a hobo running out on life  
Laughin loud telling jokes drinking to much wine  
Gathered round the table were all one of a kind  
  
Some come all you merry makers  
You wine drinkers and heart breakers  
Pass me the bottle one more round  
Come all of you love makers  
All you cheaters and lie makers  
Fill me with happiness and bring on the clowns  
  
I thought that I was happy till I saw you walkin in  
And through the loud and noisy crowd you reach out your hand  
I know I shouldnt be here I really dont belong  
Im proud that you still love me and you wanna take me home  
  
Goodbye you merry makers  
You wine drinkers and heart breakers  
Ill be gone when the bottle passes round  
Goodbye you love makers  
All you cheaters and lie makers  
Youll never miss me when you bring on the clowns  
  
Cause Ill be with my baby when you bring on the clowns
