Dont wanna know why you like me I dont care  
Dont wanna know why I walk by and you stare  
Dont wanna know why just to wanna know why  
Dont wanna know why just to wanna know why  
  
When I breathe in breathe out  
Carry on carry out  
Try to drive through your life  
Breathe in breathe out  
Carry on carry out  
Try to never say goodbye  
  
Dont wanna know how youre feeling I dont care  
Dont wanna know when youll meet me Im not there  
Dont wanna know why just to wanna know why  
Dont wanna know why just to wanna know why  
  
When I breathe in breathe out  
Carry on carry out  
Try to drive through your life  
Breathe in breathe out  
Carry on carry out  
Try to never say goodbye  
  
I wish I knew  
How to tell you  
How to tell me why
