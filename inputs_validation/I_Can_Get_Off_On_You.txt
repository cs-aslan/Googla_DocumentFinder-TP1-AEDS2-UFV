Take back the weed take back the cocaine baby  
Take back the pills take back the whiskey too  
I dont need them now your love was all I was after  
Ill make it now I can get off on you  
I can get by on little or nothing at all I know  
I can get high just thinkin about you and so  
Well take back the weed  
  
Who would have thought this was somethin that Id ever do  
Im working it out mellowing out on you  
Take back the weed  
Take back the weed
