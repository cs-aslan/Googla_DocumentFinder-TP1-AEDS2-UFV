Left New York this morning early  
Traveling south so wide and high  
Sailing through the wide blue yonder  
Its that air mail special on the fly  
  
Listen to the motors humming  
She is streaking through the sky  
Like a bird thats flying homeward  
Its that air mail special on the fly  
  
Over plains and high dark mountains  
Over rivers deep and wide  
Carrying mail to California  
Its that air mail special on the fly  
  
Watch her circle for the landing  
Hear her moan and cough and sigh  
Now shes coming down the runway  
Its that air mail special on the fly
