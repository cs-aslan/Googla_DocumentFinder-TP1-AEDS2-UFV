I found variety  
On Nolans Avenue  
Down where the air is thick  
As LA skies are blue  
The water tried to break it down  
But it held through  
It gave a little for the sake of staying true  
  
We cut ties  
We tell lies  
We hate change  
And we wanna claim where we feel  
We take toes  
We rake yours  
Yeah we dig holes  
And were diggin right in your fears  
  
Were waking up  
Were waking up  
And right on time  
And right on time  
Well take these roads  
Well break them up  
And right on time  
And right on time  
  
We got cars  
We write laws  
We wont pause  
Dont you know were wizards working in Oz  
We dont lose  
We might bruise  
Yeah but well rain fire on ya till youre playing  
All of your cards  
  
Were waking up  
Were waking up  
And right on time  
And right on time  
Well take these roads  
Well break them up  
And right on time  
And right on time  
On time  
Right on time  
Waking up  
Waking up  
Yeah  
  
Ooh  
Oh  
Ooh
