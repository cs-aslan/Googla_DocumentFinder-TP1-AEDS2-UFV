You touched me you took me away  
You left me confused when you said you couldnt stay  
But now I know what you were trying to say  
I can understand that Im not the only one  
But I believe our time is gonna come  
  
I dream of you through every night  
But youre not risin with me so I dont wanna see the light  
Even if you cant come over and I hoping that you might  
cause when youre not here nothings any fun  
But I believe our time is gonna come  
  
I believe our time is gonna come  
I believe our time is gonna come  
I believe our time is gonna  
I believe our time is gonna come
