I was right  
I was right  
Oh the sun the sun  
The sun is rising from the field  
  
Ive got a feeling  
I just cant shake  
Ive got a feeling  
That just wont go away  
  
Youve got to just  
Keep on pushing  
Keep on pushing  
Push the sky away  
  
And if your friends think  
That you should do it different  
And if they think  
That you should do it the same  
  
Youve got to just  
Keep on pushing  
Keep on pushing  
Push the sky away  
  
And if youre feeling  
Youve got everything you came for  
If you got everything  
And you dont want no more  
  
Youve got to just  
Keep on pushing  
Keep on pushing  
Push the sky away  
  
And some people  
Say its just rockn roll  
Oh but it gets you  
Right down to your soul
