I can taste salt water  
And if I blink again  
Youll be sinking in  
So well learn to swim in the oceans you made  
Ill hold ya and youll think of him  
And pretty soon youll be floating away  
And Ill hold on to the words you spoke of  
Anchored down in the throat love  
And Im captain of this sinking boat now  
With just one armband to carry me home  
  
When salted tears wont dry  
Ill wipe my shirtsleeve  
Under your eyes  
These hearts will be flooded tonight  
Ill wipe my shirtsleeve  
Under your eyes  
Your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes  
  
I still taste salt water  
On my lips from your kiss bitterness  
And Ill drown within the oceans you made  
And I hate to love you these cuffs are covered in your make up  
Ill never trust you again  
You can just be a friend  
And Ill hold on to the words you spoke of  
Anchored down in the throat love  
And Im captain of this sinking boat now  
With just one armband to carry me home  
When salted tears wont dry  
Ill wipe my shirtsleeve  
Under your eyes  
These hearts will be flooded tonight  
Ill wipe my shirtsleeve  
Under your eyes  
Your eyes your lips your mouth  
Your thighs your back you drive me wild  
Tonight the fact is I  
Im on my way home  
Im on my way home  
I lied I tried to cry but Im Im drowning in the oceans you made  
  
When salted tears wont dry  
Ill wipe my shirtsleeves  
Under your eyes  
These hearts will be flooded tonight  
Ill wipe my shirtsleeves  
Under your eyes  
Your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes
