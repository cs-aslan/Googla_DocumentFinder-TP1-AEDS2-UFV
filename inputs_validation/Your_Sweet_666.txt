There are things you should know  
The distance between us seems to grow  
But youre holding on strong  
Oh how hard is it to let go  
Oh so hard to let go  
  
Im waiting for your call  
And Im ready to take your 666 in my heart  
Im longing for your touch  
And I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart  
  
Im losing my faith in you  
You dont want it to be true  
But theres nothing you can do  
Theres nothing you can do  
Yes I lost my faith in you  
  
Im waiting for your call  
And Im ready to take your 666 in my heart  
Im longing for your touch  
And I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart  
  
How long we have to wait  
For love is fading so slowly  
I know its too late  
Oh my God youre so lonely  
  
2x  
Im waiting for your call  
And Im ready to take your 666 in my heart  
Im longing for your touch  
And I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart  
  
In my heart  
In my heart  
In my heart
