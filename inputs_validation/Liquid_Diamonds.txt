Surrender then start your engines  
Youll know quite soon what my mistake was  
For those on horseback or dog sled  
You turn on at the bend in the road  
I hear she still grants forgiveness  
Although I willingly forgot her  
The offering is molasses and you say  
I guess Im an underwater thing  
So I guess I cant take it personally  
I guess Im an underwater thing  
Im liquid running  
  
Theres a sea secret in me  
Its plain to see it is rising  
But I must be flowing liquid diamonds  
Calling for my soul at the corners of the world  
I know shes playing poker with the rest of the stragglers  
Calling for my soul at the corners of the world  
I know shes playing poker with the rest the rest  
And if your friends dont come back to you  
And you know this is madness  
A lilac mess in your prom dress  
And you say  
  
I guess Im an underwater thing  
  
I go I go inside her shell  
I see it so and youre doing oh so well these days  
You do it again and I say its coming back again  
Something like the saturdays such was it  
Can you bring me those jeans  
Keep it back daddys done preaching in to himself  
Keep it just between us  
Its liquid  
Liquid  
Liquid
