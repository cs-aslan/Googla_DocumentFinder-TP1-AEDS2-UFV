Know these blues are gonna rub me raw  
Every single cure seems to be against the law  
  
Went and told my psychic  
I said Keep it to yourself  
I dont wanna hear it and dont be telling no one else  
  
Words out on the street  
Whispers in the night  
They come out of the woodwork wanna see what its like  
  
Pickle ickle ickle  
Gonna run that voodoo down  
How the crowd gets fickle when your face is to the ground  
  
Oh no these blues are gonna rub me raw  
Oh no these blues are gonna rub me raw  
  
Now Im shaking all over  
Im a shattering mass  
But Im gonna sit up straight  
Im going to take it with class  
  
Old man used to tell me  
Son never look back  
Move on to the next case  
Fold your clothes and pack  
  
To the green horned chicken hoppers I say  
Get yourself a trade  
Or go hack to the chat room and fade in the shade  
  
Oh no these blues are gonna rub me raw  
Oh no these blues are gonna rub me raw  
  
I know these blues are gonna rub me raw  
Every single cure seems to be against the law  
  
I was walking pretty well then I fell into a hole  
I should climb out quick but I hate doing what Im told  
  
Got a wang dang doodle wrapped in bog snake hide  
This goat head gumbo is keeping me alive  
  
I dont want your pity or your fifty dollar words  
I dont share your need to discuss the absurd  
  
Oh no these blues are gonna rub me raw  
Oh no these blues are gonna rub me raw
