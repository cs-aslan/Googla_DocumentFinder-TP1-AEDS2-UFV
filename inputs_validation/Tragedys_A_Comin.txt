Tragedys A Comin  
And I cannot step aside  
No I cannot step aside  
Theres no place to run and hide  
Tragedys A Comin  
And I cannot step aside  
No I cannot step aside  
Damn my bastard pride  
  
From the middle of nowhere  
He rides it all alone  
From the edges of somewhere  
Hes grindin flesh and bone  
From the fringes of darkness  
He breathes a steady hand  
And the tinges of poison  
Come seeping from his glands  
  
Tragedys A Comin  
And I cannot step aside  
No I cannot step aside  
Theres no place to run and hide  
Tragedys A Comin  
And I cannot step aside  
No I cannot step aside  
Damn my bastard pride  
  
If you ask him nicely  
Perhaps hell go away  
Just move politely  
And beg him not to stay  
With a mouth full of garbage  
He spits into your eye  
And an ear full of pity  
Hell teach you how to die  
  
Tragedys A Comin  
And I cannot step aside  
No I cannot step aside  
Theres no place to run and hide  
Tragedys A Comin  
And I cannot step aside  
No I cannot step aside  
Goddamn my bastard pride  
  
She stands before us  
With a Bible in her grasp  
When she opens her mouth up  
You can hear the wretched rasp  
Like a bucket of barnacles  
Shes abrasive to the skin  
Like the ignorant masses  
That hope someday shell win  
  
Tragedys A Comin  
And I cannot step aside  
No I cannot step aside  
Theres no place to run and hide  
Tragedys A Comin  
And I cannot step aside  
No I cannot step aside  
Damn my bastard pride  
  
Tragedys poundin  
Hard against your door  
And the cancers eating  
At your inner core  
And youre feeling helpless  
Cant control the game  
Do you fade away softly  
Or go out in a ball of flames cause  
  
Tragedys A Comin  
And I cannot step aside  
No I cannot step aside  
Theres no place to run and hide  
Tragedys A Comin  
And I cannot step aside  
No I cannot step aside  
Damn this bastard pride
