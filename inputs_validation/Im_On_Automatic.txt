This is metal rhythm  
A new song on the Radio  
Some new face  
A picture on your wall  
Talk to me  
You say its nothing personal  
But somethings wrong  
Its eating me alive  
I cant fine the reason  
So I cant find the cure  
They say nothingss wrong forever  
But that somethings wrong with me  
Oh Ive been down so far  
Ive never hurt like this  
Im On Automatic  
Ive heard it all before  
Some new flavour  
With nothing in the hear  
This isnt music  
This is survival  
But Im still here  
Now isnt that strange  
I cant find the reason  
So I cant find the cure  
They say nothings wrong forever  
But that somethings wrong with me  
Oh Ive been down so far  
Ive never hurt like this  
They say nothings wrong forever  
But that somethings wrong with me  
Oh Ive been down so far  
Nothings ever hurt like this
