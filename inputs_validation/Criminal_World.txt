You never told me of your other faces  
You were the widow of a wild cat  
And now I know about your special kisses  
And I know you know where thats at  
I guess I recognize your destination  
I think I see beneath your makeup  
What you want is so separation  
This is no ordinary  
This is no ordinary  
  
Oh oh oh  
What a criminal world  
The boys are like babyfaced girls  
What a criminal girl  
Shell show you where to shoot your gun  
What a typical mothers son  
The only thing that she enjoys  
Is a criminal world  
Where the girls are like babyfaced boys  
  
Youve got a very heavy reputation  
But noone knows about your lowlife  
I know a way to find a situation  
And hold a candle to your highlife disguise  
You caught me kneeling at your sisters door  
That was no ordinary stickup  
Im well aware just what youre looking for  
I am no ordinary  
I am no ordinary  
  
Oh oh oh  
What a criminal world  
The boys are like babyfaced boys  
What a criminal girl  
Shell show you where to shoot your gun  
What a typical mothers son  
The only thing that she enjoys  
Is a criminal world  
Where the girls are like babyfaced boys  
Babyfaced boys  
Babyface  
What a criminal world  
What a criminal  
Criminal  
What a criminal world  
What a criminal  
Criminal
