Feeling like were ready to kick tonight  
No hesitating my bodies aching  
Looking for some action satisfaction all right  
Charging vein faced as active as onehundred solid proof  
Megaton Leviathan were ready to hit the roof  
  
You better watch out and hold on tight  
Were heading your way like dynamite  
Uh Delivering the goods  
Uh Delivering the goods  
  
Shake down rock em boys crack that whip strap mean  
Pulse rate air waves battle lies in every place weve been  
Stealing your hearts all across the land  
Hot blood doing good were going to load you with our brand  
  
You better watch out and hold on tight  
Were heading your way like dynamite  
Uh Delivering the goods  
Yeah Delivering the goods  
  
Have it your way  
Stealing your hearts  
  
Well we dont pull no punches we aim where the crunch is  
Bound to do most damage to your brain  
If youre looking for it mellow  
youre nothing more than yellow  
Gonna do it again and again  
Well beat you to submission  
So you might as well surrender  
You gotta learn your lesson  
Cause there aint nobody here to defend your heart  
  
Faster higher  
Til it seems that were gonna break  
Oh shootin further giving more than youre ever gonna take  
Leaving your heads  
Crushed out on the floor  
Begging for mercy  
Be careful or well do it some more  
  
You better watch out and hold on tight  
Were heading your way like dynamite  
Uh Delivering the goods  
Uh Delivering the goods
