Its the middle of the night  
And I cant sleep at all Im so uptight  
Tossin and turnin is how Ive spent the time  
Ive got so much on my mind hey  
  
Somethings got a hold on me  
I think its love dont you agree  
Its got to be I dont feel better  
I know what Ive got to do  
Ive got to get next to you  
  
So I came here  
For you to love  
In the pouring rain  
For you to love  
And I know Im ready  
For you to love  
Ill be the best I can  
Honey for you to love  
Cause honey its you I love  
Love love yeah  
  
I start to wonder what is true  
And I get so confused  
What should I do  
You make me worry  
When you say you understand  
But that I cant be your man  
  
Somethings gotta change your mind  
Now if I get my love to you in time  
Then youll be mine  
Ooh Ive got to get over  
Yes thats what Ive gotta do  
Look out cause Im after you  
  
I came here  
For you to love  
In a hurricane  
For you to love  
Just to be ready  
For you to love  
Ill be the kind of man  
Honey for you to love  
Cause honey its you I love  
Love love love yeah  
Cause honey its you I love yeah  
  
I wanted to see you  
I wanted to make your day  
I got myself ready  
To hear the words you would say  
Cause sometimes you talk to me so emotionally  
But then you pull it back baby  
Just let yourself love me  
  
I came here  
For you to love  
I took a train my dear  
For you to love  
So you know Im ready  
For you to love  
I never doubt never fear  
Honey for you to love  
Cause oh honey its you I love  
Cause oh honey its you I love  
Love love yeah  
  
For you to love  
For you to love  
For you to love
