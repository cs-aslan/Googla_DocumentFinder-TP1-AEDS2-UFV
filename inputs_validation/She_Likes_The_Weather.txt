Life is simple Life is sweet  
Oh so saddle up and go  
Little cowgirl in the underground  
She talks to people she doesnt know  
Oh people on the train to Eden  
The circus girl after all the rodeos  
She settles down alone  
She planted flowers in her basement  
So she has a little color when the sky runs low  
Chorus  
She likes the weather today  
She said Its raining in my head  
All of the flowers Ive raised  
Come up a little cloudy  
Life is bitter Life is cheap  
The cowgirl settles down alone  
Yeah ten years out of Eden now  
Shes got a little garden of her very own
