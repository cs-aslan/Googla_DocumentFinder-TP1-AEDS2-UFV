Holy war  
Genocide  
Suicide  
Hate and cruelty  
How can this be holy  
If I had a heart Id cry  
  
These ancient tales  
The good go to heaven  
And the wicked ones burn in hell  
Ring the funeral bells  
If I had a heart Id cry  
  
Theres just too many people now  
Too little land  
Much too much desire  
You feel so feeble now  
Its so out of hand  
Big bombs and barbed wire  
Weve set our lovely sky  
Our lovely sky  
On fire  
  
Theres just too many people now  
And too little land  
Too much rage and desire  
It makes you feel so feeble now  
Its so out of hand  
Big bombs and barbed wire  
Cant you see  
Our destiny  
We are making this Earth  
Our funeral pyre  
  
Holy Earth  
How can we heal you  
We cover you like a blight  
Strange birds of appetite  
If I had a heart Id cry  
If I had a heart Id cry  
If I had a heart Id cry
