Oh I never done this before  
Never wanna do this again  
Long turn on a dusty road  
I did it to myself so I cant pretend  
Well I learned just a little too late  
Good God I mustve been blind  
Cause she got me for everything everything everything alright  
Like my daddy Im a gambling man  
Never been afraid to roll the dice  
But when I put my bet on her  
Little miss snake eyes ruined my life  
She better sleep with one eye open  
Better make sure to lock her door  
Cause once I get my hands on her Ima oh  
  
Natalie she ran away with all my money  
And she did it for fun  
Natalie shes probably out there thinking its funny  
Telling everyone  
Well Im digging a ditch for this golddigging bitch  
Watch out shes quick  
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie  
If you see her tell her Im coming  
She better run  
  
The good lord better bless your soul  
Cause I done already cursed your name  
Dont matter which way you go  
Paybacks gonna come your way  
Youll be begging me please please please  
And now I look at you and laugh laugh laugh  
While you sit there and cry for me cry for me cry for me all night  
I spend your lifetime in jail yeah thats what I do  
Ill be smiling in my cell yeah thinking bout you  
Cant nobody save you now  
So there aint no use in trying  
Once I get my hands on you Ima oh  
  
Natalie she ran away with all my money  
And she did it for fun  
Natalie shes probably out there thinking its funny  
Telling everyone  
Well Im digging a ditch for this golddigging bitch  
Watch out shes quick  
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie  
If you see her tell her Im coming  
She better run  
  
I shouldve known better I shouldve known better  
Cause when we were together Cause when we were together  
She never said forever She never said forever  
Im a fool that played her game  
  
Hey Natalie she ran away with all my money  
And she did it for fun  
Natalie shes probably out there thinking its funny  
Telling everyone  
Well Im digging a ditch for this golddigging bitch  
Watch out shes quick  
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie  
If you see her tell her Im coming  
She better run
