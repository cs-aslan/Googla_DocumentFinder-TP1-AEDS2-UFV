Ive got a feeling its my lucky day come on fellers Im on my way  
Im going right up to the top of the tree so come right in and have a drink
with me  
It wont be long till I make my pile then Ill live in the grandest style  
Ill be a Cotton King yes sir Ill be the Emperor Of Lancashire  
  
Ill have a retinue ten miles long and an army ten million strong  
Big white elephants by the score and a fleet at anchor off the Wigan shore  
Dont you recognize who I am Youve got to give me a big salaam  
Youve got to end with a vote of thanks to the Emperor Of Lancs  
  
Now bow down everyone here I come bang that cymbal and hit that drum  
Bow down everyone yes sir Im the Emperor Of Lancashire  
  
Whos this gentleman flashing dough  
Is he somebody we should know  
Is he somebody Woah sir Im Emperor Of Lancashire  
  
Whos this gentleman talking loud Is he one of the usual crowd  
Whos this gentleman Yes sir Im the Emperor Of Lancashire  
  
Dont you recognise who youve seen Hes the boss of the whole chabine  
Hes the fellow who broke the banks  
Thats me Im the Emperor of Lancs  
  
Whos that fellow theyre crowding round  
Whos that sucker the boys have found

Now Im going back to my native town with my millions Ill knock em down  
Ill have everything in my power and Ill build a palace on the Blackpool
tower  
On my birthday the crowds will cheer all the fountains will flow with beer  
Blackpool wakes will run all year for the Emperor Of Lancashire  
  
Ill hold a banquet for fifty score tripe and onions and whelks galore  
Stewed pigs trotters aye and mutton shanks for the Emperor of Lancs  
Bow down everyone here I come bang that cymbal and hit that drum  
Bow down everyone yes sir Im the Emperor Of Lancashire
