God forgive me for the fool Ive been today  
I just throw that girl you sent to me away  
Lord Ill bet you shook your head at those awful things I said  
When I let my foolish pride get in the way  
  
And God forgive me for the man I fail to be  
To one whos only sin was loving me  
If Ive got a right to pray after treating her this way  
God forgive me for the fool Ive been today  
  
Lord I thought Id die when that tear came in her eye  
And that look of disbelief came on her face  
What a shame she had to see the ugly side of me  
Just when my lonely heart had found its place  
  
God forgive me for the fool Ive been today  
How much love can one man throw away  
I hadnt planned on growing old without that sweet and gentle soul  
God forgive me for the fool Ive been today
