When the darkness leaves you lonely  
Or the world tries to push you away  
When your sky is looking troubled  
You can count on me  
Cause Im gonna stay Im gonna stay  
  
Put your worries in my pocket  
Ive got a key so we can lock it  
I swear that I wont let them escape  
  
Love its always worth it love  
Everyone deserves it  
Its the friend that holds your hand  
When nobody understands  
  
Love it wants to heal you love  
It sees the real you  
But you have to open up  
When you need a little love  
  
If theres something youre in need of youre in need of  
You only have to let me know  
I got a shoulder you can lean on  
And Im always always right up the road  
  
Put your fears in my pocket  
Ive got a key so we can lock it  
And no Ino I wont let them escape  
  
Love its always worthing love  
Everyone deserves it  
Its the friend that holds your hand  
When nobody understands  
  
Love it wants to heal you love  
It see the real you  
But you have to open up  
When you need a little love  
  
Every night when your heart is praying for peace  
A noise in your head yeah  
Theres a light that is yours to keep  
And brighter than all the rest  
  
Love its always worthing love  
Everyone deserves it  
Its the friend that holds your hand  
When nobody understands  
  
Love it wants to heal you love  
It see the real you  
But you have to open up  
When you need a little love
