Feel like she loves me  
She loves me  
And then she loves me not  
She loves me not  
Feel like she loves me  
She loves me  
And then she loves me not  
She loves me not  
Then she loves me not  
  
Verse  
Hey I know that this aint nothing that you used to  
Out of the ordinary unusual  
I know you had your whole life planed out  
So to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you  
I know you wonder why I had to choose you  
Then wanna take you for granted or abuse you  
So Imma keep it honest  
I think its a little ironic  
If I hit another chick its gonna bruise you  
Shit staring out the window of this plane  
Thinking if it crash Ill never see your ass again  
Wouldnt that be a shame  
Cause look at all the shit we overcame  
Made it through the falme and never got cremated  
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded  
All them other couples we fck with secretly hated  
Flash forward its been year were the only ones that made it  
Sht remember I was straying from home  
And where I wanna be was my favourite song  
Sometimes I still be on my Donnell Jones  
But I just cant leave you alone  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2  
She know me like a book its too easy to read my ass  
Unhappy stressed yelling dont mislead my ass  
I mean I make it so easy dont please my ass  
The shoe was on the other foot and you would leave my ass  
Its true that true that  
My song all on the radio  
Who Dat  
Am I so far gone used to see both sides like the Mohawk on  
Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on  
All this time Ive been with ya you aint used to do that  
I loved you ass way before I knew you could wrap  
The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that  
Calling my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that  
We had a deal you aint keeping up your end of the shit  
In my mind I know she got the short end of the stick  
Trying justify it man we finna be rich  
And some bad btch I barely know sending me flix  
  
Chorus
