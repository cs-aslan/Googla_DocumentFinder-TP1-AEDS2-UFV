Anna Mccarrigle  
  
There where no cuckoos no sycamores  
We played about the forest floor  
Underneath the silver maples the balsams and the sky  
We popped the heads off dandelions  
Assuming roles from nursery rhymes  
Rested on the riverbank  
And grew up by and by and grew up by and by  
  
Frail my heart apart  
And play me a little shady grove  
Ring the bells of rhymney  
Till they ring inside my head forever  
Bounce the bow rock the gallows  
For the hangmans reel  
And wake the devil from his dream  
Im going back to Harlan  
Im going back to Harlan  
Im going back to Harlan  
  
And if you were Willie Moore  
And I was Barbara Allen  
Or Fair Ellen all sad at the cabin door  
Aweepin and apinin for love  
Aweepin and apinin for love
