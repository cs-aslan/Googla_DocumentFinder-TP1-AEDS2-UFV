That last train done left town  
That last train done left town  
I heard the whistle moaning low  
That last train done gone down  
  
My sweet babys on that train  
My sweet babys on that train  
I wonder if I will see her again  
That last train done gone down  
  
I heard that whistle moanin low  
I heard that whistle moanin low  
Im begging and pleading please dont go  
That last train done gone down  
  
Im sorry for what Ive done  
Im sorry for what Ive done  
Too late goodbye my sweet baby cried  
That last train done left town  
  
That last train done left town  
That last train done left town  
I heard that whistle moanin low  
That last train done gone down
