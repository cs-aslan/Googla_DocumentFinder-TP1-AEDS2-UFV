Here I lie feel like crying  
Its no surprise I just keep on trying  
If youre out there somewhere tonight  
Would you think of me oooeee  
Baby we live in two separate worlds  
Sure aint living in a perfect world  
So Im calling out wherever you may be  
Oooeee  
Im all alone  
Remember your touch  
Im all alone  
I think I love you too much  
And I know wherever you are tonight  
Youll begin to see  
Baby we live in two separate worlds  
Sure aint living in a perfect world  
So Im calling out wherever you may be  
Oooeee  
So youre in the country  
Where the air is so pure  
You know thats me whos knocking  
Baby knocking on your door  
And if youre flying in a plane  
High up in the sky  
You know Im calling out your name  
You know that baby Im your guy yeah  
Miles between us  
And we count the days  
Miles between us  
And theres two separate ways  
Im with you even when youre far away  
Baby we live in two separate worlds  
Sure aint living in a perfect world  
So Im calling out wherever you may be  
Oh oh oh  
Baby we live in two separate worlds  
Sure aint living in a perfect world  
Im with you even when youre far away  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be
