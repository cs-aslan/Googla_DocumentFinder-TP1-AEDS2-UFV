Now its time to shake it all up to be free  
Now its time to make us some room to let us be  
Oh it feels so bad  
Yes it feels so bad  
When everything good looks so bad  
When everything right goes so wrong  
  
I am up to break it all down whats in my way  
I wont stop until I am where Im going to stay  
No one holds me back  
No no one holds me back  
Dont want to be what Im not  
But its gotta be myself who breaks my neck  
  
I here and you look there I know its got to be somewhere  
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around  
We keep on looking til we know what for  
  
If you dont know it I dont know it we dont know it who will know it  
All of us dont know what we should know maybe one day well know  
But anyway weve got to make a stop  
  
Over my head look over my head you wont see no halo  
Its driving me mad I must hold it back inside  
  
When the sinner searches sin its all of us  
When we finally search inside its under us  
We keep on looking anyway  
If we dont find it who must pay  
All Ive ever done Ive done to you  
  
In my mind the battle goes on til I give up  
Will we find the key of life we once have dropped  
Do you really care  
Tell me you really care  
You may find Mr Blame  
But the guilt of life burns everywhere  
  
Give me light to see my inside give me light to see my sin  
Id never do what I regret Ive never done anything bad  
You must be joking when you point at me  
  
Hey Dont you blame me Dont you touch me  
Wont you ever leave me be  
I want to live Dont want to think Why should I give what I can drink  
Man Life is short so I take what I need  
  
Over your head  
When the sinner  
  
Pain  
I feel inside its such a  
Shame  
No one fights fair but who to  
Blame  
Might be the game of life but it aint over  
Now  
I walk my way firm any  
How  
My conscience speaks and there are  
Doubts  
But nothings sure in lifeand it aint over  
Now  
  
I look here  
Over my head  
When the sinner
