If I choke boy  
You start me up again  
Restring my wires whyknow  
This gearbox can make the shift polish my rims  
Damned if you do  
Damned if you dont  
I swear it seems of late boy  
Ive even curved this body to fit your bow  
  
Still the rain cant confuse the thoughts that come  
Come in rhythm  
Cause it never was the cars and guitars that came between us  
Still a thought says what if I  
Keep on drivin  
Keep on drivin  
  
Yeah that whip has skirt  
You said it proud  
Sometimes Id watch her idle while youd tune her up  
Me with my silencer on  
You and your crocodile clip  
Me and my alligator pears yeah  
All tricked out for the trip  
That slid into a spin  
  
You say that I miss you  
You stop in at my drivethrough  
You know who youll order some some boy  
  
Cause it never was the cars and guitars that came between us  
Still a thought says what if I  
Keep on drivin  
Keep on drivin  
Keep on drivin  
  
If I choke boy  
You start me up again  
Resting my wires whyknow  
This gearbox can make the shift polish my rims
