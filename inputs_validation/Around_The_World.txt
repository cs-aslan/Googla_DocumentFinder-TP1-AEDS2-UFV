All around the world  
We could make time  
Rompin and a stompin  
Cause Im in my prime  
  
Born in the north  
And sworn to entertain ya  
Cause Im down for  
The state of Pennsylvania  
  
I try not to whine  
But I must warn ya  
Bout the motherfucking girls  
From California  
  
Alabama baby  
Said hallelujah  
Good god girl  
I wish I knew ya  
  
I know I know for sure  
That life is beautiful around the world  
I know I know its you  
You say hello and then I say I do  
  
Come back baby  
Cause Id like to say  
Ive been around the world  
Back from Bombay  
  
Fox hole love  
Pie in your face  
Living in and out  
Of a big fat suitcase  
  
Bonafide ride  
Step aside my Johnson  
Yes I could  
In the woods of Wisconsin  
  
Wake up the cake  
Its a lake shes kissin me  
As they do when  
When they do in Sicily  
  
I know I know for sure  
That life is beautiful around the world  
I know I know its you  
You say hello and then I say I do  
  
Where you want to go  
Who you want to be  
What you want to do  
Just come with me  
  
I saw God  
And I saw the fountains  
You and me girl  
Sittin in the Swiss mountains  
  
Me Oh My O  
Me and Guy O  
Freer than a bird  
Cause were rockin Ohio  
  
Around the world  
I feel dutiful  
Take a wife  
Cause life is beautiful  
  
I know I know for sure  
Ding dang dong dong ding dang dong dong ding dang  
I know I know its you  
Ding dang dong dong ding dang dong dong ding dang  
  
Mother Russia do not suffer  
I know youre bold enough  
Ive been around the world  
And I have seen your love  
I know I know its you  
  
You say hello then I say I do
