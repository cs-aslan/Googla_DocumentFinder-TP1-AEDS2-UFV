You simply defy I cannot even look to the sky  
we try it single filed take on me and its my denial  
I cannot ever find something safe not done on the fly  
I cannot live this way floor and me will kick the PA  
  
You want to play with me  
Im really gonna rock your world  
You want to comfort me  
Im gonna rock your world  
  
You say everything is fine I cannot compete with the skies  
my sing has crossed the line come in me  
I fly through the sky I can not ever find  
you and me will make all the lines oh if they could see the plague  
no one would want to be me  
  
You want to play with me  
Im really gonna rock your world  
You want to comfort me  
Im gonna rock your world  
  
So I fly  
Take me  
I cannot fly  
Most people hate me  
To fly away from this pain  
Please take away  
Please take away my PA
