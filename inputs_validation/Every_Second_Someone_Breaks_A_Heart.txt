Its a dangerous world we live in  
Crime is everywhere  
Theres always some sad story going down  
  
You can read it in the paper  
You can see it on the air  
Its an evil epidemic going round  
  
But nobody seems to notice  
The saddest crime of all  
Oh just how many times a day  
Someone takes their love away  
And the national statistics  
Never put it in the chart  
But every second someone breaks a heart  
  
Theres a woman out there somewhere  
Who feels she lost her life  
But her man just shot her world down  
And it hurts  
  
Theres a guy who just got taken  
And it cuts him like a knife  
Some girl stole his heart and left him  
Without a world  
  
They dont call it a crime of passion  
But it kills you just the same  
Its murder when a true love dies  
Right before your very eyes  
  
And as soon as one is over  
Another one will start  
Every second someone breaks  
Every second someone breaks a heart  
  
If youve got someone who loves you  
Be careful all the time  
Do you know where your love is tonight  
Cause theres always someone trying  
To find the perfect crime  
And you never know just when  
Theyll strike  
  
So you better watch your woman  
And you better watch your man  
Cause no ones safe when loves at stake  
Anybodys heart can break  
  
And the next time that it happens  
Youre not the losing part  
Every second someone breaks a heart  
Every second someone breaks a heart  
Every second someone breaks a heart
