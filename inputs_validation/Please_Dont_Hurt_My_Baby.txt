Such a happy couple love and some  
Til man goes busy just for fun  
Man gets the guilt tells fun girl we cant no more  
Fun girl says if you stop Ill tell her right now  
Aah please dont hurt my baby  
Thats all his lips could say  
Aah please dont hurt my baby  
She wont believe you anyway  
I was blinded by sexsation  
Temporarily out my head  
Aah please dont hurt my baby  
She mustnt know we went to bed  
You could hear him moaning  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa  
You shoulda thought about that boy  
Before you were using it like a toy  
You shoulda thought about that boy  
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah  
What a pretty love pair perfect fit  
Til woman sights on one that shes just got to get with  
Woman gets scared tells plaything we cant no more  
Plaything says if you stop Ill tell him right now  
Aah please dont hurt my baby  
Thats all her lips could say  
Aah please dont hurt my baby  
He wont believe you anyway  
I was blinded by desire  
Temporarily insane  
Aah please dont hurt my baby  
He cant know we did the wild thing  
And you could hear her crying  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa  
You shoulda thought about that girl  
Before you were giving up that pearl  
You shoulda thought about that girl  
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah  
You shoulda thought about that boy  
Before you were using it like a toy  
You shoulda thought about that boy  
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah  
You shoulda thought about that girl  
Before you were giving up that pearl  
You shoulda thought about that girl  
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah  
You shoulda thought about that boy  
Before you were using it like a toy  
You shoulda thought about that boy  
Before you did the ooh aah ooh aah ooh ooh aaah
