I love you do you really love me  
I cry for you have you wept with me  
Ive cared for you  
How much do you care for me  
So you could have me  
I carried a load of shame  
So could have my name  
Have you done what Ive asked of you  
I asked you to come unto me  
Give all your cares and burdens to me  
For I truly love you  
Somehow I cant get through  
I have only the best for you  
But my voice you ignore  
Have you done what I asked of you  
This is my message to you  
Im coming back for you
