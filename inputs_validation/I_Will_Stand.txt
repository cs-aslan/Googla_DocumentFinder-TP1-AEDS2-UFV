I will not be the one  
Who turns his back and runs  
When things get rocky down the line  
And I will not be the one  
Holdin the smokin gun  
If our love dont stand the test of time  
  
Ill love you forever  
I will be your man  
Beside you always  
I will stand  
  
I didnt say I do  
To take control of you  
I have no chains to hold you down  
If youll let me spread my wings  
Youll get the best of me  
Deep in your heart is where Im bound  
  
I will not forsake you  
I will take your hand  
Beside you always  
I will stand  
  
No matter what happens  
This feeling will stay  
Till the day that I die  
Youll fill up the heart of my soul  
That Ill take to the other side  
  
And youll be the only one  
When all is said and done  
Ill keep you close to me I swear  
If ever you are down  
No need to look around  
Just close your eyes and Ill be there  
  
Ill love you forever  
I will be your man  
Beside you always  
I will stand
