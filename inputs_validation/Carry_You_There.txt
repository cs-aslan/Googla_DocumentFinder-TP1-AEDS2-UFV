Well I dont care what you say  
I dont have use for your words anyway  
You dont need a Cadillac  
Cause Ill be waiting with my bare back  
To carry you there  
  
Try and you dont have to be afraid  
To just rely  
On someone to hold away part of you child  
Its all right  
You can get too much to handle by yourself  
If you cant do it alone I know you will say  
I dont know whats at stake  
Or what it takes  
  
Well I dont care what you say  
I dont have use for your words anyway  
You dont need a Cadillac  
Cause Ill be waiting with my bare back  
To carry you there  
  
Turn around  
And you just might see the good  
Youve left behind  
But youre all caught up  
In whats still left to find  
And its never enough  
So slow down  
And the root of what youre feeling might appear  
When all the pushin up the hill has brought you here  
And youre used up  
To the line  
If you tell me you are fine  
  
Well I dont care what you say  
I dont have use for your words anyway  
You dont need a Cadillac  
Cause Ill be waiting Ill be waiting  
To carry you there  
Oh yeah  
  
Say dont be too proud  
Im holding my hand out  
Youve been my friend on darker days  
See Ill still be there  
Despite your despair  
And I dont really care what you say  
Hey hey hey  
  
Repeat x11  
I will carry you there
