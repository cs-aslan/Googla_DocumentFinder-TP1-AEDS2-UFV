Out here is the country theres magic in the air  
Its the middle of December theres excitement eveywhere  
  
Everyones invited the celebrations planned  
The gift is just whats in your heart and not whats in your hand  
  
Chorus  
Whos the one we need to thanks  
Whos the party for  
Whos the one responsible for all this peace and joy  
Who deserves the credit for the blessings we enjoy  
Preacher said last Sunday it was Joseph and Marys boy  
  
There were times we didnt think wed make it through the year  
The bankers tried to take our farms but somehow were still here  
  
I dont know how the crops survived the drought and then the rain  
It must have been a miracle how else could you explain  
  
Chorus  
  
The Christ Child born in Bethlehem  
He was Joseph and Marys boy
