At a quick shop somewhere west of Albuquerque  
Got a tank of gas and a cold drink and a beef jerky  
The cashier she gave me a smile  
So I stood there and I talk to her a while  
  
She said where you headed I hope you get there soon  
Ive seen em all day long from 4am till noon  
Some are running from  
Some are running too  
Some are running blind  
Lord  
Which one are you  
  
I said it dont appear to me to be so cut and dry  
You dont know me from Adam  
can it be so black and white  
I said I got a plan you see I got it figured out  
How can you be so sure my dear what Im all about  
  
She said Ive stood in this window for 27 years  
I can tell your cash or credit  
I can tell your brand of beer  
  
I can tell you whos a liar  
And the truth is plain to see  
Thats your last twenty boy  
and dont you lie to me  
  
Theirs a girl  
In Albuquerque crying aint she  
And your standing in a quick shop  
Lying Aint ya  
  
Well  
She handed back my twenty  
Said you know what to do  
If you drive it steady son  
Youll be home this afternoon  
And I hate to judge you  
I dont mean to seem unkind  
But there aint no use in running  
If youre only running blind  
  
Oh their aint no use in running  
If youre only running blind
