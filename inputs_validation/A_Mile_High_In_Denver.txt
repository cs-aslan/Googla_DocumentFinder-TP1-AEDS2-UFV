1970  
Sittin on a pocket full of hard earned wages  
Lookin at the world through magazine pages  
I heard a lot about the mountains and the colorado range  
Made this stop for personal reasons  
Didnt know Id catch the changin of the seasons  
Winter dictates everything from frost to naked trees  
Chorus  
Im about a mile high in denver  
Where the rock meets timberline  
Ive walked this ground from town to town  
Just to finally call it mine  
Lookin for the cloud with a styrofoam lining  
Hopin that the sun will keep on shinin  
Leading me to distant peace that waits so patiently  
Need a little love to try some givin  
Try a little love and then start livin  
Things I feared so long ago  
When everything was wrong  
Chorus  
Im about a mile high in denver  
Where the rock meets timberline  
Ive walked this ground from town to town  
Tonight Ill call it mine  
Tonight Ill call it mine  
Sittin on a pocket full of hard earned wages  
Lookin at the world through magazine pages  
I heard a lot about the mountains and the colorado range  
Need a little time to try some livin  
Try a little love and then start givin  
Things I feared so long ago  
When everything was wrong  
Im about a mile high in denver  
Where the rock meets timberline  
Where God and trees create the breeze  
Tonight Ill call it mine  
Tonight Ill call it mine  
Tonight Ill call it mine  
Tonight Ill call it mine  
Tonight Ill call it mine
