Im stoned in the twilight  
Screaming on the inside  
Give me your water help me survive  
Gonna miss the sunlight  
When I lose my eyesight  
  
Give me my red shoes I want to dance  
They search for an answer  
But that old man wouldnt listen  
Back then I was handsome  
Back then he was ignorant  
  
And shave off the years now its all inside my head  
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed  
Put them in a box somewhere put them in a drawer  
Take my red shoes I cant wear them anymore  
  
Had garlands in the wings back then  
All the pretty little things back then  
Calling out my name oh what fame brings  
After curtain calls and bows  
I cant see the front row now  
Hand me my red shoes just one more time  
  
They pushed aside our presence  
They refused to go the distance  
Back then I was Sigmund  
Back then he wouldnt listen
