How can I go on  
When I know I gave it all  
Have I given too much  
Something inside your heart is pushing me aside  
And it seems so on you baby  
But its so hard on me  
What is it Im seeing in your eyes  
The story that Im reading says goodbye  
Tell me baby where did we go wrong  
How did we lose a love so strong  
What can I say to make things right  
Baby hold on dont leave tonight  
Theres no reason why this part of us should die  
Dont say goodbye  
Searching for answers  
But theyre oh so hard to find  
Cause Im still loving you baby  
Oh are you still loving me  
Baby dont you turn and close the door  
Is it you dont love me any more  
Tell me baby where did we go wrong  
How did we lose a love so strong  
What can I say to make things right  
Baby hold on dont leave tonight  
Theres no reason why this part of us should die  
Dont say goodbye  
Dont leave me now all alone  
Dont bring me down  
Cause Im not that strong  
I need your love to carry on  
Tell me baby where did we go wrong  
How did we lose a love so strong  
What can I say to make things right  
Baby hold on dont leave tonight  
Theres no reason why this part of us should die  
Dont say goodbye  
Tell me baby where did we go wrong  
How did we lose a love so strong  
What can I say to make things right  
Baby hold on dont leave tonight  
Theres no reason why this part of us should die  
Dont say goodbye  
Theres no reason why this part of us should die  
Dont say goodbye
