Another morning another day in your life  
Without someone there by you  
You had a dream again last night  
You wonder why the dream just wont come true  
So what ya gonna do  
Walk around with your head hung down  
Maybe thats the reason youve never found  
The one for you  
So youve got to let your love shine through  
Your eyes your smile  
Youve got to let somebody know how you feel inside  
Your heart youll find  
Somebody wants to be a part of your life  
And if you just believe  
And say thats what youre gonna do  
One day love will find its way to you  
Yes it will  
One day love will find its way to you  
Another party and all your friends are smiles  
Oh you might meet someone new  
And being close would be so nice  
In this life the chances are so few  
So what ya gonna do  
Walk around with your head hung down  
Maybe thats the reason youve never found  
The one for you  
So youve got to let your love shine through  
Your eyes your smile  
Youve got to let somebody know how you feel inside  
Your heart youll find  
Somebody wants to be a part of your life  
And if you just believe  
And say thats what youre gonna do  
One day love will find its way to you  
Oh yes it will  
One day love will find its way to you  
Dont you think youre the only one  
Oh somewhere in the world  
Theres a lonely heart looking for someone  
Youve got to let your love shine through  
Your eyes your smile  
Youve got to let somebody know how you feel inside  
Your heart youll find  
Somebody wants to be a part of your life  
Cause your eyes your smile  
Youve got to let somebody know how you feel inside  
Somebody wants to be a part of your life
