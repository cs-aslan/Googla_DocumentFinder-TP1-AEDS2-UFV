Toe to toe dancing very close  
Body breathing almost comatose  
Wall to wall people hypnotized  
And theyre stepping lightly  
  
Hang each night in rapture  
Back to back sacroiliac  
Spineless movement and a wild attack  
Face to face sightless solitude  
  
And its finger popping  
Twenty four hour shopping in rapture  
Fab Five Freddy told me everybodys fly  
DJ spinning I said My My  
  
Flash is fast flash is cool  
Francois cest pas flashe non due  
  
And you dont stop sure shot  
Go out to the parking lot  
And you get in your car and drive real far  
And you drive all night and then you see a light  
  
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground  
And out comes a man from Mars  
And you try to run but hes got a gun  
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head  
  
And then youre in the man from Mars  
You go out at night eating cars  
You eat Cadillacs Lincolns too  
Mercurys and Subaru  
  
And you dont stop  
You keep on eating cars  
Then when theres no more cars you go out at night  
And eat up bars where the people meet  
  
Face to face  
Dance cheek to cheek  
One to one  
Man to man  
  
Dance toe to toe  
Dont move too slow cause the man from Mars is through with cars  
Hes eating bars  
Yeah wall to wall  
  
Door to door  
Hall to hall  
Hes gonna eat em all  
Rapture  
Be pure  
  
Take a tour through the sewer  
Dont strain your brain  
Paint a train  
Youll be singing in the rain  
  
Said dont stop to the punk rock  
Toe to toe dancing very close  
Body breathing almost comatose  
Wall to wall people hypnotised  
  
And theyre stepping lightly  
Hang each night in rapture  
Well now you see what you want to be  
Just have your party on TV  
  
Cause the man from Mars wont eat up bars where the TVs on  
And now hes gone back up to space  
Where he wont have the hassle with the human race  
And you hip hop  
And you dont stop  
  
Just blast off  
Sure shot  
Because the man from Mars stopped eating cars  
And eating bars  
And now he only eats guitars  
  
Get up Get up Get up  
Rapture  
Rapture  
Rapture
