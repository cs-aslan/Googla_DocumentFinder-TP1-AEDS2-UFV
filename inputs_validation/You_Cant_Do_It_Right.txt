Have you ever thought of the feeling  
I get when Im alone with you  
Its causing me worry and trouble  
Im going round in circles  
Dont know what Im gonna do  
  
You cant do it right  
With the one you love  
Nothing you can do  
Without the one you love  
  
You were always playing my records  
When I was after making some love  
But I need more than the music  
To keep myself together  
Although it makes me feel so good  
  
You cant do it right  
With the one you love  
Nothing you can do  
Without the one you love  
  
Sometimes in the morning  
I wake up without you  
Cant get up its getting me down  
Tell me what youre trying to do  
Later in the evening  
You come home feeling low  
If youd stop your cruising  
Maybe we could make a show  
  
You cant do it right  
With the one you love  
Nothing you can do  
Without the one you love
