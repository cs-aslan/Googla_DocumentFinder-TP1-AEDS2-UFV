Blue Im getting kinda close to you  
Like a shadow I cant lose  
Hey youve been hangin with me every day  
Now youre gettin in my way  
I know you understand me  
But dont ya think that maybe its time to move on  
  
Chorus  
Whats up lonely  
Seems youre my only  
Friend who wants to share my pain  
Tell me heartache  
Whats it gonna take  
For you to leave me alone today  
Just when I think that youre gone  
Youre in the mirror lookin back at me  
So whats up lonely  
  
Sometimes I wish you werent by my side  
Cant you find another shoulder cause I  
I want to leave this broken heart behind  
We been wastin too much time  
Find someone else to rain on  
Im really getting tired of singin this sad song  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont want to give you a reason  
To hang around anymore  
You wont be hurting my feelings  
If you find another broken heart you can lean on
