Passion take the wind  
And break me from this tie  
Were mortals on the earth  
Oh but Gods in the sky  
I havent got a clue  
I havent got a thing  
But what I give to you  
Is all that I could bring  
Ill give you all my time  
Thats everything to me  
You know my only crime  
Is this flight of fantasy  
  
Because Ive nothing else here for you  
And just because its easier than the truth  
Oh if theres nothing else that I can do  
Ill fly for you

Im just an average boy  
Youre more than an average girland  
When you sing to me the sho be doos  
You sing so well  
Oh dont you know that when Im under you  
Im overjoyed
