Ive seen the Ides of March  
And Ive seen the fall of Rome  
Ive seen all kinds of stuff  
But I never see my home  
If my lifeline is  
These million miles of track  
One thing I know by now  
There is no turning back  
From a moving train  
From a moving train  
From a moving train  
From a moving train  
If every venture was  
A path to no avail  
Id still be rolling down  
This never ending trail  
If we had a destination  
In our sights  
We would be helpless as  
We passed it in the night  
From a moving train hear the engine running  
From a moving train you can get on board  
From a moving train hear the motor humming  
From a moving train see youve gotta see the light  
And if by chance you find a woman  
That you might love along the way  
You better hold her tight  
Tell her everythings alright  
Or she might jump along the way  
From a moving train hear the engine running  
From a moving train you can get on board  
From a moving train hear the motor humming  
From a moving train see youve gotta see the light  
From a moving train hear the engine running  
From a moving train you can get on board  
From a moving train hear the motor humming  
From a moving train see youve gotta see the light
