Why dont you pick up after your done  
Im not your slave

Im not your maid  
I mean Ive got a life too  
So fuck you  
  
Why cant you be nicer to my friend  
Theyre gonna be here soon  
Last time they were here  
You just sat in the bedroom  
Friday you went out with your fat friend Lou  
Fuck you  
  
Why dont you ever ask about my Chinese cooking class

Fuck you

And weve never been there  
We always do what you want to do  
Fuck you

You didnt notice I had the kitched painted blue  
Why dont you notice all those guys looking at me  
You take me for granted

I always try to look my best and you should too  
Fuck you
