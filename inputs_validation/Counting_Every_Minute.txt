Gonna break these chains  
Gonna set myself free  
Gonna turn on the mains  
Feel the power inside of me  
Gonna burn all nightgonna burn all day  
Youll see me coming  
From miles away  
  
Feel me in the air  
Feel me all around you  
Gonna show you how I care  
Teach you something new  
Im gonna take my time  
Make love to you  
Yeah I know I can satisfy you  
Thats what I intend to do  
  
Now Im counting every minute  
Every single minute  
Im calling for you honey  
Come and get it while its hot  
Counting every minute  
Ooh Im living it  
Ill make every minute count  
Give it everything Ive got  
  
Feel me getting closer  
Im almost there  
Can you fell my fingers  
Running through your hair  
Can you feel my hands  
Draw you closer to me  
Can you hear that clock tick tick ticking baby  
Ill soon be there to set you free  
  
Im counting every minute  
Every single minute  
Dont fool around come and  
Get it while its hot  
Counting every minute  
Ooh Im living in it  
Ill make every minute count  
Give it everything Ive got  
  
Counting every minute  
Every single minute  
Im calling for you honey  
Come and get it while its hot  
  
Counting every minute  
Ooh Im gonna give it  
Ill give it to you honey  
Ill give you everything  
Ive got

Every single minute  
Dont fool around come and  
Get it while its hot  
  
Counting every minute  
Baby dont be timid  
Ill make every minute count  
Give it everything Ive got  
  
Counting every minute  
Counting every minute  
Counting every minute  
  
Im calling for you honey  
Come and get it while

Every single minute
