Every Saturday night I get dressed up to ride for you baby  
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine for you baby  
I drive fast wind in my hair push it to the limits cause I just dont care  
You ask me where Ive been

Ive got a burning desire for you baby  
Ive got a burning desire come on tell me boy  
Ive got a burning desire for you baby  
Ive got a burning desire come on tell me boy  
  
I drive fast wind in my hair push it to the limits cause I just dont care  
Ive got a burning desire for you baby  
Ive got a burning desire  
  
Every Saturday night I seem to come alive for you baby  
Santa Monica Im racing in the lights for you baby  
I drive fast radio blares have to touch myself to pretend youre there  
Your hands were on my hips your name is on my lips  
Over over again like my only prayer
