And I think I know you  
Something is familiar bout your face  
I move through the crowd so I can get a better look

Cant you see me Im here  
Beside you  
  
Werent you the one who  
Spilled my long drink over at a bar  
Easy come easy go I said and laughed  
Looking like a question mark you  
Stood there wondering what to do  
And I said to you Dont you look to happy now
