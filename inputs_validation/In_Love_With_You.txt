Just a gentle whisper  
Told me that youve gone  
Leaving only memories  
Where did we go wrong  
I couldnt find the words  
Then so let me say them now  
Im still in love with you  
  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell me that you care  
Tell me that you need me  
And Ill be there  
Ill be there waiting  
  
I will always love you  
I will always stay true  
Theres no one who love  
You like I do  
  
Come to me now  
I will never leave you  
I will stay here with you  
Through the good and bad  
I will stand true  
Im in love with you  
  
Now were here together  
Yesterday has passed  
Life is just beginning close to you at last  
And I promise to you  
I will always be there  
I give my all to you  
  
Living life without you is more than I can bear  
Hold me close forever  
Ill be there  
Ill be there for you  
  
Hold me closer  
Our love is forever  
Holding us together  
Nothing in this world can stop us now  
Love has found a way love has found a way  
  
Im in love Im in love  
Yes Im in love so in love  
Im in love with you
