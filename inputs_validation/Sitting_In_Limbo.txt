Jimmy Cliff  
  
Sitting here in Limbo  
Waiting for the tide turn  
Yeah now sitting here in Limbo  
So many things Ive got to learn  
Meanwhile theyre putting up a resistance  
But I know that my faith will lead me on  
  
Sitting here in Limbo  
Waiting for the dice to roll  
Yeah now sitting here in Limbo  
Still got some time to search my soul  
Meanwhile theyre putting up a resistance  
But I know that my faith will lead me on  
  
I dont know where life will take me  
But I know where I have been  
I dont know what life will show me  
But I know what I have seen  
Tried my hand at love and friendship  
That is past and gone  
And now its time to move along  
  
Sitting here in Limbo  
Like a bird aint got a song  
Yeah Im sitting here in Limbo  
And I know it wont be long  
Til I make my getaway now  
Meanwhile theyre putting up a resistance  
But I know that my faith will lead me on  
  
I dont know where life will take me  
But I know where I have been  
I dont know what life will show me  
But I know what I have seen  
Tried my hand at love and friendship  
That is past and gone  
And now its time to move along  
  
Gonna lead me on now  
Meanwhile theyre putting up resistance  
But I know that my faith will lead me on  
Sitting in Limbo Limbo Limbo  
Sitting in Limbo Limbo Limbo  
Sitting in Limbo Limbo Limbo  
Meanwhile theyre putting up a resistance  
But I know that my faith will lead me on
