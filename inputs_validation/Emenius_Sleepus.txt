I saw my friend the other day  
And I dont know  
Exactly just what he became  
It goes to show  
It wasnt long ago  
And I was just like you  
And now I think Im sick  
And I want to go home  
  
How have I been how have you been  
Its been so long  
What have you done with all your time  
And what went wrong  
I knew you back when  
And you you knew me  
And now I think youre sick  
I want to go home  
  
Anybody ever say no  
Ever tell you that you werent right  
Where did all the little kid go  
Did you lose it in a hateful fight  
And you know its true
