I followed you foolishly  
You were at a smoky bar you were out til three  
Sat alone inside my car it was nearly four  
We were gonna wait for you all night  
So I locked the door  
  
I was gonna spend the night coulda been okay  
We were gonna talk all night till I went away  
Remember how you used to say cant stay up late  
A minute later were older now I cant stay awake  
Im driving by your parents farm in the Chevrolet  
I remember that rusty car like it was yesterday  
  
Saw my brother driving by the other day  
I wished that Id go out to him but he drove away  
Saw my sister standing there standing in rain  
Then I thought about nothing that it feels the same  
  
Another day come and gone  
Dont think I can ever sing that song  
Little secrets we bring along  
Im taking my time trailing behind I thought of you  
Today is the day I think of you
