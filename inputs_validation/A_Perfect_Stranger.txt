Someone who isnt like you and to waste it all  
Someone to be around  
Someone to have me hold when the deal goes down  
Didnt I say it would happen this way in the end  
Didnt I say it would happen this way in the end  
  
A perfect stranger is what it seems  
A perfect stranger a crazy dream  
A crazy dream  
  
Find myself a perfect stranger to do for now  
Someone who isnt like you but knows why and how  
Someone to walk away  
Someone who knows the time to leave or to stay  
Isnt it sad baby we never have it that way  
Isnt it sad baby we never have it that way  
  
A perfect stranger is what he seems  
A perfect stranger a crazy dream  
A crazy dream  
  
Find myself a perfect stranger to take me there  
Someone who isnt like you but know why and where  
Soemone whos not afraid  
Someone whos blind to all the promises made  
  
How does it feel baby we shouldnt leave it this way  
How does it feel baby we shouldnt leave it this way  
How does it feel baby we shouldnt leave it this way Perfect stranger  
How does it feel baby we shouldnt leave it this way Perfect stranger  
How does it feel baby we shouldnt leave it this way Perfect stranger
