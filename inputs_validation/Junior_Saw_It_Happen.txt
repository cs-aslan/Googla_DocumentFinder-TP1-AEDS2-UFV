My sweet child was seen across town  
With some stranger man  
She had a smile on her face looked out of place  
Suitcase was in her hand  
Junior saw it happen  
Why didnt I listen to you Hey  
Whoa ohh whoa  
Couldve had her back  
Whoa ohh whoa  
Now shes down the tracks with him  
I remember on the day she left me  
Thats one thing Ill never forget  
In the apartment we owned all she left was a phone  
And a broken down TV set  
Junior saw it happen  
Why didnt I listen to you Hey  
Whoa ohh whoa  
Couldve had her back  
Whoa na na na na na whoa  
Now shes down the tracks with him  
Didnt believe it when I first got word  
But boy I sure do now  
I couldnt face it my mind wouldnt take it  
It didnt make sense somehow  
Because I thought you was happy with the way we lived  
And the things that we used to do  
Whoa no no no whoa  
Had her back  
Whoa no no no no no no no whoa  
Now shes down the tracks with him
