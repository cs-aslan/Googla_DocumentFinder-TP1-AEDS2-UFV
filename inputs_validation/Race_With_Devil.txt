Youd better run  
Youd better run  
Youd better run from the  
Devils gun  
The race is on  
The race is on  
Now youd better run from the  
Devils gun  
  
Strange things happen  
If you stay  
The devil will catch you  
Anyway  
Hell seek you here  
Hell seek you there  
The devil will seek you  
Everywhere  
  
Lead break  
  
And when he finds you  
Youll soon find out  
The devils fire just wont  
Go out  
He burns you up  
From head to toe  
The devils grip just wont  
Let go
