Im in the boot of a car breathing air through a hole  
Shes driving me down to the river  
Shell watch over me in the tears in her eyes  
Couldnt dig my own grave any deeper  
Shes pushing me blindfolded down to my knees  
But her finger still shakes on the trigger  
Shes untying my hands though I gave her the rope  
This is so much harder to leave her leave her leave her  
  
When youre forgiven but you cant forget  
Feels like youre drowning but you still got breath  
And weve been tryna lay this ghost to rest  
Oh but there aint no getting out of this mess  
No there aint no getting out  
There aint no getting out  
There aint no getting out of this mess  
  
Now shes showing me mercy as much as she can  
Shes letting me live with my demons  
See her washing her hands as shes walking away  
Oh but still she looks back she looks back  
But shes leaving shes leaving  
  
When youre forgiven but you cant forget  
Feels like youre drowning but you still got breath  
And weve been tryna lay this ghost to rest  
Oh but there aint no getting out of this mess  
No there aint no getting out  
There aint no getting out  
There aint no getting out of this mess  
No there aint no getting out  
No there aint no getting out of this mess  
  
Whats done is done  
Cant resurrect the setting sun  
Whats done is done  
Oh you cant reverse the bullet from a gun  
Whats done is done  
Cant resurrect the setting sun  
Whats done is done  
Oh you cant reverse the bullet from a gun  
  
When youre forgiven but you cant forget  
Feels like youre drowning but you still got breath  
And weve been tryna lay this ghost to rest  
Oh but there aint no getting out of this mess  
When youre forgiven but you cant forget  
Feels like youre drowning but you still got breath  
And weve been tryna lay this ghost to rest  
Oh but there aint no getting  
There aint no getting out of this mess  
Out of this mess  
Out of this mess  
Out of this mess  
Out of this mess  
Out of this mess  
Out of this mess
