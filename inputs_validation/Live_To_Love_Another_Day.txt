Lord I fell for her smile  
And she loved me for a while  
Then she said goodbye gotta go  
Left me standing on the side of the road  
Now shes gone and Im a memory in her past  
And the long and short of it some things never last  
  
Chorus  
Oh because summers come summers go  
Ill keep walking down this road  
Its alright and its okay  
Ill live to love another day  
Ill live to love another day  
  
Lord Im out here again  
With my back to the wind  
The warm sun thats sinking low  
Is gonna leave me out in the cold  
But the long and short of it some things never last  
And if that goes for the good  
It must go for the bad  
  
Chorus  
  
If I fall down  
Im not ashamed  
I always get back up again  
But Ill be fine till the right one comes to save me save me save me  
  
Lord I fell for her smile  
And she loved me for a while  
And someday shes gonna wish  
She hadnt left me here like this  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill live to love another day  
Ill live to love another day  
Ill live to love another day
