RIP to the girl you used to see  
Her days are over Baby shes over  
Ive decided to give you all of me  
Baby come closer baby come closer  
Im ready for ya  
  
Kill em all switch it up  
Put it on zip it up  
Let my perfume soak into your sweater  
Say youll be here soon sooner the better  
No option for her you sayin no  
I run this game just play your role  
Follow my lead what you waitin fo  
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night  
  
Yeah I hear you talkin dont know who you tryin to flatter  
Got my mind made up IIIm ready for ya  
Im in control but with you bein the man  
You dont seem to understand that IIIm ready for ya  
IIIm ready for ya  
IIIm ready for ya  
So keep thinkin you the man  
Cause its all part of my plan  
IIIm ready for ya  
  
Nothin on I strut around  
I do it big I shut it down  
I wonder if youll be able to handle me  
Mental picture no cameras please  
  
Yeah I hear you talkin dont know who you tryin to flatter  
Got my mind made up IIIm ready for ya  
Im in control but with you bein the man  
You dont seem to understand that IIIm ready for ya  
IIIm ready for ya  
IIIm ready for ya  
So keep thinkin you the man  
Cause its all part of my plan  
IIIm ready for ya  
  
Uh red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind  
Flash black lingerie white diamonds what a contrast  
I know you get impatient as the time pass  
You say you want it fast define fast  
Cause I can speed it up and make it last  
And I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast  
And I could produce for your future I could codirect your past  
And make damn sure you never forget it  
Committed  
Im ready Im with it still here like a statue  
Pink champagne green ink in your tattoos  
You say you got baggage well Im packed too  
Plus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you BANG  
The baddest women ever and the hardest out  
Proven over and over again thats why Im hard to doubt  
Plus Im Young Money till the death I took the carter route  
Im more than ready too hope of something that you thought about  
  
Yeah I hear you talkin dont know who you tryin to flatter  
Got my mind made up IIIm ready for ya  
Im in control but with you bein the man  
You dont seem to understand that IIIm ready for ya  
IIIm ready for ya  
IIIm ready for ya  
So keep thinkin you the man  
Cause its all part of my plan  
IIIm ready for ya  
  
RIP to the girl  
Who used to see  
Her days are over  
Baby shes over  
  
IIIm ready for ya  
IIIm ready for ya  
IIIm ready for ya  
  
So keep thinkin you the man  
Cause its all part of my plan  
  
IIIm ready for ya
