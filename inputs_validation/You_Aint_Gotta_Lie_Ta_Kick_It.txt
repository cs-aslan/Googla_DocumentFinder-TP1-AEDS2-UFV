To let you tell it Randy Moss is your people  
Its evident your ass lie like the president  
But stretch marks on your mouth is the evidence ha ha  
How the fuck can your friends be the Benjamins punk  
And your little ass cars full of fender Benz  
There you go on the stand with your hand up lyin  
Testifyin about a man thats in handcuffs  
We should do you like the Mack said  
And if he lie like a crackhead pop em like a black head  
Let him ooze let him loose  
Let him lie by his motherfuckin ass on the news yeah yeah
