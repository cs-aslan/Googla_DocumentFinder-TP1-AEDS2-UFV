Im paying for all my fathers sins  
So I will thank him for you  
Ima thank him for you  
My serotonins got a while to go  
Girl its gone cause of you  
Its been gone cause of you  
  
They say they want heaven  
They say they want God  
I say I got heaven  
Well I say I am God  
  
I never prayed a moment in my life  
Girl Im rewarded with you  
Ive been rewarded with you  
So baby let me kiss your inner thigh  
Let me kiss it for you  
I can kiss it for you  
  
They say they want heaven  
They say they want God  
I say I have heaven  
I say I am God
