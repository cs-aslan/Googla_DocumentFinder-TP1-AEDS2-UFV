Big cat walking on the wild side  
Big cat talking on the wild side  
He knows he looks the way he should  
Hes got something making him feel good  
Hes got the style hes got the sway  
Hes a million miles away  
  
She cat walking on the wild side  
She cat talking on the wild side  
She dont smile she dont look  
She dont do laundry and she dont cook  
Shes not listening to what he says  
Shes not making any promises  
  
He just wants to love someone  
She just wants to love someone  
He just wants to hold someone  
She just wants to love someone  
  
Big cat walking on the wild side  
Big cat stalking on the wild side  
She cat walking on the wild side  
She cat talking on the wild side  
Hes thinking how shes not so tough  
Could be a diamond sitting in the rough  
Shes staring out to empty space  
Shes wondering how long he will take  
  
He just wants to love someone  
She just wants to love someone  
He just wants to hold someone  
She just wants to love someone
