We kept apart and connected by the same stretch of road  
Neglected the truth and refused to grow old  
It started a stream but then the levee fell  
When the rainmaker had some extra sends to sell  
  
I just wanna drink til Im not thirsty  
I just wanna sleep til Im not tired  
I just wanna drive til I run out of highway  
Into the purple sky  
  
Well I just thought Id call and see whats going on  
Did the hills all flatten out since Ive been gone  
Are the fields all painted up in red and blue  
Are you thinking of me the times Im thinking of you  
  
I just wanna drink til Im not thirsty  
I just wanna sleep til Im not tired  
I just wanna drive til I run out of highway  
Into the purple sky  
  
But if Im gonna live until Im 50  
Im gonna need you by my side  
Cause I dont wanna dance without you with me  
Into the purple sky  
  
Livin like a soulless pirate somewhere lost at sea  
Wondering if I ever make it home will you come back to me  
Could we dream up a reason for a rendezvous  
Im back in town and I got nothing to do  
We could drive all day with the top let down  
We could stay in tonight or we could wreck this town  
  
I just wanna drink til Im not thirsty  
I just wanna sleep til Im not tired  
I just wanna drive til I run out of highway  
Into the purple sky  
  
But if Im gonna live until Im 50  
Im gonna need you by my side  
Cause I dont wanna dance without you with me  
Into the purple sky  
  
Uh huh uh huh uh huh huh huh  
Into the purple sky  
Uh huh uh huh uh huh huh huh  
Into the purple sky  
Uh huh uh huh uh huh huh huh  
Into the purple sky  
Uh huh uh huh uh huh huh huh  
Into the purple sky  
Uh huh uh huh uh huh huh huh  
Into the purple sky
