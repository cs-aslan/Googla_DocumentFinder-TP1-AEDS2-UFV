Rockin chair money  
  
Now I got rockin chair money  
But I got it the hard hard way  
I fought in every battle  
From the start to the vj day  
  
Now Ill rock yeah rock  
Oh baby rock rock on down the line  
  
Now some folks seem to be jealous  
Some dont seem to care  
But I got rockin chair money honey  
To rock on away from here  
  
Cause I love to rock yeah rock  
Baby rock rock on down the line  
  
I rocked away out on the ocean  
I rocked from here and there  
My baby stepped out while I was gone  
Now she dont get my rockin chair  
  
Cause I love to rock yeah rock  
Baby rock rock on down the line  
  
Ill soon get my big check baby  
And then well have some fun  
This rockin chair money honey  
Is better than totin a gun  
  
Cause I love to rock yeah rock  
Baby rock lets rock on down the line  
  
Now honey lets go honkytonkin  
Lets honkytonk all night  
Lets lolly gag and smooch and love  
And do it all upright  
  
Cause I love to rock yeah rock  
Baby rock lets rock on down the line
