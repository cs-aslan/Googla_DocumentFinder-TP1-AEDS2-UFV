Mama makes the music and she makes the news  
She dances all night in her golden shoes  
Shes high flying going going gone  
Shell be halfway to Heaven by the hour  
That the morning comes  
  
And papas knocked out with his head in his lap  
Mama likes to think that hes taking a nap  
Cause hes working so hard  
Working all night long  
Hell be halfway to hell in the hour  
That the morning comes  
  
Like a bat out of hell in the moonlight  
Like the pieces of the picture  
That you broke last night  
Im sure its going to be all right  
Ill be halfway heavy by the hour  
That the morning comes  
  
Oh look at that fool with the lampshade on  
Somebody told him he was having fun  
But they were wrong wrong wrong wrong  
If hes fool enough he might open his eyes  
When the morning comes along  
  
Now look at that secret agent man  
Sneaking out of church with blood on his hands  
Hes for sale going going gone  
Hell be the first to know and the last to go  
When the shit hits the fan  
  
Give me a little water give me a little wine  
Youre looking at a man whos been out  
In the sunshine just a little too long  
Little bit too long  
But Ill be halfway home in the hour  
That the morning comes
