In my dream our love was lost I lived by luck and fate  
I carried you inside of me prayed it wouldnt be too late  
Now Im standin on this empty road where nothin moves but the wind  
  
Once I was your treasure and I saw your face in every star  
But the promises we make at night oh thats all they are  
Unless we fill them with faith and love theyre empty as the howlin wind  
And honey I just want to be back in your arms  
Back in your arms again  
  
You came to me with love and kindness  
But all my life Ive been a prisoner of my own blindness  
I met you with indifference and I dont know why  
Now I wake from my dream I wkae from my dream to this world  
Where all is shadow and darkness and a above me a dark sky unfurls  
And all the love Ive thrown away and lost Im longin for again  
Now darlin I just want to be back in your arms  
Back in your arms again
