I know a fool who blows a horn  
He comes from way down South oh yeah  
And you aint seen some blowin since you been born  
Like when a trombones to his mouth  
He wails and moans grunts and groans  
He can moan just like a cow  
And you aint seen some blowin since you been born  
Cause he wont show them how  
Chorus  
Oh Charlie wont you play that thing  
I mean the slide trombone  
Make it talk  
Make it sing  
I mean the slide trombone  
If Gabriel knew how you could blow  
Hed let you lead his band I know  
Oh Charlie wont you play that thing  
I mean the slide trombone  
Chorus  
Now you aint seen such movin hips  
Like when the trombones to his lips  
Charlie Green play that thing  
I mean the slide trombone  
Oh yeah I mean the slide trombone
