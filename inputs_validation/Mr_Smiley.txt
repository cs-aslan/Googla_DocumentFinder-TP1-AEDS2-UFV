I heard a funny thing about me  
Lately Ive been living on the edge  
I wont say that aint true  
But who the hell are you  
I dont recognize my own face or my friends  
  
Chorus  
Hey Mr Smiley  
Read the writing  
On the wall  
Wake up Mr Smiley  
Before you dont wake  
Up at all up at all  
  
Today I hired me a yes man  
He simply agrees with everything I say  
He does all my dirty deals  
And feeds me my pills  
As long as Im still breathing he gets paid  
  
Chorus  
  
Yesterday I had a conversation  
With all them voices in my head  
One said I was no good  
One said I should quit  
One said to remind myself to get myself a fix  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey Mr Smiley  
And Im feeling ten feet tall  
Bye Mr Smiley  
You got to go now they just called they just called
