All of my memories lay in the life of the highway  
All of my nights in old motels and sleeping alone  
All of my days on the road with no one beside me  
All of my dreams of a place that I can call home  
  
Chorus  
Somewhere in the shade near the sound of a sweet singin river  
Somewhere in the sun where the mountains make love to the sky  
Somewhere to build me a faith a farm and a family  
Somewhere to grow older and somewhere a reason to try  
  
Cause Im tired of big cities and so tired of big city ways  
Scratchin off sunsets and walkin around in the maze  
Some sweet taxi dancers tryin to save me from bein alone  
Ah its much worse than lonely there is no place that I really belong  
I want to be home  
  
Im leavin this city life In my mind Im flyin away  
Im leavin tomorrow and all of the old yesterdays  
Im leavin the trash cans the bright lights the telephone lines  
Im leavin my sorrows and all of my memories behind  
To see what I find  
  
Chorus  
  
Somewhere to grow older somewhere to lay down and die
