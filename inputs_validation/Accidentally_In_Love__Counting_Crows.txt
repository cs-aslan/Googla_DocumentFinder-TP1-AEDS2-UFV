So she said Whats the problem baby  
Whats the problem I dont know  
Well maybe Im in love love  
Think about it everytime  
I think about it  
Cant stop thinkin about it  
  
How much longer will it take to cure this  
Just to cure it cause I cant ignore it if its love love  
Makes me wanna turn around and face me  
But I dont know nothing about love  
  
Come on come on  
Turn a little faster  
Come on come on  
The world will follow after  
Come on come on  
Because everybodys after love  
  
So I said Im a snowball running  
Running down into the spring thats coming all this love  
Melting under blue skies  
Belting out sunlight  
Shimmering love  
  
Well baby I surrender  
To the strawberry ice cream  
Never ever end of all this love  
Well I didnt mean to do it  
But theres no escaping your love  
  
These lines of lightning  
Mean were never alone  
Never alone no no  
  
Come on Come on  
Move a little closer  
Come on Come on  
I want to hear you whisper  
Come on Come on  
Settle down inside my love  
Come on come on  
Jump a little higher  
Come on come on  
If you feel a little lighter  
Come on come on  
We were once  
Upon a time in love  
Were accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love x7  
Accidentally  
Im In Love Im in Love  
Im in Love Im in Love  
Im in Love Im in Love  
Accidentally X 2  
Come on come on  
Spin a little tighter  
Come on come on  
And the worlds a little brighter  
Come on come on  
Just get yourself inside her  
Love Im in love
