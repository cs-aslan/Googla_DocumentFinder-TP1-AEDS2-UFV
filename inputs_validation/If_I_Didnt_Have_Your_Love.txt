If the sun would lose its light  
And we lived an endless night  
And there was nothing left that you could feel  
Thats how it would be  
What my life would seem to me  
If I didnt have your love to make it real  
  
If the stars were all unpinned  
And a cold and bitter wind  
Swallowed up the world without a trace  
Ah well thats where I would be  
What my life would seem to me  
If I couldnt lift the veil and see your face  
And if no leaves were on the tree  
And no water in the sea  
And the break of day had nothing to reveal  
Thats how broken I would be  
What my life would seem to me  
If I didnt have your love to make it real  
If the sun would lose its light  
And we lived in an endless night  
And there was nothing left that you could feel  
If the sea were sand alone  
And the flowers made of stone  
And no one that you hurt could ever heal  
Well thats how broken I would be  
What my life would seem to me  
If I didnt have your love to make it real
