All you seem to do want to do  
Is break my heart  
Seems to me  
Were a lot better off apart  
Time was when you took  
A pride in puttin me down  
Well Ive some news for you  
Thats gonna turn ya around  
  
I got no time for no crazy lady  
And the games you want to play  
Cause a love like mines  
Gonna take some time  
You cant save it for a rainy day  
  
Well l do you know  
Do you know  
Do you know what  
Im trying to say  
Loves not a game  
Its never the same  
You gotta live your love  
From day to day  
  
Lonely days are long and  
Sad nights are so black  
Then I get right down thinkin  
Maybe I could take you back  
Till at mornin light  
A new face appears at my door  
As a kinda reminder that  
I aint seein you no more
