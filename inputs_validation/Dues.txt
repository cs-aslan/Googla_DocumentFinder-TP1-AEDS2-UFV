I think Im headed for a terrible accident  
Made more plans than anyone who ever paid their rent  
Im not stupid and I might be havin too much pride  
Surgeon general has determined that I may as well die  
  
Jesus are you watching or have you gone blind  
Evil souls are upon us and were surely runnin out of time  
  
Chorus  
I tried religion and some holy roller steals my tenth  
In the grave yard I aint strong enough to jump the fence  
Some men they say they got more soul than both my shoes  
Makes me wonder can we ever stop payin dues  
  
I might be workin on a scene that I can never act  
Everybodys gonna think that my mind is cracked  
I dont care because its my right to win or lose  
Makes me wonder can we ever stop payin dues  
  
Crazy am I crazy for wanting so much more  
My mind says I cant ever give up but I still cant be sure  
  
Chorus  
  
Can we ever stop payin dues  
Can we ever stop payin dues  
Can we ever stop payin dues
