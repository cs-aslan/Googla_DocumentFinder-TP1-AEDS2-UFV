Theres a full moon risin  
Comin up behind them cypress trees  
Betty Jo aint wearin nothin round her body  
But a cool night breeze  
Her daddy warned me  
Boy dont come round here no more  
But here I am knockin  
On sweet Bettys door  
Louisiana moon  
Done cast its spell on me  
Yeah  
Louisiana moon  
Makes a man do crazy things  
We slipped off to a place  
In the swamp where nobody goes  
Down by the water  
Where the snakes and the alligators play  
Nobody follows  
Cause theres evil in there  
Uh I aint scared of nothin  
When Im holdin Betty tight  
Louisiana moon  
Done cast its spell on me  
Yeah  
Louisiana moon  
Makes a man do crazy things  
I cant stay away  
Cause I love the thrill  
If the gators dont get me  
Her daddy will  
Louisiana moon  
Done cast its spell on me  
Yeah oh yeah yeah  
Louisiana moon  
Makes a man do crazy things  
Yeah  
Louisiana moon  
Done cast its spell on me  
Yeah  
Louisiana moon  
Makes a man do crazy crazy things  
Oh  
Louisiana moon  
Done cast its spell on me  
Yeah  
Louisiana moon  
Makes a man do crazy crazy crazy crazy things  
Louisiana moon  
Done cast its spell on me
