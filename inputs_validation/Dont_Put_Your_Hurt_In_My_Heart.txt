Dont put your hurt in my heart  
Stop what youre planning before you start  
Yes I loved you once its true but now Im over you  
Dont put your hurt in my heart  
Dont put your burning in my eyes  
Cause the burning only stops when I cry  
Once my teardrops fell like rain washed away the burning flame  
And it washed all your hurt from my heart  
Dont put your sorry in my mind  
Cause its useless and youre only wasting time  
I got over you before I cant chance it anymore  
Dont put your hurt in my heart dont put your hurt in my heart
