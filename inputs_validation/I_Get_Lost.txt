Im sorry  
Why should I say Im sorry  
If I hurt you  
You know youve hurt me too  
  
Chorus  
But you get lost inside your tears  
And there is nothing I can do  
Cause I get lost inside my fear  
That I am nothing without you  
  
Youre angry  
Why shouldnt you be angry  
With what weve been through  
Well I get angry too  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause I am nothing without you  
  
Why should we have taken so long  
To be looking inside of our mind  
Everything we tried went wrong  
Are we worried bout what we might find  
  
Im sorry  
But can I say Im sorry  
If I hurt you  
You know it hurts me too  
  
Chorus  
  
And you get lost inside your tears  
And there is nothing we can do  
Cause I get lost inside my fear  
That I am nothing without you  
  
Cause I am nothing without you  
And I am nothing without you  
Cause I am nothing without you  
Cause I am nothing without you
