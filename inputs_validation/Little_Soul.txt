My little light  
Is going to shine  
Shine out so bright  
And illuminate your mind  
  
My little soul  
Will leave a footprint  
  
This little voice  
Is going to sing  
I have no choice  
It will infinitely ring  
  
My little soul  
Will leave a footprint  
  
Im channeling the universe  
Its focusing its love inside of me  
A Singularity  
  
My little words  
Are going to sting  
Havent you heard  
The pain and joy they bring  
  
My little soul  
Will leave a footprint  
  
Im channeling the universe  
Its focusing its love inside of me  
A singularity  
  
Your little eyes  
Theyre going to see  
I cant disguise  
The beauty inside me  
  
My little soul  
Will leave a footprint
