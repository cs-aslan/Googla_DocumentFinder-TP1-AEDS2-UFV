In lifes many battles that you will have to fight  
Just stay close to Jesus and journey in His light  
Then on that judgment morning when all pain has fled  
Youll stand in Gods Kingdom when the Book Of Life is read  
When the seals are broken and names are read aloud  
Youll see many loved ones standin in the crowd  
So brother keep on prayin and follow where youre lead  
Youll stand in Gods Kingdom when the Book Of Life is read  
All your dreams of heaven will come true on that day  
When the sky shall open and this earth melt away  
Then all Gods faithful children will raise up from the dead  
United in Gods Kingdom when the Book Of Life is read  
What a happy feelin to know Hell always care  
And when our work is over heaven with Him well share  
Theres be no pain or sorrow no tears will ever be shed  
When we stand there in Gods Kingdom and the Book Of Life is read
