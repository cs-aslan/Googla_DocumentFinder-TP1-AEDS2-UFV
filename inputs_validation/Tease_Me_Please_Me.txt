Ive been around the world  
Ive known a lot of girls  
Livin and lovin  
Its hard to keep them all in line  
  
Ive seen a lot of sights  
Many crazy nights  
Cruisin and boozin  
Its a wonder that Im still alive  
  
Never wasted any time  
Never missed a beat  
Total satisfaction  
Always guaranteed  
  
Tease me  
Please me  
No one needs to know  
Tease me  
  
Please me  
Before I have to go  
  
Speed the world around  
The boys are back in town  
Reelin and rockin  
Were rollin with it win or lose  
  
The girls are dressed to kill  
Lookin for a thrill  
Slidin and glidin  
Sometimes they make it hard to choose  
  
I never wasted any time  
Never missed a beat  
Total satisfaction  
Always guaranteed  
  
Tease me  
Please me  
No one needs to know  
Tease me  
  
Please me  
Before I have to go  
Tease me  
Please me  
  
Well take it nice and slow  
Tease me  
Please me  
Just let the feeling grow
