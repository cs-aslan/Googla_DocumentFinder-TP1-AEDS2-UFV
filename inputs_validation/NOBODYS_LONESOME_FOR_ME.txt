Evrybodys lonesome for somebody else  
But nobodys lonesome for me  
Evrybodys thinkin bout somebody else  
But nobody thinks about me  
When the time rolls around for me to lay down and die  
I bet Ill have to go and hire me someone to cry  
Evrybodys lonesome for somebody else  
nobody is lonesome for me  
  
Evrybodys longin for somebody else  
But nobodys lonesome for me  
Evrybodys dreamin about somebody else  
But nobody dreams about me  
All I need is a bride who wants a bighearted groom  
I wouldnt care if she come ridin in on a broom  
Evrybodys lonesome for somebody else  
Nobodody lonesome for me  
  
Evrybodys pinin for somebody else  
But nobodys lonesome for me  
Evrybodys crazy bout somebody else  
But nobodys crazy bout me  
Oh I shined up my shoes and then I slicked down my hair  
Put on my Sunday suit but I aint goin nowhere  
Evrybodys lonesome for somebody else  
But nobodys lonesome for me  
  
Evrybodys yearnin for somebody else  
But nobodys lonesome for me  
Evrybodys fallin for somebody else  
But nobodys fallin for me  
Now I aint had a kiss since I fell out of my crib  
It looks to me like I been cheated out of my rib  
Evrybodys lonesome for somebody else  
Nobodody lonesome for me
