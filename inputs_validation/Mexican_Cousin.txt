Oh tequila I turn to you like a long lost friend  
I want to kiss my Mexican cousin once again  
Well cover every emotion from happiness to sorrow  
And the conversations I forget youll tell me about tomorrow  
When the phone calls start am I in bed or in a hearse  
The things you tell me about myself cant make me feel any worse  
Well Im awful sorry you got pissed  
Just have to cross you off the list  
of my true friends  
And tequilas where that starts and where it ends
