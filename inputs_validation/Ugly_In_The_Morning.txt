You did one thing wrong  
You woke up  
It looked better before  
More more  
  
And the stomach turns  
Say nothing without wasting a word  
I know exactly what you meant  
  
I know how piggy feels  
He starves without missing a meal  
Look in the mirror  
  
Dont look at me  
Im ugly in the morning  
  
When the headache is gone  
The sun is not  
Forgot to turn the alarm  
On on  
  
Doesnt matter how much you think  
Or the number of hairs in the sink  
I did it to myself again  
  
I know how piggy feels  
He starves without missing a meal  
Its getting clearer
