Wherever we go whatever we do  
Were gonna go through it together  
We may not go far but sure as a star  
Wherever we are its together  
Wherever I go I know he goes  
Wherever I go I know she goes  
No fits no fights no feuds and no egos  
Amigos together  
Through thick and through thin all out or all in  
And whether its win place or show  
With you for me and me for you  
Well muddle through whatever we do  
Together wherever we go  
Wherever we go whatever we do  
Were gonna go through it together  
Wherever we sleep if prices are steep  
Well always sleep cheaper together  
Whatever the boat I row you row a duo  
Whatever the row I hoe you hoe a trio  
And any I O U I owe you ohs  
Who meoh No youoh  
No weoh together  
We all take the bow including the cow  
Though business is lousy and slow  
With Herbies vim Louises verve  
Now all we need is someone with nerve  
Together together wherever wherever  
Together wherever together wherever we go  
We go in a group we tour in a troupe  
We land in the soup but we know  
The things we do we do by threes a perfect team  
No this way Louise  
Together together wherever wherever  
Together wherever we go
