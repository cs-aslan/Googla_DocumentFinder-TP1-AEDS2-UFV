Its coming down  
Its coming down  
Its raining outside  
Youve nowhere to hide  
  
Shes asking you why you think its funny  
Its coming down  
Its coming down  
Shes leaving your house  
  
She had to get out  
Shes mad and shell take her mattress with her  
Its coming down  
Its coming down  
  
Its coming down  
Its coming down  
Its coming down  
Its coming down  
  
Its coming down  
Its coming down  
Its coming down  
You lie on the floor  
  
Shes slamming your door  
Shes gone and shes wearing your red sweater  
Its coming down  
Its coming down  
  
Its coming down  
Its coming down  
Its coming down  
Its coming down  
  
Aw no  
Its coming down  
Its coming down  
Its coming down
