Weve got a nice little house on a quiet little street  
But it dont matter  
A two garage with a new Cherokee  
But it dont matter  
  
Chorus  
Cause we dont ever seem to talk anymore  
And you dont hold me like you did before  
Weve got everything we wanted and more  
But now I know and now I see  
Nothing matters if you dont love me  
  
Weve given twelve precious years of our lives  
But it dont matter  
And I guess for awhile we were both satisfied  
But it dont matter  
It wouldnt be easy to walk out tonight  
But it dont matter  
And I know I would miss you if you said goodbye  
But it dont matter
