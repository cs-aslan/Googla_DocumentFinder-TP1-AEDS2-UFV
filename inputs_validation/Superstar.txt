Long ago and oh so far away  
I fell in love with you  
Before the second show  
Your guitar it sounds so sweet and clear  
But youre not really here  
Its just the radio  
Dont you remember you told me  
You loved me baby  
You said youd be coming back this way  
Again baby  
Baby baby baby baby oh baby  
I love you I really do  
Loneliness is such a sad affair  
And I can hardly wait  
To be with you again  
What to say to make you come again  
Come back to me again  
And play your sad guitar
