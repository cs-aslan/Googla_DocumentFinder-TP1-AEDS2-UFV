Yeah I like it  
Ugh Ugh Ugh  
  
Im only five foot one  
I got a pain in my neck  
Im looking up in the city  
What the hell what the heck  
  
I stare at the concrete  
The girders eye high  
The steels above me  
Theres love in my eyes  
  
And Im doing the things  
A five foot one man can do  
  
Im only five foot one  
I got a pain in my heart  
All the night Im working  
In the amusement park  
  
With a bottle of aspirin  
A sack full of jokes  
I wish I could go home  
With all the big folks  
  
And I wish life could be  
Swedish magazines  
I wish life could be  
Swedish magazines  
I wish life could be  
Anything  
  
Im only five foot one  
Unless the time has come  
I wont grow anymore  
Anymore anymore anymore  
  
Till Im losing my head  
Im checkin it twice  
Im gonna find out whos naughty and nice  
  
And Im doing the things a five foot one man can do  
  
I wish life could be Swedish magazines Repeat x3  
I wish life could be  
Yeah I wish life could be  
Oh  
I wish life could be  
  
I wish life could be Swedish magazines  
I wish life could be Swedish magazines  
I wish life could be  
  
I wont grow anymore Repeat x3  
Anymore anymore anymore anymore anymore  
  
Im only five foot one Repeat x3  
Im five foot one
