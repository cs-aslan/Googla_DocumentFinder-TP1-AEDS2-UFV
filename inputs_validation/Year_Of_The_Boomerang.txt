Tha sistas are in so check the front line  
Seems I spent the 80s in the Haiti state of mind  
Cast me into classes for electro shock  
Straight incarcerated the curriculums a cell block  
Im swimmin in half truths and it makes me want to spit  
Instructor come separate the healthy from tha sick  
Ya weigh me on a scale smellin burnt skin  
Its dark now in Dachau and Im screamin from within  
Cause Im cell locked in tha doctrines of tha right  
Enslaved by dogma talk about my birthrights  
Yet at every turn Im runnin into hells gates  
So I grip tha cannon like Fanon an pass tha shells to my classmates  
Aw power to tha people  
Cause tha bosses right ta live is mine ta die  
So Im goin out heavy sorta like Mount Tai  
Wit tha five centuries of penitentiary so let tha guilty hang  
In tha year of tha boomerang  
  
I got no property but yo Im a piece of it  
So let tha guilty hang  
I got no property but yo Im a piece of it  
In the year of tha boomerang  
I got no property but yo Im a piece of it  
So let tha guilty hang  
I got no property but yo Im a piece of it  
In the year of tha boomerang  
  
Yeah  
Now its upon you  
Now its upon you
