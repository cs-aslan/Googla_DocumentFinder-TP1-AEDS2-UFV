One two  
Theres a young girl lost on the edge of town  
Dont see no future its blind  
Dont give up when youre upside down  
You just keep it inside  
  
You know we all cry when were alone  
Someone like you  
And the promise that we wont be  
  
Giving up the ghost  
Giving up the ghost  
Never you and I  
Giving up the ghost  
  
Giving up the ghost  
We can never stop  
Giving up the ghost  
  
Dont be a hero in the name of love  
Dont leave me waiting in line  
No ties that bind no ball and chain  
The ghost is waiting outside  
  
Im searching so high  
Im searching low  
Someone like you  
Baby Im not  
  
Giving up the ghost  
Giving up the ghost  
Never you and I  
Giving up the ghost  
  
Giving up the ghost  
We can never stop  
Giving up the ghost  
  
You know we all cry when we are alone  
Someone like you we know oh  
Im searching so high  
Im searching low  
Someone like you  
We know oh oh oh  
  
Giving up the ghost  
Giving up the ghost  
Never you and I  
Giving up the ghost  
Giving up the ghost
