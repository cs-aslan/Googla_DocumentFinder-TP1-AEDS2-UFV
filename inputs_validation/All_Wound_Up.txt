Youve got me all wound up and ready to go  
Every night when I see your eyes  
You look like no other  
Even though the world has all kinds  
You can find friends and lovers  
  
Chorus  
Where have you been all my life  
Why did you wait so long wait so long  
Ive been lookin every night  
Ill be with you from now on  
Hey hey hey  
Youve got me all wound up and ready to go  
Hey hey hey  
Youve got me all wound up and ready to go  
  
If you feel left out in the crowd  
You are not the only  
You can go where the music is loud  
And you wont be so lonely  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
Hey hey hey  
Youve got me all wound up and ready to go  
Hey hey hey  
Youve got me all wound up and ready to go  
Hey hey hey  
Youve got me all wound up and ready to go  
Ready to go
