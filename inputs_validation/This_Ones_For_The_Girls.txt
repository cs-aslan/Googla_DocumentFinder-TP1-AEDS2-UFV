This ones for the girl that I see at the coffee shop  
Who knows my name and looks so hot  
I always get an extra shot and smile for free

At the bus stop waiting for the 23  
Shes so shy I wish shed notice me

This ones for the girl in the pub sitting next to me  
She spends too much on the fruit machine  
She drinks me under the table every time

Shes not all that but thats okay  
She talks to trees but still she blows my mind

Standing up on the bar shaking this and that  
Even though shes got that big exam at 8
