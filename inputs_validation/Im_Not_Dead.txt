Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Theres all these cracks crack of sunlight  
Crack in the mirror on your lips  
Its the moment of a sunset Friday  
When our conversations twist  
  
Its the fifth day of ice on a new tattoo  
But the ice should be on our heads  
We only spun the wheel to catch ourselves  
So we werent left for death  
  
And I was never looking for approval from anyone but you  
And though this journey is over Ill go back if you ask me to  
  
Im not dead just floating  
Right between the ink of your tattoo  
In the belly of the beast we turned into  
  
Im not scared just changing  
Right beyond the cigarette and the devilish smile  
Youre my crack of sunlight  
  
You can do the math a thousand ways  
But you cant erase the facts  
That others come and others go  
But you always come back  
  
Im a winter flower underground  
Always thirsty for summer rain  
And just like the changing seasons  
I know youll be back again  
  
Im not dead just floating  
Underneath the ink of my tattoo  
Ive tried to hide my scars from you  
  
Im not scared just changing  
Right beyond the cigarette and the devilish smile  
Youre my crack of sunlight oh  
  
Im not dead just yet  
  
Im not dead Im just floating  
Doesnt matter where Im going Ill find you  
  
Im not scared at all  
  
Underneath the cuts and bruises  
Finally gained what no one loses Ill find you  
I will find you  
  
Im not dead just floating  
Im not scared just changing  
Youre my crack of sunlight yeah
