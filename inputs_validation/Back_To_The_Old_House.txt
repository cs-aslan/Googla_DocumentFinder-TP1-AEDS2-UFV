I would rather not go  
Back to the old house  
I would rather not go  
Back to the old house  
Theres too many  
Bad memories  
Too many memories  
There  
There  
There  
When you cycled by  
Here began all my dreams  
The saddest thing Ive ever seen  
And you never knew  
How much I really liked you  
Because I never even told you  
Oh and I meant to  
Are you still there   
Orhave you moved away   
Or have you moved away   
Oh  
I would love to go  
Back to the old house  
But I never will  
I never will  
I never will  
I never will
