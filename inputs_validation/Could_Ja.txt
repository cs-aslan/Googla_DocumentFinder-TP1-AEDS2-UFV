Couldya for an ice cream sundae Couldya for a smile or two  
Wouldya say along about next Monday keep a guy from feeling blue  
Couldya for big red apple Couldya for a tootsie roll  
Wouldya for some Philadelphia truffle brighten up some lonely soul  
I dont wanna have the stars in the pocket or ride a rocket to the moon  
I just want what I want when I see what I want and I hope I get it soon  
Couldya for a peaceful valley Couldya for the Zuyder Zee  
Wouldya for a honeymoon in Bali Couldya fall in love with me  
Baby couldya wouldya take a chance on romance  
Couldya for a ripe tomato Couldya for a place thats in  
Wouldya for a bowl of sweet potato Couldya for a leopard skin  
Couldya for a bright red tulip Couldya for a ferris wheel  
Wouldya for Kentucky plate of juleps Couldya for a home cooked meal  
I dont wanna have the stars in the pocket or ride a rocket to the moon  
I just want what I want when I see what I want hope I get it soon  
Couldya for a peaceful valley Couldya for the Zuyder Zee  
Wouldya for a honeymoon in Bali Wouldya shouldya couldya fall in love
with me
