You were streets ahead I couldnt sleep a wink  
Staring in the dark by the light of your skin  
At myself sitting on a suitcase  
Or as the sleeping youth in the upset sleigh  
  
They dont wait  
They wont wait  
They run with the weather  
They dont wait  
  
Listen you can hear the sound of the sleigh  
The panting of the team of all runners away  
And all the gentle work of the traces  
Their jinglejangle jerk destroying all space  
  
They wont wait  
They dont wait  
They run with the weather  
They dont wait  
They dont wait  
They wont wait  
Just stay together  
They dont wait  
  
Wait wait wait wait  
Please just stay together  
  
They dont wait  
They wont wait  
They run with the weather  
They dont wait  
They dont wait  
They wont wait  
Just stay together  
They dont wait  
  
Wait wait wait wait  
Please just stay together
