Before I was born late one night  
My papa said everythings alright  
The doctor paid when Ma lay down  
With her stomach bouncing all around  
Cause the beebop stork was about to arrive  
Mama gave birth to the handjive  
  
I could barely walk when I milked a cow  
When I was three I pushed a plow  
While chopping wood I moved my legs  
I started dancing when I gathered eggs  
The townfolk clapped I was only five  
Hell out dance em all hes born to handjive  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  everybody  
Born to handjive baby  
Born to handjive baby  
Born to handjive baby oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah  
Born to handjive baby  
Born to handjive baby  
Born to handjive baby oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah  
Born to handjive oh yeah
