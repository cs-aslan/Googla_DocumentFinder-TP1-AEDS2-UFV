Electricity eye to eye  
Hey dont I know you I cant speak  
Stripped my senses on the spot  
Ive never been defenseless  
I cant even make sense of this  
You speak and I dont hear a word  
  
What would happen if we kissed  
Would your tongue slip past my lips  
Would you run away  
Would you stay  
Or would I melt into you  
Mouth to mouth lust to lust  
Spontaneously combust  
  
The room is spinning out of control  
You act like you didnt notice brushed my hand  
Forbidden fruit ring on my finger  
Youre such a moral mortal man  
Would you throw it away No question  
Will I pretend Im innocent  
  
What would happen if we kissed  
Would your tongue slip past my lips  
Would you run away  
Would you stay  
Or would I melt into you  
Mouth to mouth lust to lust  
Spontaneously combust  
What would happen if we kissed  
  
Ahhhh  
Oh  
Ahhhh  
  
I struggle with myself again  
Quickly the wall Im crumbling  
Dont know if I can turn away  
  
What would happen if we kissed  
Would your tongue slip past my lips  
Would you run away  
Would you stay  
Or would I melt into you  
Mouth to mouth  
If we kissed  
Would your tongue slip past my lips  
Would you run away  
Would you stay  
Or would I melt into you  
Mouth to mouth  
If we kissed  
Oehhoh  
If we kissed  
Oehhoh
