Well I hear you downstairs  
Youre foolin around with your fathers brother  
And your mothers gown  
  
All the old heroes keep coming around  
To find you if youre still at home  
  
So you lie in the sun watch your body turn to tan  
Your skin is oiled with the sweat of a man  
  
He bought you a diamond ring girl to wear on your hand  
And baby hes leaving tomorrow  
  
Yeah Ill be with you in your weakest moments uh huh  
Yeah Ill be with you in your weakest moments  
  
You say you remember when it was your world  
And you were Mister Rubys girl  
He gave you dreams and schemes that swirl  
Around your head and your body  
  
And when you drink sometimes you try to liberate  
And you stagger in the front yard till you find the gate  
That swing on that thin line of love and hate  
And baby just let it go  
  
Yeah Ill be with you in your weakest moments uh huh  
Yeah Ill be with you in your weakest moments
