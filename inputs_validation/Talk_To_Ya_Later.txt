I met her on a strip  
It was another lost weekend  
But the band was too slick  
And the people were twisted  
  
So I asked her for a date  
She reluctantly agreed  
Then we went to my place  
And she never did leave  
  
She wont even miss me when shes gone  
And thats okay with me Ill cry later on  
  
Its been six months  
She hasnt shut up once  
Ive tried to explain  
Shes driving me insane  
  
She wont even miss me when shes gone  
Thats okay with me Ill cry later on  
  
Ill talk to ya later  
Dont want to hear it again tonight  
Ill talk to ya later  
Just save it for another guy  
Ill talk to ya later  
Dont want to hear it again tonight  
Ill just see you around  
  
Get out Im telling you now  
Do you catch my drift  
What could be plainer than this  
  
Nothin more to be said  
Write me a letter instead  
I dont mean to be cruel  
But Im finished with you  
  
She wont even miss me when shes gone  
Thats okay with me Ill cry later on  
  
Ill talk to ya later  
Dont want to hear it again tonight  
Ill talk to ya later  
Just save it for another guy  
Ill talk to ya later  
Dont want to hear it again tonight  
Ill just see you around  
  
Ill talk to ya later  
Dont want to hear it again tonight  
Ill talk to ya later  
Just save it for another guy  
Ill talk to ya later  
Dont want to hear it again tonight  
Ill just see you around  
  
Ill talk to ya later  
Dont want to hear it again tonight  
Ill talk to ya later  
Just save it for another guy  
Ill talk to ya later  
Dont want to hear it again tonight
