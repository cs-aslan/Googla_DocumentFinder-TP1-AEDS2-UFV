Feat GLC  
Kanye West  
Heavy hitters fo life heavy hitters fo life  
  
You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit  
Want to be on my album but dont want me on they shit  
Everybody thought I was makin a compilation  
I was really makin myself they competition  
Fresh off the plane from the AllStar game  
Hoes from on TV so its AllStar trains  
Just picture man no snitchin man  
Somethin for the fiends fresh out the kitchen man  
Last 911 I was poor on the ave  
Til I pulled out my map  
Not its course 911 and Im floorin the gas  
Gotta lotta problems but at least one that Annette have no more  
Uh well Dame look at how everybody changed  
Tell Jay that Im bout to change the game  
Tell BIG that we about to get paid  
All my niggas about to have it made  
This makes everything else sound played  
Goddamn Kanye Kanye Kanye  
Now hold up  
Aint nobody messin with me dog  
Now you say it aint nobody messin with you at all  
I told dude You cant even rap on my interlude  
Now does that make me as rude as you  
When the album comin out Man the peoples is askin  
Whyall dont model Adidas just stick with the fashion  
Whyall already got do so just spit for the passion  
The way ya rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks  
And lets not even bring up the tracks man  
Nope nope lets not do that man  
You eatin up the game like PacMan  
He got the whole world shakin just like crack fangs  
  
Chorus Kanye West  
Heavy hitters fo life RocaFella is fo life  
Throw your diamonds up throw your diamonds up  
Throw your diamonds  
  
Let the beat ride out for a minute  
  
GLC Kanye West  
Lets take it there take it there man  
Its not supposed to be  
GLC where you at nigga  
  
How many niggas you know put their life on the line and get signed  
Did a few high crimes almost got lifetime  
After the sunshine you thinkin it might count  
How could I mic out just look at my account  
I used to work at the mall with nothin at all  
Seein niggas that ball that shit was depressin  
Keep my clothes in the cleaners I hate with the pressin  
When I copied hounds it was my best investment  
Dre got shot and it taught me a lesson  
Im stickin niggas up and them rubbery masses  
Mash like Batman minus the tight pants  
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy  
Fo different blues man your outfit is crashin  
You aint got no muscles dude you weakling bastard  
Man look at your haircut  
Mm hmm mm hmm no your hair sucks  
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters  
87 go getters two hoes like John Ritter  
Even did it on his crime picture and ye  
And offers to sell and yell uh  
  
Chorus Kanye West
