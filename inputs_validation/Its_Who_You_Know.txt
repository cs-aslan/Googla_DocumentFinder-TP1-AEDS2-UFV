Baby you look like somebody ooh to know  
Like a rose comin out of a photo  
All your lipstick shows  
I dont want to make you cry  
  
I dont want to even try  
I just want to say I met meet you  
Its who you know  
Oh you can talk to me  
  
Make my life complete  
When I think of the ways I can use you  
Get me off the streets  
Then we spend the night in bed  
  
And I cant loose my head  
Even in lovin its who you know
