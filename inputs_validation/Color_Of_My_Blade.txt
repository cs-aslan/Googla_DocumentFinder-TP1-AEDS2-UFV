The color of my blade is red  
Remember what you said  
Perfection is killing the freaks yeah  
Even as we speak yeah  
Dont you  
Now it was decided the war  
The silence will rise to a shout yeah  
You told us wed see it through  
The practical joker police came  
To knock down doors and to leave blame  
I remember what you told them  
The color of my blade is golden  
They didnt come back anymore  
You shouldve decided to lay it out on the floor  
Be sure to instruct them to leave you  
Cause they no longer would believe you  
Its worthless to you through  
Dont you come back anymore
