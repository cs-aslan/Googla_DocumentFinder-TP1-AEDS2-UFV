My eyes are burning bells are ringing in my ears  
Alarm clocks wailing class bells screaming I cant hear  
A text book madhouse twelve years Im here in a rage  
A juveniles jail and Im here locked up in their cage  
  
Chorus  
School daze school daze Im here doin time  
School daze school daze my age is my crime  
School daze school daze Im here doin time  
School daze school daze Im attending hell high  
  
A blackboard jungle toed the line the rulers made  
A homework hellhouse screams at me make the grade  
Tick tock three oclock Im sitting here and counting off the days  
A fire bell is ringin hell and Id sure love to see it blaze  
Burn it down  
  
Chorus  
  
I pledge no allegiance and I bet  
Theyre gonna drive me crazy yet  
Nobody here is understanding me  
I pledge no allegiance and I bet  
Theyre gonna drive me crazy yet  
Im dying here and trying to get free  
  
Chorus
