Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away  
  
Talking to myself all the way to the station  
Pictures in my head of the final destination all lined up  
all the ones that arent allowed to stay  
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away  
  
Tried to save a place from the cuts and the scratches  
Tried to overcome the complications and the catches  
Nothing ever grows and the sun doesnt shine all day  
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away  
  
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
