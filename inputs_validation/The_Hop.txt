Thinkin bout the night life  
In the ladies powder room  
Brothers like a howlin wolf in the light of the silvery moon  
Joeys like a Pavlos dog when he starts to salivate  
A Hardly man himself is hard to shake his rattle snake  
  
Me I got a brand new babe  
You know something just aint right  
I say yeah yeah  
Cant stop rockin tonight  
  
Hangin at the shopping mall  
With a watchman full of sash  
Leave your smile outside the door  
Cause the kids be kicking ass  
My old boot heels be smokin  
You really got to understand  
Were burning down the town tonight  
When the new shit hits the fan  
  
Me I got a brand new babe  
You know something just aint right  
I say yeah yeah  
Cant stop rockin tonight  
  
Yeah yeah cant stop rockin tonight  
Lyin on your back tonight  
Watch the moon eclipse  
Maybe eatin out tonight  
But ya just aint leavin tips  
So you best watch out what you do  
And who you do it with  
Cause youll be kickin ass tonight  
With the boys in Aerosmith
