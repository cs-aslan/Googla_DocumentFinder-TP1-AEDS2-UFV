From underneath the trees we watch the sky  
Confusing stars for satellites  
I never dreamed that youd be mine  
But here we are were here tonight  
  
Singing Amen Im alive Im alive  
Singing Amen Im alive  
  
If everyone cared and nobody cried  
If everyone loved and nobody lied  
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride  
Then wed see the day when nobody died  
And Im singing  
  
Amen I Amen I Amen I Im alive  
Amen I Amen I Amen I Im alive  
  
And in the air the fireflies  
Our only light in paradise  
Well show the world they were wrong  
And teach them all to sing along  
  
Singing Amen I Im alive Im alive  
Singing Amen I Im alive  
  
If everyone cared and nobody cried  
If everyone loved and nobody lied  
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride  
Then wed see the day when nobody died  
If everyone cared and nobody cried  
If everyone loved and nobody lied  
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride  
Then wed see the day when nobody died  
  
And as we lie beneath the stars  
We realize how small we are  
If they could love like you and me  
Imagine what the world could be  
  
If everyone cared and nobody cried  
If everyone loved and nobody lied  
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride  
Then wed see the day when nobody died  
If everyone cared and nobody cried  
If everyone loved and nobody lied  
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride  
Then wed see the day when nobody died  
  
Then wed see the day wed see the day  
When nobody died  
Then wed see the day wed see the day  
When nobody died  
Then wed see the day when nobody died
