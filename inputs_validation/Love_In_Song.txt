My heart cries out for love  
And all that goes with loving  
Love in song  love in song  
  
My youre so fine  
When love is mine  
I cant go wrong  
Love in song  love in song  
  
I can see the places that  
We used to go to now  
Happiness in the homeland  
  
Happiness in the homeland  
  
My eye cries out  
A tear still born  
Misunderstanding  
Love in song  love in song  
  
I can see the places that  
We used to go to now  
Happiness in the homeland  
  
Happiness in the homeland  
  
My youre so fine  
When love is mine  
I cant go wrong  
Love in song  love in song  love in song
