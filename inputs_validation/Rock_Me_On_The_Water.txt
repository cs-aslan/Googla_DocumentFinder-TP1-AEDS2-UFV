Oh people look around you  
The signs are everywhere  
Youve left it for somebody other than you  
To be the one to care  
Youre lost inside your houses  
Theres no time to find you now  
Your walls are burning  
And your towers are turning  
Im going to leave you here  
And try to get down to the sea somehow  
  
The road is filled with homeless souls  
Every woman child and man  
Who have no idea where they will go  
But theyll help you if they can  
Now everyone must have some thought  
Thats going to pull them through somehow  
Well the fires are raging hotter and hotter  
But the sisters of the sun are going  
To rock me on the water now  
  
Rock me on the water  
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow  
Rock me on the water  
Ill get down to the sea somehow  
  
Oh people look among you  
Its there your hope must lie  
Theres a sea bird above you  
Gliding in one place like Jesus in the sky  
We all must do the best we can  
And then hang on to that Gospel plow  
When my life is over Im going  
To stand before the Father  
But the sisters of the sun are going  
To rock me on the water now  
  
Rock me on the water  
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow  
Rock me on the water maybe Ill remember  
Maybe Ill remember how  
Rock me on the water  
The wind is with me now  
So rock me on the water  
Ill get down to the sea somehow
