I live in a small town    deep in LA  
About five miles north of where the Lakers play  
Everybody heres from someplace else  
Working all together just like Santas elves  
  
Baby Culver me  
And Ill Culver you  
When the streets are shining with the smoggy dew  
When the lights are glowing with the mists of June  
And the whole world is lit up by the Culver Moon  
  
Baby dont worry bout Angelyne  
She aint the prettiest thing Ive ever seen  
Nothing she wears ever fits her right  
And her complexion is just a little too tight  
And the way she looks down from so high above  
Makes me think the poor childs never been in love  
  
Baby Culver me  
And Ill Culver you  
When the streets are shining with the smoggy dew  
When the lights are glowing with the mists of June  
And the whole world is lit up by the Culver Moon  
  
Baby Im going to love you til the stars come down  
Til they park their limos and they walk to town  
Til the LA river overflows its banks  
Til the whole alternative nation bows its knobby head in thanks  
Til the fish are jumping in Ballona Creek  
Til the earth is inherited by the meek  
  
Baby Culver me  
And Ill Culver you  
When the streets are shining with the smoggy dew  
When the lights are glowing with the mists of June  
And the whole world is illuminated by the Culver Moon  
  
Under the rainbow and behind Versailles  
From the aisles of Fedco to the 405  
From MGM to Veterans Park  
Way down at Chippendales fumblin in the dark  
Where the ghostly specter of Howard Hughes  
Hovers in the smoke of a thousand barbeques  
  
Baby Culver me  
And Ill Culver you  
When the streets are shining with the smoggy dew  
When the lights are glowing with the mists of June  
And the whole world is lit up by the Culver Moon
