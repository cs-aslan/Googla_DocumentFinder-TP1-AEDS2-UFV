Lyrics by bernie taupin  
Available on the album breaking hearts  
  
They used to say that boys are tough as nails  
In every way he keeps his heart as guarded as a jail  
Now things have changed I feel so old  
Like any girl could drag my heart across the coals  
  
I was always there in the thick of things  
I always had the heart of every woman on a string  
The danger zone shone from my eyes  
It seemed like every inch I gained became a mile  
  
Its not the night reaching in and touching me  
Its just that breaking hearts aint what it used to be  
It seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me  
And breaking hearts aint what it used to be  
  
Its not the light shining in and catching me  
Its just that breaking hearts aint what it used to be  
But time has come and cast a spell on me  
And breaking hearts aint what it used to be  
  
And now I know what lonely means  
I used to give so little and gain everything  
The darkest part of every day  
Is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away  
  
Cant say I blame them all for being hurt  
After all I treated each and every one like dirt  
Who wants a heart thats never home  
I face the facts and lock myself into a life alone
