I was dancing with a dirty blond Texan  
Charming accent but the musics playing too loud for talking  
So I showed him how people in the Far East get down  
  
Push it up push it down  
Pull it up pull it down  
Keep it up keep it down  
Now put me down  
What a workout  
  
If you want you can come  
Come get it get it  
If you dont you may really regret it gret it  
Up and down till your knees start shakin shakin  
aint it good to be alive tonight  
  
One life twotime three girls four guys  
Five ripples running up and down my spine  
60 Make it sweet drop another dime  
  
I was talking with a bornagain Christian  
So whats it like to start life all over  
He sad Amen  
I feel like Ive been rediscovering the tomb of Tutankhamen  
  
Push it up push it down  
Pull it up pull it down  
Baby dont put me down  
What a workout  
  
What you want its a done deal  
Shake it shake it  
What you dont you can forget about it bout it  
Up and down feel your brainwaves jumpin jumpin  
Makes me want to take a dive  
  
As we count to five  
  
One life twotime three girls four guys  
Five ripples running up and down my spine  
  
Can you hold on someones calling on the other line  
  
Push it up push it down  
Pull it up pull it down  
Keep it up keep it down  
Now put me down  
What a workout  
  
If you want you can come  
Come get it get it  
If you dont you may really regret it gret it  
Up and down till your knees start shakin shakin  
Aint it good to be alive tonight  
  
One life twotime three girls four guys  
Five ripples running up and down my spine  
60 Make it sweet drop another dime
