Like the Seminole  
Navajo  
Kickapoo  
Like those Indians  
Im an Indian  
Too  
A Sioux uhu  a Sioux uhu  
  
Just like battle axe  
Hatchet face  
Eagle nose  
Like those Indians  
Im an Inidan  
Too  
A Sioux uhu  
A Sioux uhu  
  
Some Indian summers day without a sound  
I may hide away with Big Chief on the ground  
  
Ill have totem poles  
Tomahawks  
Small papoos  
Which will go to prove  
Im an Indian  
Too  
  
With my chief in his tipi  
Well raise an Indian family  
And Ill be busy night and day  
Looking like a flour sack  
With two papooses on my back  
And three papooses on the way  
  
Im an Inidan  
Too  
  
Some Indians summers day  
Withou a care  
I may run away with Bigchiefs Son of a Bear  
And Ill wear moccasins  
Wompan beads  
Feather hats  
Which will go to prove  
Im an Indian  
Too  
A Sioux uhu  
A Sioux uhu
