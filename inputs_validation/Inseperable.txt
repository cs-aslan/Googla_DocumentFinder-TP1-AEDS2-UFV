Inseperable Thats how well always be  
Inseperable Just you and me  
Its so wonderful to know youll always be around  
Incredible What you are to me  
Incredible You bring out the woman in me  
With your style of love  
Inseperable Yes we are  
Well like a flower to a tree  
Like words to a melody of love  
Theres no way we could break up  
No words that can make us  
Blow our thing Were just  
Inseperable Thats how it is  
Inseperable For the rest of our years  
Its so wonderful to know youll always be around
