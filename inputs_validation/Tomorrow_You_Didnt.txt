Its a forgone conclusion youre loves an illusion  
And the picture is starting to fade  
Boy lets be honest when it comes to your promise  
Its just a lot of empty words you say  
And the futures only gonna be more of the same  
Youve only got yourself to blame  
  
Chorus  
Tomorrow you didnt yesterday you wont  
Cause I know everything you say you gonna do you dont  
Thats a given it doesnt matter anyway  
Hey I know what love wasnt I know what love isnt  
So when you say youre gonna change you gotta be kidding  
Tomorrow you didnt  
Hey hey Im outta here today  
  
I used to believe in all your romantic dreaming  
But it really aint that cute anymore  
Cause my times to precious  
So I wish you the best with  
Whatever it is youre looking for  
Baby this is all for your own good  
Im leaving cause I know you never would  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont need a crystalball to see it all my dear  
It doesnt matter what you say  
It always turns out the same way  
Your predictions are fiction  
And its tragically clear  
  
Guitar solo  
  
Chorus  
  
Dadada Yea
