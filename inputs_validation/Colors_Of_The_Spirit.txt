We are one we are one  
Distant rhythm in a troubled sky  
Angry clouds divide the sun  
Feels like thunder and so do I  
Bloody silence has begun  
Flying like a wounded dove  
  
Tomorrow comes undone  
Surrender dont come easily  
We try to get over over  
Falling together together  
  
Many colors of the spirit  
Many lives below the sun  
We are colors of the spirit  
We are many we are one  
  
Ask the question whats goin on  
Why raging children run  
Wheres the fathers legacy  
Wheres the harvest of the son  
Close your eyes and tell me what you see  
I see the same thing same thing  
  
Many colors of the spirit  
Many lives below the sun  
We are colors of the spirit  
We are many we are one  
No surrender dont come easily  
We try to get over over  
  
Many colors of the spirit  
Many lives below the sun  
We are colors of the spirit  
We are many we are one  
We are many we are one
