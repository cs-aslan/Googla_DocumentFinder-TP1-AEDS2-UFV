On the east side thats where I met my Ramona  
I wanna go to a party Thats what she said  
Lonely thats what Ive been heres my telephone number call me  
And to a party a house party  
Whole loop a people just rally around me  
And love she send a message of love  
She said I love up the way you move I love the way you rap  
Ramona please step back  
Now shes my Ruca Im barely waiting for my Heina  
She moved from Long Beach down to LA  
Right now shes selling oranges by the freeway  
I wanna know Ramona am I the only one Tell me  
And she said Youre not the only one but your the best Bradley  
Now Im waiting for my Ruca  
And I barely pulled up with my Heina  
I know tonight Ill be behind her  
And I barely pulled up with my Heina
