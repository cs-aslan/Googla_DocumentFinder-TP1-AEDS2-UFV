Texas are you my friend you live so close to the end  
Texas are you my friend cause Im afraid of you  
Hey Maine hey youre a little too high for me  
And Fla youre just a little too low  
DC you could be the end of me  
I think Im movin to Idaho  
I aint afraid of you  
  
Oh people on the outside lookin in  
Mother Nature shakes what then what then  
Oh people on the outside lookin through  
Shell shake you to Idaho thats what shell do  
Oh oh Carolina Brothers you make me crawl under the covers  
I just cant get myself to go oh no  
Hey Joe I see your name too but there is nothin that they can do  
I think Im movin to Idaho  
I aint afraid of you  
  
Oh people on the outside lookin in  
Mother Nature shakes what then what then  
Oh people on the outside lookin through  
Shell shake you to Idaho thats what shell do
