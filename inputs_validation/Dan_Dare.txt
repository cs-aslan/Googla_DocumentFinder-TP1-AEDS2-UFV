Can you tell me how old Dan might have done it  
If hed been here now Holy cow  
My stars might have been read on the planet Mars  
Cause I dont have foresight to see  
If we still be together in the twenty first  
In the twenty first century Incomprehensible  
Hes our flyin ace pilot of the future  
In an endless space holy cow  
My eyes never saw a rocket that was quite that size  
Cause I dont have the energy  
To be cat and mouse for the champions  
For the champions of destiny oh no  
So long Captain Dan  
I fail to see what motivates your hands  
Goodbye restless night  
You know I loved Dan Dare  
But I couldnt make his flight  
So long so long yeah  
Dan Dare doesnt know it  
He doesnt know it he doesnt know it  
But I liked the Mekon  
So long Captain Dan  
I fail to see what motivates your hands  
Goodbye restless night  
You know I loved Dan Dare  
But I couldnt make his flight  
So long so long  
Dan Dare doesnt know it  
He doesnt know it he doesnt know it  
But I liked the Mekon  
Dan Dare doesnt know it  
He doesnt know it he doesnt know it  
But I liked the Mekon  
Dan Dare doesnt know it  
Doesnt know it doesnt know it  
But I liked the Mekon  
Dan Dare doesnt know it  
No he doesnt know it no he doesnt know it  
No he doesnt know it but I liked the Mekon  
Dan Dare doesnt know it  
No he doesnt know it no he doesnt know it  
No he doesnt know it  
Dan Dare doesnt know it  
No he doesnt know it no he doesnt know it  
No he doesnt know it
