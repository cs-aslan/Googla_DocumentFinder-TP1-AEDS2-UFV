Last time I saw her it was turnin colder  
But that was years ago  
Last I heard she had moved to Boulder  
But where shes now I dont know  
But theres somethin bout this time of year  
That spins my head around  
Takes me back makes me wonder  
What shes doin now  
  
Cause what shes doin now is tearin me apart  
Fillin up my mind and emptyin my heart  
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows  
And I wonder if she knows what shes doin now  
  
Just for laughs I dialed her old number  
But no one knew her name  
Hung up the phone sat there and wondered  
If shed ever done the same  
I took a walk in the evenin wind  
To clear my head somehow  
But tonight I lie here thinkin  
What she doin now  
  
Cause what shes doin now is tearin me apart  
Fillin up my mind and emptying my heart  
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows  
And I wonder if she knows  
  
What shes doin now is tearin me apart  
Fillin up my mind and emptying my heart  
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows  
And I wonder if she knows what shes doin now
