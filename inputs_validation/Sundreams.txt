She stood out just like a diamond lady  
Amongst the tourists in a crowded room  
I took her walking on the sandy beaches  
Under a silk Carribean moon  
Thats when she proimsed that  
And I promised this  
And til this day I can still picture it  
She took my hand  
And I took her kiss  
So temporary the moments of bliss  
  
Some Dreams just fade away  
Like yesterdays sunset  
Some Dreams are made to stay  
Shes one dream Ill never forget  
  
Everyday just seemed to go to quickly  
And every night just passed us in a blur  
I never noticed the blue skies and waters  
Becuase I only had eyes for here  
And so when she promised that  
And I promised this  
And to this day I can still picture it  
She took my hand  
And I took her kiss  
So temporary those moments of bliss  
  
Some Dreams just fade away  
Like yesterdays sunset  
Some Dreams are made to stay  
Shes one dream Ill never forget  
  
Roll back  
Those crazy summer days  
Stroll back  
Ill find you through the haze  
  
Some Dreams just fade away  
Like yesterdays sunset  
Some Dreams are made to stay  
Shes one dream Ill never forget  
Some Dreams just fade away  
Like yesterdays sunset  
Some Dreams are made to stay  
Shes one dream Ill never forget
