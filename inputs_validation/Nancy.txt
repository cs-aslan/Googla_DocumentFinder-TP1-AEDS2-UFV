Ohoh  
  
Walking in the midnight rain  
Thought I heard a southbound train  
Call your name  
Nancy  
  
Walking in the rain all day  
Guess there wasnt nobody goin my way  
They didnt stop at all  
But I will get back to you if I have to crawl  
  
Nancy I told you in my letter  
Things didnt appear to be no better at all  
And this ol highways a hell of a line  
Nancy I just spent my last dime to make this call  
Oh Nancy  
Ill get back to you if I have to crawl  
Oh yeah  
  
solo  
  
Oh yeah mmmmm  
  
I left my home for a job in the city  
Its a crying shame  
Its a pity  
It aint livin at all  
Nobody knows my name  
They dont even give a thang about me tall  
Nancy  
Baby Im getting back to you if I have to crawl  
Ohh  
  
Nancy I told you in my letter  
Things didnt appear to be no better at all  
This ol highways a hell of a line  
Nancy I just spent my last dime to make this call  
Nancy  
Baby Ill get back to you if I have to crawl  
Oh yeah yeah oh oh  
Oh Nancy  
Oh Nancy
