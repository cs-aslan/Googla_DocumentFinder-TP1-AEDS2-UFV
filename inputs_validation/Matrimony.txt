Well Im saving this dress for my wedding day  
Momma wouldnt have it any other way  
She says when she married  
Her waist was twenty three  
  
I guess Ill never wear it anyway  
I dont believe I care to marry  
Though I cannot explain exactly why  
It somehow seems to me  
  
Matrimony is misery  
Simply a faster way to die  
Im saving all my money for my wedding day  
You know my momma wouldnt have it any other way  
  
She says when she married  
She didnt have a dime  
But I guess Ill spend that money some other way  
Because I dont believe I care to marry  
  
Although I cannot explain exactly why  
It somehow seems to me  
That matrimony is misery  
Simply a faster way to die  
  
Well Im saving my best thing for my wedding day  
Because my poppa wouldnt have it any other way  
He says if I lose it early  
Ill have thrown my life away  
  
But I swear Ill use my cherry my own way  
I dont believe I care to marry  
Though I cannot explain exactly why  
It somehow seems to me  
  
Matrimony is misery  
Simply a faster way to die
