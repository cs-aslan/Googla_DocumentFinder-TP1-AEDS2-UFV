High tide  
In the cool of the mist  
Walking in the shadows of the trade ships  
Ill be your baby  
I will not be your man  
I will not be around when you call  
Oh Daddy  
Ill be Daddys little girl  
Black water  
The warm summer rain  
Washes your tears in to the big snake  
Into the ocean  
And your skin is so white under harbour light  
Should you fall Ill be your baby  
Say Ill be daddys little girl  
Oh Daddy  
Im all alone now  
Hush little baby  
Dont you cry  
I will sing you a lullaby  
Its high tide  
In the still of your room  
And the big snakes a crawling  
Through the smoke and perfume  
To be your baby  
I will not be your man  
I will be around when you fall  
Ill be your baby  
Ill be Daddys little girl  
Say it be my Daddy  
Ill be Daddys little girl  
Oh Daddy  
Were all alone now  
Wont you be my Daddy  
Were all alone now
