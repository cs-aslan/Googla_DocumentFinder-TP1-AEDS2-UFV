If youre tired of sinnin take your Saviours hand  
Theres a mansion worth winnin in the great Promised Land  
Many doubters are grinnin dont you slip and fall  
If you miss heaven youll miss it all  
If you miss heaven youll miss it all  
For me to reach heaven Id gladly crawl  
The smallest and weakest who love him are tall  
If you miss heaven youll miss it all  
 steel   
Our loving Saviour gave us a second birth  
And his salvation frees us from the sorrows of earth  
Forever with Jesus makes life seem so small  
If you miss heaven youll miss it all  
If you miss heaven youll miss it all
