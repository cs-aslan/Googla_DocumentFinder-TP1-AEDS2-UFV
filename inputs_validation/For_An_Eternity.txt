What does it to keep us together  
We love so strong its like dying  
Then we fight so hard we end up crying  
Who are you that I cant let you go  
  
ChorusWhy dont we let peace live between us and give ourselves a chance  
To  
Live in the largeness of love  
  
You fill me with ecstasy until  
You leave me craving your will  
When will you end this up and down  
Ive had enough of looking for you upptown  
  
Chorus  
  
I need you as a babe needs a mothers caress  
Your heart to me is like an act of theft  
Without your heart I am left bereft  
Give me all you have now I need you boy  
Chorus For all eternity you will be mine Ill go to battle for what  
Belongs  
To me What troubles have I caused you to deserve this There is no one who  
  
Will love you like me Chorus
