I know you like it hot  
Love to writhe and sweat  
You think that this feels good  
You aint felt nothin yet  
  
Redhot licks in the palm of my hand  
Feel your body quake  
As we hit the promised land  
Im heavy duty  
  
Well rise inside ya till the power  
splits your head  
Were gonna rock ya till your metal  
Hungers fed  
  
Lets all join forces  
Rule with iron hand  
And prove to all the world  
Metal rules the land  
Were heavy duty  
So come on lets tell the world  
  
We are defenders of the faith
