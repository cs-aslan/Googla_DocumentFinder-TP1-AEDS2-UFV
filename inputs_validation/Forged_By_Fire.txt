It was hard for him to get out of bed  
When the phone rang sleepeyed she said  
Charlies drunk again  
Why dont you just let it ring  
Through the years hed always picked it up  
For the guy who came back and saved his butt  
What they have in common is a brotherhood  
So few could understand  
  
Chorus  
They were forged by fire  
Hard times you get beyond  
Gives you an unbreakable bond  
Forged by fire  
When you pray to god bet the odds  
And walk through hell together  
Youre forever  
Forged by fire  
  
The young GI said from his VA bed  
Why you wanna hang out with us broken men  
When you could be spending your time with your family and friends  
He told him son youre family too  
I see myself when I look at you  
In a place and time you dont forget  
And even tho weve just met  
  
Chorus  
  
He said goodbye GI see you next week  
Then he rolled himself out to the street  
It was pretty hard for him to get his van  
And throw the wheelchair in the back  
He was headed home ready to unwind  
Charlie called can you help me one more time  
He said Chuck Ill be there on the double  
For a brother its no trouble  
  
Chorus
