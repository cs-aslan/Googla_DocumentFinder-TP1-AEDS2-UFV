Its Christmas at ground zero  
Theres music in the air  
The sleigh bells are ringing and the carolers are singing  
While the air raid sirens blare  
Its Christmas at ground zero  
The button has been pressed  
The radio just let us know that this is not a test  
Everywhere the atom bombs are dropping  
Its the end of all humanity  
No more time for last minute shopping  
Its time to face your final destiny  
Its Christmas at ground zero  
Theres panic in the crowd  
While we dodge debris lets trim the tree  
Underneath the mushroom cloud  
  
You might hear some reindeer on your rooftop  
Or Jack Frost on your windowsill  
But if someones climbing down your chimney  
You better load your gun and shoot to kill  
Its Christmas at ground zero  
And if the radiation levels OK  
Ill go out with you and see all the new  
Mutations on New Years Day  
Its Christmas at ground zero  
Just seconds left to go  
Ill duck and cover with my Yuletide lover  
Underneath the mistletoe  
Its Christmas at ground zero  
Now the missiles are on their way  
What a crazy fluke were gonna get nuked  
On this jolly holiday  
What a crazy fluke were gonna get nuked  
On this jolly holiday
