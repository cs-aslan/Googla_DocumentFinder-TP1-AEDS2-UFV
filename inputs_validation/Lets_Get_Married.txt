Weve been going together  
Too long to be vague  
When theres something to say  
If its not now then its never  
So Ill say it straight out  
Cause I have no doubt no doubt  
  
Lets get married  
I love you and I want to stay with you  
Lets get married  
Have kids and grow old and grey with you  
Lets get married  
Hold hands walk in the park  
You can get a cat as long as it barks  
  
We know other people  
Who drifted apart  
Who broke each others hearts  
But we aint other people  
So well do things our way  
Were gonna be okay  
Were gonna be more than okay  
  
Lets get married  
Were ready for tying the knot  
Lets get married  
Set the seal on the feelings weve got  
Lets get married  
We can make each other happy or we can make each other blue  
Yeah its just a piece of paper but it it says I love you  
For the good times  
For the days when we can do no wrong  
For the bad times  
For the moments when we think we cant go on  
For the family  
For the lives of the children that weve planned  
Lets get married  
Cmon darlin please take my hand  
  
And Ill be the one  
Whos by your side  
Ill be the one  
Still taking pride  
When were old if they ask me  
How do you define success  
Ill say You meet a woman  
You fall in love  
You ask her and  
She says Yes  
  
Lets get married  
I love and I want to stay with you  
Lets get married  
Have kids and grow old and grey with you  
Lets get married  
Hold hands when we walk in the park  
All right you can get a cat just as long as it barks  
For the good times  
For the days when we can do no wrong  
For the bad times  
For the moments when we think we cant go on  
For the family  
For the lives of the children that weve planned  
Lets get married
