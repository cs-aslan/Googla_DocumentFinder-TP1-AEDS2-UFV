Somebody calls me on the phone  
Say heyhey is DeeDee home  
You want to take a walk  
You want to go cop  
You want to go get some Chinese Rock  
  
Im livin on a Chinese Rock  
All my best things are in hock  
Im livin on a Chinese rock  
Everything is in the pawn shop  
  
The plaster fallin of the wall  
My girlfriend cryin in the shower  
Stall  
Its hot as a bitch  
I shouldve been rich  
But Im just diggin a Chinese ditch
