Why did I show my hand  
Now you know your wish  
Is my command  
I never longed for things I didnt have  
But thats no longer true  
Since I laid eyes on you  
  
I know Im not the same  
I dont need a fortune  
Dont care about fame  
But my soul is a burning flame  
Cant sleep the whole night through  
Since I laid eyes on you  
  
I want your sweet caress  
I dream of your tenderness  
Oh I never ever felt like this  
I swear  
Look what youve done for me  
Oh boy its poetry  
When I see the wind in your hair  
  
The tears well up inside  
Oh what will turn the tide  
And Ive been waiting for you to decide  
That you love me too  
Since I laid eyes on you  
  
What else could I do  
Since I laid eyes on you  
  
You you you you  
On you  
Oh yeah  
Since I laid eyes  
On you you you
