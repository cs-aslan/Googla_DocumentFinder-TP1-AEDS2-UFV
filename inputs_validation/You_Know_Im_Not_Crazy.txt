Say your mind has an overload  
Your heart beats rhythm  
Hot and cold  
Your stature has a naked bucks  
When youre near  
Youre not like us  
  
Chorus  
You know Im not crazy  
You know Im not crazy  
  
I caught on to the way you smile  
Love could only last a while  
I couldnt love  
I couldnt touch  
The situation  
Was too much  
  
Chorus  
  
Your love fails me  
Your love it fails me  
Your love fails me  
Your love it drives me crazy  
  
Dont tell me that lovers always mistrust  
The lies in your eyes  
The death in your lust  
Its more than distraction  
You touch you feel  
Our hearts dance apart  
And you say this is real  
You know Im not crazy  
  
Talk about the love we feel  
The passion that our hearts conceal  
Kiss and run  
The fools we trust  
Love inside a blinding lust  
  
Chorus  
  
Hold me to my every word  
Forget about the things you heard  
Time will conquer  
Time will state  
We owe every tear to fate  
  
Chorus  
  
Your love fails me  
Your love it fails me  
Your love fails me  
Your love it drives me crazy
