You just could not know how long we tried  
To see how this building looks inside  
This must be a lucky day for me  
Because the sign says theres a vacancy  
Look I know you came a long way  
But you made it just too late  
So we had to give it to somebody else  
Well I talked to you on the phone less than fifteen minutes ago  
And you told me that it was cool  
I graduated from Howard U  
My job is paying good money too  
And if you check on my resume  
Youll find they all wanted me to stay  
  
Well I cant take the time out  
To check your credit card  
Cause the computer just broke down today  
Well Ill stop by here tomorrow to complete our interview  
But I know what youre gonna say  
I know what your bottom line is  
  
You might have the cash but you  
Cannot cash in your face  
We dont want you living in here  
Say you might have the cash but you  
Cannot cash in your face  
We dont want your kind living in here  
Toooo toooo too bad  
Toooo toooo too sad  
  
Our first child is due here any day  
Thats why were desperate for a place to stay  
The location is so perfect too  
So please try to do what you can do  
  
Well in this apartment complex no children are allowed  
And if you told me that I could have saved you a lot of time  
Well I thought the Bill was passed that said you could not discriminate  
But I know some excuse youll find  
Because your bottom line is  
  
You might have the cash but you  
Cannot cash in your face  
We dont want you living in here  
Say you might have the cash but you  
Cannot cash in your face  
We dont want your kind living in here  
Aye you might be a great doctor  
You might be a great lawyer  
You might possess the key to the city  
Or maybe a politician  
You might have the cash but you  
Cannot cash in your face  
We dont want you living in here  
Say you might have the cash but you  
Cannot cash in your face  
We dont want your kind living in here
