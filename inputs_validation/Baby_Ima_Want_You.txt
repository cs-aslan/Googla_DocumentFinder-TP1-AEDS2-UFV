Baby Im awant you  
Baby Im aneed you  
  
Youre the only one  
I care enough to hurt about  
Lately Im a crazy but I just cant live  
Without your lovin and affection  
  
Givin me direction like a guiding light  
To help me through my darkest hours  
Lately Im aprayin that youll  
Always be a stayin beside me  
  
Used to be my life was  
Just emotions passing by  
Feeling all the while  
But never really knowing why  
  
Baby Im awant you  
Baby Im aneed you  
  
Youre the only one  
I care enough to hurt about  
Lately Im a prayin that youll  
Always be a stayin beside me  
  
Use to be my life was  
Just emotions passing by  
Feeling all the while  
But never really knowing why  
  
Baby Im awant you and  
Baby Im aneed you  
Baby Im awant you and  
Baby Im aneed you
