Well Im down in the alley of Sally and Im feeling my way  
And its four in the morning I dont have a lot I can say  
I know Im looking for some satisfaction  
But there aint much news  
Got some walking from a back reaction  
Im hanging down and loose  
  
Me and the boys have been drinking  
Feeling like this is the wrong time for thinking  
All I can say is Im doing fine with just me and my wine  
  
Now my brain and my body are runnin on different rails  
And I died and just say hi what if all else fails  
Oh I woke up in a subway station  
Lying half dead on the floor  
I dont remember anything  
What happened the night before  
  
Oh me and the boys have been drinking  
Feeling like this is the wrong time for thinking  
All I can say is Im doing fine with just me and my wine  
  
Now listen  
My hairs a real mess I feel and look like a joke  
And theres a hole in my jeans I just ran right out of smokes  
You know Id like to get to know you  
But I aint got the time  
Im finding it harder and harder  
To make this damn thing rhyme  
  
Just me and my wine  
Well just me and my wine  
You know that Im doing fine  
Well just me and my wine  
Thank you
