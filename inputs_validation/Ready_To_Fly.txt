Ive been trying to open the door  
To the secret of my destiny  
And every new road I think is the one  
Seems to lead right back to me  
  
Ive looked for a way to be wiser  
A way to be strong  
Now I see the answer was hiding  
In me all along  
  
Chorus  
And Im ready to fly  
Over the sun  
Like a rocket to heaven  
And Im ready to soar  
Right through the sky  
Never dreamed Id find something to lift me so high  
Ive always had wings  
But I wasnt ready to fly  
  
Restless hopeless and misunderstood  
Like so many others I know  
So busy tryin to keep holdin on  
When I shouldve been letting go  
  
I was given the gift to find it  
The spirit inside me  
But I never really imagined  
All I could be  
  
Chorus  
  
The answer to all of my wonder  
Was right in my hands  
Now its time for me to discover  
All that I am  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive always had wings  
Now Im finally ready to fly
