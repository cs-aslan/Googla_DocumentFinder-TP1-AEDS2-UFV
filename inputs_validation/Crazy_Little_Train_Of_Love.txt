I never saw the world lookin so bright  
Never saw the wheels turnin so right  
And Im glad to be ridin  
This crazy little train of love  
  
Im just like a kid on a merrygoround  
Im so high in the clouds I hope I never come down  
And Im glad that Im ridin  
This crazy little train of love  
  
Our train dont carry the blues  
No room for hurtin or any bad news  
Our train is just loaded with love  
Just you and I and thats enough  
  
It just keeps achuggin on down the track  
Were so in love we dont want to look back  
Arent you glad that were ridin  
This crazy little train of love  
  
I see our destination just over the hill  
Cozy little place that they call Arborsville  
Arent you glad to be ridin  
This crazy little train of love  
  
The wheels sing the song as they roll down the track  
They seem to say I love you with each clicketyclack  
Arent you glad that were ridin  
This crazy little train of love  
  
Our train dont carry the blues  
No room for hurtin or any bad news  
Our train is just loaded with love  
Just you and I and thats enough  
  
It just keeps achuggin on down the track  
Were so in love we dont want to look back  
Arent you glad that were ridin  
This crazy little train of love
