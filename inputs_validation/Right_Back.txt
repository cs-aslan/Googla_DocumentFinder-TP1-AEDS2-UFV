Sleepin by yourself at night can make you feel alone  
Your girlfriend said so but I dont really know  
That dont mean we fucked around that night last week when you left town  
  
I was tweakin by myself one night thats when I wrote this tune  
Didnt have no need for that bed in my hotel room  
Sometimes right now since Ive left the pen  
I feel like Im right back there again  
  
Sometimes I pray waiting waiting for some bright holiday  
So I bought myself a gun and Im right back right back where Im from  
  
Sleepin by yourself at night can make you feel alone  
My girlfriend said so shes a little ho  
That dont mean I fuck around I like to keep that higher ground  
  
Sometimes I pray waiting waiting for some bright holiday  
So I bought myself a gun and Im right back right back where Im from  
Dont tease me dont tease me dont tease  
Sometimes I pray waiting waiting for some bright holiday  
So I bought myself a gun and Im right back right back where Im from
