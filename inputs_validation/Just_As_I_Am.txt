Ive had a lot of big dreams  
Ive made a lot of bad moves  
I know you could walk away  
But you never do  
  
Ive met a lot of cold hearts  
Ive learned to smile and deceive  
I know Im hard to be around  
But you never leave  
  
Im not easy to understand  
But you hold out your hand  
  
And you say you love me  
Just as I am  
You always treat me  
The best that you can  
You say you want me need me  
Love me baby  
Just as I am just as I am  
  
Ive made a lot of heartaches  
Ive found a lot of closed doors  
When all the others turn away  
You love me more  
You love me more  
  
Im not easy to understand  
But you hold out your hand  
  
And you say you love me  
Just as I am  
You always treat me  
The best that you can  
You say you want me need me  
Love me baby  
Just as I am just as I am  
  
I want to love forever  
To keep our world together  
And be the best that I can be  
Baby every time the world  
Caves in on me  
  
And you say  
Just as I am  
You always treat me  
The best that you can  
You say you want me need me  
Love me baby  
Just as I am just as I am
