Never say never  
Keep both your eyes on the flame  
The power that lies within you  
Comes forth once again  
  
Onward through darkness  
Envisions the diamonds beyond  
Through burning deceit and corruption  
The dream still lives on  
  
And youre standing there  
Raise your hands  
Split the air tonight  
Action call to arms  
  
Im fighting for eternity  
For honor for grace and for glory  
Immortality  
Layer by layer  
  
By mortar by rampart by stone  
A fortress a haven for love  
I can call my own  
And youre standing there  
  
Raise your hands  
Split the air  
And dream for tomorrow  
Take my hand well be free  
  
Ancient kingdoms in the sunset  
In the darkness of our years  
Never fade  
And youre standing there  
  
Raise your hands  
Split the air  
And dream for tomorrow  
Take my hands cross the sea  
  
Rainbow castles in the distance  
Emerald sands beckon me  
Come to me come to me  
Heed the voice that is calling  
  
Come to me come to me  
For thy kingdom  
Awaits your crowning  
Come to me
