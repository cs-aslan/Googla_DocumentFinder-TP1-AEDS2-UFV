Turn out the lights and close the door  
Put your head on the pillow  
Let me keep you warm  
I want to run my hands across your face  
Lyin beside you is still the perfect place  
Were still going strong  
So glad that you came along  
  
Babe in every way  
Youre still beautiful to me  
I just have to say  
Youre still beautiful to me  
  
Lay back baby and close your eyes  
Let me do everything your heart desires  
When I think of the years making love to you  
There still aint nothing that Id rather do  
Theres something I cant deny  
You sure know how to move this guy  
  
Babe in every way  
Youre still beautiful to me  
I just have to say  
Youre still beautiful to me  
  
And it still feels good  
It still feels good  
It still runs deep  
When you get close babe  
I still get weak  
Cause in these arms is where you belong  
Were still going strong  
So glad that you came along  
Hey babe youre still number one  
Baby cant you see  
  
Youre still beautiful to me  
Youll always be so beautiful to me
