Yeah like father like son  
Got joey crack ridin with us this time  
I smell murder you know  
Birdman sponsor this one  
And I got em  
  
Look  
Young desperado straight out the grotto  
Im so bad my shadow chooses not to follow  
Little nigga but see me as a fuckin rhino  
Lil Weezy hit this bitch like Rocky Marciano  
Its a drought aint it  
How the fuck would I know  
Nigga I been gettin my Cher  
Like Sonny Bono  
I ran the streets check my bio  
I started high wit two Os just like Ohio  
Im fuckin nuts cashews  
But Im so DC like fat shoes  
I skate away like later dudes  
Never get caught baby Im mashed potato smooth  
And just when it stopped I made it move  
Respect me nigga Im a dog no Asian food  
I wet up the party so have a bathin suit  
And daisy dukes you bitch ass nigga  
  
Chorus  
Keep talkin that shit that you talkin  
And we gon have to get into some gangsta shit  
My nigga keep talkin that shit that you talkin  
And we gon have to get into some gangsta shit  
My nigga Cause you aint really even bout all that  
You aint really even bout all that  
And dontcha forget  
I know ya you aint bout all that  
You aint never been about all that fall back  
  
Niggas must want Joey to lean on em  
Flash the blinky splash his dreams on em  
Let em sleep on it its nothin to Crack  
Lay the murder game down back to hustlin packs  
Yeah Weezy homies got yo back whether raps or macks  
Either way they both spit like brrat  
Nigga them mufuckas is broke like them levies  
And we done sold so much dope aint shit you tell me  
Nigga how you want it  coke or dog food  
My shitll have you runnin naked like in old school  
And yeah we bout it bout it and you aint ridin on me  
Unless ya got a whole fuckin suicidal army  
And Im a rider homie  
And you can find it on me  
That forty calll get you shirt picture ironed on it

Poppin bottles fuckin wit them bitches nigga

Chillin Im in the streets hustlin gettin money nigga  
Changed all my new shoes nigga got some new tools  
Nigga got some mo jewels we was gettin money
