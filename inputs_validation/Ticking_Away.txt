Clock on the wall keeps ticking away  
Ive got to go but Id love to stay  
Yo Ive been walkin round in the streets of these cities  
Ive flipped a few whiskies Ive rode a few kitties  
I made a few dollars I bought a few bottles  
I popped a few collars then rocked a few models  
Ive pushed a few buttons left all you cats guessing  
Its  Garcia bia who you stressin  
Im  bout to drop blessings  
I had to kill Whitey word to the almighty  
Im tailormade and Im customfitted  
Cant none of yall cats do it like I did it  
I might come sing it I might come spit it  
And if you want to take it try to come get it  
Youll get your wig splitted get your grill busted  
Im crazy like the Beastie Boys were still dusted  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking away  
A tick tock and you dont stop  
Ive got to go but Id love to stay  
A tock tick and you dont quit hit it  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking away  
A tick tock and you dont stop  
Ive got to go but Id love to stay  
A tock tick and you dont quit hit it  
Yo off the dummys instrumental I spit heavy metal  
Never been from the ghetto keep it mad fundamental  
Became a night devil  rebel  
Add some bass add some treble pump up my level  
Cause mad motherfuckers done bit my steeze  
And the game has got biters like dogs got fleas  
And all you dick riders get up off your knees  
Drinkers turn your bottles up smokers burn your trees  
Learn your A be sees mind your Ps and Qs  
Fuck around get shot up wind up on the news  
Yo its  Garcia he a singin the blues  
Rockin shiney jewels and some brand new shoes  
I love my mama cause she aint raised no fools  
My golden rule is stay holdin the tool  
What you doing to your peoples comes back on you  
Dont know when the grim reaper wants to rendezvous  
Its like  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking away  
A tick tock and you dont stop  
Ive got to go but Id love to stay  
A tock tick and you dont quit hit it  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking away  
A tick tock and you dont stop  
Ive got to go but Id love to stay  
A tock tick and you dont quit hit it  
I hear mad motherfuckers say theyre ready to die  
Acting like they dont care but I swear they lie  
Tell you now if they had to look death in the eye  
They beg and they plead and they scream and they cry  
When the reaper calls you all will fall  
You all will fall when the reaper calls  
When the reaper calls you all will fall  
You all will fall when the reaper calls  
I hear a lot of motherfuckers say they down for the kill  
Most of them are just clowns but they swear they will  
Spend a lot of time being down keepin it real  
But I pay more attention to the ones that keep still  
You all will fall when the reaper calls  
When the reaper calls you all will fall  
You all will fall when the reaper calls  
When the reaper calls you all will fall  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking away  
A tick tock and you dont stop  
Ive got to go but Id love to stay  
A tock tick and you dont quit hit it  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking away  
A tick tock and you dont stop  
Ive got to go but Id love to stay  
A tock tick and you dont quit hit it
