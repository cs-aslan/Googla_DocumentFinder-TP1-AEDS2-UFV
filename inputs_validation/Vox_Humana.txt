Early mornin lookin tired and worn  
And lookin out for the enemy  
You made all the way to Hudson Bay  
But youre right back here with me  
Tryin to run away  
Your lips are sealed  
  
A runaway  
So tell me baby  
What youre wantin me to do  
Givin my love to you  
Mama dont you know  
Now youre livin like a runaway  
Sunday dawn you met a Gypsy woman  
On a road to Tennessee  
She told you a lot about the world to come  
But did she tell you  
Why you couldnt tell me  
Like a runaway  
How one by one you run away  
Now tell me baby  
What you want me to do  
Givin all my love to you  
Mama dont you know  
  
Its gonna be a hard leavin  
Youre gonna need a strong reason  
Cause I aint gonna start believin  
That youre out of my life  
You bet you better do your fast talkin  
Before you do your last walkin  
Its gonna be a hard hard leavin talk to me  
Vox humana  
I wanta feel the power of speech  
Vox humana  
Sounds so right so real to me  
Vox humana  
You gotta say  
What you oughtta say  
Dont try to run away  
Darlin Im lettin you know
