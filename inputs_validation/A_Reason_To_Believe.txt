If I listened long enough to you  
Id find a way to believe that its all true  
Knowing that you lied straightfaced while I cried  
Still Id look to find a reason to believe  
  
Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else  
Someone like you makes it easy to give never think of myself  
  
If I gave you time to change my mind  
Id find a way to leave the past behind  
Knowing that you lied straightfaced while I cried  
Still Id look to find a reason to believe  
  
Chorus  
Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else  
Someone like you makes it easy to give never think of myself  
Someone like you makes it hard to think about somebody else  
  
If I listened long enough to you  
Id find a way to believe that its all true  
Id find a reason a reason to believe oh no  
And though I want you youre just not what I need  
  
Chorus  
Someone like you like you  
Id find a reason to believe  
I would find a reason to believe
