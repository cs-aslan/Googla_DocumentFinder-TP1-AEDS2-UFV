When youre a boy  
Some days are tough  
Lying on your bed  
Playing punk rock and stuff  
Home is a boot camp  
You gotta escape  
Want to go and wander  
In the tickertape  
You feel the deals is real  
Youre a New York City boy  
So young so run  
Into New York City  
  
New York City boy  
Youll never have a bored day  
Cause youre a New York  
City boy  
Where Seventh Avenue  
Meets Broadway  
  
The street is amazing  
The hoochies unreal  
Check out all the hardware  
At the latest deal  
Hear a song  
Thats the bomb  
If you dont get the mix  
Its gone eightysix  
You feel the deal is real  
Youre in New York City  
  
New York City boy  
Youll never have a bored day  
Cause youre a New York  
City boy  
Where Seventh Avenue  
Meets Broadway  
New York City boy  
This is your reward day  
Cause youre a New York  
City boy  
Where Seventh Avenue  
Meets Broadway  
  
Then as the evening falls  
You can return its calls  
  
You feel the deal is real  
Youre a New York City boy  
So young so run  
Into New York City
