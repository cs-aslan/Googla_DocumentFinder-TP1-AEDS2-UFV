I should have know there was someone else  
Down below I always kept it to myself  
Now I believe in nothing  
Not today as I move myself out of your sight  
Ill be sleeping by myself tonight  
  
I could never go with no one else  
The hurt dont show but who knows time will tell  
Now I believe in nothing but the pain  
And I cant see this turning out right  
Oh Ill be sleeping by myself tonight  
  
Forever be sad and lonely  
Forever never be the same  
Oh I close my eyes and wait for a sign  
Am I just waiting in vain  
  
Oh I close my eyes and wait for a sign  
Am I just waiting in vain  
  
Oh I believe in love and disaster  
Sometimes the two are just the same  
Im beginning to see  
Whats left of me is gonna have to be free to survive  
  
Oh Ill be sleeping by myself tonight  
  
I believe in nothing but the pain  
And I cant see this turning out right  
Oh Ill be sleeping by myself  
Ill be sleeping by myself  
Ill be sleeping by myself tonight
