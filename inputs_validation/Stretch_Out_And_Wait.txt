All the lies that you make up  
Whats at the back of your mind  
Oh your face I can see  
And its desperately kind  
But whats at the back of your mind  
  
Two icycold hands conducting the way  
Its the Eskimo blood in my veins  
Amid concrete and clay  
And general decay  
Nature must still find a way  
So ignore all the codes of the day  
Let your juvenile impulses sway  
This way and that way  
This way that way  
God how sex implores you  
To let yourself lose yourself  
  
Stretch out and wait  
Stretch out and wait  
Let your puny body lie down lie down  
As we lie you say  
As we lie you say  
Stretch out and  
Stretch out and wait  
Stretch out and wait  
Let your puny body lie down lie down  
  
As we lie you say   
Will the world end in the night time  
I really dont know  
Or will the world end in the day time  
I really dont know  
And is there any point ever having children  
Oh I dont know  
All I do know is were here and its now  
  
Sostretch out and wait  
Stretch out and wait  
There is no debate no debate no debate  
How can you consciously contemplate  
When theres no debate no debate  
Stretch out and wait  
Stretch out and wait  
Stretch out and wait  
Wait  
Wait  
Wait  
Wait  
Oh
