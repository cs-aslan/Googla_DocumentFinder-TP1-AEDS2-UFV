I believe you  
When you say that you will reach into the sky  
And steal a star so you can put it on my finger  
I believe you  
Baby I believe you  
  
I believe you  
When you say that every time that we make love  
Will be the first time weve made love  
And every act of love will please you  
Baby I believe you  
  
Blind faith makes me follow you  
Id live in a cave if you wanted to  
Just ask me and Ill marry you  
You dont have to sell me  
Cause you overwhelm me  
Ive made up my mind for a life time  
I believe you  
When you swear your love will keep on growin strong  
And that forever isnt long enough to love me like you need to  
Baby I believe you  
Baby I believe you  
Honey I love you  
  
Blind faith makes me follow you  
Id live in a cave if you wanted to  
Just ask me and Ill marry you  
You dont have to sell me  
Cause you overwhelm me  
Ive made up my mind for a life time  
I believe you  
When you swear your love will keep on growin strong  
And that forever isnt long enough to love me like you need to  
Baby I believe you  
Baby I believe you  
Honey I love you  
  
I believe you  
When you say youll fill my body with your soul  
And love will grow into a freckled little girl  
Who looks like we do  
Baby I believe you  
Baby I believe you
