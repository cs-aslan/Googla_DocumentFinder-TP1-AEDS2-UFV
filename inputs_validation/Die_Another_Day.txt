The madness creeping up on me  
The pressures building I foresee  
  
Slowly escaping  
This wreckage in making  
So dont look back for me  
  
Sometimes we take it all  
Nothing stands in our way  
We have to fight and crawl  
To die another day  
Die another day x2  
  
Misery often misleads  
It creates things we can not see  
Excessive thoughts unbound  
Distorting reality  
  
Slowly escaping  
This carnage in making  
So dont look back for me  
  
Sometimes we take it all  
Nothing stands in our way  
We have to fight and crawl  
To die another day  
Die another day x4  
  
Hello  
Are you there  
How come  
Wont you listen  
I really dont care x2  
  
Slowly escaping  
This wreckage in making  
Nothing will be the same  
So dont look back for me  
  
Sometimes we take it all  
Nothing stands in our way  
We have to fight and crawl  
To die another day  
Sometimes we take it all  
Nothing stands in our way  
We have to fight and crawl  
To die another day
