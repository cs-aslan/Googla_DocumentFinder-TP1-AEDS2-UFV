Late one night on a road in Texas  
I pulled into an allnight cafe  
Whats my pleasure Well maam the fact is I dont know  
  
Sat down next to a Rajun Cajun  
A black haired beauty from New Orleans  
Did my duty can I buy you a drink dear  
She said Please  
  
So we rolled right along  
And the night got long  
So I said how would you like it to be  
  
Then she sang her song  
Said If I come along  
You must find a place in your heart for me  
  
I was lost on a road to nowhere  
And asked if she was goin my way  
She was late for a date with no one  
So please dont leave  
  
Shed just left a love that was dying  
And had no plans of goin back  
I caught her eyes as she was crying  
Lets make tracks  
  
She said Ill follow  Ill follow you on your dare  
Your eyes say something your heart better care  
Youre lost and youre lonely Ive been to long there  
So Ill follow Ill follow youanywhere
