Late at night Ill be knocking  
On your door  
Late tonight Ill be calling  
You can be sure  
Ill be waiting  
Standin in the shadows once again  
Sneakin creepin  
Howling like a tom cat once again  
  
Oh therell be nowhere  
You can hide  
When I take you  
On the other side of midnight  
  
You know I dont love you  
But I love what you can do  
Some more of that hot persuasion  
This time its  just like you  
  
Oh therell be nowhere  
You can hide  
When I take you  
On the other side of midnight  
Ill be knockin  
The other side of midnight  
Ill be callin  
The other side of midnight  
Knock knockin  
The other side of midnight

At midnight at midnight

On your door

You can be sure

Oh its gonna hurt so good
