And I feel I feel a deep connection  
And I think that we might be onto somethin no  
And I know its somethin special  
Seein you here is not coincidental mhmm  
  
Well Ive been walkin walkin behind enemy lines  
And Ive been fightin fightin from the other side  
Ive been sayin sayin that I wont fall this time  
But now Im walkin walkin within enemy lines  
  
Ooh oh  
  
See I was tryin to be everything you werent expecting  
All I ever wanted was to try and keep you guessing  
But Im falling way too fast  
I just want this love to last forever forever  
And every time I feel this way  
Oh somethings changed for the better  
Whoa whoa whoa ooh  
  
And Ive been walkin walkin behind enemy lines  
And Ive been fightin fightin from the other side  
Ive been sayin sayin that I wont fall this time  
But now Im walkin walkin within enemy lines  
  
And now Im walkin walkin behind enemy lines  
And now Im fightin fightin from the other side  
Ive been sayin sayin I wont fall this time  
Now Im walkin walkin within enemy lines
