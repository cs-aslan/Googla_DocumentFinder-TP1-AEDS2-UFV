Working for the devil  
Youll have to pay his tax  
That means going to see him  
Down among the racks  
You do his work so fine  
Hell remember you  
  
Worried for my friend  
As he shows me round the flat  
Where I dont want to find him  
His lips an eyelids black  
He dont believe my speech  
That lines can and should be drawn  
Like if he had a shotgun  
The barrels would be sawn  
  
Swallowed by the river  
Swollen by the rains  
That leakin ol computer  
Of fingerprints and names  
Swimming in the river  
That floods the neighborhood  
I would call to you  
But it would do no good  
  
Voting for the law  
Thats the general occupation  
First comes the public safety  
Second comes the nation  
You wont believe me now  
But theres been some illumination  
The wisest cops have realized  
They fucked the operation  
  
Cooking up the books  
A respected occupation  
The anchor and foundation of multicorporations  
They dont believe in crime  
They dont know that it exists  
But to understand  
Whats right and wrong  
The lawyers work in shifts  
  
N speaking of the devil  
He aint been seen for years  
Cept every twenty minutes  
He zooms between me ears  
I dont believe in books  
But I read all the time  
For ciphers to the riddles  
An reasons to the rhymes
