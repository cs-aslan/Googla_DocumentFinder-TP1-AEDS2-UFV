In the morning I awake  
I feel my bladder about to break  
I scratch my balls I rub my eyes  
Just feeling lousy  
  
My girlfriend tells me that  
Its time to take a bath  
I say No not today its only Tuesday  
  
Once every 24 hours  
Im supposed to take a shower  
Thats not the way I do it  
Do it do it  
  
Personal hygiene is the last thing on my mind  
I dont want to do it  
Do it do it  
  
It doesnt make a difference to me  
Everyday I do the same old thing  
So why should I have to be clean  
  
Those dreaded Wednesdays and Saturdays  
Also known as shower days  
I hate them
