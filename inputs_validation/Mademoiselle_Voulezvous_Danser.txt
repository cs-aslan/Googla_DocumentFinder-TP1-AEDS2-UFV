Madamoiselle voulezvous danser  
Take my hand dont turn away  
Youve been sitting there all night long  
I know that something must be wrong  
  
Madamoiselle voulezvous danser  
A new moon has come out to play  
Take my hand step outside  
These doors and windows open wide  
  
The stars are out and shining hear the south wind sighing  
Itll be okay  
Let the breeze caress you  
Violin undress your heart  
On va danser  
  
Madamoiselle voulezvous danser  
It will soon be the break of day  
We all have so little time  
Oh wont you put your hand in mine  
  
The stars are out and shining hear the south wind sighing  
Itll be okay  
Let the breeze caress you  
Violin undress your heart  
I swear on va danser  
  
Madamoiselle voulezvous danser  
A new moon has come out to play  
Madamoiselle voulezvous danser  
It will soon be the break of day  
On va danser  
On va danser  
  
Madamoiselle voulezvous danser  
Madamoiselle voulez vous danser  
Danser  
We all have so little time
