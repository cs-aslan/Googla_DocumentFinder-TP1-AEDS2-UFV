What a beautiful noise  
Comin up from the street  
Got a beautiful sound  
Its got a beautiful beat  
  
Its a beautiful noise  
Goin on everywhere  
Like the clicketyclack  
Of a train on a track  
Its got a rhythm to spare  
  
Its a beautiful noise  
And its sound that I love  
And its fit me as well  
As a hand in a glove  
Yes it does yes it does  
  
What a beautiful noise  
Comin up from the park  
Its the song of the kids  
And it plays until dark  
  
Its the song of the cars  
On their furious flights  
But theres even romance  
In the way that they dance  
To beat of the lights  
  
Its a beautiful noise  
And its a sound that I love  
And it makes me feel good  
Like a hand in a glove  
Yes it does yes it does  
What a beautiful noise  
  
Its a beautiful noise  
Made of joy an of strife  
Like a symphony played  
By a passing parade  
Its the music of life  
  
What a beautiful noise  
Comin up to my room  
And its beggin for me  
Just to give it a tune
