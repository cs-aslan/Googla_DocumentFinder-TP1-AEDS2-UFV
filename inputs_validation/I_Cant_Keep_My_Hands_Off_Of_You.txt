You know I cant stand to be around you cause you know Im still in love with
you  
And my arms keep reaching to do what my thoughts do all the time  
I just cant keep my hands off of you  
Cause its like looking at heaven while Im standing in hell  
We shared something precious for a while  
You look just like a baby in a cradle to me I just cant keep my hands off of
you  
Woman youve got the man inside my body trembling the way only you know how to  
And I guess thats just one of a million reasons I just cant keep my hands
off of you  
Cause its like looking at heaven
