Frosted window panes  
Candles gleaming inside  
Painted candy canes on the tree  
  
Santas on his way  
Hes filled his sleigh with things  
Things for you and for me  
  
Its that time of year  
When the world falls in love  
Every song you hear seems to say  
  
Merry Christmas  
May your New Years dreams come true  
And this song of mine  
In three quarter time  
Wishes you and yours  
The same thing too  
  
Frosted window panes  
See them gleaming  
Candles gleaming inside  
Painted candy canes on the tree  
Just look and youll see  
  
Santas on his way  
Thats why sleigh bells are ringing  
Hes filled his sleigh  
And thats why were all singing  
With things  
Things for you and for me  
  
Its that time of year  
Time for falling  
When the world falls in love  
So in love  
Every song you hear seems to say  
  
Merry Christmas  
May your New Years dreams come true  
And this song of mine  
In three quarter time  
Wishes you and yours  
The same thing too
