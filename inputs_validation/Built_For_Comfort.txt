Some folks built like this  
Some folks built like that  
Way you move you aint talkin back  
Im built for comfort aint built for speed  
Got everything all you good girls need  
Dont need no diamond dont need no gold  
Got a lot of love and got a whole lot of soul  
Im built for comfort aint built for speed  
But I got everything all you good girls need  
I dont need no diamond dont need no gold  
Got a lot of love and got a whole lot of soul  
Im built for comfort I aint built for speed  
But I got everything all you good girls need
