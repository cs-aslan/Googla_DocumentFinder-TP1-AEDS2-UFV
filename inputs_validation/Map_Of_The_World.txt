Watching the people on the street today she couldnt help but smile  
Watchin the town go walking by all shaded eyes and alibis  
Strange how much pain you can hide away beneath a wellcut suit  
This is the day she walks away  
  
And the lights of the city pushin a good time  
Asking her out tonight  
But shes saving her money for a better life  
  
Shes got a map of the world  
Pinned up on her wall  
Shes got a map of the world  
Shes gonna go and see it all  
Shes gonna see it all  
  
Watchin the people on the street today  
Such a lonely sight  
Swore she could see their dreams go by  
All cars and stars and buy buy buy  
Runnin on empty Runnin to stand still  
No time for their own lives  
Sleepwalking through the danger signs  
  
And it feels a little scary  
A little runaway  
Letting go of all shes done  
And the lights of the city well theyre all singin  
Buy some of this cmon  
But when you lie to yourself  
You lie to everyone  
  
Shes got a map of the world  
Pinned up on her wall  
Shes got a map of the world  
Shes gonna go and see it all  
Shes gonna see it all  
  
Shell empty the sand from her shoes  
In Paradise  
Sail out across the bay  
Shell dance under an island sky  
Until the break of day  
  
Shes got a map of the world  
Pinned up on her wall  
Its such a beautiful world  
Glistening and magical  
  
Shes got a map of the world  
Shining away in her mind  
Colouringin her life  
This is the day she walks  
Shes gonna see it all  
Shes gonna breathe it all  
Paris London New York  
Shes gonna see it all
