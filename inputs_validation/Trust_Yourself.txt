Olivia NewtonJohn  
I need to tell the truth  
I cant lie anymore  
I need to do whats right  
I know thats what my life is for  
I cant be quiet anymore  
About what Im suppose to do  
I need to tell the truth  
And do whats right by you  
I need to speak my mind  
And let my heart run free  
Your pain will heal with time  
And one day youll thank me  
And as I follow my dream  
And there is no room for you  
Just know there was no scheme  
Its just what I had to do  
Trust yourselfyou know all the answers  
Trust yourselfyou know what is right  
Trust yourselftheyre all there inside you  
Theyve been there foreverjust show them some light  
Sometimes the truth brings pain  
But broken dreams regrow  
Not in the same old way  
But change is life you know  
And as I move on  
To start my song anew  
Please understand my need  
To do what I have to do  
Trust yourselfyou know all the answers  
Trust yourselfyou know what is right  
Trust yourselftheyre all there inside you  
Theyve been there foreverjust show them some light  
And as life goes on  
Can we still be friends  
Dont let this circumstance  
Cause our friendship to end  
Trust yourselfyou know all the answers  
Trust yourselfyou know what is right  
Trust yourselftheyre all there inside you  
Theyve been there foreverjust show them some light  
I need to tell you the truth  
I need to speak my mind  
Sometimes the truth brings pain  
Your pain will heal in time
