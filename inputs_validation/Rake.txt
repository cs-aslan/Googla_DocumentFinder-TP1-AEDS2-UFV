I used to wake and run with the moon  
I lived like a rake and a young man  
I covered my lovers with flowers and wounds  
My laughter the devil would frighten  
The sun she would come and beat me back down  
But every cruel day had its nightfall  
Id welcome the stars with wine and guitars  
Full of fire and forgetful  
  
My body was sharp the dark air clean  
And outrage my joyful companion  
Whisperin women how sweet did they seem  
Kneelin for me to command them  
And time was like water but I was the sea  
Id have never noticed it passin  
Except for the turnin of night into day  
And the turnin of day into cursin  
  
You look at me now and dont think I dont know  
What all your eyes are a sayin  
Does he want us to believe these ravings and lies  
Theyre just tricks that his brains been a playin  
A lover of women he cant hardly stand  
He trembles hes bent and hes broken  
Ive fallen its true but I say unto you  
Hold your tongues until after Ive spoken  
  
I was takin my pride in the pleasures Id known  
I laughed and thought Id be forgiven  
But my laughter turned round eyes blazing and  
Said my friend were holdin a wedding  
I buried my face but it spoke once again  
The night to the day were a bindin  
And now the dark air is like fire on my skin  
And even the moonlight is blinding
