Love Knows I Love You  
  
You make me say it 25 times a day  
You make me feel you dont believe the words I say  
What is a man to do to prove his love for you  
You make me feel like Im just givin free love away  
  
I can send flowers tomorrow  
But it doesnt mean a thing  
If your heart rejects the message from mine  
Its a waste of time  
  
Baby love knows I love you  
Baby love knows the truth  
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you  
  
Yeah I look at you and know I never loved anyone more  
You make me feel like a child in a candy store  
What can I do to prove  
That youre a dream come true  
And in this dream theres a pulse from my heart to you  
I can send daisies daily  
But it never will penetrate  
If your heart if rejects the best from mine  
Its a waste of time  
  
Baby love knows I love you I really do  
Baby love knows the truth  
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you I really do babe  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you  
  
Baby Im lookin for cupid  
Can I tie him in a ball and chain  
To see if he can say to you  
The words that make you feel my love is real oh  
  
Baby love knows I love you  
Thats right you know I love you baby girl  
Baby love knows the truth  
Hey gotta know the truth you know I love you  
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here  
Resting in my heart  
In my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you  
Yeah thats right  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you yeah
