Why youre up in here starting drama  
Cutey got the bottie with a curve like coma  
We can disappear MIA until tomorrow  
We can gone  
Feels like I should be throwin hundred dollar bills when you pass me  
You know whats on my mind girl you dont got to ask me  
I dont need no digits I aint tryin do no math  
I just wanna get gonee  
  
Chorus  
  
I got you baby girl  
So you can relax  
The way you do that  
Girl the way you move that  
You know Im on a mission  
I aint tryin get missin  
Im trying to get lost  
Lose all ya girlfriend you came with  
Cause I aint gotta side of homies where Im going girl  
We can go A A A A A WOL WOL WOL WOL WOL  
Turn up the phone  
Girl you dont need it  
Nobody is coming  
Gil we can go AWOL  
  
I love the way you fit in Dolce and Gabanna  
It makes me wanna get behind it  
 and just get love  
I got the mister Money  
Im your super and your doctor  
We can light it up and go like a rocket  
Blow in the wind we dont need nobody watching

Chorus
