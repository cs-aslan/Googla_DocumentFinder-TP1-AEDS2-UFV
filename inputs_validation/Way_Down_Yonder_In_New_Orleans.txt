Way down yonder in New Orleans  
In the land of the dreamy scenes  
Theres a Garden of Eden  
You know what I mean  
  
Creole babies with flashin eyes  
Softly whisper their tender sighs then stop  
Wont you give your lady fair a little smile  
Stop ya bet your life youll linger there a little while  
  
Weve got heaven right here on earth  
With those beautiful queens  
Way down yonder in New Orleans  
  
Youre gonna find heaven right here on earth  
With all them beautiful queens  
Way down yonder in New Orleans  
Im goin down yonder to New Orleans  
Its way down yonder in New Orleans
