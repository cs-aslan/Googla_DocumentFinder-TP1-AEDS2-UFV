Theres something about the look in your eyes  
Something I noticed when the light was just right  
It reminded me twice that I was alive  
And it reminded me that youre so worth the fight  
  
My biggest fear will be the rescue of me  
Strange how it turns out that way yeah  
Could you show me dear  
Something Im not seeing  
Something infinitely interesting  
Could you show me dear  
Something Im not seeing  
Something infinitely interesting  
  
theres something about the way you move  
I see your mouth in slow motion when you sing  
Like suddenly something someone contrives  
Your movements echo that I have seen the real thing  
  
Your biggest fear will be the rescue of you  
Strange how it turns out that way yeah  
Could you show me dear  
Something Im not seeing  
Something infinitely interesting  
Could you show me dear  
Something Im not seeing  
Something infinitely interesting
