When a good thing goes bad its not the end of the world  
Its just the end of a world that you had with one girl  
And shes the reason it happened but shes overreacting  
And its all because she dont want things to change  
  
Chorus  
So cry if you need to but I cant stay to watch you  
Thats the wrong thing to do  
Touch if you need to but I cant stay to hold you  
Thats the wrong thing to do  
Talk if you need to but I cant stay to hear you  
Thats the wrong thing to do  
Cause youll say you love me and Ill end up lying  
And say I love you too  
  
But I need someone different  
You know it oh ho you know it  
Oh ho you know it we both know it  
I need someone different  
You know it oh ho you know it  
Oh ho you know it we both know it  
Somethings been missing  
You know it oh ho she knows it  
Oh ho I know it we all know it  
I need someone different oh ho oh ho  
  
We live in a generation of not being in love and not being together  
But we sure make it feel like were together  
Cause were scared to see each other with somebody else  
  
Chorus  
  
But I need someone different  
You know it oh ho you know it  
Oh ho you know it we both know it  
I need someone different  
You know it oh ho you know it  
Oh ho you know it we both know it  
Somethings been missing  
You know it oh ho she knows it  
Oh ho I know it we all know it  
I need someone different Oh ho oh ho
