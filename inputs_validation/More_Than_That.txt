I can see that youve been crying  
You cant hide it with a lie  
Whats the use in you denying  
That what you have is wrong  
I heard him promise you forever  
But forevers come and gone  
Baby he would say whatever  
It takes to keep you blind  
To the truth between the lines oh  
  
Chorus  
I will love you more than that  
I wont say the words  
Then take them back  
Dont give loneliness a chance  
Baby listen to me when I say  
  
I will love you more than that  
  
Baby you deserve much better  
Whats the use in holding on  
Dont you see its now or never  
Cause I just cant be friends  
Baby knowing in the end that  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres not a day that passes by  
I dont wonder why we havent tried  
Its not too late to change your mind  
So take my hand dont say goodbye  
  
I will love you more than that  
I wont say the words  
Then take them back  
  
Chorus  
  
I will love you more than that  
  
Chorus  
  
I will love you more than that
