Ive seen the old man sittin round  
The courthouse square back home in town  
Talking bout the big war back in 1943  
Sayin how much good its done  
  
Medals gleamin in the sun  
Cussin at my long hair  
And my talk of bein free  
Their vision like their battle scars  
  
Of other wars has faded  
Like the colors on the ribbons  
From the battles that theyve won  
If theres one thing Ive learned its this  
  
You just cant shake hands with a fist  
And I once did my talkin with a gun  
And old man I know what youve seen  
But yours is not the only dream  
  
I have to believe in something more  
Than yesterday  
Let it die just like the past  
I believe theres hope at last  
  
Old man did you ever have to pray  
Old man can you show me the way  
  
He shakes his head from time to time  
And rambles somewhere in his mind  
Mumbling bout the Civil War  
And how we should have won  
  
Settin up his battle plans  
On checkerboards at his command  
Watchin all his gallant kings  
Go falling one by one  
  
And son hed say theres not much time  
For you to straighten out your mind  
But you never listen to  
The things I try to say  
  
And I just turn my head and cry  
Never understanding why  
Hes set up that checkerboard  
When he knew I couldnt play
