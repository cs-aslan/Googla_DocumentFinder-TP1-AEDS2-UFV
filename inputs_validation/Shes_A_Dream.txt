Oh

Oh no  
Yeah  
  
Shorty aint got cable  
She aint even got a radio way more than able  
What kinda girl should I take her for  
The perfect kind just what I like  
Exactly what I had in my mind a dream  
Shes a dream yeah  
  
Shorty dont know Im on the red carpet almost every night  
And when Im outta town to go and do work  
Im first class every flight  
If she takes the time to open her eyes  
She can realize that shes a dream  
Cause she knows me  
  
Cause Shorty dont know who I am she dont know Im a celebrity  
Cause when I let her meet my fam aint nobody mention my pedigree  
Cause every time I take her out we always in the VIP  
But Shorty dont know who I am but she knows me  
Thats why I make her say ooh  
Make her say ah  
Make her say ooh  
Make her say ah  
  
Shorty dont know who I am  
  
And Im cool with that if she says so  
I aint even got a lot to her  
And when Im out making pesos  
Aint nobody treat her like I do her  
Cause Im the one that she thinks about  
The only one on her mind  
Shes a dream  
Cause she knows me  
And Shorty dont know that Im on the stage  
Like three or four times a week  
She dont even know Ive been around the world  
And all the different girls I meet  
But theres just one face that I see  
Shes the only one for me  
Shes a dream  
Cause she knows me  
  
Cuase Shorty dont know who I am she dont know Im a celebrity  
Cause when I let her meet my fam aint nobody mention my pedigree  
Cause every time I take her out we always in the VIP  
Shorty dont know who I am but she knows me  
Thats why I make her say ooh  
Make her say ah  
Make her say ooh  
Make her say ah  
Shes a dream  
  
See shorty dont know who I am  
Thats not good for us cause I know  
Its not good to fuss  
And I know she loves me for me  
And I love her for her  
But It wouldnt work if she ever gave  
A damn bout who I am but she knows me  
  
She dont know Im a celebrity  
Cause when I let her meet my fam aint nobody mention my pedigree  
Cause every time I take her out we always in the VIP  
Shorty dont know who I am but she knows me  
Oh  
Make her say ah  
Make her say ooh  
Make her say ah  
  
Bout me  
Shes a dream
