When I think of all of the things Hes doin for me  
It makes me stand in wonder at what Hes making me to be  
Tryin to walk through straight but getting turned around  
Always makin my Master take a backseat and wait around  
But I praise the Lord for giving me  
A brand new start each day  
And I praise His blessed name  
For guiding me all along the way  
If He didnt I wouldnt even try  
Well maybe you cant see a change  
You know these things can take time  
But now that Ive found Jesus  
Well Hes given me peace of mind  
Now every days just a chance  
To grow closer to Him  
I may not win all the battles  
But its a victory in Him  
So I praise the Lord for giving me  
A brand new start each day  
And I praise His blessed name  
For guiding me all along the way  
If He didnt I would surely die
