Bend over I command you  
Turn your visage away from me  
I dont care about your face  
Bend over  
  
A twolegged being on all fours  
I take him for a walk  
Ambling along the corridor  
I am disappointed  
  
Now he comes backwards towards me  
Honey stays stuck on the garter  
I am disappointed totally disappointed  
  
Bend over  
Your face doesnt interest me  
  
The twolegged one has bent over  
And moved into a good light  
I show him what you can do  
And I start to cry  
  
The biped stammers a prayer  
Because hes scared Im feeling even worse  
He tries to bend over even more  
Tears run up his back  
  
Bend over  
  
Bend over I command you  
Turn your visage away from me  
I dont care about your face  
Bend over once more  
  
Bend over
