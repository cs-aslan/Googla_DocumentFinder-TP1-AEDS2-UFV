Theres a man across the hall who sits staring at the floor  
He thinks hes Hank Williamshear him singing through the door  
Theres a girl in 203 who stops by to visit me  
And she talks about her songs and the star that she should be  
There are lots of special people staying in or passing through  
And for one thing or another committed to Parkview  
Theres a girl in 307 coming down on Thorazine  
And a superstars exdrummer trying to kick Benzedrine  
Theres a boy just down below me whos the son of some wellknown  
He was brought in by his mother cause his daddys always gone  
Theres a bum from down on Broadway and then a few quite welltodos  
Who have withdrawn from the rat race and committed to Parkview  
Theres a girl who cries above me loud enough to wake the dead  
They dont know what she has taken that has scrambled up her head  
Theres a writer and a singer who has tried and tried and tried  
They just brought him in this morning an attempted suicide  
There are those that never made it those that did but now are through  
Some came of their own good choosing some committed to Parkview  
They wake us about 6 30 just before the morning meal  
While theyre taking blood pressure they ask us how we feel  
And I always say Fantastic There aint nothing wrong with me  
And then they give me my injection and I go right back to sleep  
And my days are kind of foggy and my nights are dreamy too  
But theyre taking good care of me committed to Parkview
