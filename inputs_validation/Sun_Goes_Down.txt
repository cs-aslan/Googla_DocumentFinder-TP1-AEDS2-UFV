Oh youre all looking up  
With hearts of devotion  
Through the dust and the heat lost to me  
In a cloud of emotion  
I have no motivation  
To keep this breathless pace  
Im more inclined to stay here  
In this breathing space  
  
And the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
  
I never tried to walk the walk  
Cause the steps are elusive  
The membership is too costly  
And exclusive  
Hey the more Ive got  
The more I stand to lose  
So Im gonna unpack my bags  
And take off my shoes  
  
And the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
  
Let me tell you theres no point knocking  
At the big oak door  
Cant you see that its all full up  
They cant take no more  
The lines so long  
Its almost Disney  
Ooh  
Wont somebody kiss me  
  
And the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up
