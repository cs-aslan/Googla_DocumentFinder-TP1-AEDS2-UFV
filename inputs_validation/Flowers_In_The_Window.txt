When I first held you I was cold  
A melting snowman I was told  
But there was noone there to hold before  
I swore that I would be alone for ever more  
Wow look at you now  
Flowers in the window  
Its such a lovely day  
And Im glad you feel the same  
Cause to stand up out in the crowd  
You are one in a million  
And I love you so  
Lets watch the flowers grow  
  
There is no reason to feel bad  
But there are many seasons to feel glad sad mad  
Its just a bunch of feelings that we have to hold  
But I am here to help you with the load  
  
Wow look at you now  
Flowers in the window  
Its such a lovely day  
And Im glad you feel the same  
Cause to stand up out in the crowd  
You are one in a million  
And I love you so  
Lets watch the flowers grow  
  
So now were here and now is fine  
So far away from there and there is time time time  
To plant new seeds and watch them grow  
So therell be flowers in the window when we go  
  
Wow look at us now  
Flowers in the window  
Its such a lovely day  
And Im glad you feel the same  
Cause to stand up out in the crowd  
You are one in a million  
And I love you so  
Lets watch the flowers grow  
Wow look at you now  
Flowers in the window  
Its such a lovely day  
And Im glad you feel the same  
Cause to stand up out in the crowd  
You are one in a million  
And I love you so  
Lets watch the flowers grow  
Lets watch the flowers grow
