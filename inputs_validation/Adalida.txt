Chorus  
Adalida pretty little Cajun queen  
Sweet Dixie flower the bell of the bayou  
Youre every young mans dream  
Adalida Id walk through the hurricane  
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida Id swim the Ponchartrain  
  
Oh no here ya coming down the road  
With your cotton dress a swishing  
Youre getting some attention  
From all the boys in Thibodaux  
Oh my youre really filling up their eyes  
Smiling and a winking  
I know what theyre thinking  
But Im the only one who loves you so  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh no the hottest little dish I know  
I know that you can tell it  
Youre making me so jealous  
From my head down to my toes  
Oh me you could make a red neck green  
The way that youre a looking  
You got me a cooking  
And I aint talking bout Etoufee  
  
Chorus x2  
  
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida  
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida  
Just to stand beside of my sweet Adalida  
Id swim the Ponchartrain
