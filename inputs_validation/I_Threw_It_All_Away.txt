I once held her in my arms  
She said she would always stay  
But I was cruel  
I treated her like a fool  
I threw it all away  
  
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand  
And rivers that ran through evry day  
I must have been mad  
I never knew what I had  
Until I threw it all away  
  
Love is all there is it makes the world go round  
Love and only love it cant be denied  
No matter what you think about it  
You just wont be able to do without it  
Take a tip from one whos tried  
  
So if you find someone that gives you all of her love  
Take it to your heart dont let it stray  
For one thing thats certain  
You will surely be ahurtin  
If you throw it all away
