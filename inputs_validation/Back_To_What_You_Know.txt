Verse 1  
I dont know where to begin  
Fighting a war I cant win fighting a memory  
Something that used to be  
No matter how hard I fight  
All of my strength and might  
Keeps on defeating me it just keeps on defeating me  
  
Chorus  
So what Im trying to say I know whats happening  
Your body is here with me  
But your heart and your mind is still with him  
  
Go back to what you know  
Go back to where you know where your heart is  
Girl just be honest this is impossible  
This is impossible well never work cause you dont want it  
Girl you belong with him so just go back to what you know  
Go back to what you know because this is impossible  
  
Verse 2  
Telling me things that you two did when he was with you  
How he was oh so sweet the way that he used to treat you  
Instead you just cant keep him outta your mind  
Why cant you just tell me that Im not who you want to be  
Baby you dont want me no no no  
  
Chorus  
  
Go back to what you know  
Go back to where you know where your heart is  
Girl just be honest this is impossible  
This is impossible well never work cause you dont want it  
Girl you belong with him so just go back to what you know  
Go back to what you know because this is impossible  
  
Bridge  
And if that was really what you want  
I will not stand in your way you want to be free  
I will let you be  
I rather you have me than miserable with me  
Back to what you know  
Back to what you know  
Said back to what you know  
  
Chorus  
  
So there aint no need to make those lies  
Youre stuck in the past  
Pedal to the gas and drive away
