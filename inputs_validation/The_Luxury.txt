Zoo Lion sobers up and starts to scream and shout  
A little dose of homefire got him all smoothed out  
Melancholy winesoaked tenderness  
She hated it here and she couldnt care less  
  
Prisonyard stares and FleurDelis tattoos  
Cannibal are saving all their bones for soup  
Eating with my fingers and sucking hulls of ships  
My parasite dont deserve no better than this  
  
The Golden Rim Motor Inn  
Soft water and a color TV  
So consumed with the shape Im in  
Cant enjoy the luxury  
  
She says Why are you partial to that Playboy con  
When you can see me naked anytime you want  
If I had loads of money to make me tame and sour  
I could pay you to remind me of my baby by the hour  
  
Zoo Lion sobers up and starts to scream and shout  
A little dose of homefire got him all smoothed out  
If this is where it all starts getting good  
Then Ill be here waiting for you like I said I would  
  
The Golden Rim Motor Inn  
Soft water and a color TV  
So consumed with the shape Im in  
Cant enjoy the luxury  
  
The luxury
