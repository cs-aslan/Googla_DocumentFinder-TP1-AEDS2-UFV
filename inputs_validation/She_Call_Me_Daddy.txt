Shes gone  
I froze her out  
Move by move  
First I didnt hold her hand  
Then I didnt touch her in bed  
Then I wasnt tender with her upsets  
Then I just told her to go  
And still she didnt go  
I had to push  
Now this place is peaceful as a grave  
Its dead quiet without her  
And her stupid T V Shows  
And young girl laughing  
I was always ashamed she read cosmopolitan  
I should have been proud of her  
What did she want that was so bad  
She just wanted to believe that someone would  
Love her and look after her always  
She called me daddy  
She called me daddy
