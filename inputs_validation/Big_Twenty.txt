Move along big twenty big twenty move along  
Youve got a master and youve got a home  
Move along big twenty big twenty move along  
Youve got the muscle and youve got the bone  
  
Went out on the Mojave with a twenty mule team  
Ten tons of borax and a muleskinners dream  
Well soon be awinin and adinin I know  
With a cute little filly in the town of Reno  
  
The Apaches are restless theres smoke in the sky  
But Im too old for scalpin and Im too young to die  
But theyll soon be around us like ants on a hill  
Bringin this muleskinner up for the kill  
Heres where I cant remember much  
  
My mules started runnin bring big twenty down  
But were still alivin so the story can be told  
How I traded that borax for Apache gold
