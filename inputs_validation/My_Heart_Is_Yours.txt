When you hold my hand time stands still  
When the love in my pain fills my heart  
Its your love that heals  
  
When Im feeling this feeling inside  
I know that its true  
That every single beat of my heart  
Is beating for you  
  
My heart is yours and my love is too  
And I love you with all of my heart  
Which belongs to you  
  
When your stuck and cold  
And loving moves in  
And love is shining bright as the sun  
Gives my soul from a veil  
  
That every little kiss from your lips  
Takes my breath away  
And its right here  
By your side I will always stay  
  
My heart is yours  
Its where youll be  
Your the only love of my life  
Your everything to me  
  
My heart is yours  
Is where youll be  
Your the only love of my life  
Your everything to me  
  
If I love you with all of my heart  
Which belongs to you
