Ive got love on my mind  
Ive got love on my mind  
Ive got love on my mind  
  
And theres nothing particular wrong  
Its a feeling I feel inside  
When I woke up early this morning  
It was staring me straight in my eye  
I got there I start to unwind  
In your arms I like to be  
  
Caressing you gently and passionately  
From sunrise to sunset and all through the day  
Ive been waiting for your return  
And you know this is where Ill be  
I can say to the world  
I learned only you can satisfy me  
  
Ive got love on my mind  
Ive got love on my mind  
Ive got love on my mind  
  
When you touch me I cant resist  
And youve touched me a thousand times  
When I think of your tender kiss  
Then and there I start to unwind
