Chorus  
Why dont we make believe were in love again  
Who said the crimson moon doesnt shine  
Where do people go when theyre lookin for that one of a kind  
  
Why dont we make believe that were sorry  
Why must we hold it all inside  
Where do lovers go when theyre runnin and theres no place to hide  
  
Always remember the day we met in the foreign rain  
You were content and we went our separate ways  
No matter which way the wind blows now hang on to it anyhow  
Dont ever say it could never be the same  
  
Chorus  
  
Always remember holding hands on a summer day  
You were content ob das stimmt and you took it all away  
I didnt come here to change your mind lead you on and waste your time  
All alone in the evening gettin blue  
  
Why dont we make believe  
  
Chorus  
  
Why dont we make believe why dont we make believe
