A piece of mail  
A letterhead  
A piece of hair  
From a human head  
  
Theyre stayin to me  
I shouldve killed it  
I shouldve killed it  
I shouldve killed it before  
  
Youre right youre right  
Kill the body and the head will die  
Theyre laughin at me  
I shouldve learned it  
I shouldve learned it  
I shouldve learned it before  
  
What a day what a day  
If you can look it in the face  
And hold your vomit  
  
A wet sneeze and a no left turn  
A row of teeth and an encouraging word  
Beneath a mile of skin  
I shouldve noticed it  
I shouldve noticed it  
I shouldve noticed it before  
  
What a day  
What a day  
What a day  
Dont you touch it
