If I had the world to give Id give it to you  
Long as you live would you let it fall or hold it all in your arms  
  
If I had a song to sing Id sing it to you  
As long as you live lullaby or maybe a plain serenade  
Wouldnt you laugh dance and cry or be afraid at the change you made  
  
I may not have the world to give to you  
But maybe I have a tune or two  
Only if you let me be your world  
Could I ever give this world to you  
  
But I will give what love I have to give  
I will give what love I have to give  
I will give what love I have to give long as I live  
  
If I had a star to give Id give it to you  
Long as you live would you have the time  
To watch it shine watch it shine  
Or ask for the moon and heaven too Id give it to you  
  
Well maybe Ive got no star to spare or anything fine or even rare  
Only if you let me be your world could I ever give this world to you  
Could I ever give this world to you
