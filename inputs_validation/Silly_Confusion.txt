Meet me on the moon very very soon  
Meet me on the stars Jupiter and Mars  
Fly me to a star  
Burning out in space shining on my face  
  
Fly me through the night on your Silver Wings  
Over crystal seas Valleys of the Kings  
By the lilac shore where the dragon flies  
In the diamond skies  
  
Silly Silly Confusion  
And tangle of wild illusion  
Were living in a wonder world of fantasy  
We spent all our times in sweet living dreams  
  
Its a Silly Silly Confusion  
Like a flower of wild profusion  
You can do the things in life  
You always wanted to  
Within your heart you know it always will come through  
  
Take me for a ride in your DreamMachine  
To a time and place where no one has been  
Let me look upon worlds Ive never seen  
In your DreamMachine  
  
Fly me to a star burning out in space  
Let me feel the light shining on my face  
Sail on solar winds sail on silver birds  
Through the universe  
  
Silly Silly Confusion  
Its a Silly Silly Confusion  
  
Silly Silly Confusion  
Its a Silly Silly Confusion  
  
Silly Silly Confusion  
Silly Silly Confusion
