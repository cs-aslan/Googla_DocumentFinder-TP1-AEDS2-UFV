We may struggle  
We may even very well see hell from the gates  
Dont think that you are alright  
Are above making mistakes  
Said Im gonna get on your damn nerves  
And youre gonna make me mad  
But I know we can survive all that  
Cause this love is good could never be that bad  
  
Chorus  
So may you never know the way  
Way that it feels  
Feels to be lonely  
May you never know one day  
When love isnt real  
See this stuff to me is genuine only  
  
See well maybe in a perfect world  
We would get along perfectly  
But seeing how this is real life  
Sometimes we just wanna be  
And I may make you say that you wanna leave  
Never come back  
But I dont  
But I know we can survive all that  
Cause this love is good could never be that bad  
  
Chorus  
  
Said I aint always gonna like you girl  
Said you aint always gonna like me girl  
But youre the only one I want in this world  
Let me sing it again  
I aint always gonna like you girl  
Said I aint always gonna like you girl  
You aint always gonna like me girl  
Said you aint always gonna like me girl  
I love you more than anything in this world  
But I love you more than anything in this world  
Ooh  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Yeah yeah
