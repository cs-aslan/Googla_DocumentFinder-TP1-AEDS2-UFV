Lil Wayne  
Uhh she got that good good  
She Michael Jackson Bad  
Im attracted to her  
With her attractive ass  
You get her the matching bags  
I get her to pack them bags  
Get straight in that taxi cab  
Come straight to my bachelor pad  
I hate to see her go  
But I love to watch her leave  
I keep her comin back  
Like she forgot her keys  
And now were murderers  
Because we kill time  
She saw doctor carter and now she feel fine  
  
Gudda Gudda  
I like the way you walking if you walking my way  
Im that red bull now lets fly away  
Lets buy a place  
With all kinds of space  
Ill let you be the judge  
And and Im the case

No stevie wonder  
She dont even wonder  
Cos she know she bad  
And I got her ngga grocery bags  
  
Omarion  Chorus  
Look look at you at you  
Bad yes you are

Look at how she walks

Damn you know it damn you know it  
And she know it and she know it

Nicki Minaj  
Ok I get it let me think  
I guess its my turn  
Maybe its time to put this pssy on your sideburns  
You say Im bad you probably right  
He pressing me like button downs on a friday night  
Im so pretty like be on my pedal bike  
Be on my low scrunch  
Be on my egg and whites  
You say Nicki dont stop you the bestest  
And I just be coming off the top asbestos  
  
Drake  
I love your sushi roll  
Hotter than Wasabi  
I race for your love  
Shake and bake ricky bobby  
Im at the W but I cant meet you at the lobby  
Girl I gotta watch my back cos Im not just anybody  
I see em stand in line just to get beside her  
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her  
Cos when we disappear you need gps to find her  
Oh that was you girl  
I thought I recognised her  
  
Chorus  
  
Tyga  
She like tanning  
I like staying in  
She like romancing  
I like rollin with friends  
She said Im caged in  
I think her conscious is  
She watching them dat oxygen  
Im watching espn  
But when the shows ends she all in my skin  
Lotions no emotions rollarcoasting like back forth  
Hold it hold it hold it hold it  
She pose like its for posters  
And I poke like Im supposed to  
Take this photo if you for me  
Dont you ever show this  
Im too loyal and too focused  
To be losing and be hopeless  
When I spoke this she rejoiced it  
Tell your words get me open  
So I closed it where your clothes is  
Im only lovin for the moment  
  
Jae Millz  
She aint got a man but she is not alone  
Miss Independent yeah she got her own  
Hey gorgeous uh I mean flawless  
Well thats what you are how I see it  
Is how I call it yeh  
Look at how she walk  
Who knew she know she bad  
Do your thing baby I aint even mad  
And I aint leaving fast  
Imma stay a while  
Hold your head chris  
Imma take it down
