Your heart beat so near me  
But I cant break in  
How easy you control me  
Look at the state Im in  
  
You got me jumping like Im up and down  
Im inside out again  
You keep me running til the sun goes down  
Til the sun comes round again  
  
Why do I love you  
Why do I care  
I keep on chasing you  
Im going nowhere  
Why cant I hate you  
Why dont I dare  
Thought I saw an angel  
But there aint nothing there  
  
Why do I love you  
Why do I care  
I keep on chasing you  
Im going nowhere  
Why cant I hate you  
Why dont I dare  
Thought I saw an angel  
But there aint there aint nothing there  
There aint nothing there  
There aint nothing there  
There aint nothing there  
  
Youre cold your heart  
Im in too far  
I love you and I cant pretend  
But your heart beats so near me  
But I cant break in  
  
You got me jumping like Im up and down  
Im inside out again  
You keep me running til the sun goes down  
Til the sun comes round again  
  
Why do I love you  
Why do I care  
I keep on chasing you  
Im going nowhere  
Why cant I hate you  
Why dont I dare  
Thought I saw an angel  
But there aint there aint nothing there  
There aint nothing there  
  
Real hearts dont feel this pain  
Let it go let it go  
Real hearts dont feel this strain  
Let it go let it go  
Real hearts dont feel this way  
Let it go let it go  
But this heart wont ever change  
  
Why do I love you  
Why do I love you  
Why do I love you  
Why do I love you  
  
Why do I love you  
Why do I care  
I keep on chasing you  
Im going nowhere  
Why cant I hate you  
Why dont I dare  
Thought I saw an angel  
But there aint there aint nothing there  
  
Why do I love you  
Why do I love you  
Why do I love you  
Why do I love you  
Why do I love you
