Love is gentle as a rose  
And love can conquer any war  
Its time to take a stand  
Brothers and sisters join hands  
  
We got to let love rule  
Let love rule  
  
We got to let love rule  
Let love rule  
  
Love transcends all space and time  
And love can make a little child smile  
Cant you see this wont go wrong  
But we got to be strong  
We cant do it alone  
  
We got to let love rule  
Let love rule  
  
We got to let love rule  
Let love rule
