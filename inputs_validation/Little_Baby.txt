Chorus  
Baby youre just a little baby  
You pretend to be a lady  
But youre just a little baby  
  
Bored of the sitter will go to the bidder the highest  
If you discover that hes undercover his stained kiss  
Pull out your heartstrings and take all the other things for granted  
Remember yourself before all the other ideas have been planted  
  
Chorus  
  
Right from the start I saw you play the part in rehearsal  
You chose the mood and decided to move in the circle  
How does it feel when you spin on the wheel of destiny  
You feel good tonight but tomorrow youll wake up dishonestly  
  
Chorus  
  
He took you for a lover  
But then you found another  
And now youre asking me  
What should I do  
  
I wont try to stop you  
I think you want to grow  
In the arms of someone new  
Maybe in time youll return to him  
And maybe in time youll see the best  
Changing the cast erasing the past
