Whooo umm yeah  
Lifes like a road that you travel on  
When theres one day here and the next day gone  
Sometimes you bend and sometimes you stand  
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind  
Theres a world outside every darkened door  
Where blues wont haunt you anymore  
Where brave are free and lovers soar  
Come ride with me to the distant shore  
We wont hesitate  
To break down the garden gate  
Theres not much time left today  
  
Chorus  
  
Life is a highway  
I wanna ride it all night long  
If youre going my way  
I wanna drive it all night long  
Gimme gimme gimme gimme yeah  
  
Through all these cities and all these towns  
Its in my blood and its all around  
I love you now like I loved you then  
This is the road and these are the hands  
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights  
The Khyber Pass to Vancouvers lights  
Knock me down and back up again  
Youre in my blood Im not a lonely man  
Theres no load I cant hold  
A road so rough this I know  
Ill be there when the light comes in  
Tell em were survivors  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
There was a distance between you and I  
A misunderstanding once  
But now we look in the eye  
  
There aint no load that I cant hold  
A road so rough this I know  
Ill be there when the light comes in  
Tell em were survivors  
  
ChorusRepeat x3
