I ran into your best friend today  
Twelve nights since you ran away  
I asked about you and she said cant say cant say  
Im feeling lonely and it seems to stay  
Its been a while since I felt that way  
Well I can tell you theres no room to play this game  
  
All I know is what Im missing  
What Im missing is your kissing  
Are you listening  
  
Dont go dont go telling me youre all right  
Theres no room for getting uptight  
Dont go saying that youre okay  
When youre lonely  
Baby dont go telling me were over  
When you know youre my one and only lover  
And I wont go saying that were okay when were  
Lost without each other  
Cause were lost without each other  
Cause were lost without each other  
  
I didnt mean to start the last big fight  
You never should have hung up that night  
All I want to do is make things right  
Make it right  
Listen with all the choices that we chose to make  
And all the promises we chose to break  
We were busy making big mistakes yesterday  
  
All I know is what Im missing  
What Im missing is your kissing  
Are you listening  
  
Dont go dont go telling me youre all right  
Theres no room for getting uptight  
Dont go saying that youre okay  
When youre lonely  
Baby dont go telling me were over  
When you know youre my one and only lover  
And I wont go saying that were okay when were  
Lost without  
  
I can tell you one thing  
Were not better on our own  
Im tired of running from my feelings  
Are you listening  
  
All I know is what Im missing  
What Im missing is your kissing  
Are you listening  
  
Dont go dont go telling me youre all right  
Theres no room for getting uptight  
Dont go saying that youre okay  
When youre lonely  
Baby dont go telling me were over  
When you know youre my one and only lover  
And I wont go saying that were okay when were  
Lost without each other  
Lost without each other
