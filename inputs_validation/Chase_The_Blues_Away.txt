Well come along walk with me  
And learn the songs that lovers sing  
When they believe  
Well dance along the rivers edge  
Just arm and arm along the moonlit shore  
The midnight cries  
  
Well I just came to chase the blues away  
For awhile  
  
Just like a child youll cling to me  
From every sound along that rushes near  
Its just the breeze that licks your skin  
and rubs your breast  
And as we lay our rivers flow away  
Your woman fear  
  
Well I just came to chase the blues away  
For awhile  
  
With the morning sun well wake  
And lift our eyes and watch the eagle fly  
Up mountain high  
And on his wings our love will climb  
And never fail until he soars and dives  
Oh hell take your breath away  
  
Well he just came to chase the blues away  
For awhile
