Look over yonder here come the blues  
The thirteenth of any time powered by fools  
I can see em comin  
Wearing a blue armored coat  
Youre sittin here with your violins  
Hittin wrong notes  
Look over yonder hes comin my way  
When hes around I never have a happy day  
you even bust my guitar strings  
Look over yonder look over yonder look over yonder etc  
Look over yonder  
Well hes talkin to my baby  
They found my peace pipe on her  
Now theyre draggin her away  
Lord knows we dont need a devil like him beatin us around  
Well hes knockin on my door  
How my house is tumblin down  
Now dont you come no closer  
The path is keepin me bolder  
Wait by my door baby  
Unless you want to start another war  
Look over yonder hey  
Look over yonder  
Look over yonder  
Look over yonder
