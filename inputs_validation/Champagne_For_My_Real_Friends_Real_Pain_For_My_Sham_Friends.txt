You are a getaway car a rush of blood to the head  
But me Im just the covers on top of your bed  
You steer away in a rear view mirror you make my head swim  
I keep you warm and wont ask you where youve been  
  
With your backless black dress soaked to the skin  
When its said and down theyre all scrambling  
And were friends yeah were friends  
Just because we move units  
  
Strike us like matches cause everyone deserves the flames  
We only do it for the scars and stories not the fame  
At least everyone is trying everyone else is shining  
Everyone deserves the flames but its such a shame  
Such a shame  
  
The sounds of this small town make my ears hurt  
Oh yeah you caught me But I caught you way worse  
They say You want a war Youve got a war  
But who are you fighting for  
The tides out the ships run aground  
We drown traitors in shallow water
