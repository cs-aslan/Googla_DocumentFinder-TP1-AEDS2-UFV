But if you want to keep your song do mi do mi do  
Dont play the chords of fame oh no no

And when they find a melody theyre surrounded by the girls  
But it all fades so quickly like a sunny summer day  
Reporters ask you questions and they write down what you say  
  
Chorus

The more that you will find success the more that you will fail

But I wonder who I left behind on the other side of fame  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont oh dont dont play the chords of fame  
Dont oh dont dont play the chords of fame  
Dont
