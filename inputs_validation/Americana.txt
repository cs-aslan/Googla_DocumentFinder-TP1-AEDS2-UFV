Well id like to tell you all about my dream its a place  
Where strip malls abound and diversions mere moments away  
  
Where cultures defined by the  
Ones least refined  
And youll be left behind  
If you dont fit in  
Its all distorted  
In americana my way  
  
Well my dream has come true  
My vision has come true  
  
Now give me my cable fast food fourbys tats right away  
I want it right now cause my generation dont like to wait  
  
My futures determined by  
Thieves thugs and vermin  
Its quite an excursion  
But its okay  
Everythings backwards  
In americana my way  
  
Well my dream has come true  
My vision has come true  
  
Im a product  
Of my environment  
So dont blame me i just work here  
  
My rights are denied by  
Those least qualified  
Trading profit for pride  
But its okay  
Everythings backwards  
In americana my way  
  
My nightmare has come true  
My nightmare has come true  
Yeah its all coming true
