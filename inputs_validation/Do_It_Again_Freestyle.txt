Verse 1  
You know how your boy come through on a Friday  
Im a smooth operator like Sade  
Ill put you in your place like valet  
But they aint really about nothin like Wale  
Yeah I aint talkin bout no album  
Time to turn up I aint talkin bout no volume  
Crazy up in here I aint talkin bout asylums  
You aint talkin income they walkin outs they outcome  
You ex on a nigga I aint talkin bout no Malcolm  
Bird from Atlanta I aint talkin bout no falcons  
No Julio Jones or Roddy White  
But she could catch it like them if her body tight  
If she walkin lose her naughties right  
If she stretch it like Pilates right  
If she ride it like Ducati bikes  
But you aint fuckin everybody right  
You aint out here bein thotty right  
I mean I see a lot of thots whenever Im in the club
