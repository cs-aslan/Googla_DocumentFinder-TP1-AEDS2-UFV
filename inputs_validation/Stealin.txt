Take me across the water cause I need some place to hide  
I done the ranchers daughter and I sure did hurt his pride  
  
Oooo oooo ah ah ah  
Oooo oooo ah ah ah  
  
Well theres a hundred miles of desert  
Lies between his hide and mine  
I dont need no food no water Lord  
cause Im running out of time  
  
Fightin killin  
Wine and women gonna put me to my grave  
Runnin hidin losin cryin  
Nothing left to save  
But my life  
  
Oooo oooo ah ah ah  
Oooo oooo ah ah ah  
  
Stood on a ridge and stunned religion  
Thinking the world was mine  
I made my break and a big mistake  
Stealing when I should have been buying  
  
All that fightin killin  
Wine and women gonna put me to an early grave  
Runnin hidin losin cryin  
Nothing left to save
