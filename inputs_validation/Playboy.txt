I just wanna be a playboy play it night an day boy  
Just wanna have lots of fun  
Chase the girls and spend lots of mon  
I just wanna be a playboy cause thats the only way boy  
To really get a lotta lovin done while Im still young  
I dont especially want a limousine  
I dont especially want a Cadillac  
I just want a hot rod machine and really wreck a back  
I just wanna be a playboy just wanna be the real Mccoy  
I dont really want a steady girl  
I kinda like to give em all the whirl  
I just wanna be a playboy I just wanna spread lots of joy  
I gotta get a lotta lovin done while Im still young playboy
