Oohooh  
Old Mr Joe he build a house away  
On top of some hill  
Old Mr Joe knew he had to go so he  
He got right down and wrote bank will  
He say now heres to mother hen  
And her chicken Lord have mercy now  
Master will you take a roll in the mud  
Like you know you should  
The old barnyard the old barnyard  
Birds and the chick oohwee  
Whos got to watch out for brother mongoose  
With his top hap and walkingstick  
  
Its just the poors brain washing  
Poors They told me a long time ago  
Its just the poors brain washing oohwee  
Poors brain washing Now look at a thing like this  
  
Cinderella and her long lost fellow  
In the midnight hour she lost her silver slipper  
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall  
While Jack and Jill had themselves a fall  
  
Its just the poors brain washing  
And I dont need it no longer washing  
Its just the poors brain washing  
Coming through to a poor mans child oohwee look at this  
  
Little Miss Muffet she sat on a tuffet  
While Little Red Riding Hood delivered her grandmoms food  
Oohwee oohwee  
Oohwee look at one more thing like this  
The cow jumping over the moon  
While the dish got jealous he grabbed the handy spoon  
  
Its just the poors brain washing  
And I dont need it no longer I dont want it no longer  
I dont need it no longer washing  
And I dont care for no more brain washing washing
