All last week and half of today Johnnie has been a good little girl  
Trying to keep her devils at bay watching her health return  
But she always comes back for more hanging her head and banging my door  
Johnnie comes back again  
I said Johnnie remember oh Johnnie be good Please give me some medicine
man  
Oh Johnnie comes back again  
Whered she get that tear in her eye  
Whoever said she could leave me whered she learn to say goodbye  
Shes been watching too much TV she only shows up for meals  
my medicine chest and my automobiles Johnnie comes back again  
I said Johnnie remember oh Johnnie be good Please give me some medicine
man  
Oh Johnnie comes back again  
  
Me Im just an evil demon Im playing on her weakness  
counting on her sickness to bring her home again  
  
To use me up and to rob me blind I guess it shouldnt surprise me  
Fighting and flashing like a fish on a line my God she must despise me  
But she always comes back again now it wont be long til shes gone again  
Johnnie comes back again  
  
I said Johnnie remember oh Johnnie be good Please give me some medicine
man  
Oh Johnnie comes back again
