We had a life we had a love  
But you dont know what youve got til you lose it  
Well that was then and this is now  
And I want you back  
How many times do I have to say Im sorry  
  
How can something so good go so bad  
How can something so right go so wrong  
I dont know I dont have all the answers  
But I want you back  
How many times can I say Im sorry  
  
You can run and you can hide  
But Im not leaving less you come with me  
Weve had our problems but Im on your side  
Youre all I need please believe in me  
  
I only wanted someone to love  
But something happened on the way to heaven  
It got a hold of me and wouldnt let go  
And I want you back  
How many times do I have to say Im sorry  
  
You can run and you can hide  
But Im not leaving less you come with me  
Weve had our problems but Im on your side  
Youre all I need please believe in me  
  
They say you cant take it with you  
When you go  
And I believe it  
But taking what Ive got or being  
here with you you know  
Id rather leave it  
  
You can run and you can hide  
But Im not leaving less you come with me  
Weve had our problems but Im on your side  
Youre all I need please believe in me
