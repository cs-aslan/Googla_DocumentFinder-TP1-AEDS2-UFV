Yes Ive got someone new  
Ive had enough of you  
Im tired of your lying  
So throw it out your mind  
You toss me around  
Lately Ive found  
That someone elses love  
Can be so fine  
So bye bye my friend  
Too bad it had to end  
My brand new love is waiting so Ill see you now and then  
But as  
Of now  
Were through  
And how  
So throw  
It  
Out  
Your  
Miiiiiiind

And how

It  
Out
