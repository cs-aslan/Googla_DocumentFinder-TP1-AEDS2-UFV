With every breath I breathe  
Im making history  
With your name on my lips  
The ages fall to bits  
  
In flames I sleep soundly  
With angels around me  
I lay at your feet  
Youre the breath that I breathe  
  
Some kind of violent bliss  
Led me to love like this  
One thousand deaths my dear  
Id die without you here  
  
In flames I sleep soundly  
With angels around me  
I lay at your feet  
Youre the breath that I breathe  
  
Youre the breath that I breathe  
The breath that I breathe  
Breath that I breathe  
Youre the breath that I breathe
