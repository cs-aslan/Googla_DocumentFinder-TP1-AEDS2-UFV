Shes just a product of misery  
  
Everyday shed go around  
Everytime I see that frown  
Broken down and down and out  
The drudgery goes on and on  
Oh I just want to say  
I aint gonna live that way cause  
  
Shes just a product of misery  
I dont want to live like that  
Just a product of misery  
I dont want to live like that  
  
Like her mother and hers before  
She left her heart out by the door  
Everybody passed it by  
They never bothered asking why  
She stayed looked up inside  
Watching as the world turns by  
  
Now shes just a product of misery  
I dont want to live like that  
Just a product of misery  
I dont want to live like that  
I dont want to live like that   
Hey like that   
I dont want to live like that  
Just a product of misery  
  
Annie said she must confess  
She never came and never left  
Never could communicate and  
Now the time is much too late  
Passions laid to rest  
Buried with her wedding dress  
  
Now shes just a product of misery  
I dont want to live like that  
I dont want to live like that  
Just a product of misery
