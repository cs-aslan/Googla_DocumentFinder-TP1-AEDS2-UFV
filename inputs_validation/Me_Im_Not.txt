Well its happening  
Never planned on this  
Youve got something I need  
Kind of dangerous  
And Im losing control  
Im not used to this  
What you want from me  
Im not used to this  
  
I cant shut it off  
This thing Ive begun  
And its hard to tell  
Just where its coming from  
And its hard to see  
What Im capable of  
And its hard to believe  
Just what Ive become  
  
Chorus  
Hey can we stop  
Me Im not  
Hey can we stop  
Me Im not  
Hey can we stop  
Me Im not  
Hey can we stop  
Me Im not  
  
I can swallow it down  
Keep it all inside  
I define myself  
By how well I hide  
I feel it coming apart  
Well at least I tried  
I can win this war  
By knowing not to fight  
  
If I take it all back  
Someway somehow  
If I knew back then  
What I know right now  
  
Chorus  
  
Me Im not  
  
Me Im not  
  
Me Im not  
  
Me Im not  
  
Me Im not  
  
Me Im not  
  
Me Im not  
  
Me Im not
