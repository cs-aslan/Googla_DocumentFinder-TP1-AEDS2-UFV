I dont want to see tomorrow  
unless I see it with you  
Tomorrow so they say  
Will be a lovely day  
A bright new sun will suddenly break through  
But I dont want to see tomorrow  
Unless I see it with you  
Tomorrow so I hear  
The clouds will disappear  
The door to happiness will open wide  
But I dont want to see tomorrow  
Unless youre there by my side  
Dont want to walk alone  
Dont want to dream alone  
Just want you close to my heart  
For if your love is gone  
How can I face the dawn of  
Sunday or Monday  
I just cant face one day  
Until you say youre mine  
Oh darling please be mine  
And make each bright tomorrow young and new  
But I dont want to face tomorrow  
Unless I see it with you  
Tomorrow so I hear  
The clouds will disappear  
The door to happiness will open wide  
But I dont want to see tomorrow  
Unless I see it with you
