Its over all over  
And soon somebody else  
Will make a fuss about you  
But how about me  
  
Its over all over  
And soon somebody else  
Will tell his friends about you  
But what about me  
  
Youll find somebody new  
But what am I to do  
Ill still remember you  
When you have forgotten  
  
And maybe a baby  
Will climb upon your knee  
And put its arms about you  
But how about me  
  
And maybe a baby  
Will climb upon your knee  
And put its arms about you  
But how about me  
  
Its over  
But how about me
