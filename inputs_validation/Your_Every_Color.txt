I can see the red white and free in you  
You light the night up like the moon  
And underneath your clouds I see the blue  
  
Youre hopeless cause you tell the truth  
The stars are jealous of your shine  
If you were mine  
Theres not a thing I wouldnt do  
  
Youre black and beautiful yellow tan  
Youre white as light and soft as sand  
With greens and greys and oh for days  
A silver lining on the way you cover everyone  
Just like a morning sun  
You turn me into someone I would rather be  
  
Oh I love your every color  
Oh I love your everything  
You wear the day around you  
Like its yours to stay around you  
Maybe I could stay around you too  
If thats alright with you  
  
Youre coffee brown and bubble gum pink  
And oh I think the shade of you is on the brink  
Of changing all the ways I see the world  
I could drown inside a single drop  
Of all the kinds of things you got  
And all the kinds of things Im not  
  
Might just give me a chance to see  
From way up where you are  
Above the silent stars  
Just dancing in the sky  
  
Youre better than any rainbow  
Youre brighter than the sun  
You look like my first day of summer  
When my spring is on the run  
Youre gold and more gold  
And youre platinum too  
With snow toned copper attitude  
I dont know what Id do without you  
I dont know what Ill do about you
