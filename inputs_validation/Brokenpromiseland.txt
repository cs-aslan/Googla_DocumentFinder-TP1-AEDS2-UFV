Angels falling from the sky  
Imagine that imagine that  
Nobodys getting out of here alive  
No turning back no turning back  
Whos going to bail out all our shattered dreams  
And scrape some truth off of these city streets  
No time for praying get up off your knees  
  
Chorus  
Theres hope I know  
Out on that lonely road  
Cause home is where you are and where I am  
Breathe in breathe out  
Theres only now  
And all I got Im holding in my hands  
Were breaking out of brokenpromiseland  
  
Lets close our eyes and just disappear  
Slip through the cracks no looking back  
Well get a million miles away from here  
And let the past just fade to black  
So what you learn to live with your regrets  
No need to fear what hasnt happened yet  
Life will get you but you cant forget  
  
Chorus  
  
So rise my fallen angel  
Come on now come on now  
Shine dont let em break you  
Come on now come on now  
Come on now come on now  
  
Come on now come on now  
Come on now come on  
  
Chorus  
  
La la la la la la la la breaking out of brokenpromiseland  
La la la la la la la la breaking out of brokenpromiseland  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
