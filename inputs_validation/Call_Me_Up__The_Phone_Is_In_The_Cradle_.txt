My friends they dont talk much about religion  
But my friends they dont talk much anywayay  
When they do I know Id better listen  
Cause my good friends just naturally know  
The right things to say  
  
They say call me up the phone is in the cradle  
Get yourself delivered to my dooroor  
Well if youre so inclined and if youve got the time  
We can talk the night away  
  
Adam got so lonely in the garden  
He said its tough to be the only man alive  
He said Id give a rib for just somebody to talk to  
Well thunder and lightnin out providin  
You came strollin by  
  
She said call me up the phone is in the cradle  
Get yourself delivered to my doooor  
Well if youre so inclined and if youve got the time  
We can talk the night away  
  
Now Rosie was the queen of the all night cowboy  
She said Texas boy you seem kinda shywhy  
Dont you expect an embossed invitation  
Just knock on the wall come down the hall  
And knock on by  
  
She said call me up the phone is in the cradle  
Get yourself delivered to my doooor  
Call me up the phone is in the cradle  
Get yourself delivered to my doooor  
Call me up the phone is in the cradle  
Get yourself delivered to my doooor  
Call me up the phone is in the cradle  
Get yourself
