Verse 1  
Im George IV the regent king  
Which means I was just standing in  
Acting king because my dad  
George III had gone barking mad  
Banana  
Great palaces I did design  
Buckingham was one of mine  
Art and fashion I so rated  
And wives Thats more complicated  
  
Chorus  
Actresses and duchesses  
The great loves of my life  
I loved more girls than I ate pies  
But I couldnt stand my wife  
He couldnt stand his wife  
Go away  
  
Verse 2  
I only married Queen Caroline  
When my debts began to climb  
Cause if I agreed to tie the knot  
I said Id pay off the lot  
  
Verse 3  
But the wedding caused all sorts of strife  
Cause I already had a wife  
A divorced Catholic Dad did sigh  
But the mad old goat just wouldnt die  
Still here Oh spoke too soon  
At last I can go solo  
  
Verse 4  
As true king my reign began  
Though I was now older than your nan  
And as the ruler of our nation  
I banned my wife from my coronation  
  
Verse 5  
And knowing now that I did hate her  
She promptly died just three weeks later  
But all those pies that I got through  
Meant ten years later I died too  
Hello have we met Im a kangaroo  
  
Chorus  
Actresses duchesses  
The great loves of my life  
I loved more girls than I ate pies  
But I couldnt stand my wife  
I had just ten years on the throne  
Do you remember that  
No all that you remember is  
I was really fat
