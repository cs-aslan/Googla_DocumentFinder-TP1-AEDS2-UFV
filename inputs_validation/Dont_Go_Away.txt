A Cold and frosty morning theres not a lot to say  
About the things caught in my mind  
As the day was dawning my plane flew away  
With all the things caught in my mind  
  
And I want to be there when youre  
Coming down  
  
And I want to be there when you hit the ground  
So dont go away say what you say  
But say that youll stay  
Forever and a dayin the time of my life  
  
Cause I need more time yes I need more time  
Just to make things right  
Damn my situation and the games I have to play  
With all the things caught in my mind  
  
Damn my education I cant find the words to say  
About all the things caught in my mind  
Me and you whats going on  
All we seem to know is how to show  
  
The feelings that are wrong
