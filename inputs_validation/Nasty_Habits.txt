Heres something to think about  
Where would we be now without  
Nasty habits nasty habits  
Makes me want to scream and shout  
Life would be so dull without  
Nasty habits nasty habits  
  
All those naughty little things  
That we dont discuss publicly  
Nasty habits nasty habits  
Tell me your secrets tell me your name  
Tell me your secrets  
  
Does it please you to employ  
Little girls or little boys  
Nasty habits nasty habits  
Do you like to romp and play  
By yourself when theyre away  
Nasty affair what do I care  
  
Do you peek at magazines  
Filled with doggies and leather queens  
Nasty habits nasty habits  
Tell me your secrets that no one should hear  
Whisper them softly into my ear  
I wont tell I wont tell  
  
People act so proper when theyre going bout their business  
Cup of coffee friendly conversation  
Til they get home  
Til they get home  
Turn the phone off lock the door and shut the curtains  
Make sure that the neighbors are without suspicion  
No one will know  
No one will know  
  
Nasty habits I must condone  
No one knows what I do when Im all alone  
Nasty habits Im so ashamed  
  
Nasty habits here to stay  
Now theyll never go away  
Try and stop youll have to pay  
Nasty habits are here to stay
