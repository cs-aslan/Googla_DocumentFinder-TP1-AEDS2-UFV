Bob Dylan  
When you are sad and you are lonesome  
And you just cant find a friend  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
And when all that youve held sacred  
Falls down and does not mend  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
Not the end  
No not the end  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
Now when youre standing at a crossroads  
That you cannot comprehend  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
And when all your dreams have vanished  
And you dont know whats around the bend  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
Not the end  
No not the end  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
The tree of life is growing  
Where the spirit never dies  
And the bright lights of salvation shine  
In dark and empty skies  
When the cities are on fire  
With the burning flesh of men  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
Not the end  
No not the end  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
Now when the rainclouds gather around you  
And the heavy rain descends  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
And if nobody is close beside you  
With a soulful hands to lend  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
Not the end  
No not the end  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
Not the end  
No not the end  
Just remember  
Death is not the end
