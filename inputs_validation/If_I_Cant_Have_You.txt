Dont know why  
Im surviving every lonely day  
When theres got to be  
No chance for me  
  
My life would end  
And it doesnt matter how I cry  
My tears of love  
Are a waste of time  
If I turn away  
  
Am I strong enough to see it through  
Go crazy is what I will do  
  
If I cant have you  
I dont want nobody baby  
If I cant have you oh oh oh oh  
If I cant have you  
I dont want nobody baby  
If I cant have you oh oh oh  
  
Cant let go  
And it doesnt matter how I try  
I gave it all so easily  
To you my love  
  
To dreams that never will come true  
Am I strong enough to see it through  
Go crazy is what I will do  
  
If I cant have you  
I dont want nobody baby  
If I cant have you oh oh oh oh  
If I cant have you  
I dont want nobody baby  
If I cant have you oh oh oh
