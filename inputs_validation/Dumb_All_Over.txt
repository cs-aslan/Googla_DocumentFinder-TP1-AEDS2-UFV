Whoever we are  
Wherever were from  
We shoulda noticed by now  
Our behavior is dumb  
And if our chances  
Expect to improve  
Its gonna take a lot more  
Than tryin to remove  
The other race  
Or the other whatever  
From the face  
Of the planet altogether  
They call it the earth  
Which is a dumb kinda name  
But they named it right  
cause we behave the same  
We are dumb all over  
Dumb all over  
Yes we are  
Dumb all over  
Near n far  
Dumb all over  
Black n white  
People we is not wrapped tight  
Nurds on the left  
Nurds on the right  
Religious fanatics  
On the air every night  
Sayin the bible  
Tells the story  
Makes the details  
Sound real gory  
bout what to do  
If the geeks over there  
Dont believe in the book  
We got over here  
You cant run a race  
Without no feet  
n pretty soon  
There wont be no street  
For dummies to jog on  
Or doggies to dog on  
Religious fanatics  
Can make it be all gone  
I mean it wont blow up  
n disappear  
Itll just look ugly  
For a thousand years  
You cant run a country  
By a book of religion  
Not by a heap  
Or a lump or a smidgeon  
Of foolish rules  
Of ancient date  
Designed to make  
You all feel great  
While you fold spindle  
And mutilate  
Those unbelievers  
From a neighboring state  
To arms to arms  
Hooray thats great  
Two legs aint bad  
Unless theres a crate  
They ship the parts  
To mama in  
For souvenirs two ears get down  
Not his not hers but what the hey   
The good book says  
it gotta be that way  
But their book says  
revenge the crusades  
With whips n chains  
n hand grenades  
Two arms two arms  
Have another and another  
Our God says  
there aint no other  
Our God says  
its all okay  
Our God says  
this is the way  
It says in the book  
burn n destroy  
n repent n redeem  
n revenge n deploy  
n rumble thee forth  
To the land of the unbelieving scum on the other side  
cause they dont go for whats in the book  
n that makes em bad  
So verily we must choppeth them up  
And stompeth them down  
Or rent a nice french bomb  
To poof them out of existence  
While leaving their real estate just where we need it  
To use again  
For temples in which to praise our god  
cause he can really take care of business  
And when his humble tv servant  
With humble white hair  
And humble glasses  
And a nice brown suit  
And maybe a blond wife who takes phone calls  
Tells us our God says  
Its okay to do this stuff  
Then we gotta do it  
cause if we dont do it  
We aint gwine up to hebbin  
depending on which book youre using at the  
Timecant use theirs it dont work  
its all liesgotta use mine  
Aint that right  
Thats what they say  
Every night  
Every day  
Hey we cant really be dumb  
If were just following gods orders  
Hey lets get serious  
God knows what hes doin  
He wrote this book here  
An the book says  
He made us all to be just like him  
So  
If were dumb  
Then God is dumb  
an maybe even a little ugly on the side
