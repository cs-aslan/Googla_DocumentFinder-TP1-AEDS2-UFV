I treat this like my thesis  
Wellwritten topic broken down into pieces  
I introduce then produce  
Words so profuse its abuse how I juice up this beat  
Like Im deuce two people both equal  
Like Im Gemini rather Simeon  
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it  
You cant stop it drop it  
Your whole crews microscopic  
Like particles while I make international articles  
And on the cover  
Dont discuss the baby mother business  
I been in this third LP you cant tell me I witness  
First handed Im candid  
You cant stand it respect demanded  
And get flown around the planet  
Rock Hard like granite or steel  
People feel Lauryn Hill from NewArk to Israel  
And this is real so I keep makin the streets ballads  
While you lookin for dressin to go with your tossed salad  
  
You can get the money  
You can get the power  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour  
You can get the money  
You can get the power  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour  
  
Im about to change the focus from the richest to the brokest  
I wrote this opus to reverse the hypnosis  
Whoevers closest to the lines gonna win it  
You gonna fall trying to ball  
While my team win the pennant  
Im about to begin it  
For a minute then run for senate  
Make a slum lord be the tenant give his money to kids to spend it  
And then amend it every law that ever prevented  
Our survival since our arrival  
Documented in The Bible like Moses and Aaron  
Things gon change its apparent  
And all the transparent gonna  
Be seen through let God redeem you  
Keep your deen true  
You can get the green too  
Watch out what you cling to  
Observe how a queen do  
And I remain calm reading the 73 Psalm  
Cause with all this going on I got the world in my palm  
  
You can get the money  
You can get the power  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour  
You can get the money  
You can get the power  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour  
  
Now I be breaking bread sipping  
Manichevitz wine  
Pay no mind party like its 1999  
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine  
Say your rhymes lets see if that get you out your bind  
Now Im a get the mozzarella like a Rockerfeller  
Still be in the church of Lalibela singing hymns a cappella  
Whether posed in Maribella in Couture  
Or collecting residuals from off The Score  
Im making sure Im with the 144  
Ive been here before this aint a battle this is war  
Word to Boonie  
I makes a lot like a Sunni  
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community  
Had opportunity went from Hoodshock to Hoodchic  
But it aint what you cop its about what you keep  
And even if there are leaks you cant capsize this ship  
Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip  
Every time i take sips  
  
You can get the money  
You can get the power  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour  
You can get the money  
You can get the power  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour  
You can get the money  
You can get the power  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour  
You can get the money  
You can get the power  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour  
You can get the money
