Put me on the table  
Make me say your name  
If I cant remember  
Then give me all your pain  
I can sit and listen  
Or I can make you scream  
Kiss it and make it better  
Just put your trust in me  
  
Chorus  
Oh my God go a little slower  
Oh my God what was that again  
La da da let me feel you baby  
Let me in cause I understand  
Let me feel you baby  
Cause I understand  
  
Rap  
I understand all  
Now climb my sugar walls  
Problem solved its dissolved  
With the solvent known as spit  
Lickity lick not so quick its a  
Slick ride make my mink slide  
Cause were all pink inside  
  
This can be really easy  
It doesnt have to be hard  
Here baby let me show you  
Ill have ya climbing up the walls  
You got all the problems  
I think that I can solve  
Why dont you come in here baby  
Why dont we sit and talk  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Rap  
You like the top and the bottom  
You make a drop and then caught em  
And when you rock then youve got em  
Oh my God em oh my God em  
  
Ad libs
