Ive never once in my life met someone like you  
I dont know what the word blue means  
As long as Im with you  
You fill me so completely through everything you do  
Blue is not a word at all  
As long as Im with you  
  
Most of the time in my past  
Blue is all I knew  
But now that were together  
O how I love you  
Im so glad Ive found you  
Youve made my dreams come true  
Blue is not a word at all  
As long as Im with you  
  
Most of the time in my past  
Blue is all I knew  
But now that were together  
O how I love you  
Im so glad Ive found you  
Youve made my dreams come true  
Blue is not a word at all  
As long as Im with you
