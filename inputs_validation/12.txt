12  
Wake  
Revenge is mine  
12 people will die tonight  
Violent J  
Now I look and then reborn  
Though I have just until dawn  
I remember every face  
Spirits show me every place  
First one sleeps inside his bed  
Place my fingers on his head  
To each temple push and smother  
Till my fingers touch each other  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
Next one makes love to his wife  
Only wish to take his life  
For his familys done no wrong  
Place his children on the lawn  
Tell the misses leave the room  
Less she wish to witness doom  
Grab the squirming filthy goat  
And shove the dresser down his throat  
Violent J  
I must quickly use my gift  
Next two work the midnight shift  
Drinking coffee in the back  
I will listen to them chat  
Hear them speaking of my death  
Hear the laughter in their breath  
But the laughter quickly died  
When their heads collide  
Die  
Youre gonna die  
Violent J  
Now my angers growing worse  
Next ones working as a nurse  
Have to make a doctors call  
Drag my body down the hall  
Grab a scalple and a blade  
Time to play the nurses aide  
Operate and strap her down  
Carve her face into a clown  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
Killed another then three more  
Now were down to only four  
This man drives a taxi cab  
Another wicked life to grab  
Screaming that hed thought Id died  
Lets go for a taxi ride  
In the wreck of twisted steel  
The stearing wheel becomes his meal  
Violent J  
This man watches his TV  
Scanning channels endlessly  
Stops at station fortyfour  
Its the Wicked Clown Show  
Watch me juggle watch me dance  
In 3D watch me enhance  
Watch me crawl out from the screen  
And squeeze your neck until youre green  
Die  
Youre gonna die  
Time  
Violent J  
Even though theres just one left  
I feel my bones becoming stiff  
And now I wonder endlessly  
The spirits have abandoned me  
My limbs are falling piece by piece  
My ears and fingers in the street  
But still yet see no morning sun  
And heres my victims early run  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
Quickly grab him from behind  
Round his neck with fishing twine  
Keep him still and pull the string  
Watch his head go bobbaling  
Listen to my riddle song  
Even though my crime was wrong  
Murder me just for your law  
And Ill be back for all yall  
Die  
Youre gonna die  
Ill be back for all yall
