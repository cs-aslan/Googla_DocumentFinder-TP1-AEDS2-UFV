In a word to the wisdom tooth  
To tell or not the truth yeah  
So open up and say ahhmen  
Rinse cup and spit again  
Forked tongue in double speak  
Pretty soon you just might  
Spring a leak  
Inhale before you begin  
Your iron lungs a bag of wind  
  
Theres a fire in the hole  
Fire in the hole  
Theres a fire in the hole hey hey hey hey hey  
Fire  
  
Sweet n sour filiblister  
Faucet pouring fresh n bitter  
Come on smile and say cheese  
On a count of three  
Ya got a mindful of decavities  
Hey  
  
Chew your words lest you choke  
You better watch your mouth  
Wash it out with soap Yeah  
Tongue tied in a tangled web  
Your bile inside better left unsaid  
  
Theres a fire in the hole  
Fire in the hole hey hey hey hey hey  
Theres a fire in the hole hey hey hey hey hey  
Fire  
Ah shoot it

Fire in the hole hey hey hey hey hey

A fire  
  
Rudder of ship which sets the course  
Does not the bit bridle the horse  
Great is the forest set by a small flame  
Like a tongue on fire no one can tame
