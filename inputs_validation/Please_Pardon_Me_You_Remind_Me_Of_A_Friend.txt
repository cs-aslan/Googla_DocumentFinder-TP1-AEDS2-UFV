Please pardon me but Im longing to speak  
I hope you dont mind my staring  
I dont mind cause your face looks so kind  
Seldom youll find someone so daring  
  
You remind me of a friend of mine  
Ooh Ive lost the time yeah  
  
Everytime I see your face  
You remind me of that someone  
In fact its true its you  
Runnin right into you  
  
I hope you dont mind you look like a friend of mine  
And its seldom you find a face thats so kind  
I hope you dont mind you look like a friend of mine  
And its seldom you find a face thats so kind  
  
Please pardon me but Im longing to speak  
I hope you dont mind my starin  
I dont mind cause your face looks so kind  
Seldom youll find someone so daring  
  
Everytime I see your face  
You remind me of that someone  
In fact it was you  
Runnin right into you
