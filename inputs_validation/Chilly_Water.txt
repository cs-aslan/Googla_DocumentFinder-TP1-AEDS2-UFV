In the easy chair with my boots on  
Melted whiskey in my hand  
I couldnt have been asleep for more than three hours  
Time to go to work again  
  
Once more I beat the sunrise  
And theres a dark breeze at my door  
Raise the water from the well up to my face  
How could a man like me be poor  
  
As long as theres water  
Chilly wet water  
Gimme some of that cool water  
  
Well my horses eyes are glassy  
He breathed the city in his lungs last night  
I lead his natural body  
To the trough to regain his might  
  
Red rooster crow them blues here  
That Old Blue he round the bull  
And the mornins crying rays of sunrise  
It hasnt rained for three weeks full  
  
As long as theres water  
Chilly well water  
Gimme some of that cool cool water  
  
Venus light is rising  
I lay my buckets inside the shed  
And theres a man I see  a stranger  
Leaning on the gate outside my fence  
  
Said Im riding out from the city  
Where they started holding water back last night  
I was hoping I could get a drink from your well  
Before I ride on to another city tonight  
  
Before I ride on to another city tonight  
Before I ride on to another city tonight  
Chilly well chilly well water  
Cool well chilly well water  
Before I ride on
