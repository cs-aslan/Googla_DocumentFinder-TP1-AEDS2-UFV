Fighting the odds while we still have time  
There is a limit dont cross that line  
Its no good with water we cannot drink  
Were a ship about to sink  
We pray but the wall is just too high  
We pay with our lives to the dark tower in the sky  
seeest la vie life in the shadows  
seeest la vie theres no tomorrow  
Give us back the blue blue sky  
Where the air is so fresh were eagles fly  
What good is a planet thats slowly dying  
What kind of life can it bring  
We pray but the wall is just too high  
We pay with our lives to the dark tower in the sky  
seeest la vie life in the shadows  
seeest la vie theres no tomorrow
