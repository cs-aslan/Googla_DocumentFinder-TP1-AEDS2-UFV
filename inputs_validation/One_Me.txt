Chorus x2  
There can only be one mecant nobody cant nobody do your body like me  
  
I wanna make you moan  
Do it all night long  
Once I get you home  
Baby girl its on  
Im gonna kiss yo lips  
Then Im gonna raise yo slip  
Im gonna take your hand  
And let you feel these ribs  
Im a winner Im a winner Im a winner  
Im a winner in bed  
Go to dinner go to dinner go to dinner

I wanna show you love  
From the bottom up  
Once the light goes off  
You cant get enough  
I wanna be yo man  
Not a one night stand  
And if you take my hand  
I bet 1 hundred grand  
Im a winner Im a winner Im a winner  
Im a winner in bed yes I am  
Go to dinner go to dinner go to dinner  
And the dinner in bed there can only be

And your gonna see my face  
Come to bed right now lets cover up  
Nothin but sweat comin between us in this place
