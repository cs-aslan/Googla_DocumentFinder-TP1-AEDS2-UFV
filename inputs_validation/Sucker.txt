Shes worked hard to enjoy the weekend  
All glammed up to describe the feeling  
Making her way through the crowd  
Something is driving her wild  
  
Shes turning up the stereo she wants everybody to know  
Shes fixing to see the show  
Shes a suh suh suh sucker for a guitar hero  
  
Her obsession is legendary  
And all her boyfriends temporary  
Her idea of a perfect man  
Plays a custom through a marshall amp  
  
Shes turning up the stereo she wants everybody to know  
Shes fixing to see the show  
Shes a suh suh suh sucker for a guitar hero  
  
God knows she cant control her weakness  
Sometimes she settles for the local talent  
And everyone knows its a phase  
Just happy to kill some time  
Cause shell be back in her rightful place  
When those trucks roll into town  
  
And now she wont need a stereo  
Yeah cause everybody will know  
That shes right there watching the show  
Shell be throwing all her love around  
Now the boys are back in town  
Until she just cant take it no more  
Shes a suh suh suh sucker for a guitar hero
