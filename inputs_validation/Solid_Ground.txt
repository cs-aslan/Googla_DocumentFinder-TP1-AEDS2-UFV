Oh when I get back on solid ground  
Im gonna crawl my way to you  
  
Oh I once was lost and now Im found  
Im gonna do what I should do  
and when I get back on my feet again  
Im gonna run my way to you  
  
Oh when all is lost and come undone  
Im gonna sing out and see ya through  
But no the water  
the water flows over  
  
Oh when I get back off my feet again  
Im gonna crown my days a turn  
  
So all Ive been on my knees again  
and Ill do it all the time  
  
And when I get back on solid ground  
Im gonna crawl my way to you  
  
Oh I once was lost but now Im found  
so heres what Im gonna do  
  
I sing oh the water  
the water flows over  
I sing oh the water  
the water flows over you
