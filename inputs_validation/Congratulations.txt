Congratulations  
Oh seems like youve done it again  
And  
I aint had such misery since  
I dont know when  
Oh and I dont know when  
Oh and I dont know when  
  
I notice so many people slippin away  
And many more waiting in the lines  
In the courtrooms today  
Oh in the courtrooms today  
  
Love is not a game  
Love is not a toy  
Loves no romance  
Love will do you in and love will wash you out  
And needless to say you wont stand a chance  
And you wont stand a chance  
  
Im hungry for learnin  
Wont you answer me please  
Can a man and a woman live together in peace  
Oh live together in peace
