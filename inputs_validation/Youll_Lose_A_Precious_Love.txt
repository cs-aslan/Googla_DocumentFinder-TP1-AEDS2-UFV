One day you will be cared to realize  
By the look thats in my eyes  
  
Chorus  
How much I love you  
Love you  
And if you leave youll lose a precious love  
Youll lose a precious love  
  
Somehowthese arms of mine cant let you go  
The touch of my hand baby should let you know  
  
Chorus  
  
We go together like hand and glove  
Dont destroy our precious love  
Somehow these arms of mine cant let you go  
The touch of my hand should let you know
