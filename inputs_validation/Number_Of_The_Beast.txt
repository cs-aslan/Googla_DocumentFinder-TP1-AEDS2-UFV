Left alone my mind was blank  
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind  
  
What did I see can I believe  
That what I saw that night was real  
And not just fantasy  
  
Just what I saw in my old dreams  
Were they reflections of my warped mind  
Staring back at me  
  
Cause in my dreams its always there  
The evil face that twists my mind and brings  
Me to despair  
  
Sixsixsix the number of the beast  
Hell and fire was spawned to be released  
  
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised  
As they start to cry hands held to the sky  
In the night the fires burning bright  
The ritual has begun Satans work is done  
  
Sixsixsix the number of the beast  
Sacrifice is going on tonight  
  
Im coming back I will return  
And Ill possess your body and Ill make you burn  
I have the fire I have the force  
I have the power to make my evil take its course
