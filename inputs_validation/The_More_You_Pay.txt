The auctioneer said Im not through yet  
Heres a horse the likes of which youve never seen  
And the straw hats in the sun with a face beneath each one  
Shown doubtful and the auctioneer got mean  
Do you think that you can find a horse like this every day  
I dont think theres any better on this earth  
And the more you pay the more its worth  
  
Then out she came a snowwhite mare  
Prancin and a dancin in the silver sun  
They watched her from behind as she did her bump and grind  
Walkin naked sad and graceful for their fun  
Oh how I wished I could afford that lady painted white  
A queen with high nobility of birth  
But the more you pay the more its worth  
  
My pockets hung with empty blues  
Silent heels were standin on my growin pains  
My bid was not too bad two bits was all I had  
And the stable boy just handed me the reins  
Well the gallery went wild and the auctioneer half smiled  
What we dont sell we shoot or give away  
Cause the more you pay the more its worth  
  
And where was the boy who rode on her back  
With his arms holding tight round her neck  
How tightly he clung  
When they both were young  
And fate had not let this poor girl be so  
Disgraced
