When you walked up behind me and covered my eyes  
And whispered in my ear guess who  
I rattled off names like I really didnt know  
But all along I knew it was you  
  
And the longer we talked the more we laughed  
And wondered why we didnt last  
It had been a long time but later last night  
Baby we caught up real fast  
  
Chorus  
And maybe its a little too early  
To know if this is gonna work  
All I know is youre sure looking  
Good in my shirt  
  
Thats right  
You look good in my shirt  
  
Well now Im not saying that we solved overnight  
Every way that we went wrong  
Oh but what Im seeing Id sure love seeing  
Every morning from now on  
  
Chorus  
  
cmon now  
Aww thats right  
Oh you look so fine  
  
Chorus x2  
  
You look good in my shirt  
You look good in my shirt
