Youre hunting me  
In the night and in your fantasy  
Its the sign of the gypsy queen  
An endless dream  
Youre hunting me  
I feel the need  
I never felt love so deep  
Love is so dangerous mysterious  
I try to win baby  
  
Oh in Shaire  
You wont have my love for free  
You are selling frozen tears  
A journey to my heart and fears in Shaire  
In Shaire you will play a game with me  
You are stealing memories  
My heartbeat is a loving beat in Shaire  
  
In Shaire you try  
Breaking the rules  
Make white doves cry  
In Shaire I know  
All your love will come and go  
When I say you will take all my feelings away  
In Shaire  
  
Youre hunting me  
Winning games of the night I see  
Loving you such is such a thrill  
You make me feel  
Youre hunting me  
Youre holding me  
Im lost in a lonely sea  
And behind your painted smile  
Youre a child  
Try to win baby
