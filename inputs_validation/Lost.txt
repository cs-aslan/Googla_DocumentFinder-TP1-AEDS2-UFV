I cant believe its over  
I watched the whole thing fall  
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall  
If I only knew  
The days were slipping past  
That the good things never last  
That you were cryin  
  
Summer turned to winter  
And the snow it turned to rain  
Then the rain turned into tears upon your face  
I hardly recognize the girl you are today  
And God I hope its not too late  
Its not too late  
  
Cuz you are not alone  
Im always there with you  
And well get lost together  
Till the light comes pouring through  
When you feel like youre done  
And the darkness has won  
Babe youre not lost  
  
When your worlds crashing down  
And you cant bear the thought  
I said babe youre not lost  
  
Life can show no mercy  
It can tear your soul apart  
It can make you feel like youve gone crazy  
But youre not  
Though things have seemed to change  
Theres one thing thats still the same  
In my heart you have remained  
And we can fly fly fly away  
  
Cuz you are not alone  
I am there with you  
And well get lost together  
Till the light comes pouring through  
When you feel like youre done  
And the darkness has won  
Babe youre not lost  
  
When your worlds crashing down  
And you cant bear the thought  
I said baby youre not lost  
  
Mmmm yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I said baby youre not lost  
I said baby youre not lost  
Oh yeah yeah  
I said baby youre not lost
