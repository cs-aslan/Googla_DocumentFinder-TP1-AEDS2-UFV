I thought I would go to the sea and shrink down very tiny  
And slide inside the telephone wire that runs under the briny  
Till I found there is a way of crawling to the USA  
  
You had better not go too far  
Theres one way out theres only one way  
Leave your mother and your father  
Crawling to the USA  
  
Saw it late one night on a secret channel  
Its farther on along the tunnel  
Its way beyond the final station  
Thats the one they never mention  
  
You had better not go too far  
Theres one way out theres only one way  
Leave your mother and your father  
Crawling to the USA  
  
You dont have to pay them that much  
You had better bring your lunch  
Its undercover around the houses  
Up your skirt and down your trousers  
  
You had better not go too far  
Theres one way out theres only one way  
Leave your mother and your father  
Crawling to the USA  
  
She said I catch you taking liberties and they do not impress me  
Attach me to your credit card and then you can undress me  
Everybody is on their knees except the Russians and the Chinese  
  
You had better not go too far  
Theres one way out theres only one way  
Leave your mother and your father  
Crawling to the USA
