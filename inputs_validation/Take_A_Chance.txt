I wanna run my fingers through your hair  
Squeeze your hand and tell you that I care  
Park in the dark and kiss goodnight  
Thrill me hhhold me tight  
Cmon pretty baby you could maybe take a chance with me  
Ill fall still when you walk in the room  
Ill look up and youll be lookin cccool  
Curled up smile upon your lips  
One button low my heart just flips  
Cmon pretty baby you could maybe take a chance with me  
The stars complete the melody  
Could you say you belong to me  
And as they ride the milkyway  
Baby baby can I have this dance  
Baby baby can you take a chance someday  
Did I tell you now  
I wanna
