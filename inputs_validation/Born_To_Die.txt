My oh me my  
Feet dont fail me now  
Take me to your finish line  
Oh my heart it breaks every step that I take  
But Im hoping that the gates theyll tell me that youre mine  
Walking through the city streets  
Is it by mistake or design  
I feel so alone on a Friday night  
Can you make me feel like home if I tell you youre mine  
  
Dont make me sad dont make me cry  
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I dont know why  
Keep making me laugh  
Lets go get high  
The road is long we carry on  
Try to have fun in the meantime  
  
Come take a walk on the wild side  
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain  
You like your girls insane  
So choose your last words this is the last time  
Cause you and I we were born to die  
  
Lost but now I am found  
I can see but once I was blind  
I was so confused as a little child  
Tried to take what I could get  
Scared that I couldnt find  
All the answers honey  
  
Dont make me sad dont make me cry  
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I dont know why  
Keep making me laugh  
Lets go get high  
The road is long we carry on  
Try to have fun in the meantime  
  
Come take a walk on the wild side  
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain  
You like your girls insane  
Choose your last words this is the last time  
Cause you and I we were born to die  
We were born to die  
We were born to die  
  
Come and take a walk on the wild side  
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain  
You like your girls insane  
  
Dont make me sad dont make me cry  
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I dont know why  
Keep making me laugh  
Lets go get high  
The road is long we carry on  
Try to have fun in the meantime  
  
Come take a walk on the wild side  
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain  
You like your girls insane  
Choose your last words this is the last time  
Cause you and I we were born to die We were born to die
