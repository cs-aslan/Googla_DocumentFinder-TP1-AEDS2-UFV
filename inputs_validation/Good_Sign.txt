Nice to see  
Nice to see you Ive been feeling so blue  
Owning up now cause you change my point of view  
Its funny how you do what you do  
Its a very good sign a really good line for you  
Ive been waiting for the heat of the night  
Warming up now and youve got me in your sights  
So tell me what you want me to do  
Its a very good time to tell you Ive been thinking of you  
Because youre wonderful baby and youre beautiful baby  
Its a very good sign a very good time of life  
Let me tell you youre a woman with style  
Ive been waiting but you made it all worthwhile  
And all you had to do was to smile  
Youre a very good sign and everythings fine my child  
cause youre wonderful baby and youre beautiful baby  
Its a very good sign a very good time of life ooh  
Set in my ways I live from day to day happy to be free hey  
Needing for nothing always looking for someone who could make me see  
But baby I was so wrong I sat here waiting too long  
To have you here with me oh  
cause youre wonderful baby and youre beautiful baby  
Its a very good sign a very good time of life  
cause youre wonderful baby and youre beautiful baby  
Its a very good sign a very good time of life oh
