I think back to the time  
When I first saw your face  
You were walkin across the delta  
To your cold and lonely place  
You know I took you for a small girl  
Really not quite seventeen  
Oh Lord but I was wrong oh so wrong  
Youre like a woman Ive never seen  
  
Dark eyed Cajun woman  
Where are you comin from  
Your soul is in the back woods  
They say you never had a home  
But Im gonna know you better  
If it takes all night and day  
Dark eyed Cajun woman  
Youll never get away no no  
  
Now the evenin breeze is blowin  
I hear your voice most everywhere  
Your cold black eyes  
They are dancin in the starlight  
Warmin the cold night air  
Its so beautiful you know I have to say  
Dark eyed Cajun woman  
Youll never get away
