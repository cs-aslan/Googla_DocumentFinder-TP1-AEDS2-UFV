Im driving home for christmas  
Oh I cant wait to see those faces  
Im driving home for christmas yea  
Well Im moving down that line  
And its been so long  
But I will be there  
I sing this song  
To pass the time away  
Driving in my car  
Driving home for christmas  
  
Its gonna take some time  
But Ill get there  
Top to toe in tailbacks  
Oh I got red lights on the run  
But soon therell be a threeway  
Get my feet on holy ground  
  
So I sing for you  
Though you cant hear me  
When I get trough  
And feel you near me  
I am driving home for christmas  
Driving home for christmas  
With a thousand memories  
  
I take look at the driver next to me  
Hes just the same  
Just the same  
  
Top to toe in tailbacks  
Oh I got red lights on the run  
Im driving home for christmas yea  
Get my feet on holy ground  
So I sing for you  
Though you cant hear me  
When I get trough  
And feel you near me  
Driving in my car  
Driving home for christmas  
Driving home for christmas  
With a thousand memories
