She said dont worry baby  
Ill do my own crying  
Im a big girl now  
Now Im gonna be okay  
Yes Ill find a new way of living  
You know I will  
And you lie there without sleeping  
And you stare at your wall  
And you realize youre not weeping  
You dont need her anymore  
You say dont hate me baby  
It wont hurt you if you do  
You got no reason not to  
Shell kiss you on the head  
Says theres no easy road for leaving  
If it hurts you too  
And you lie there without sleeping  
And you stare at your wall  
And you realize youre not weeping  
You dont need her anymore  
You walk by the old place  
Looks like just any other place  
Yeah thats what you say  
You say Ill be okay  
Yes Ill find a new way of living  
Sure I will  
And you lie there without sleeping  
And you stare at your wall  
And you realize youre not weeping  
You dont need her anymore  
And you lie there without sleeping  
And you stare at your wall  
And you realize youre not weeping  
Cause you dont need her anymore  
You guess that its over
