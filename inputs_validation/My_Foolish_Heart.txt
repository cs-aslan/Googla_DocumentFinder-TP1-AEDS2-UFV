The night is like a lovely tune  
Beware my foolish heart  
How white the ever constant moon  
Take care my foolish heart  
  
Theres a line between love and fascination  
Thats hard to see how many names such as this  
For they both have the very same sensation  
When youre locked in the magic of a kiss  
  
Her lips are much too close to mine  
Beware my foolish heart  
But should our eager lips combine  
Then let the fire start  
  
For this time it isnt fascination  
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart  
Its love this time its love  
My foolish heart
