Times are tough on an honest heart  
People dont follow through with what they start  
Lyin eyes looking at me up and down  
Makin talk thats only cheap  
Makin promises they never keep  
But I keep lookin for what I still havent found  
  
Chorus  
One honest heart  
That I can believe in  
Two lovin arms that will never let me go  
One good man that I can count on  
It shouldnt be so hard  
Findin one honest heart  
  
Now Ive been close a time or two  
I thought I saw my dream comin true  
But I was just livin in a fairy tale  
I wont play the fool again  
I wont play a game that I cant win  
But I still have faith and keep tellin myself  
Theres  
  
Chorus
