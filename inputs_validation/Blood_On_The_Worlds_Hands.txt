Sometimes it makes me wonder  
Sometimes it makes me question  
Sometimes it makes me saddened  
Always it makes me angry but  
  
When you can see it happening  
The madness thats all around you  
Nobody seems to worry  
The World seems so powerless to act  
  
Its out of control  
Blood on The Worlds hands  
Each day a new toll  
  
Another assassination  
The same day a new creation  
But what are they coming into  
Security of a world that brings  
  
One day another killing  
Somewhere theres someone starving  
Another a savage raping  
Meanwhile theres someone laughing at us  
  
Its out of control  
Blood on The Worlds hands  
Each day it goes on  
  
Brutality and aggression  
Tomorrow another lesson  
Expecting another air raid  
Praying for a ceasefire  
  
They say things are getting better  
No need to be complacent  
Theres chaos across the border  
And one day it could be happening to us  
  
Its out of control  
Blood in The Worlds hands  
Its our epitaph  
Its out of control  
Someone should know  
Blood on The Worlds hands  
  
Someone should
