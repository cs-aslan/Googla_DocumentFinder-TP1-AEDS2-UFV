The sky looks pissed  
The wind talks back  
My bones are shifting in my skin  
And you my love are gone  
  
My room seems wrong  
The bed wont fit  
I cannot seem to operate  
And you my love are gone  
  
So glide away on soapy heels  
And promise not to promise anymore  
And if you come around again  
Then I will take then I will take the chain from off the door  
  
Ill never say Ill never love  
But I dont say a lot of things  
And you my love are gone  
  
So glide away on soapy heels  
And promise not to promise anymore  
And if you come around again  
Then I will take then I will take the chain from off the door
