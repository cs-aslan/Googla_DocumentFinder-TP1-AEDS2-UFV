Fire in her eyes  burn   
Perfume of the skies   
Fingers cold as ice  freeze   
Devil in disguise  
  
Well shes a shes a shes a  
You know that shes a hellcat hellcat hellcat hellcat  
Shes gonna scratch up your mind   
You know that guy with piccadillyeyes  
Was talking to the French boy  
But didnt realize  
Bananalongboateating  
An he tried to get a wife  
But he couldnt stay alive  
Well you know that lad with the rubberdad  
Paints his fingers yellow blue and red  
An you also know that shes a liar  
Knowing only her desire
