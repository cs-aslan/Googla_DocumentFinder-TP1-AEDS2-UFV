Running men is looking on Why  
Why dont you come out to play  
And get closer to your animal inside  
  
PreChorus  
Ready I act like the gentleman that your mother would love  
Ooh get to know me  
Baby you act like a lady dont have to cover it up  
Things you wanna show me  
Make me remember the reason why I wanted to love  
Please be slowly  
I think youre ready to try  
Walk a little closer and  
  
Chorus  
Now take me to your jungle Im not afraid  
And if youre looking for your animal hop in my cage  
Fall in a terror of height dont talk
