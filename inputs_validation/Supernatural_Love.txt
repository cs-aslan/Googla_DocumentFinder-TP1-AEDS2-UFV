We were strangers  
Who one were lovers  
Weve been everlasting friends  
  
I was shattered  
When you walked out boy  
I was walking off the edge  
  
Friends said i looked so downhearted  
When you left  
Now my broken heart is stable  
Im starting to mend  
Got you back and Im living again  
  
Oh this must be love  
That sets my soul on fire  
A supernatural love  
this must be  
That makes my flame burn higher  
A supernatural love  
  
Life was only tear drops falling down  
From my eyes  
Now my broken heart is stable  
Oh Im coming alive  
I cant fight what Im feeling inside  
  
This must be love  
That sets my soul on fire  
A supernatural love  
oh this must be  
That makes my flame burn higher  
A supernatural love  
That gets me so excited  
A supernatural love  
oh this must be  
That makes us true survivors  
A supernatural love
