Ill be there to hold you by the hand  
When you need someone to walk you home  
You know that Ill be there to understand  
When you call me on the phone  
Ill be there to watch you when you sleep  
When you close your eyes at night  
And Ill be there to keep your secrets kept  
  
Cross my heart hope to die  
I swear each word is true  
Theres only one thing I wouldnt do  
Ill be there when you need a real friend  
Ill be there to listen to your secrets  
Ill be there and give you all Ive got  
Ill be there when you paint your masterpiece  
And Ill be right beside your every move  
  
Ill give you my eyes so you can see  
And Ill help you to find the things youve lost  
When youre busting at the seams  
I swear each word is true  
Theres only one thing I wouldnt do  
I aint gonna love you  
I aint gonna love you  
  
Nobody wants you like I want you  
Nobody needs you like I need you  
You know I would beg and plead get down on my knees  
Id do most anything its true  
But I aint gonna love you  
I aint gonna love you  
Cause I love you  
Ill be there to love the things you love  
Ill be the one who knows your middle name  
  
Be the only one that you can trust  
Ill give you the blood thats in my veins  
I swear these words are true  
Theres only one thing I wouldnt do  
I aint gonna love you  
  
Cause nobody wants you like I want you  
Nobody needs you like I need you  
You know I would beg and please get down on my knees  
Do most anything for you  
But I aint gonna love you  
I aint gonna love  
Cause I love you  
Because I love you
