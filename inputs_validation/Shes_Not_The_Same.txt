Ah the living aint easy  
With all of these false emotions  
Too little devotion and Im tired of just  
Being alone shes not the same  
Shes a son of a gun shes a red hot flame  
She lights the sun and conjures up the rain  
  
Like any good gambler  
I was chained to a wishing well  
I keep wishing in vain but listen friend  
Dont look now shes right behind you  
Looking for someone to take her inside  
It thrills her so its a rainbow ride  
  
Im a little uneasy  
And there aint much pride inside me  
She dont know how it hurts and Im telling you  
Its too late now shes not the same  
Shes a red hot kid shes a crying shame  
  
Anytime is the right time  
To get on with a new tomorrow  
But I could never let yesterday go  
And when the falling rain makes me sad  
She comes to me in the dreams Ive had  
In the morning light in the dead of night  
  
Ah the loving aint easy  
I let it get the best of me  
She dont know how it hurts and Im telling you  
Its too late now she dont talk no more  
She dont make me feel like she did before  
Theres too much wait and too much give and take  
  
Im a little uneasy  
And there aint much pride inside me  
She dont know how it hurts and Im telling you  
Its too late now shes not the same  
Its too late now shes not the same  
Its too late now shes not the same
