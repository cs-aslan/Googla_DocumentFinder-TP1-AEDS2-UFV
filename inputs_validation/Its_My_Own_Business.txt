I am tired of you telling me what I ought to do  
Stickin your nose in my business and it dont concern you  
Its my own business its my own business  
Seems like the ones that want to tell you  
They dont ever know as much as you  
If I go buy a Cadillac convertible coupe  
And all I got at home to eat is just onion soup  
Its my own business its my own business  
If I would rather ride around  
In my own Cadillac convertible coupe  
If Is a dignatary on Capitol Hill  
And up and married me a waitress in a hot dog grill  
Its my own business its my own business  
Because I am not a juvenile  
And I can go out at my own free wil  
After workin on my job and then drawin my pay  
If I want to go out and have a ball and throw it all away  
Its my own business its my own business  
Cause I dont wait until tomorrow  
To do something I could do today
