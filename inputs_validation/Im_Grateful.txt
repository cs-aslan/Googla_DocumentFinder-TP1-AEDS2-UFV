I woke up this morning closed in my right mind  
Counting all the blessings Ive had in my lifetime  
Im so fortunate to have someone like God  
Heavenly Father  
  
When I was having so many problems  
No one but Him could help me solve them  
He stepped in and He made everything okay  
And for this Im so grateful  
  
Im grateful so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
Im grateful Im so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
  
I dont mind sharing my testimony  
To anyone who hear it cause Im lead by the spirit  
And its possible that something I might say  
To help along the way  
  
Been through the storm but here Im still standing  
On solid ground I keep on landing  
Thats why I have so much faith in God  
For His love Im grateful  
  
Im grateful so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
Im grateful Im so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
  
Im grateful so thankful  
To be in the land of the living  
Im grateful Im so thankful  
To be in the land of the living
