At an antique desk  
An old man sits alone  
Its Christmas Eve  
And its almost time to go  
  
He signs his name to a letter he just wrote  
Then he reads it back with a voice as soft as snow  
  
Chorus  
I want peace on earth for Christmas  
In a world where theres not one hungry child  
They would hope and faith  
Conquers fear and hate  
All Im asking for is a little more love  
  
Then he walks outside  
And he climbs up on his sleigh  
And calls out to his reindeer  
Off they fly away  
Oh tonight hell make a million dreams appear  
While he wishes that his own dreams would come true this year  
  
Chorus  
  
That they would hope and faith  
Conquers fear and hate  
All Im asking for is a little more love
