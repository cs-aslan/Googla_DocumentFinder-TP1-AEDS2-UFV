What is the meaning  
Of the morning rain  
I got a feeling  
Its no good  
I waited for my baby  
But she never made the train  
Now Im hoping  
At the next stop she will be there  
Shell catch my eye  
And satisfy my every care  
This seats been taken  
Dont ask me where shes coming from  
Youre quite mistaken  
You know shes gonna be here  
I know shes gonna come  
She must have a reason  
I will understand  
I know shell turn up  
By and by  
Ill see her standing  
With a suitcase in her hand  
And shell tell me  
How she couldnt find a pay phone  
Shell start to cry  
Ill realize Im not alone
