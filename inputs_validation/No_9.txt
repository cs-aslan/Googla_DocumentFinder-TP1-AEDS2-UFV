Take my money   
Is all I think  
He looks at the earring  
Fag he mumbles  
I dont mind  
Hes fat  
No one likes him  
Lifes too short  
I pass a table of black girls  
With short hair  
They look like men  
They all look the same  
I can hear the strobe now  
Its loud  
And the musics too bright  
I look for my friends  
But I cant remember if I came alone  
Or not  
Doesnt matter though  
Theres hundreds of people  
Who have waited all their lives  
No doubt  
To be my friend  
And as I near the bar  
I see two persons  
Eating each others faces  
I bark to the bartender  
He gives me a placebo  
Im so young he tells me  
To be here  
I nod and swallow the bland drink  
Then I stumble several times  
Near a crowd  
And they think Im a good dancer  
I hear a girl tell another girl  
That some girl she knows  
Watched a  
Girl  
Puke in the toilet  
I smile in their general direction  
The goodlooking one comes over  
And bites my cheek  
It hurts  
And I start to  
Hit her  
But shes grinning  
And I can see my blood on her teeth  
And I pull her to me  
My place or yours  
The gutter will be fine she confesses  
As we walk out  
She takes another bite from my cheek  
And I smile at the fat man  
By the door
