Im shufflin through the Texas sand  
but my heads in Mississippi  
Im shufflin through the Texas sand  
but my heads in Mississippi  
The blues has got a hold of me  
I believe Im gettin dizzy  
  
Help me now  
  
I keep thinkin bout that night in Memphis  
Lord I thought I was in Heaven  
I keep thinkin bout that night in Memphis  
I thought I was in Heaven  
But I was stumblin through the parking lot  
of an invisible seven eleven  
  
What was I doin out there  
  
Wheres my head baby  
Somewhere in Mississippi  
  
Last night I saw a cowgirl  
She was floatin across the ceiling  
And last night I saw a naked cowgirl  
She was floatin across the ceiling  
She was mumblin to some howlin wolf  
about some voodoo healin  
  
Mmm Baby
