Here is a song  
It reminds me of when we were young  
Looking back at all the things weve done  
You gotta keep on keepin on  
  
Out to sea its the only place I honestly  
Cant get myself some piece of mind  
You know its getting hard to fly  
  
If Im to fall  
Would you be there to applaud  
Or would you hide behind them all  
Cause if I have to go  
In my heart you grow  
And thats where you belong  
  
If Im to fall  
Would you be there to applaud  
Or would you hide behind them all  
Cause if I have to go  
In my heart youll grow  
And thats where you belong  
  
If Im to fall  
Would you be there to applaud  
Or would you hide behind them all  
Cause if I have to go  
In my heart youll grow  
And thats where you belong  
  
Guess Im outta time  
Im outta time  
Im outta time  
Im outta time  
Im outta time
