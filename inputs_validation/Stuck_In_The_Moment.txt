With you  
With you  
I wish we had another time  
I wish we had another place  
  
Now Romeo and Juliet  
Bet they never felt the way we felt  
Bonnie and Clyde  
Never had to hide like  
We do  
We do  
  
You and I both know it cant work  
Its all fun and games  
Til someone gets hurt  
And I dont  
I wont let that be you  
  
Now you dont wanna let go  
And I dont wanna let you know  
There might be something real between us two who knew  
Now we dont wanna fall but  
Were tripping in our hearts and its reckless and clumsy  
Cause I know you cant love me here  
  
I wish we had another time  
I wish we had another place  
But everything we had is stuck in the moment  
And theres nothing my heart can do can do  
To fight with time and space cause  
Im still stuck in the moment with you  
  
See like Adam and Eve  
Tragedy was our destiny  
Like Sunny and Cher  
I dont care  
I got you baby  
  
See we both  
Fightin every inch of our fiber  
Cause aint no way  
Its gonna end right but  
We are both too foolish to stop  
  
Now you dont wanna let go  
And I dont wanna let you know  
That there might be something real between us two who knew  
And we dont wanna fall but  
Were tripping in our hearts and its reckless and clumsy  
And I know you cant love me here  
  
I wish we had another time  
I wish we had another place  
But everything we had is stuck in the moment cause  
Im still stuck in the moment with you  
  
See like  
Just because this cold cold world saying we cant be  
Baby we both have the right to disagree  
And I aint with it  
And I dont wanna be so old and gray  
Reminiscin bout these better days  
But conventions telling us to let go  
So well never know  
  
I wish we had another time  
I wish we had another place  
Cause everything we did  
And everything we have is stuck in the moment  
Yeah  
  
I wish we had another time  
I wish we had another place  
But everything we have is stuck in the moment  
And theres nothing my heart can do  
Nothing my heart can do  
To fight with time and space cause and space  
Im still stuck in the moment with you  
Yeah
