And heres one of the nations top tunes  
As a matter of fact its number one in your hit parade  
The nations big hit coming in on a Wing And A Prayer  
  
Coming in on a wing and a prayer  
Coming in on a wing and a prayer  
Coming in on a wing and a prayer  
Coming in a plane  
  
Though theres one who is gone we still carry on  
Were coming in on a wing and a prayer  
A wing and a prayer  
Watta show what a fight  
Watta show watta fight  
  
Yup we really hit our target for tonight  
Hit our target tonight  
How we sing as we lift through the air  
We lift while we are singing  
  
Look below theres our field over there  
Over there  
With a full throttle on and our struts in a storm  
Were coming in on a wing
