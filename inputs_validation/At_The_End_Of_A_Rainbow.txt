At the end of a rainbow  
Youll find a pot of gold  
At the end of a story  
Youll find its all been told  
  
But our love has a treasure  
Our hearts cant always spend  
And it has a story without any end  
  
At the end of a river  
The water stops its flow  
At the end of a highway  
Theres no place you can go  
  
But just tell me you love me  
And you are only mine  
And our love will go on til the end of time  
  
At the end of the rainbow  
Youll find a pot of gold  
At the end of a story  
Youll find its all been told  
  
But our love has a treasure  
Our hearts cant always spend  
And it has a story without any end  
  
At the end of a river  
The water stops its flow  
At the end of a highway  
Theres no place you can go  
  
But just tell me you love me  
And you are only mine  
And our love will go on  
Til the eend of time  
  
Til the end of time
