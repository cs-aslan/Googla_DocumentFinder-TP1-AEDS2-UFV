Verse 1  
When I cannot hear the sparrow sing  
And I cannot feel the melody  
Theres a secret place thats full of grace  
Theres a blessing in the storm  
Help me sing it  
Theres a blessing in the storm  
  
Verse 2  
When the sickness wont leave my body  
And the pain just wont leave my soul  
I get on my knees and say Jesus please  
Theres a blessing in the storm  
Help me sing it  
Theres a blessing in the storm  
  
Verse 3  
When I cannot seem to love again  
And the raindrops wont ever end  
If you just hold on  
Those clouds will soon be gone  
Theres a blessing in the storm  
Help me sing it  
Theres a blessing in the storm  
Sweet sweet the storm sweet  
repeat verse 3
