Some people always complain that their life is too short so they hurry it
along  
Their worries drive them insane but they still go along for the ride  
As for me  
I have all the time in the world  
  
I was born  
A someday man  
Im a maybe child  
I was born  
A someday man  
I was always wild  
  
Tomorrows a new day baby  
Anything can happen  
Anything can happen at all  
  
Some folks are working for reasons and waiting for answers theyre never  
gonna find  
They keep on searching for pleasures and looking for what they cant see  
But for me  
Life can be a sweet holiday  
  
I was born  
A someday man  
Im a maybe child  
I was born  
A someday man  
I was always wild  
  
Tomorrows a new day baby  
Anything can happen  
Anything can happen at all  
  
I was born  
A someday man  
Im a maybe child  
I was born  
A someday man  
I was always wild  
  
I was born  
A someday man  
Im a maybe child  
I was born  
A someday man  
I was always wild
