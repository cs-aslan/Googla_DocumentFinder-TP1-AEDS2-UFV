Its only human to want  
To inhabit every feeling youve got  
And more often than not  
Lets take it to the nth degree  
  
Here he goes  
Gimmie ten bucks and a head start  
Heres where he goes  
The puzzles pullin apart  
  
And heres the scene  
Youre yellin calmly out the street  
Are we family or what  
  
From happygolucky  
To surlygocrazy the lot  
And more often than not  
Admission to the battles is free  
  
Here he goes  
Gimmie ten bucks and a head start  
Heres where he goes  
Pullin the puzzle apart  
  
And heres the scene  
Where you whisper down the crookedest street  
Are we family or what  
  
Are we family when its only if not when  
Sisters and brothers wolf wolf lover  
And the boy who stamped too many ants  
Are we family  
  
Its only human to want  
To inherit every feeling youve got  
And like it or not  
Lets take it to the nth degree  
  
Here we go  
Give us ten bucks and a head start  
Heres where we go  
The puzzles pullin apart  
  
And heres the scene  
Your horse is going the wrong way up the street  
Are we family or what  
  
Are we family when its not if but when  
Taking care of each other one bullet to another  
When its all if a song cant save us then nothing can  
Are we family or what  
Are we family   
  
Are we family or what  
To one another the lost to the recovered  
Incomprehensible  
Are we family or what  
The tribal jury to the Pakistani teen  
  
Are we family or what  
Illstarred evenings to champion mystique  
Are we family or what  
Sick as a writer writing to be lighter than the uncanny are we family  
When the invasion of Antarcticas complete are we family
