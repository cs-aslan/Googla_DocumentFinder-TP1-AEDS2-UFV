Ten million stories in the city  
Ten million backs against the wall  
Desperations out tonight  
You can cut it with a knife  
Everybody wants to have it all  
Well they tell you that the world is rough  
But they never rocked it hard enough  
  
Hey little Caesar  
Nobody messing with you  
Hey little Caesar  
Go show em what you can do  
  
Nobody said that it was pretty no no  
You havent got a penny or a prayer  
You know its gonna be a fight  
If you want to see your name in lights  
Aint nobody gives a damn out there  
Well you got your guts and you got your pride  
Youll never let them see inside  
  
Hey little Caesar  
Nobody messing with you  
Hey little Caesar  
Go show em what you can do  
Let them show em what you can do  
  
Well you dont believe in the books and rules  
Cause you just believe what you know is cool  
Well they try to tell you that the world is rough  
But they never rocked it hard enough  
I cant hear you oh yeah  
  
Well they just dont understand  
You gotta fight to be a man  
  
Hey little Caesar  
Nobody messing with you  
Hey little Caesar  
Go show em what you can do  
  
Hey little Caesar

Hey little Caesar
