Sometimes I look up high  
And then I think there might  
Just be a better life  
Away from all we know  
Thats where I wanna go  
Out on the wild side  
And I wish I was  
Oh oh oh oh a wild west hero  
  
Ride the range all the day  
Till the first fading light  
Be with my western girl  
Round the fire oh so bright  
Id be the indians friend  
Let them live to be free  
Ridin into the sunset  
I wish I could be  
  
Id ride the desert sands  
And through the prairie lands  
Tryin to do whats right  
The folks would come to me  
Theyd say we need you here  
Id stay there for the night  
Oh I wish I was  
Oh oh oh oh a wild west hero  
  
Ride the range all the day  
Till the first fading light  
Be with my western girl  
Round the fire oh so bright  
Id be the indians friend  
Let them love to be free  
Ridin into the sunset  
I wish I could be
