From the dark cafes of Paris  
To the streets of Amsterdam  
From the homes of old Vienna  
To the shores of Uncle Sam  
Wherever freedoms hope is true  
Each heart cries out to you  
  
Dont give up Tommy Atkins  
Be a stout fella  
Chin up Cheerio Carry on  
Keep a stiff upper lip  
When youre in doubt fella  
Chin up Cheerio Carry on  
  
Oh the suns sure to smile  
On your tight little isle  
So hang on to your wits  
And youll turn the blitz on Fritz  
Theres a whole world behind you  
Shoutin stout fella  
Chin up Cheerio Carry on
