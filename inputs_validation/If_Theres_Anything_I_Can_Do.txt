Baby Im so sorry your world came crashing in  
Its times like these you need a friend  
You dont have to worry its out of our hands  
I believe that were part of a much bigger plan  
  
Chorus  
If theres anything I can do  
Just call and Ill come runnin  
I will always be here for you  
If theres anything I can do  
  
Your eyes are filled with sorrow  
Your heart is filled with pain  
Just let the tears fall down like rain  
I promise you tomorrow  
The sun is gonna shine  
All you can do is take it one day at a time  
  
Chorus
