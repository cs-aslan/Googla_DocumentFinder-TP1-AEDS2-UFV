Nnnnot too far but long ago  
When life was straight up and cars would move slow  
When you were cool if you were pigeontoed  
But things have changed it aint so simple  
Now life is a musical  
  
I called Big Boi on the telephone  
I said hey hold up fore we put out another song  
Say no matter what goes down we stand strong  
Cause aint nothing changed its simple  
Now lets make a musical  
  
Based on big infection  
No words like such grow in some action  
And you got us well to a fraction  
Cause things have changed its all hood  
The Kast go Hollywood  
  
Chorus  
Dont let em dont let em Repeat x2  
Change us change us  
Change us change us  
Dont let em dont let em Repeat x2  
Change us change us  
Change us change us  
Dont let em dont let em Repeat x2  
Change us change us  
Change us change us  
Dont let em dont let em Repeat x4  
  
Dont
