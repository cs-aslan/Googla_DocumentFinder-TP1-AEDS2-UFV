When someone becomes nothing to anyone  
Whilst feelings have died  
Anyone would know it  
They set out stick and stones  
They say theyd crush my bones  
I say I dont get mad I get even  
Before they do  
  
Spoils go to the victor  
Im dead on time  
Your time is going to come  
  
Chorus  
One day Ill dance on your graves  
Even if youre buried at sea  
Till then till when I exact my revenge  
Ill tell them youre dead to me  
  
Were all just trying to hold on to anything  
Youd think theyd know thats what were trying to do  
These wounds are invisible  
Underneath the dirt I still see the scars  
But then when things got bad we spread our wings and fly away  
  
Youll take all of your riches in the back of a hearse  
Your time is going to come  
  
Chorus  
  
One day Ill dance on your graves  
Even if youre buried at sea  
Till then till when I exact my revenge  
  
Chorus
