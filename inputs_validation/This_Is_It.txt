Thereve been times in my life  
Ive been wonderin why  
Still somehow I believed wed always survive  
Now Im not so sure  
Youre waiting here one good reason to try  
But what more can I say Whats left to provide  
  
You think that maybe its over  
Only if you want it to be  
Are you gonna wait for a sign your miracle  
Stand up and fight  
  
This is it  
Make no mistake where you are  
This is it  
You backs to the corner  
This is it  
Dont be a fool anymore  
This is it  
  
The waiting is over no dont you run  
No way to hide  
No time for wonderin why  
Its here the moment is now about to decide  
Let em believe  
Leave em behind  
But keep me near in your heart  
Know whatever you do Im here by your side  
  
You say that maybe its over  
Not if you dont want it to be  
For once in your life heres your miracle  
Stand up and fight  
  
This is it  
Make no mistake where you are  
This is it  
Youre goin no further  
This is it  
Until its over and done  
  
No one can tell what the future holds  
Ohohohoh  
Who makes the choice of how it goes  
Its not up to me this time  
You know  
Comes a day in every life  
  
This is it  
Make no mistake where you are  
This is it  
Youre goin no further  
This is it  
Until its over and done  
This is it  
One way or another  
This is it  
No one can tell what the future holds  
This is it  
Your backs to the corner  
This is it  
You make the choice of how it goes  
This is it  
The waiting is over  
This is it  
No one can tell what the future holds  
This is it  
One way or another  
This is it
