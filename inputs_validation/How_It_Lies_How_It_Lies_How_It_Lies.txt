If you think candys sweet  
Theres a girl you ought to meet  
Sugar drips from her lips  
When she sighs  
  
But the love light that lies  
Within my babys eyes  
How it lies how it lies  
How it lies  
  
She has style she has charms  
And a pair of loving arms  
That Im dying  
To try on for size  
  
But the love light that lies  
Within my babys eyes  
How it lies how it lies  
How it lies  
  
Oh her name tops the list of every florist  
Her beaus stand ten deep in line  
With all of the trees in the forest  
Why should I be the only clinging vine  
  
Oh theres heartbreak in store  
Where the one that you adore  
Is a devil  
In the angel disguise  
  
But the love light that lies  
Is the love light that dies  
How it lies how it lies  
How it lies
