Spent the morning  unaware  
Spent the daytime  didnt care  
Spent the evening  drawing breath  
Spent the nightime  fearing death  
One more down some more to go  
Then Ill know or I wont know  
If all the songs I hear you sing  
Are everything or anything  
Saw a picture I didnt know  
Of a football game played 50 years ago  
You see the jerseys being worn so proud  
But look behind them look up at the crowd  
A sea of heads pointing right up to the sky  
Some of them are still with us and some of them have died  
I think the ones whove left are still with us aswell  
Cause I can hear them when the voices start to swell  
One more down some more to go  
Then Ill know or I wont know  
If all the songs I hear you sing  
Are everything or anything  
Well I hear you I dont see you  
Yes I hear you but I dont see you  
But it wont be long till Im gone  
And then Ill know if my ears or eyes are wrong  
Spent the morning  unaware  
Spend the daytime  didnt care  
Spent the evening  drawing breath  
Spent the nightime  fearing death  
One more down some more to go  
Then Ill know or I wont know  
If all the songs I hear you sing  
Are everything or anything  
One more down some more to go  
Then Ill know or I wont know  
If all the songs I hear you sing  
Are everything or anything
