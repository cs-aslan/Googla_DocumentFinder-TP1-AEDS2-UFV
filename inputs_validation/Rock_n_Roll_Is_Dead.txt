You think youre on top of the world  
But you know its really over  
Runnin round with diamond rings  
And coke spoons that are overflowin  
Rock n roll is dead  
  
But all the money in the world  
Cant buy you from the place youre going to  
  
Rock n roll is dead  
Rock n roll is dead  
Rock n roll is dead  
  
You cant even sing or play an instrument  
So you just scream instead  
Youre living for an image  
So you got five hundred women in your bed  
Rock n roll is dead  
  
But its real hard to be yourself  
When youre living with those demons in your head  
  
Rock n roll is dead  
Rock n roll is dead  
Rock n roll is dead  
  
Rock n roll is dead  
Rock n roll is dead  
Rock n roll is dead  
Rock n roll is dead  
  
Rock n roll is dead  
Rock n roll is dead  
Rock n roll is dead
