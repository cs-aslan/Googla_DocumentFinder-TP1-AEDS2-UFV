I live to work and work to live  
Oh but what i wouldnt give  
For a ray of sun and a little piece of beach  
Where the sand dollar is the only currency  
  
Chorus  
I vote we go to the gulf of mexico  
You and me by the sea  
Palm trees call me oh thats the place i want to be  
Down where the southern breezes blow  
On the Gulf of Mexico  
  
Right at five oclock today  
Ill pick you up well drive away  
And i cant wait to feel the sand beneath my toes  
And i can almost see the sunburn on your nose  
  
Repeat chorus  
Vamos we go repeat chorus again  
Tag  
Down where the southern breezes blow  
On the Gulf of Mexico  
  
On the Gulf of Mexico  
Thats the place i want to be  
  
Down where the southern breezes blow  
On the Gulf of Mexico
