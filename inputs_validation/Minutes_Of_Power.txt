Verse 1  
Crank it up yo and let me hear that system bump  
cause with this here I gotta get over the hump  
And you know what that means that means  
Kickin out funky rhymes G rhymes G  
I got the funky rhymes thatll please thatll please  
And my jams break overseas overseas  
So when I come to town be prepared to be hyped up  
cause when the mics turned on I get psyched up psyched up  
The VIP gets it started with intro  
Bustin smooth moves on top of instrumental  
Turn up the beats in the Jeeps louder  
Here we go yall  with minutes of power  
Minutes of power  
Verse 2  
Minutes of power  
When I step to the mic  bro  
Vanilla Ice does it right  
And what Im sayin is  Yo  
Ya suckers frontin what ya wantin is for me to fade  
Thought I was outta here fools  
I aint goin away  
Back with the track that will keep my bank fat  
HA Vanillas got the flavor for the funky format  
And if youre not givin up the credit I seek  
VIPs in the house and theyre ready to creep  
Now whatcha gonna do when my boys are on you  
You know a hard head makes for a soft shoe  
So turn it up for the passengers  LOUDER  
Its Vanilla Killa with the Minutes of Power  
Verse 3  
Walk through the smoke on the stage  
And the girls scream  
Ice gets em hot then they melt like ice cream  
Flowin with the swiftness  
Kickin it with the quickness  
Fellas gettin jealous cause their girlies want a quick kiss  
When Im rolllin around in my 50 drop top  
Turning up the sounds  
cause I want to bump the hip hop  
People gettin mad cause they hear the big bass hit  
I turn it up more just to let cha know I wont quit  
Ice has got it locked down and theres no stoppin it  
When I hear a track like this  
You know that Ill be rocking it  
Sounds so sweet it could never be sour  
Here we go yall with the  
Mminutes of power  
Verse 4  
Nows the time for the Ice to let a rhyme rip  
Loadin up my lyrics with a 9 double M clip  
Shootin all enemies youre not even a friend of me  
I aint Spike Lee so I do the wrong thing G  
So down with Luther Campbell OH NO  
I dont think so  
Travel state to state an and the Ice man rips shows  
Steppin in my path an you might get broken  
I got it goin on an you know I aint jokin  
Power every hour an the Ice keeps risin  
Sellin out arenas so dont look surprised  
When Vanilla shows up an the place explodes  
An if ya missed it  catch the next episode  
Gather up your troops  
Rush em to the record store  
An pick up the new LP from the Ice Man  
So let the funk flow louder  
And let me hit cha  hit cha  hit cha  
With the with the  
Minutes x3 Minutes of Power
