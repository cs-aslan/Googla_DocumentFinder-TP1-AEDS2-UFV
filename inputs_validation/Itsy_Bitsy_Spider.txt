Chorus  
The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout  
Down came the rain and washed the spider out  
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain  
And the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again  
  
I believe in love  
And who knows where or when  
Bit its comin around again  
  
Chorus  
  
I know nothin stays the same  
But if youre willing to play the game  
Its comin around again  
  
Chorus
