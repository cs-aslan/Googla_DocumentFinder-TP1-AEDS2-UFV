Its a twelve oclock depression my mind is in recession  
And I cant answer you  
Its the day I cant remember I think its late September  
Or is it April blue  
  
I cant find peace of mind in a world so unkind  
Its just a little heart breaker just a little heart breaker yeah  
  
Its a sticky situation when Im near hallucination and I refuse to bow  
They used to think me funny when I promised them their money  
But theyre not laughing now  
  
Chorus  
I cant find peace of mind then she calls me just in time  
Shes a gift with a golden gun and shes got them on the run  
Shes a gift with a golden gun cause she knows what theyve done  
  
Just what theyve done done done done done  
What theyve done done done done done  
Just what theyve done done done done done
