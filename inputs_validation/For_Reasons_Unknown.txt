I pack my case I check my face  
I look a little bit older  
I look a little bit colder  
With one deep breath and one big step  
I move a little bit closer I move a little bit closer  
For reasons unknown  
  
I caught my stride I flew and flied  
I know if destinys kind Ive got the rest on my mind  
Well my heart  it dont beat it dont beat the way it used to  
And my eyes  they dont see you no more  
And my lips  they dont kiss they dont kiss the way they used to  
And my eyes dont recognize you no more  
  
For reasons unknown  
For reasons unknown  
  
It was an open chair  
We sat down in the open chair  
I said if destinys kind Ive got the rest on my mind  
But my heart  it dont beat it dont beat the way it used to  
And my eyes  they dont see you no more  
And my lips  they dont kiss they dont kiss the way they used to  
And my eyes dont recognize you at all  
  
For reasons unknown  
For reasons unknown  
  
I said my heart  it dont beat it dont beat the way it used to  
And my eyes dont recognize you no more  
And my lips  they dont kiss they dont kiss the way they used to  
And my eyes dont recognize you no more
