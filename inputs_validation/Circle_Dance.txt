I dont know why it should be so hard  
Givin up this circle dance  
Worn out steps from long ago  
Dont give love a chance  
Its a bitter heirloom handed down  
These twisted parts we play  
  
Im not her and youre not him  
It just comes out that way  
Cant go back to make things right  
Though I wish Id understood  
Time has made things clearer now  
We did the best we could  
  
Ill be home soon thats what youd say  
And a little kid believes  
After a while I learned that love  
Must be a thing that leaves  
I tried so hard just to hold you near  
Was as good as I could be  
  
Even when I had you here  
You stayed so far from me  
Cant go back to make things right  
Though I wish Id understood  
Time has made things clearer now  
  
You did the best you could  
Now that this has occurred to me  
I just wanted you to know  
Ive been too faithful all my life  
Its time to let you go
