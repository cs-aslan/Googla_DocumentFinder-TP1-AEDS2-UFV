Chorus  
Im a gonna take a trip  
In the good old gospel ship  
Im goin far beyond the sky  
Im a gonna shout and sing  
Until all the Heavens ring  
When I bid this old world goodbye  
  
I have good news to bring  
And that is why I sing  
All my joys with you Id like to share  
Oh Im a gonna take a trip  
In the good old gospel ship  
And go sailin through the air  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh ah yeah yeah  
  
Oh I can scarcely wait  
I know I dont wanna be late  
For I want to spend all my time in prayer  
And a when my ship comes in  
Im a gonna leave this world of sin  
And go sailin through the air
