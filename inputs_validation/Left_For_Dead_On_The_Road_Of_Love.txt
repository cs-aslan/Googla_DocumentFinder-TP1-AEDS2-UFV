Chorus  
Well Ive been left for dead on the road of love  
I was doin high speed with a load of love  
Forgot the first creed in the code of love  
Alls fair in love and war  
  
Well Im an honest man and I try to be true  
I did unto her like Ill do unto you  
Now you prefer to tell me were through  
Im bleedin through my shirt and tie  
Im bleedin and Ill tell you why  
  
Chorus  
  
Well now who is the guy and when did he come  
When did he start to go beatin your drum  
Well hes hittin on you Im feelin numb  
And she dont believe a word I told her  
Im cryin on a gravel shoulder  
  
Chorus  
  
Watch what youre doin  
Look where youre goin  
Give me a signal  
Some way of knowin  
Well now whos at the wheel in the life that drove by  
I could swear it was her made me shift into high  
Shes got those dangerous curves  
And theyre wrackin my nerves  
She always wiggles and swerves  
Shes gonna give her driver everything he deserves  
  
Well now who could want this to lie here alone  
With a palate of bricks a pillow of stone  
Well to think that one kiss pulled me out o my zone  
And I wonder whats the change inside her  
This road has got a long divider  
  
Chorus  
  
Alls fair in love and war  
Alls fair in love and war
