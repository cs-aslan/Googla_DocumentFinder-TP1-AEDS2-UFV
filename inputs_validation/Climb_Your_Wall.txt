One time I saw you in the street  
Thought that I would be that kind you want  
Ooh babe youre the best of them all  
  
Im trying to tell you how much I love you  
Oh baby please let me climb your wall  
Ooh baby youre the best of them all  
  
Then in the dawn Ill be leavin  
   
Ooh babe thats the strength of it all  
  
Come on over and see    
And let me crawl around on your floor  
Ooh babe thats the strength of it all  
  
Im trying to tell you how much I love you  
Oh baby let me climb your wall  
Ooh baby thats the strength of it all  
  
I see that I lied neglected you badly  
Cause you are that one light thats   me blind  
  
All alone Ive tried to see  
Then you agree let me climb your wall  
Ooh baby youre the best of them all  
  
Cmon sweety come over here  
Let me please   let me climb your wall  
Thats the strength of it all  
  
Im trying to tell you how much I love you  
Oh baby let me climb your wall  
Ooh baby youre the best of them all
