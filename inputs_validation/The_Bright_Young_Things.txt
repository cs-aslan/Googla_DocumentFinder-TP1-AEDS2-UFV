Well be the worms in your apple pie  
Fake abuse for our bios  
Blacken our own eyes  
The grass isnt greener on the other side  
We set it on fire  
And we have no reason why  
Set fashion not follow  
Spit vitriol not swallow  
We set fashion not follow  
Spit vitriol not swallow  
  
Were  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything thats bad  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything thats bad  
We know who we are and what we want to say  
And we dont care whos listening  
We dont rebel to sell  
It just suits us well  
Were the bright young things  
Ive got my villain necktie  
And a mouth of hifi  
So sharp Im bleeding  
from my Judas Hole  
Im the Arch Dandy  
Nogoodnik and Im headed  
For Crashville  
  
Im most monster with my groan box  
In the Meat Show  
We set fashion not follow  
Spit vitriol not swallow  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything thats bad  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything thats bad  
We know who we are and what we want to say  
And we dont care whos listening  
We dont rebel to sell  
It just suits us well  
Were the bright young things  
Crashing the ether  
Weve got the loudest stereotype  
Even neophytes deep 6 your prolife  
  
We Dont need to move a single prayer bone  
Were so beautiful and damned  
Simply as a still life  
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause  
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause  
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause  
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause  
  
Stop the song and remember what you used to be  
Somebody that fucking impressed me  
We know who we are and what we want to say  
And we dont care whos listening  
We dont rebel to sell  
It just suits us well  
Were the bright young things  
We know who we are and what we want to say  
And we dont care whos listening  
We dont rebel to sell  
It just suits us well  
  
Were the bright young things  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything thats bad  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything thats bad
