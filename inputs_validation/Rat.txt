Not too smart just out of school  
A teachers pet and modern fool  
Talked about being a freelance broker  
But the police caught him tryin to choke her  
Cant describe him in his corner  
Like a rat out of the water  
Out of work and outta grass  
Mother Mary never seems to stop to talk she just walk on past  
Down Down no information one day always away  
But why why cant I see you  
One day always away  
Why why cant I be you  
One day always away  
Hes outta school now just another taken bar stool  
And this neighborhood aint what he had in mind  
Wants to be your girlfriend love to be your boyfriend  
Wants to be your telephone wants to wants to be your man  
But why why cant I see you  
One day always away  
Why why cant I be you  
One day always away  
Down Down no information
