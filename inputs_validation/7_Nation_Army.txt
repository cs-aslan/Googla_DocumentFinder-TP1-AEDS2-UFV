Im gonna fight em off  
A seven nation army couldnt hold me back  
Theyre gonna rip it off  
Taking their time right behind my back  
  
And Im talking to myself at night  
Because I cant forget  
Back and forth through my mind  
Behind a cigarette  
And the message coming from my eyes  
Says leave it alone  
  
Dont want to hear about it  
Every single ones got a story to tell  
Everyone knows about it  
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell  
  
And if I catch it coming back my way  
Im gonna serve it to you  
And that aint what you want to hear  
But thats what Ill do  
And the feeling coming from my bones  
Says find a home  
  
Im going to Wichita  
Far from this opera for evermore  
Im gonna work the straw  
Make the sweat drip out of every pore  
And Im bleeding and Im bleeding and Im bleeding  
Right before the lord  
All the words are gonna bleed from me  
And I will sing no more  
And the stains coming from my blood  
Tell me go back home
