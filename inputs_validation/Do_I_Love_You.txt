After that sweet Summer afternoon  
When for the first time I saw you appear  
Dreaming of you I composed a tune  
So will you listen to it dear  
  
Do I love you do I  
Doesnt one and one make two  
Do I love you do I  
Does July need a sky of blue  
Would I miss you would I  
If you ever should go away  
If the sun should desert the day  
What would life be  
Will I leave you never  
Could the ocean leave the shore  
Will I worship you for ever  
Isnt heaven forever more  
  
Do I love you do I  
Oh my dear its so easy to see  
Dont you know I do  
Dont I show you I do  
Just as you love me  
  
Do I love you do I  
Doesnt one and one make two  
Do I love you do I  
Does July need a sky of blue  
Would I miss you would I  
If you ever should go away  
If the sun should desert the day  
What would life be  
Will I leave you never  
Could the ocean leave the shore  
Will I worship you for ever  
Isnt heaven forever more  
  
Do I love you do I  
Oh my dear its so easy to see  
Dont you know I do  
Dont I show you I do  
Just as you love me
