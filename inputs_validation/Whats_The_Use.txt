Whats the use of paradise or everyday of livin  
They spend and learn in Heaven sin in Hell  
  
Whats the point of children  
When evil got before them  
They learn in every tale we tell  
  
Theres no point in being kind  
Whats the use when love becomes an evil of the mind  
  
Oh Yeah  
  
Whats the use of power  
When the battle isnt equal  
And were all too Scared to use it anyway  
  
Whats the point of reason  
When no one wants to listen  
Deliverance is all too far away  
  
Oh whats the use  
Oh whats the use  
Tell me oh whats the use  
Whats the use  
  
Love becomes an evil of the mind  
Whats the use  
  
Whats the use
