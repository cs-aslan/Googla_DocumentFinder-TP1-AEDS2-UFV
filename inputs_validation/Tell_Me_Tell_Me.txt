Tell me tell me tell me please  
What is this that hovers me its  
Driving me to a state of hopeless  
Having any sex at all  
Hasnt any worth at all  
Or is it just enough to bitch  
  
The funny thing that makes me do  
The things that I do to you  
Oh I know they are so damn very tall  
Im in a state I cant explain  
My mind is gone my mind is gone  
It seems so very little I can do  
  
Cause all these things I want to know  
  
Chorus  
Tell me tell me tell me please Repeat x3  
Wont you tell me please  
  
Im so full of emptiness  
Its so hard to sustain the mess  
Ive no idea who I am at all  
So tell me tell me tell me please  
What is this that hovers me  
Before I smash my head against the wall  
  
Cause all these things I want to know  
  
Chorus x2
