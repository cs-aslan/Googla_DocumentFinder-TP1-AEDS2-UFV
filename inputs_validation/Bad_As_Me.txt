Youre the head on the spear  
Youre the nail on the cross  
Youre the fly in my beer  
Youre the key that got lost  
Youre the letter from Jesus on the bathroom wall  
Youre Mother Superior with only a bra  
Youre the same kind of bad as me  
Youre the same kind of bad as me  
  
Im the hat on the bed  
Im the coffee instead  
The fish or cut bait  
Im the detective up late  
Im the blood on the floor  
The thunder and the roar  
Im the boat that wont sink  
I just wont sleep a wink  
Youre the same kind of bad as me  
Youre the same kind of bad as me  
Youre the same kind of bad as me  
Youre the same kind of bad as me  
  
No good you say  
Well thats good enough for me  
  
Youre the wreath that caught fire  
Youre the preach to the choir  
You bite down on the sheet  
But your teeth have been wired  
You skid in the rain  
Youre trying to shift  
Youre grinding the gears  
Youre trying to shift  
And youre the same kind of bad as me  
Youre the same kind of bad as me  
Shes the same kind of bad as me  
Youre the same kind of bad as me  
  
They told me you were no good  
I know youll take care of all my needs  
Youre the same kind of bad as me  
  
Im the mattress in the back  
Im the old gunnysack  
Im the one with the gun  
Most likely to run  
Im the car in the weeds  
If you cut me Ill bleed  
Youre the same kind of bad as me  
Youre the same kind of bad as me  
Same kind of bad as me  
Youre the same kind of bad as me  
Youre the same kind of bad as me  
  
Uno dos tres quatro  
Same kind of bad as me
