Whos that waddlin down the street  
Its just me cause I love to eat  
Fudge and Twinkies and deviled ham  
Whos real flabby Yes I am  
Every picture of mes  
Gotta be an aerial view  
Now my doctor tells me  
Theres just one thing left to do  
  
Grapefruit Diet Diet  
Throw out the pizza and beer  
Grapefruit Diet Diet  
Oh get those jelly donuts out of here  
Grapefruit Diet Diet  
Might seem a little severe  
Grapefruit Diet Diet  
Im gettin tired of my big fat rear  
Blow flatty  
  
Well I used to live on chocolate sauce  
Made sumo wrestlers look like Kate Moss  
Walked down an alley and I got stuck  
I got more rolls than a pastry truck  
When Im all done eating  
I eat a little more  
When I leave a room  
First I gotta grease the door  
  
Grapefruit Diet Diet  
Cant have another eclair  
Grapefruit Diet Diet  
I gotta decrease my derriere  
  
Im on a Grapefruit Diet  
Im on a Grapefruit Diet  
Im on a Grapefruit Diet  
  
No more pie now  
No more creme brulee  
Lay off the gravy  
And souffle  
No french friyiyies now  
No ice cream parfait  
Mr Cheese Nacho  
Stay away  
  
Oh I think Id sell my soul  
For a triple patty melt  
But I need a boomerang  
When I put on my belt  
  
Grapefruit Diet Diet  
Lay off the 3 Musketeers  
Grapefruit Diet Diet  
Until my big booty disappears  
Grapefruit Diet Diet  
Eatem till theyre comin out of my ears  
Grapefruit Diet Diet  
Cause I havent seen my feet in years  
  
Im on a Grapefruit Diet  
Im on a Grapefruit Diet  
Im on a Grapefruit Diet
