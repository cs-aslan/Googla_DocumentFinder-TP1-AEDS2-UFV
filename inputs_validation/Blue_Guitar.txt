Blue Guitar  
Blue guitar  
Fortune of my ways  
Making of my days  
New chord  
Counting up the ways  
Happiness is lazy  
  
If you dont know the song  
If you cant put the words to the tune  
Tell the rhyme from the reason  
What should it matter  
To the fool or the dreamer  
  
New hope  
Travellers in a storm  
Finding love is warm  
New day  
The world has just begun  
Our eyes have seen the sun  
  
If you dont know the way  
If you cant see the wood for the trees  
Taste the wine from the water  
Well what should it matter  
To the fool or the dreamer
