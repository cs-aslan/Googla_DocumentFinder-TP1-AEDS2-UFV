Your place midnight  
When I come through  
I ring ya doorbell twice  
When I come through  
I do the things you like like  
Like Im room service  
And dont you take me  
But every chick  
Tryna take all your shit  
Coz I aint even tryna  
Get none of yo shit  
Please I dont want none  
Of your shit  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont be start struck  
When we go on under these covers  
You can have have a bit  
Of my hand cuffs  
Man a boy just playin along  
Ill give it to you proper  
Play nurse and you play doctor  
Boy you know I got ya hah

Even with a chick get a grip  
With hips like this

That Im good on that anger please

Youve been given none of my love to you
