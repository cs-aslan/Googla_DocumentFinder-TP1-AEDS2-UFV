Watch the master plan the pastures span through the streets  
Flipped the beat move the sheep like the shepherd  
Its a new day my crew stay forever strivin  
Give thanks cause we alive and been through the gutter  
Now we see the horizon  
  
Its clear to me now  
Used to be confused took a lot of years to see how  
Now we movin planets take the average mind and expand it  
You take for granted like were always gonna be disadvantaged  
  
But soon come it soon come ya soon done  
Ya start run you stumble we catch one  
In the rhythm Santana lick the guits with precision  
Not accidental intentional conscious decision  
  
To Zion were marchin through with African Mayans  
Conquerin Babylon with the heart of a lion  
Behold and watch yesterday come back around  
And the walls of Jericho come a tumblin down  
  
Tell me how long has it been  
Is everything everything alright my friend  
You see time is passin  
People askin how come none of this aint lastin  
  
Money will make people deal like they dont even have to feel  
But no it aint real it aint real  
Oh do you like the way thats going down  
Do you like the way that its going down  
  
Ooh do you like the way  
How long how long will we wait to sit down and communicate  
See everything is relative if you want to get then give  
Cant we all just build and live cant we cant we  
  
Oh do you like the way that its going down baby  
Going down baby going down wait a minute
