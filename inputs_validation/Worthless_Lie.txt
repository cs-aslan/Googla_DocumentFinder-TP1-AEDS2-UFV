The sheets wont need changing everyday  
The freezer supply should last a year  
Those hidden little points that youre away  
Nothing much has changed since you were here  
  
Our paths will cross some day  
Our paths will cross some day  
While youre out jogging and Im sat snogging  
Some fool on a lakeside bench  
  
And when she calls I hope its you that dials  
I hope its you that feels this love inside  
And when I touch her I hope its you that smiles  
And when I die I hope its you Im beside  
To die with her would be a worthless lie  
To die with her would be a worthless die  
To die together would be worth a try  
To die together would be worth a try  
  
The family pack seems larger than it should  
Two for ones no good when theres just one  
Id raise a bigger smile if I could  
But me minus you equals none  
  
Our paths will cross some day  
Our paths will cross some day  
When youre out fishing and Im sat wishing  
  
You instead of him  
Our paths will cross some day  
Our paths will cross some day  
When youre out exercising and Im there prising  
The pants of I my latest sin  
  
And when we kiss she knows its you I kiss  
Cause when we kiss I always start to cry  
You just cant cover up these lying lips  
When I die I hope its you Im beside  
To die with her would be a worthless lie  
To die with her would be a worthless die  
To die together would be worth a try  
To die together would be worth a try  
  
An ambulance flashed past me in the street  
Just yards from where we were to meet  
I was half hoping you were dead meat  
That it was you that was under the sheet  
  
And as you lay there alone in the ward  
Fumbling for the keys to deaths door  
At least Id have summoned up the nerve  
To whisper you these words  
  
Finally Quietly Actually  
I love you
