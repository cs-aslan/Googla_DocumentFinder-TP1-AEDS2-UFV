Every second every minute man I swear that she can get it  
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high hands up high hands up high  
Tell em dim the lights down right now put me in the mood  
Im talking bout dark room perfume  
Go go  
  
I recognize your fragrance hol up  
You aint never gotta say woo  
And I know your taste is  
A little bit mmm high maintenance ooh  
Everybody else basic  
You live life on an everyday basis  
With poetic justice poetic justice  
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it  
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you  
When youre in the mood for empathy theres blood in my pen  
Better yet where your friends and them  
I really wanna know you all  
I really wanna show you off  
Fuck that pour up plenty of champagne  
Cold nights when you this name  
You called up your girlfriends and  
Yall curled in that little bitty Range I heard that  
She wanna go and party she wanna go and party  
dont approach her with that Atari  
that aint good game homie sorry  
They say conversation rule a nation I can tell  
But I could never right my wrongs  
less I write it down for real PS  
  
Chorus x2  
You can get it you can get it  
You can get it you can get it  
And I know just know just know just know just know just what you want  
Poetic justice put it in a song  
  
I really hope you play this  
Cause ol girl you test my patience  
With all these s photographs and all these one off vacations  
Youve been taken  
Clearly a lot for me to take in  
It dont make sense  
Young East African Girl you too busy with your other man  
I was trying to put you on game put you on a plane  
Take you and your mama to the motherland  
I could do it maybe one day  
When you figure out youre gonna need someone  
When you figure out its all right here in the city  
And you dont run from where we come from  
That sound like poetic justice poetic justice  
You were so new to this life but God you got adjusted  
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun  
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big in that sundress ooh  
Good God what you doing that walk for  
When I see that thing move I just wish we would fight less  
And we would talk more  
And they say communication save relations I can tell  
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real  
PS  
  
Chorus  
  
Every time I write these words they become a taboo  
Making sure my punctuation curve every letter is true  
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof  
Im talking poetic justice poetic justice  
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it  
I mean you need to hear this  
Love is not just a verb its you looking in the mirror  
Love is not just a verb its you looking for a maybe  
Call me crazy We can both be insane  
A fatal attraction is common  
And what we have common is pain  
I mean you need to hear this  
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering  
drive when you swerve I want that interference  
Its coherent I can hear it mmhmm  
Thats your heartbeat  
It either caught me or it called me mmhmm  
Breathe slow and youll find gold mines in these lines  
Sincerely yours truly  
And right before you go blind  
PS  
  
Chorus
