Father weve something to tell you a story of our time A tragic but  
inspiring tale of manhood in its prime You know you had a dozen sons  
Well now thats not quite true But feel no sorrow do not grieve he  
would not want you to  
  
Theres one more Angel in Heaven theres one more star in the sky  
Joseph well never forget you Its tough but were gonna get by  
  
Theres one less place at our table Theres one more tear in my eye  
But Joseph the things that you stood fer like truth and light never die  
When I think of his last great battle a lump comes to my throat  
It takes a man who knows no fear to wrestle with a goat  
His bloodstained coat is tribute to his final sacrifice His body may  
be past its peak but his souls in paradise  
  
So long little Jo  
Adios Buckeroo  
Ten four good buddy  
  
Theres one less place at our table Theres one more tear in my eye  
But Joseph the things that you stood fer like truth and light never die  
Carve his name with pride and courage let no tear be shead  
If he had not laid down his life we all would now be dead
