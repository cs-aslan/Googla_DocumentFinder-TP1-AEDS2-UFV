It must be love Im feeling  
This must be love  
Oh this must be love Im feeling  
This must be love  
  
Well I wait in every day just in case  
You decide to call  
And I can hardly wait  
Coz I never thought time could pass so slowly  
  
It must be love Im feeling  
This must be love  
Oh this must be love Im feeling  
This must be love  
  
Happiness is something I never thought Id feel again  
But now I know  
Its you that Ive been looking for  
And day by day more and more  
I know what you think youve heard it before  
Dont tell me I know  
But this feeling inside my heart  
You know Im never letting go  
Cause I think that  
  
It must be love Im feeling  
This must be love  
Oh this must be love Im feeling  
This must be love  
  
Words can only say so much  
Its hard to express  
The things you do to me  
Youre everything I couldve ever dreamed youd be  
  
This must be love Im feeling  
This must be love  
Oh this must be love Im feeling  
This must be love
