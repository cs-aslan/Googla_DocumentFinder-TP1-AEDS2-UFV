Its against my uniform  
To be a civil judge  
All the songs are history now  
Bout rock stars and their grudge  
Let us cast our minds back  
To thirty years or more  
You took up all the vandals  
Will Hitler beat em all  
  
And were sad and sorry  
Really sorry that it happened that way  
Yes were sad and sorry  
But whyd you have to treat us that way  
  
Compare ourselves with others  
And cover them in sin  
Oh God what a terrible  
A terrible state were in  
There must be some way out of here  
A compromise thats right  
If we cannot work it out  
Were gonna have to fight  
  
Yes were sad and sorry  
Really sorry that it happened that way  
Yes were sad and sorry  
We cannot go on in those days  
  
Im talking about my brothers  
Yeah Im talking bout sisters as well  
I wish you good luck  
Good luck  
  
Oh but the worlds still on fire  
Chain the hope you take on liar  
This fire  
Were on fire were on fire yeah
