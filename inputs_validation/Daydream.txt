Its so sweet  
In my daydreams  
  
Every night you creep into my dreams  
Fantasy  
Its so deep but its a fantasy  
Every night you creep into my dream  
  
Its so real  
In my daydreams  
Its just a sweet  
Its just a sweet  
  
In my daydreams  
It seems so real  
You touch me  
You come into my room  
  
Come to me  
Its just a fantasy  
It feels so sweet  
But its just not real  
Oh baby its just a sweet fantasy  
  
And daydream is all that I can do  
I feel raptured over you  
In silence I keep it to myself  
Come take me  
I dont want nobody else  
  
And its sweet  
I feel sweet  
And its sweet  
I feel sweet  
And its sweet  
I feel sweet  
  
And its deep  
I feel really deep  
Its just a sweet  
Its just a sweet  
  
Youre like the kiss of life  
Youre like the kiss of life  
Beaming in the sky  
  
Oh youre just a fantasy  
Oh baby you come into my room  
Yeah but youre just a fantasy
