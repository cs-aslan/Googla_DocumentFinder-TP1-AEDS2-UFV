Hello Im the Pied Piper from the far away land of Night  
Nobody knows anything about my existence  
I only want to know kids  
Late at night when people are sleeping  
I go into their old radios and turn them into magic transistors  
And fly outside with them  
I come from such a far away land of Night  
That Im fascinated with the funny music I hear on your radios  
You are the first to know of me  
You cant see me Im hidden  
But you can see the green glow I make  
I heard you laugh last night  
I figured that you would be amused by me  
Listen to this  
  
Bow bow  
Im the Pied Piper  
Bow bow bow bow bow  
In the radio  
  
Bow bow

Bow bow bow bow bow  
In the radio  
  
Bow bow

Then the prince heard something he never knew could be  
Bow bow

Bow bow bow bow bow  
In the radio  
  
The hidden Pied Piper was laughing  
Bow bow

Bow bow bow bow bow  
In the radio  
  
As the prince moved his head back and forth with the music going on  
Bow bow

Bow bow bow bow bow  
In the radio  
  
When the music died down the Piper said that every night

Bow bow

Bow bow bow bow bow  
In the radio  
  
Then the radio was glowing no more  
As it fell into the hands of the fascinated prince  
He ran back amazed and he hopped right back into bed  
  
That night he dreamt all night  
Mostly about his radio and his friend the Pied Piper  
  
The prince did try what the Piper said to do  
But for weeks at night  
He heard nothing like the music of that magic night  
  
That Pied Piper must have been joking he said  
Theres nothing but Bach on this radio  
Im gonna throw it back up in the attic for good  
This he sat disbelieving the young prince so loud  
That two of his brothers overheard him  
The next day those two brothers took the radio from the attic and turned  
It on  
Dom dom kingdom  
There it was the music had to be from the Pied Piper himself  
  
My radio is radiatin through the  
Dom dom kingdom  
Through the misty night  
Through the misty night  
  
Dom dom kingdom  
My radio is radiatin through the  
Dom dom kingdom  
Through the misty night  
Through the misty night  
  
Dom dom kingdom  
The princes sisters ran in their brothers room  
My radio is radiatin through the  
Dom dom kingdom  
And they were all dancing and screaming with joy  
Through the misty night  
Through the misty night  
But the transistor was playing too loud  
  
And their mother heard it  
Dom dom kingdom  
What are you doing there What is that youre listening too  
Give me that radio at once she said
