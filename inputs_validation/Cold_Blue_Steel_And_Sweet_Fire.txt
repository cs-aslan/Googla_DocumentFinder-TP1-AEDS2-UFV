Cold blue steel out of money  
One eye for the beat police  
Sweet fire calling  
You cant deny me  
Now you know what you need  
Underneath the jungle gym  
Hollowgreyfireescapethief  
Looking for Sweet Fire  
Shadow of Lady Release  
Come with me  
I know the way she says  
Its down down down the dark ladder  
Do you want to contact somebody first  
Leave someone a letter  
You can come now  
Or you can come later  
  
A wristwatch a ring a downstairs screamer  
Edgyblack cracks of the sky  
Pincushionprick  
Fix this poor bad dreamer  
Money cold shadows reply  
Pawnshops crisscrossed and padlocked  
Corridors spit on prayers and pleas  
Sparks fly up from Sweet Fire  
Black soot of Lady Release  
Come with me  
I know the way she says  
Its down down down the dark ladder  
Do you want to contact somebody first  
Does it really matter  
If you come now  
Or if you come on later  
  
Red water in the bathroom sink  
Fever and the scum brown bowl  
Blue Steel still begging  
But its indistinct  
Someones hifi drumming Jelly Roll  
Concrete concentration camp  
Bashing in veins for peace  
Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire  
Fall into Lady Release  
Come with me I know the way she says  
Its down down down the dark ladder  
Do you want to contact somebody first  
I mean what does it really matter  
Youre going to come now  
Or youre going to come later
