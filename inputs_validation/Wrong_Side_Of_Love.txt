She said that shes got something else on her mind  
Im spending my money but Im wasting time  
It looks to me like the end of the line  
Well she plays both sides and shes making me choose  
Its heads she wins and tails I lose  
Each time I call its another excuse  
  
I thought I was finally doin everything right  
Now it looks like Im the one left lonely tonight  
I picked the wrong side of love  
And I wound up on the losin end  
The wrong side of love  
Now Im starting all over again  
  
She makes me feel like Im out of control  
She comes on hot but she turns ice cold  
Her light says stop when Im ready to gogo  
  
She set me up now shes puttin me down  
Sometimes I feel like a face in the crowd  
One day Im in the next day Im out  
  
I thought I was finally doin everything right  
Now it looks like Im the one left lonely tonight  
I picked the wrong side of love  
And I wound up on the losin end  
The wrong side of love  
Now Im starting all over again  
  
I picked the wrong side of love  
Right place wrong time  
The wrong side of love  
Well honey point me in the right direction  
  
I thought I was finally doin everything right  
Now it looks like Im the one left lonely tonight  
I picked the wrong side of love  
And I wound up on the losin end  
The wrong side of love  
Now Im starting all over again  
I picked the wrong side of love  
And I wound up on the losin end  
The wrong side of love  
Now Im starting all over again  
  
I picked the wrong side of love  
Is there a bad side to love  
I picked the wrong side of love  
The wrong side of love  
I picked the wrong side of love  
Is there a bad side to love  
I picked the wrong side of love  
I picked the wrong side of love  
I picked the wrong side of love
