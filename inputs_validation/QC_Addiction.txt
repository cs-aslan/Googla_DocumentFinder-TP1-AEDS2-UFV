Hook  
  
You see the light  
Yeah we in the pitcra cra  
Thats why young niggas  
Still kicking dough  
And some of my niggas convicted  
Moneymoney money  
Power respect  
Guess Im addicted  
Money power and munition  
Guess Im addicted  
  
A date that took the moneyman  
Cause I dont know plus fo hundred babes  
Making a flip like its gymnastics  
Hot wheelin hands stacking  
Callin my spatula acrobat  
Turnin a brick to a platinum plat  
You pussy I double that fish scale  
My pockets are deeper than waterware  
Pluck on the border I got shizz on the water  
Definite prison blew the whale  
All nigga checking somethin  
While hustle my Emi I aint kickin shit  
With it you hot on the webcam Im Peter Parker  
Twelve crest smoking Linkin Park babe  
  
Hook  
  
Money on the table  
You seeing the label  
Not tellin no fables  
In time here like a nigga  
In school doing time tables  
Shopping got flavors  
Bend on no cable  
Traveling country to country  
Skipping unstable  
Im whipping miss Mable  
Whip whip eat look out  
The spider skeet well velvet Sneider  
Hit my brother Duke  
Thats my la riddapah cra  
Boy you impostor  
Check your pocket  
We dont rock with coppers  
Street west side talkin  
  
Hook  
  
Can see the label  
Money we making  
Without a major  
If I aint no cut  
I aint selling my soul  
Cause everything glitter  
Aint gold  
Double D tell me dont fall  
The water so cold  
Your butler gonget you your phone  
Jump in the black you do not belong  
Dozen my gibble they talkin gibble  
Drop the cocaineo no trap the trail  
Adversaries call me the Advocator  
Come in the truck like the Terminator  
They tumple the mac in the elevator  
Money passing ammunition  
Me flip a Rover in a kitchen  
Another thing made us ridiculous  
Cant you see we in the business  
  
Hook  
  
Solid foundationsolid foundation  
Could see the label  
Under rotation keep guarding your pray  
Thats a milli hot  
In that space Coupe that you lookin at  
Got shit on in Aspen stopping traffic  
Im a space cadet  
Time for nothing took a lot of shit  
Jab bout my reserve  
Ammunition  
We got penny F in this we cant retain it  
Baby chopper baby chopper  
Feel it longer than a towel  
I aint never been a lame nigga  
Bitch never called me Roger
