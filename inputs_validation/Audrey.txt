Audrey  
  
Audrey was a girl that sat in my classroom  
She never said a word  
She just sat there furtively  
I never noticed her until I heard the radio  
Telling about the way she took her life  
Today its all upon the covers of the papers  
About her folk at home  
I guess her daddys a drinker  
Her mommy left her  
When she was just a little child  
Oh tell me Audrey was it the first time  
You felt abounding ness  
  
Hold on baby  
Dont be sorry  
Every day has its ups and downs  
Hold on baby  
There will be sunshine  
Every life has its stormy nights  
  
Comes to think about it  
There is some things that cant be called  
About her arms  
They had blue spots on them  
I remember to think  
It starts to myself  
Is it wrong to wonder about somebody else problems  
Im not burning with at all  
  
Hold on baby  
that she lays down on the bottoms of the river  
Tell me what crime did it take  
To take this girls only willingness  
But I will pray  
That someday shell rise again  
  
If youre out there  
I hope you can see my sorrow  
And pain of guilt  
I never asked you how you were  
But one thing I can assure you  
After witnessing what is been done  
I will open my heart to the new girl  
That sits next door  
Hold on baby
