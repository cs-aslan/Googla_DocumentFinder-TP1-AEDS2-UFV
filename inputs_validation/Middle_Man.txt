I was sitting in a diner  
With a girl named Flo  
She wouldnt say yes  
But she couldnt say no  
She said Darling can I get a middle man  
She was engaged to a fellow  
On the lay a way plan  
But she carried all her money  
In a coffee can  
She said Darling can I get a middle man  
The cook looked over  
With a short order face  
Dropped a fork  
And he saw Flos legs  
Straightened his apron  
And burnt my eggs  
I got competition  
Everywhere I go  
These days  
She was leaning on the juke box  
And was lookin real good  
Like Natalie Wood  
On a Pontiac hood  
I said Darling I think I need a little hand  
Ya see Ive seen my downs  
Ive seen my ups  
I seen miniature dogs  
In coffee cups  
But Darling I aint never seen a middle man  
Flo talked slow  
Like real wet paint  
She said A middle mans there  
When the other ones aint  
Hes got a left handed manner  
That leans to the right sleeps all day  
And keeps it up all night  
I got an aunt in Ohio  
And a boat that wont row  
Some veterans insurance  
And nowhere to go  
Darling Can I be your middle man  
If I could get the money in that coffee can  
I could open me up a lemonade stand  
Send all the kids off to Pakistan  
Make flo happy  
If I can  
Jerry Mahoney and Johnny B Goode  
Are gonna buy me a house in Hollywood  
Darling I think I got the perfect plan  
Were gonna save half a dollars  
And sell em to France  
Buy us a record  
And learn how to dance  
And darling Ill always be your middle  
Darling go buy a griddle  
Darling I wanna be your middle man
