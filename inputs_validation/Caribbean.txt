Have you ever been down to Haiti when  
The summer sun was sinkin low  
Theres nothin but romance just everywhere you glance  
And the native hearts are all aglow  
But when the Cuban Queen comes upon the scene  
They all stare like a statue out of stone  
And when they realize whats before their eyes  
The other girls are left all alone  
  
Down in the Caribbean its not a dream youre seein  
When you get a glimpse of the lady with the charm  
But from miles away you can see her sway  
To the beat of the Cuban Conga line that forms  
  
Up in a tree so high way up in the sky  
Sits a wideeyed monkey on a limb  
He wonders why the people go to so much trouble  
Just to try to be like him  
He doesnt understand that its a ladys hand  
That makes a heart feel so sublime  
But before too long he starts singing the song  
And then he gets in the Conga line  
  
Columbus searched for spices but he missed the nicest  
Part of the Caribbean  
He didnt see the charms and the open arms  
It was the gold that he was seein  
Oh but Im glad he missed the sweetest thing Ive kissed  
Cause were on our honeymoon  
Im so sorry Chris to talk about you like this  
But you were fivehundred years too soon
