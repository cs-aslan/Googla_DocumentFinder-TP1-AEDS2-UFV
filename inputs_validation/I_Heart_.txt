Wish I had concentrated  
They said love was complicated  
But its something I just fell into  
And it was overrated  
But just look what I created  
I came out alive but Im black and blue  
Before you ask me if Im alright  
Think about what I  
Had to do yeah  
  
Wake up and smell the break up  
Fix my heart put on my makeup  
Another mess I didnt plan  
And Ill bet you thought you beat me  
Wish you could only see  
I got an I Heart   
Written on the back of my hand  
  
Id be fine if youd just walked by  
But you had to talk about why  
You were wrong and I was right  
But I cant believe you made me  
Sit at home and cry like a baby  
Wait right by the phone every night  
And now you ask about you and I  
Theres no you and I  
Remember what you put me through  
I had to  
  
Wake up and smell the break up  
Fix my heart put on my makeup  
Another mess I didnt plan  
And Ill bet you thought you beat me  
Wish you could only see  
I got an I Heart   
Written on the back of my hand  
  
And when youre home all alone at night  
Youll still wonder why  
You took everything I had oh baby  
I havent thought about you and I  
Theres no you and I and I know  
Someday you will  
  
Wake up and smell the break up  
Realize that we wont make up  
It didnt go the way you planned  
And youll know you didnt beat me  
When you look down and see  
I got an I Heart   
Written on the back of my hand  
  
Written on the back of my hand  
An I Heart  yeah  
Written on the back of my hand
