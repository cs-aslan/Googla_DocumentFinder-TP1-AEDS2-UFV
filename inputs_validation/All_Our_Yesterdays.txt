The stakes are high  
We have to seize the chance  
A case of do or die  
This is our last dance  
  
A moments hesitation and we always pay the price  
Hiding in the wings is just like walking on thin ice  
  
All our yesterdays will soon be ending  
Hide the walking shadow on the stage  
All our yesterdays be soon forgotten  
Theres an easy way to turn the page  
  
The vision is too real  
The prize is there to take  
Were on an even keel  
No demons in our way  
  
If you stack the cards you will one day find your heaven  
Both sides of the dice are always adding up to seven  
  
All our yesterdays will soon be ending  
Hide the walking shadow on the stage  
All our yesterdays be soon forgotten  
Theres an easy way to turn the page  
  
Yesterdays tomorrow is tomorrows yesterday

Destinys forgotten theres another game to play  
No more future perfect we just need the present tense  
All our yesterdays are only hanging in suspense  
  
Hang the banners high  
On the outward walls  
The battles lost and won  
Thats when the hammer falls  
  
Racing to the future we must never lose our way  
All we have to do is take tomorrows chance today  
  
All our yesterdays have come of age  
Now we all can sing a different song  
All our yesterdays have all departed  
The writing on the wall will soon be gone  
  
All our yesterdays all our yesterdays  
Now we all can sing a different song  
All our yesterdays all our yesterdays  
The writing on the wall will soon be gone  
  
All our yesterdays have come of age  
The writing on the wall will soon be gone
