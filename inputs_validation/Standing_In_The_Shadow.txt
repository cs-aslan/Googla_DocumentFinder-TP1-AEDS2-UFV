Im running away from a feeling  
Hiding my face in the sand  
Im scared to love and lose again  
I dont know if I can  
I dont need the night to remind me  
Where the lonely people go  
I try running away from love  
But my heart keeps telling me no  
  
Too many people  
Standing in the shadow of love  
Too many people  
Are standing in the shadow  
Standing in the shadow of love  
  
Ive been living so long in the darkness  
I know the cold embrace of the night  
When morning comes I close my eyes  
cause Im blinded with the light  
Taking a chance of a feeling  
Is like waiting for a flower to grow  
So I stand at the crossroad baby  
Wondering which way to go  
  
Too many people  
Standing in the shadow of love  
Too many people  
Are standing in the shadow  
Standing in the shadow of love  
  
Im running away from a feeling  
Hiding my face in the sand  
Im scared to love and lose again  
I dont know if I can  
I dont need the night to remind me  
Where the lonely people go  
I try running away from love  
But my heart keeps telling me no  
  
Too many people  
Standing in the shadow of love  
Too Many people  
Are standing in the shadow  
Standing in the shadow of love
