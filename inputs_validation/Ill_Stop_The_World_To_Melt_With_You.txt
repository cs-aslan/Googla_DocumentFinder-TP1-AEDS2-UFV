Moving forwards using all my breath  
Making love to you was never second best  
I saw the world thrashing all around your face  
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace  
  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
Youve seen the difference and its getting better all the time  
Theres nothing you and I wont do  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
Dream of better lives the kind which never hate  
Dropped in the state of Imaginary grace  
I made a pilgrimage to save this human race  
Never comprehending a race that long gone by  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
Youve seen the difference and its getting better all the time  
  
Theres nothing you and I wont do  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
 The futures open wide  
Na na naa na na na na  
Na na naa na na na na  
  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
Youve seen some changes but its getting better all the time  
Theres nothing you and I wont do  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
 1234  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
Youve seen the difference and its getting better all the time  
Theres nothing that you and I wont do  
Ill stop the world and melt with you
