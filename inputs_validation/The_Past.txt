You chose to take  
From the past  
You want a game  
Thats built to last  
  
Cause love without affection  
Is hate without the pain  
Life is a connection  
Separate from the brain  
  
You chose to take  
From the past  
  
Cant you see the pain in my eyes  
Cant you see the betrayal in disguise  
I cant live with all your lies again  
I cant trust anything even you my friend  
  
You wanna lay  
In the past  
Youll do anything  
To make your pain last  
  
Cause love without affection  
Is hate without the pain  
Life is a connection  
Separate from the brain  
  
You just take  
From the past  
  
Cant you see the pain in my eyes  
Cant you see the betrayal in disguise  
I cant live with all your lies again  
I cant trust anything even you my friend  
  
Run away go away Repeat x30  
  
Cant you see the pain in my eyes  
Cant you see the betrayal in disguise  
I cant live with all your lies again  
I cant trust anything with you my friend  
  
Cant you see the pain in my eyes  
Cant you see the betrayal in disguise  
I cant live with all your lies again  
Is this the end
