A chill runs up your spine  
It crawls into your brain  
The freezing touch of fear  
  
Its driving me insane  
Although you try to fight  
Dragged from the silence where you hide  
Til you Scream  
  
Scream  
I cant wait to hear you  
I cant wait to hear you  
Scream  
  
Its driving me insane  
Although you try to fight  
Dragged from the silence where you hide  
Til you Scream  
  
Scream  
I cant wait to hear you  
I cant wait to hear you  
Scream
