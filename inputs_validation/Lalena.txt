When the sun goes to bed  
Thats the time your raise your head  
Thats your lot in life Lalena  
Cant blame you Lalena  
  
Arty Tart la de da  
Can your part get much sadder  
Thats your lot in life Lalena  
Cant blame you Lalena  
  
Run you hand through your hair  
Paint your face with despair  
Thats your lot in life Lalena  
Cant blame you Lalena  
  
When the sun goes to bed  
Thats the time your raise your head  
Thats your lot in life Lalena  
Cant blame you Lalena  
  
Arty Tart Oh so la de da  
Can your part ever get ever get much sadder  
Thats your lot in life Lalena  
Cant blame you Lalena  
Oh Lalena
