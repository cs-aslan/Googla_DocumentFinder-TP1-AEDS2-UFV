It took me all day to find some inspiration  
It just hit me like a ton of bricks no renovation  
Problem with the game now there aint no innovation  
I see my shit all in your shit we call that imitation  
And they say thats flattering but I aint flattered at all  
Matter fact yall need to practice that more  
See my man Nate ask me if I gain weight I said nah  
My pockets got fatter thats all  
Money was an issue but now that thats solved I ball I ball  
Like Kobe in the fall  
Put trophies on my wall rather trophies on my man  
And dog my shows be off the handle  
Take the proceeds go to gamble ha  
Bet it all black and pray I quadruple my salary  
If I win maybe then I can pay Sallie Mae  
Told her I be dealing with some real life shit  
She be asking when bitch when I feel like it  
Cole World Cole life Cole blooded  
I be on my shit and look at all the hoes love it  
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club staring at me  
How that feel Very happy  
  
Cole World Boy check the degrees  
These lil nggas is trash go and get the Febreeze  
Thats why I blew up on you suckas all thats left is debris  
One soldiers all thats left is fatigues  
Act like you know me boy Im Kobe  
How the fck you gon step in my league  
Rapping bout bullshit your message fatigue  
Played out phoney ngga probably only got arrested for weed  
And out here talking that dime shit  
Dom Perignon shit  
Not gon cut it like some scissors on my lawn shit  
Grown cause I own shit  
This is what you wont get  
Game so cold bring the blizzard to the Palms  
Im a wizard Im a don and I put this on my mom  
Im offended Im appalled  
If yall aint bowing  
Claim you a monster but yall aint growling  
Claim you a beast why yall aint howling  
Bout as sweet as a jumper on the gay Ray Allen  
Im bout fcking hoes like Ray J wylin  
Killin nggas like K K K violence  
I guess its why they pay homage  
Momma Imma be big and I put that on the late great Wallace  
Christopher check my temperature nigga my integers  
Whatever man  
  
Alone in my zone tell me dont it sound stunning  
Been fcked the world but she just now cummin  
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground runnin  
I aint never been the one for fourth down puntin  
Aiming at a couple heads bitch Im crown huntin  
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks  
So I lock pick just to lock shit back  
I want Money Power Respect since the Lox said that  
Better stay up on your toes this is not tic tac  
Yet Im a breath of fresh air you can place your bets here  
Ballin like a Laker you should pray for next year  
Cause Im repeating and Im 3peatin  
And Im knee deep in the game its quick sand and I keep leakin  
The label heat seekin nigga aint sign me what the fck was he thinkin  
They say I killed the game that was only preseason  
  
Im heavy  
Im Heavy  
  
Man Im already hot you can say Im preheated  
If money talks mine telling yours be seated  
Cut my leg off I wouldnt be defeated  
Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it  
Email the shit make sure you cc it  
For these fck niggas who dont wanna believe it  
I be in the airport damn near bare foot  
Security hollin out Cole we need it  
Getting high as fck and I dont even be weeded  
No point drinkin I cant even be faded  
Real recognise real like they related  
You aint no fcking G boy your style GRated  
Hatred is flattery Im glad to be hated  
Fckin bad bitches that would rather be dated  
Carolina niggas just happy he made it  
My money was running late now now its happy belated  
Im heavy nigga Im heavy
