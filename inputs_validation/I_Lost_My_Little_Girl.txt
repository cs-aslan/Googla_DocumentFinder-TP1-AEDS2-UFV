WELL I WOKE UP LATE THIS MORNING  
MY HEAD WAS IN A WHIRL  
ONLY WHEN I REALISED I LOST MY LITTLE GIRL  
AHHAHHAHHAHHAH  
  
WELL HER CLOTHES ARE NOT EXPENSIVE  
HER HAIR DIDNT ALWAYS CURL  
I DONT KNOW WHY I LOVE HER  
BUT I LOVE MY LITTLE GIRL  
AHHAHHAHHAHHAH  
  
WELL GATHER ROUND PEOPLE  
LET ME TELL YOU THE STORY  
OF THE VERY FIRST SONG I WROTE  
WELL GATHER ROUND PEOPLE  
LET ME TELL YOU THE STORY  
OF THE VERY FIRST SONG I WROTE  
  
I WOKE UP LATE THIS MORNING  
MY HEAD WAS IN A WHIRL  
ONLY WHEN I REALISED I LOST MY LITTLE GIRL  
AHHAHHAHHAHHAH  
  
THATS IT
