Chorus  
How strong is my love  
How strong is my love  
How strong is my love  
How wrong could it be  
  
Ill walk a water mile  
Rest a while to kiss your smile  
Laugh and roll and after a while  
Ill begin to like your style  
  
How strong is my love  
How wrong could it be  
She turned me down this time  
She turned me down  
  
Lord I cant believe she  
She turned me down  
She turned me inside out  
She turned me down  
  
All I ask of you  
Is turn me up this time  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on over show me your  
Your glow soul I do adore  
Ill be sure to drop my guard  
Give it up its not that hard  
  
Lord I cant believe she  
She turned me down  
She turned me inside out  
She turned me down  
  
All I ask of you  
Is turn me up this time  
  
Chorus  
  
Tested life but thats alright  
Darker than the darkest night  
Living hell and pollocks at you  
Getting new down your back  
  
How strong is my love  
How wrong could it be
