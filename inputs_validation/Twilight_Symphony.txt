Morning came and so did they flying  
Questions from the police  
Im waiting here in an ambulance for  
Dr landau  
To return and tell me why theyre  
Taking me so far away  
I did what I did and Im glad I did  
Cause I could have been the  
I could have been the next in line  
  
Nobody found a trace of missy  
Id be the last to tell them anyway  
How could I ever ever explain  
  
Now I hear them again singing  
Twilight symphony twilight  
I hear them again singing  
Twilight symphony twilight  
  
Grandma was dead with an open neck  
Blood still running from my open  
Mouth  
I knew they would blame it they  
Would blame it all on me  
How could I ever ever explain  
  
Now I hear them again singing  
Twilight symphony twilight  
I hear them again singing  
Twilight symphony twilight  
  
Dr landau returned and I told him the  
Story  
Are you mad or just insane  
I tried anyway  
You can take him away now the boy  
Has lost his mind  
Oh no no  
  
I havent seen my mother since they  
Took me away  
And dr landau wouldnt tell me  
He wouldnt tell me anything  
Oh Im back on the outside  
  
Time has caught up with me and I  
Must leave for the old house  
Yes I must leave now  
Grandma Im coming  
Im coming home now  
Im coming home now
