Ive traveled far the land and the sea  
Beautiful places I happened to be  
One little town Ill never forget  
Is Lourdes the village of St Bernadette  
  
Ave ave ave Maria  
Ave ave ave Mariiia  
  
There like a dream this wonderful night  
I gazed at the grotto aglow in the light  
A feeling divine swept over me there  
I fell to my knees as I whispered the prayer  
  
Ave ave ave Maria  
Ave ave ave Mariiia  
  
Now I am home Im happy to be  
Telling of places Ive traveled to see  
One little town Ill never forget  
Is Lourdes the village of St Bernadette  
  
Ave ave ave Maria  
Ave ave ave Mariiia  
  
Ave ave ave Maria  
Ave ave ave Maria
