Im living in this line  
I know my place could think of no way  
Of edging along in a losers race  
The line was moving slowly  
Day by night  
Everybodys shuffling on to keep a place in the line  
  
Nine long years Ive been in line  
Getting nowhere there is no reason  
For this line I dont care  
Everybodys standing in the burning sun  
Everybodys shuffling on keeping a place in the line  
  
Dont you think were gonna make it  
Weve got a place in line  
Were gonna make it some time  
Somehow
