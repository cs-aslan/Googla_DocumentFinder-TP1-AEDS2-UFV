There was a time  
We thought our dream was over  
When you and I  
Had surely reached the end  
Still here we are  
The flame as strong as ever  
All because we both kept holding on  
We know we can weather any storm  
Baby thats what love is all about  
Two hearts that find a way somehow  
To keep the fire burning  
Its something we could never live without  
It it takes forever  
We can work it out  
Beyond a shadow of a doubt  
Baby thats what love is all about  
As time goes by  
Weve learned to rediscover  
The reason why  
This dream of our survives  
Through thick and thin  
Were destined for each other  
Knowing we can reach the other side  
Far beyond the mountains of our pride  
Ridin the good times is easy  
The hard times can tear you apart  
Therell be times in your heart  
When the feelin is gone  
But ya keep on believing  
And ya keep holdin on  
Baby thats what love is all about  
Two hearts that find a way somehow  
To keep the dream from dying  
Its something we could never live without  
If it takes forever  
We can work it out  
Beyond a shadow of a doubt  
Baby thats what love is all about
