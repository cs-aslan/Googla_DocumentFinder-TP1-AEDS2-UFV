Aint no good life  
Not the one that I lead  
Cause the more I fight the sadness yeah  
It only seems the more that I grieve  
Well I look back on the good times  
As some lost part of me  
I want to know tell me why is it so  
Well just because I dont pray  
Lord that dont mean I aint forgiven  
Just cause Im alive  
That dont mean Im makin a livin  
  
Im gonna get myself together  
Im gonna try a dyin attempt  
Talkin about the good times slippin by  
Yeah I tell ya  
I dont even know where last month went  
Well I cant make no money baby  
Well cause my moneys already spent  
And I know where it went  
I said it went on that damn rent  
Well I dont mean change baby  
I mean foldin money  
Well I want lovin said I dont need a buddy  
I dont need nobody now  
  
Aint exactly my idea  
Its sort of old borrowed and blue  
Just tryin to say  
Dont try that straight life buddy  
Oh youll find it kind of hard on you  
Women dont try to cook nothin up ooh  
Brother you know youll only wind up in your own stew  
Just dont let nobody tell you oh what you oughta do
