Sweet love sweet love  
Trapped in your love  
Ive opened up unsure I can trust  
My heart and I were buried in dust  
Free me free us  
  
Youre all I need when Im holding you tight  
If you walk away I will suffer tonight  
  
I found a man I can trust  
And boy I believe in us  
I am terrified to love for the first time  
Can you see that Im bound in chains  
I finally found my way  
I am bound to you  
I am bound to you  
  
So much so young  
Ive faced on my own  
Walls I built up became my home  
Im strong and Im sure theres a fire in us  
Sweet love so pure  
  
I catch my breath with just one beating heart  
And I brace myself please dont tear this apart  
  
I found a man I can trust  
And boy I believe in us  
I am terrified to love for the first time  
Cant you see that Im bound in chains  
I finally found my way  
I am bound to you  
I am bound to  
  
Suddenly the moments here  
I embrace my fears  
All that I have been carrying all these years  
Do I risk it all  
Come this far just to fall fall  
  
Oh I can trust  
And boy I believe in us  
I am terrified to love for the first time  
Can you see that Im bound in chains  
And finally found my way  
I am bound to you  
  
I am  
Ooh I am  
Im bound to you
