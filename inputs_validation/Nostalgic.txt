Dont be sad that its over  
Just be happy that it happened to us  
Dont look back and remember  
Drunken tears oh remember the love  
  
In my head I see you laughing  
From the words I said felt like a new beginning  
In my head I see you standing there  
The words you said felt like a story ending  
  
We will never ever be the same  
Pictures changing but not the frame  
When Im sleeping I still kiss your face  
I cant have it when Im awake  
  
Chorus  
And I know we lost it I still get nostalgic  
Even if we wanted we cant turn back the hands of time  
And I know we lost it I still get nostalgic  
Nostalgic  
  
I wonder if youre wearing  
That gold chain with a promise from me  
Honestly felt so real then  
Even now its not hard to believe  
  
In my head I see you laughing  
From the words I said felt like a new beginning  
In my head I see you standing there  
The words you said felt like a story ending  
  
We will never ever be the same  
Pictures changing but not the frame  
When Im sleeping I still kiss your face  
I cant have it when Im awake  
  
Chorus  
And I know we lost it I still get nostalgic  
Even if we wanted we cant turn back the hands of time  
And I know we lost it I still get nostalgic  
Nostalgic  
  
Bridge  
We will never ever be the same  
We will never ever be the same  
We will never ever be the same  
Never be the same  
  
Chorus  
And I know we lost it I still get nostalgic  
Even if we wanted we cant turn back the hands of time  
And I know we lost it I still get nostalgic  
Nostalgic  
  
And I know we lost it I still get nostalgic  
Even if we wanted we cant turn back the hands of time  
And I know we lost it I still get nostalgic  
Nostalgic
