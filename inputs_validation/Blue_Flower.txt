Waitin for a sign from you  
Waitin for a signal to change  
Have you forgotten what your love can do  
Is this the end  
  
Walkin through the city  
Your boots are highhilled and are shinin bright  
The sun was sparklin on the shaft of your knife  
Flower in the morning rain  
Dying in my hand  
  
Was it all in vain  
Superstar in your own private movie  
I wanted just a minor part  
But Im no fool  
I know youre cool  
I never really wanted your heart  
  
Youre the keeper of the key  
Nothing seems to bring you down  
Its not that cool when Im around  
Flower in the morning rain  
Dying in my hand  
  
Was it all in vain  
Superstar in your own bright movie  
I wanted just a minor part  
But Im no fool  
I know youre cool  
I never really wanted your heart
