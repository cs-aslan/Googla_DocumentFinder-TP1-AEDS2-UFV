I put down more hits than mafioso made  
And Lucky Lucianno bout to sing soprano  
And I know I know the way you feel  
And baby bubba we gon keep it on tha real  
  
Just to get you caught up in amazement  
We puffin on Cubans so it might get dangerous  
But when it isnt you can sit izzon bizzack  
And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack ha ha  
  
How you feelin Im up to dealin ridin like a villan  
Makin a killin thrillin the crowd wit my new hairdo  
Outfits unused fifty dollar socks hundredthousand dollar shoes  
Man Im givin blues to these sucka MCs  
  
Who you be You know who I be young nigga  
Im Tha DoggFather  
  
Chorus x 2  
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father Father  
  
Lets make a move for this paper Where we rollin Dogg  
We gots ta get paid Makin money all yall  
I mean I steps to tha stage in my Gboy stance  
And say a few rhymes to make your girl want to dance  
  
Im so fly like a dove  
I come from up above  
You trippin on your girl cause she showed me love  
Nigga dont beat em cause if you beat em you dont need em  
  
You lay your hands on me watch how fast I take your freedom  
I delete em but dont mistreat em  
I stay up on em and thats one ta grow on  
Let me flow on  
  
You can rock to tha rythme you see  
or you can rock to tha rythme of me  
Just remember when you do your thang  
Make sure you do your thang on a hang  
  
And everythang is everythang  
There aint no mo than this paper chase  
Like them whiteboy DAs was on tha case  
You know I aint tryin ta floss but uh  
Murder murder murder was the case that they lost  
Im Tha DoggFather  
  
Chorus  
  
Now do anybody in tha house remember  
When there wasnt no Snoop Dogg Hell yeah  
There wasnt no rappers hollin bout LBC  
Am I trippin yall Hell no  
  
Now when I grow up I want to be like Snoop  
Have prestigious women  
Thats the truth from the beginning  
In and out of the flyest hotels  
  
You say your family dont know me  
Hold on hommie thats foremost and promos  
Sales tails scales and jails  
Success before death  
  
No one in my clique fails  
As females with the almighty Father lead  
Succeedin ta give my peeps just what they need  
And it aint no party like this kind  
  
Cause you can leave your worries behizzind  
But Ima git back to tha grizzind  
Snoop DO double G comin back for mizzine and  
Im tha DoggFather  
  
Chorus until fade
