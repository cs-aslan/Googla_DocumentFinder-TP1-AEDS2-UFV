At the far end of the midway  
By the double Ferris wheel  
Theres a band that plays so snakey  
You cant help how you feel  
Emmie Mae ran away  
With a man as dark as night  
You can see him if you go there  
Second trumpet to the right  
  
They play Night Train  
So snaky  
Black girls dancing  
Long and lanky  
Barkers barking  
Step right up folks  
The show is about to begin  
Its Harlem in Havana time  
Step right in  
Silver spangles  
See em dangle in the farm boys eyes  
Hootchie kootchie  
Auntie Ruthie wouldve cried  
If she knew we were on the inside  
  
When Emmie Mae ran away  
She came back a bottle blond  
God The gossips had a gourmet feast  
Chomping on how she was born  
But miracle of miracles  
cause we were underage  
She got us nearly front row seats  
To the right side of the stage  
See that tall girl  
Thats a man  
That one too  
Big yellow feather fan  
Barkers barking  
Step right up folks  
The show is about to begin  
Its Harlem in Havana time  
Step right in  
Silver spangles  
See em dangle in the farm boys eyes  
Hootchie kootchie  
Auntie Ruthie wouldve died  
If she knew we were on the inside
