I was 18 when I came to town  
They called it the summer of love  
Burning babies burning flags  
The hawks against the doves  
  
I took a job at the steaming way  
Down on Caltrim St  
Fell in love with a laundry girl  
That was workin next to me  
  
Brown hair zig zagged across her face  
And a look of half surprise  
Like a fox caught in the headlights  
There was animal in her eyes  
  
She said to me  
Cant you see Im not the factory kind  
If you dont take me out of here  
Ill surely lose my mind  
  
She was a rare thing fine as a bees wing  
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away  
She was a lost child she was runnin wild  
She said  
So long as theres no price on love Ill stay  
You wouldnt want me any other way  
  
We busked around the market towns  
Fruit pickin down in Kent  
We could tinker pots and pans  
Or knives wherever we went  
  
We were campin down the Gower one time  
The work was mighty good  
She wouldnt wait for the harvest  
I thought we should  
  
I said to her well settle down  
Get a few acres dug  
A fire burning in the hearth  
And babies on the rug  
  
She said Oh man you foolish man  
That surely sounds like hell  
You might be lord of half the world  
Youll not own me as well  
  
She was a rare thing fine as a bees wing  
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away  
She was a lost child she was runnin wild  
She said  
So long as theres no price on love Ill stay  
You wouldnt want me any other way  
  
We were drinking more in those days  
Our tempers reached a pitch  
Like a fool I let her run away  
When she took the rambling itch  
  
Last I heard she was living rough  
Back on the Derby beat  
A bottle of White Horse in her pocket  
A Wolfhound at her feet  
  
They say that she got married once  
To a man called Romany Brown  
Even a gypsy caravan  
Was too much like settlin down  
  
They say her rose has faded  
Rough weather and hard booze  
Maybe thats the price you pay  
For the chains that you refuse  
  
She was a rare thing fine as a bees wing  
I miss her more than ever words can say  
If I could just taste all of her wildness now  
If I could hold her in my arms today  
I wouldnt want her any other way
