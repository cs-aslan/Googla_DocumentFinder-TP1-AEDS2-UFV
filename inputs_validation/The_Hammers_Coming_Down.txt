Where will you be when the sky comes down  
And what would you do if the strength was found  
Stand right beside me when the ground starts shaking  
The only sound youll hear is the breath were taking  
If there is one thing I can promise you  
Well see the light again  
  
This is the calm before the coming storm  
This is the red sky morning  
Without warning now  
This is the fight that weve been waiting for  
And theres no sense in running  
The hammers coming down  
The hammers coming  
  
Once its started theres no turning back  
And Ill be with you when the sun turns black  
Cause finding faith will always be the hardest  
When youre standing in the heart of darkness  
If there is one thing I can promise you  
Well see the light again  
  
This is the calm before the coming storm  
This is the red sky morning  
Without warning now  
This is the fight that weve been waiting for  
And theres no sense in running  
The hammers coming down  
The hammers coming  
  
Holding on  
Well make it till the dawn  
Itll be here before long  
Holding on  
If we can find the light  
We can make our way back home  
  
Holding on  
Well make it till the dawn  
Itll be here before long  
Holding on  
If we can find the light  
Well find the light come on  
Well find the light come on  
Hold on  
If we can find the light  
Well find the light come on  
Well find the light come on
