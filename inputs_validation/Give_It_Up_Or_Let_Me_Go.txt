Well I told you pretty baby such a long time ago  
If I found you with another well Id walk right out your door  
Woh you might call me crazy but theres one thing you should know  
Oh honey if you want me to love you  
Youve got to give it up or let me go  
  
I know its useless to be jealous I couldnt tire you if I tried  
But when I think of you messing behind my back  
It brings a pain I just cant hide  
Oh baby Ive been true to you  
And if I can make that sacrifice honey you can do it too  
Well you come home drunk and nasty you wont tell me where youve been  
Just when things are nice and sweet you go back out again  
Why do you want to mess up a good thing  
Im gonna find me another man one who wants to give me everything  
  
Well I told you pretty baby such a long time ago
