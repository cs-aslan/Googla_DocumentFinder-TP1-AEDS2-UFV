On his way to dinner when it took him by surprise  
And with one pull of the trigger he would vanish overnight  
Dancing by the roadside holding on for dear life  
The a gun from out of nowhere made a widow of his wife  
  
I dont mind single file down the runway  
Feelin fine and Ill see you my friend  
Over and over again  
  
Who can we get on this case  
We need Perry Mason  
Someone to put you in place  
Calling Perry Mason  
  
Riding painted horses oh the kids the love it so  
You can see it on their faces how they love the wind to blow  
Minding my own business like my mama always said  
But if I dont try to helpum they could wind up on the front page  
  
I dont mind draw the line then draw me an arrow  
Feelin fine then Ill see you my friend  
Over and over again  
  
Who can we get on this case  
We need Perry Mason  
Someone to put you in place  
Calling Perry Mason  
  
Wake me when its over tell me its all right  
Just keep on talking baby Ive been doing this all night  
How much did you give me tell me itll be all right  
  
Who can we get on this case  
We need Perry Mason  
Someone to put you in place  
Calling Perry Mason again again again again
