Give me all you have Come over  
All you got to give Come over  
Save your guilt till tomorrow Come over  
Wont be that hard to live with  
Satisfy my need Come over  
Wont be that easy Come over  
You gonna have to try a little harder baby Come over  
A little harder please me  
  
Why tell me no Come over  
When what you mean is yeah yeah Come over  
Youll have to tell me what you want to do cause Come over  
You Cant expect me to guess  
Last verse repeats  
My way of thinking
