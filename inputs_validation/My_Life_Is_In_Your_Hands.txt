You dont have to worry  
and dont you be afraid  
joy comes in the morning  
troubles they dont last always  
for theres a friend name Jesus  
who will wipe your tears away  
and if your hear is broken  
just lift your hands and say  
  
Chorus  
Oh I know that I can make it  
I know that I can stand  
no matter what may come my way  
my life is in your hands  
  
You dont have to worry  
And dont you be afraid  
joy comes in the morning  
Troubles they dont last always  
for theres a friend name Jesus  
who will wipe your tears away  
and if your heart is broken  
just lift your hands and say  
  
Chorus  
Oh I know that I can make it  
I know that I can stand  
no matter what may come my way  
my life is in your hands  
with Jesus I can take it  
with him I know I can stand  
no matter what may come my way  
my life is in your hands  
  
So learn your tests and trials  
they seem to get you down  
and all your friends and love ones  
are no where to be found  
remember theres a friend name Jesus  
who will wipe your tears away  
and if your heart is broken  
just lift your hands and say  
  
Chorus  
Oh I know that I can make it  
I know that I can stand  
no matter what may come my way  
My life is in your hands  
with Jesus I can take it  
with him I know I can stand  
no matter what may come my way  
my life is in your hands  
  
repeat chorus all the way until the end
