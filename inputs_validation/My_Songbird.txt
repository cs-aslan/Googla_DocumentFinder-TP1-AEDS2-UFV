Songbird in a golden cage  
Shed prefer the blue  
How I crave the liquor of her song  
Poor bird who has done no harm  
  
What harm could she do  
She shall be my prisoner her life long  
My songbird wants her freedom  
Now dont you think I know  
  
But I cant find it in myself  
To let my songbird go  
I just cant let her go  
  
O lord when your jewelers eye  
Peers into my soul  
O lord I am overcome with shame  
Take me lord and purify  
Heal me with a word  
Lord I beg a gift I dare not claim  
  
My songbird wants her freedom  
Now dont you think I know  
But I cant find it in myself  
To let my songbird go  
I just cant let her go
