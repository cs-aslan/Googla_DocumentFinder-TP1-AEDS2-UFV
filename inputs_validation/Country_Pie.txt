Just like old Saxophone Joe  
When hes hot the hogshead up on his toe  
Oh me oh my  
Love that country pie  
  
Listen to the fiddler play  
When hes playin til the break of day  
Oh me oh my  
Love that country pie  
  
Raspberry strawberry lemon and lime  
What do I care  
Blueberry apple cherry pumpkin and plum  
Call me for dinner  
Honey Ill be there  
  
Saddle me up on my big white goose  
Tie me on er turn her loose  
Oh me oh my  
Love that country pie  
  
I dont need much and that aint no lie  
Aint runnin any race  
Give to me my country pie  
I wont throw it up in anybodys face  
  
Shake me up that old peach tree  
Little Jack Horners got nothin on me  
Oh me oh my  
Love that country pie
