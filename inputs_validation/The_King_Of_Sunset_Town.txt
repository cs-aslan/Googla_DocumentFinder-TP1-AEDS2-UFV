A ragged man came shuffling through  
A puppet king on the fourth of June  
And butterflies from all around  
Settled on his paper crown  
  
A pretty sight it seemed to be  
An avenue of eternal peace  
But he said What is here can soon burn down  
Im the king of Sunset Town  
  
Watch a big wheel turning round  
Some go up and some go down  
Some go thirsty some just drown  
Thats the law round here  
Said the king of Sunset Town  
  
And in the night he comes to me  
And the square becomes a battlefield  
Of staring eyes that cant explain  
The insanity and the greater game  
  
Watch a big wheel turning round  
Some go up and some go down  
Some go thirsty some just drown  
Thats the law round here  
  
Said the king of sunset town  
A ragged man came shuffling through  
The corridors of this white place  
And as he lay his body down  
  
I saw the scars that lined his face  
And injured souls came to his bed  
To hear the stories he would tell  
Of butterflies and summertimes  
  
And everyone assembled here  
Remembers how it used to be  
Before the twentyseventh came  
This place will never be the same  
  
He said Im the king of sunset town  
Watch a big wheel turning round  
Some go up and some go down  
Some go thirsty some just drown  
  
Thats the law round here  
Said the king of sunset town
