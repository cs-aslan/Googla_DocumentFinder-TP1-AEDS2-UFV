When we are dancing  
And youre dangerously near me  
I get ideas I get ideas  
I want to hold you  
So much closer than I dare do  
I want to scold you  
Cause I care more than I care to  
  
And when you touch me  
And theres fire in every finger  
I get ideas yes I get ideas  
And after we have kissed goodnight  
And still you linger  
I kinda think you get ideas too  
  
Your eyes are always saying  
The things youre never saying  
I only hope theyre saying  
That you could love me too  
For thats the whole idea its true  
The lovely idea  
That Im falling in love with you
