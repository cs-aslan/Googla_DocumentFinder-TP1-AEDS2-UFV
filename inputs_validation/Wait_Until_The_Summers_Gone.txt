The time is right but dont be critical  
The same could happen to you  
You know Im not right and I cant be analytical  
About the things youre going through  
Look at me baby now you think I might be crazy  
But you just cant touch me now  
I know Im not right and I really cant be lazy  
And I think Im going home  
Look into my eyes  
  
The high is fine but dont be cynical  
The game is still the same  
If youre coming up light and you want some retribution  
Then believe in what I say  
Take a position where there aint no superstition  
And just grab whatevers gold  
Cause if youre coming up light on the day of testimony  
Theyll just send you packing home  
Theyre gonna do it to ya  
  
Look into my eyes  
Wait for the lies  
  
Wait until the summers gone  
Waiting for the lines to fall  
Wait until the summers gone  
Look into my eyes  
Wait for the lies
