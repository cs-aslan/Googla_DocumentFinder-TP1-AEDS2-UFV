If you need a woman in bed with you  
Tell her in front what you can do  
Its easy easy as pie  
Dont have to be a   
You dont have to lie  
  
If you play the guitar it wont be long  
Youd be writing and singing them songs  
Its easy easy you bet  
And youve been bet if you dont quit  
  
If you feel kinda lonesome a friends inside  
Get yourself a dog and be alright  
Get yourself too lucky me  
Now one thing nice Ill be there twice to love you  
  
Its so easy gettin through these times  
So easy your love and mine  
  
If you wanna think shes ugly and always depressed  
She can go out and buy herself a new dress  
Its easy easy for her  
Solves all of her problems thats for sure  
  
Its so easy gettin through these times  
So easy your love and mine  
  
If she cashes your property you might regret  
Use that old plastic swipe deeper in debt  
Its easy easy you see  
If tomorrow never comes everything is free  
  
Its so easy gettin through these times  
So easy your love and mine  
  
Its so easy gettin through these times  
So easy your love and mine
