There is a house down in New Orleans  
They call the Rising Sun  
And its been the ruin for many a poor boy and me  
Oh God Im one  
My mother was a tailor  
She sowed these old blue jeans  
My father was a gambler Lord  
Down in New Orleans  
The only thing a gambler needs  
Is a suitcase and a trunk  
And the only time hes ever satisfied  
Is when hes on a drunk  
Go tell my baby sister  
Not to do the the things Ive done  
Outshine that house down in New Orleans  
That they call the Rising Sun  
There is a house down in New Orleans  
That they call the Rising Sun  
And its been the ruin for many a poor boy and me  
Oh God Im one
