Ooh woman and a woman them are silly games you play yeah  
didnt you didnt you  
Dealin with your troubles drove me away  
Ooh well a sayin that youre leavin I dont want to hear that talk  
Stare at disbelief in me when I just up and walk  
Outta love outta love again outta love once again  
Ooh lovin and a livin and a treat me like a fool  
didnt you didnt you  
Youre doin all you can to make me sad and blue  
Didnt you  
Ooh well a sayin that youre leavin I dont want to hear that talk  
Stare at disbelief in me when I just up and walk  
Outta love outta love again outta love once again
