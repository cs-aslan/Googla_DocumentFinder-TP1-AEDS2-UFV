Convalescent Home Patients Serving Me With Subpoenas  
Make Sure You Tell The Fuckin Captain His Legs Are Made Of Rubber  
I Got An Apple For Your Forehead If Im Cleaning The Shutters  
Give Me My Turkey Pass  
Tradin Chops Sticks With The Hooligans  
Snakes Are In A Submarine  
Ill Never Go To School Again  
I Stole You A Porsche cause Your Mamas A Fox  
Im Selling Footwear Insoles And Im Running Three Shops  
Horrified Jelly Worms With Electric Infantago  
Dinosaur Crybabies Cookin Shrimp In San Diageo  
Full Moons Mean Nothing Without Your Roller Skates  
When The Water Runs Dry And Blood Fills The Great Lakes  
Im A Hired Assassin But Ice Sculpture Is Art  
And So I Ride A Horse Everywhere Returning Shopping Carts  
Its Raining Fish Flies On The East Side And Im Rappin  
Slutty Ass Skanks Get Slapped For Nappin umph

With That Watermelon Foot Bath They Minds Collide  
Bitch My Knees Been Bald Headed So Download That  
Ridin On A Zamboni In My Danny Kaye Hat  
Im The Number One Contender For A Shot At The Bible Belt  
I Swam Between Piranhas And Assaulted A Patty Melt  
The Red Planet Still Remains In Orbit  
Leavin Trash Piles Cleaned Up By Aj Styles Me And J Giles  
Leopard Shit In My Yard  
I Took The Yellow Pill  
I Once Stabbed A Flamingo But It Was Only A Fire Drill  
Meet Me At The Market For Your Kung Fu Prize  
With That Frozen Ice Firecracker everybody Rise  
Get Your Panties Off Ho This Ship Is Ready To Attack  
Somebody Get On The Piano Im Calling John Cusack  
And Put Ten On Pump Seven If Your Skills Are Tight  
Make Sure You Bring A Wet Mitten cause Its Col Col Col Cold At Night  
  
I Dont Wanna Know About The Shit That Matters  
Skipswitch Forget Shit I Scatter My Brain i Scatter My Brain 4x

I I I Scatter My Brain  
  
I Dont Wanna Know About The Shit That Matters

Skipswitch Forget Shit I Scatter My Brain i Scatter My Brain 2x
