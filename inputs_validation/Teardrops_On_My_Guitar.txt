Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he wont see  
That I want and Im needing everything that we should be  
Ill bet shes beautiful that girl he talks about  
And shes got everything that I have to live without  
  
Drew talks to me I laugh cause it is so damn funny  
That I cant even see anyone when hes with me  
He says hes so in love hes finally got it right  
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night  
  
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar  
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star  
Hes the song in the car I keep singing dont know why I do  
  
Drew walks by me can he tell that I cant breathe  
And there he goes so perfectly  
The kind of flawless I wish I could be  
Shed better hold him tight give him all her love  
Look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause  
  
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar  
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star  
Hes the song in the car I keep singing dont know why I do  
  
So I drive home alone as I turn out the light  
Ill put his picture down and maybe  
Get some sleep tonight  
  
Because hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar  
The only one whos got enough of me to break my heart  
Hes the song in the car I keep singing dont know why I do  
Hes the time taken up but theres never enough  
And hes all that I need to fall into  
  
Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he wont see
