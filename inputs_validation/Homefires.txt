Im not the same man  
I was a while ago  
Ive learned some new things  
I hope that it shows  
  
Im free to give my love  
But youre not the one  
Im thinking of  
So for me  
The wheels are turning  
Got to keep  
The homefires burning  
  
Ill walk these borders  
In search of a line  
Between young lovers  
Who live separate lives  
  
How long can this go on  
I can hear another song  
Late at night  
When Ive been drinking  
Substitute comes at me winking  
  
How long can this go on

When Ive been drinking

Im not the same man  
I was a while ago  
Ive learned some new things  
I hope that it shows  
  
Im free to give my love  
But youre not the one  
Im thinking of
