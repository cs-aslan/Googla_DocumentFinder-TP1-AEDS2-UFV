Saturday night and youre still hangin around  
Tired of living in your one horse town  
Youd like to find a little hole in the ground  
For a while  
  
So you go to the village in your tie dyed jeans  
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens  
Its like some pornographic magazine  
And you smile  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push and youll be smilin  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Your sisters gone out shes on a date  
You just sit at home and masturbate  
Your phone is gonna ring soon but you just cant wait  
For that call  
  
So you stand on the corner in your New English clothes  
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes  
Ah but still your fingers gonna pick your nose  
After all  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push and youll be smilin  
  
So you decide to take a holiday  
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet  
Ah there aint no place to go anyway  
What for  
  
So you got everything ah but nothings cool  
They just found your father in the swimming pool  
And you guess you wont be going back to school  
Anymore  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push and youll be smilin  
  
So you play your albums and you smoke your pot  
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot  
Oh but still youre aching for the things you havent got  
What went wrong  
  
And if you cant understand why your world is so dead  
Why youve got to keep in style and feed your head  
Well youre 21 and still your mother makes your bed  
And thats too long  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push and youll be smilin  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push and youll be smilin
