Summer night in Harlem  
Man its really hot  
Well its too hot to sleep  
And too hot to eat  
I dont care if I die or not  
  
Winter night in Harlem  
Oh oh radiator wont get hot  
And that mean ole landlord  
He dont care if I freeze to death or not  
  
Saturday night in Harlem  
Ahh every things alright  
You can really swing and shake your pretty thing  
The parties are out of sight  
  
Sunday morning here in Harlem  
Now every bodys all dressed up  
The heathen folk just getting home from the party  
And the good folk just got up  
Our crooked delegation  
Wants a donation  
To send the preacher to the holy land  
Hey hey lord honey dont give your money  
To that lying cheating man  
  
Saturday night in Harlem  
Ahh every things alright  
You can really swing and shake your pretty thing  
The parties are out of sight
