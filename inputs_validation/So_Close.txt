Youve been keeping me in limbo  
Playing hide and seek  
Youve been teasing me cause you know  
That it makes me weak  
Youve done everything to fall in love  
I know what youre running from  
Kisses like these are few and far between  
Now were so close yet so far away  
Im breaking down the distance  
With every move with every touch  
Youre wearing down my resistance  
You know your lonely days are numbered  
Theres nothing you can do  
Therell be no more keeping us apart  
Im ready for the love to start  
I can almost feel it breaking through  
Now were so close yet so far away  
Im breaking down the distance  
With every move and every touch  
Im wearing down your resistance  
I wanna get closer closer to you  
I can almost feel it breaking through  
So close yet so far away  
Im breaking down the distance  
With every move and every touch  
Im wearing down your resistance  
So close yet so far away  
Im breaking down the distance  
With every touch and every move  
Youre wearing down my resistance
