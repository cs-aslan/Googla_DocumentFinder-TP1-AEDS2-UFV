Yeah ooh uh  
  
This ones for the mothers who have lost a child  
And this ones for the gypsies whove left their hearts behind  
This is for the strangers sleeping in my heart  
Who take what they want yeah and leave while its still dark  
  
No one is glamorously lonely  
All by themselves all by themselves  
  
This is a song for the unloved  
This is the music for one last cry  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
Its a song for the unloved the unloved  
  
This ones for the bridesmaid never the bride  
This ones for the dreamers who lock their faith inside who lock their faith
inside  
And this is for the widows who think theres only one  
For the dying fathers who never told their sons  
  
No one is glamorously lonely  
Follow your heart follow your heart  
  
This is a song for the unloved  
This is the music for one last cry one last cry  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
Its a song for the unloved unloved  
The unloved  
  
Oh tomorrow the sun will shine  
And dry the tears in your eyes  
Suddenly love comes alive  
Suddenly love comes alive  
  
For one last cry  
Just one last cry  
Ohh  
  
This is a song for the unloved  
This is the music for one last cry  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
  
This is a song for the unloved loved  
This is the music for one last cry one last cry  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
  
This is this is  
This is a song for the unloved  
This is the music for one last cry  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
Its a song for the unloved  
Song for the unloved the unloved
