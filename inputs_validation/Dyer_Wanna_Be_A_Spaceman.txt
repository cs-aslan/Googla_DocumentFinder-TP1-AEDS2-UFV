I havent seen your face round  
Since I was Kid  
Your bringing back those memories  
Of the thing that we did  
Youre hanging round and climbing trees  
Pretending to fly  
Dyer want to be a spaceman and live in the sky  
You got how many bills to pay  
And how many kids  
And you forgot  
About the things that we did  
The town where were living  
Has made you a man  
And all of your dreams  
Are washed in the sand  
Well its alright  
Its alright  
Who are you and me to say  
Whats wrong and whats right  
Do you still feel like me  
We sit down here  
And we shall see  
We can talk  
And find common ground  
And we can just forget  
About feeling down  
We can just forget  
About life in this town  
Its funny how your dreams  
Change as youre growing old  
You dont want to be no spaceman  
You just want gold  
Allthe dream stealers  
Are lying in wait  
But if you want to be a spaceman  
Its still not too late  
Well its alright  
Its alright  
Who are you and me to say  
Whats wrong and whats right  
Do you still feel like me  
We sit down here  
And we shall see  
We can talk  
And find common ground  
And we can just forget  
About feeling down  
We can just forget  
About life in this town  
Its funny how your dreams  
Change as youre growing old  
You dont want to be no spaceman  
You just want gold Dream stealers  
Are lying in wait  
But if you want to be a spaceman  
Its still not too late  
Well its alright  
Its alright  
Who are you and me to say  
Whats wrong and whats right  
Do you still feel like me  
We sit down here  
And we shall see  
We can talk  
And find common ground  
And we can just forget  
About feeling down  
We can just forget  
About life in this town
