Tomorrow is a brand new day  
All my sins have been washed away  
My hands look new my life is free  
My heart is pure Ive been redeemed  
  
Ive seen His face touched His hands  
Finally now I understand  
Why He saved a wretch a wretch like me  
And by His blood Ive been redeemed  
  
Chorus  
We ran the race we kept the fight  
We shed our blood for what was right  
We carried our cross through storm and rain  
Because of Christ now we can say  
We are conquerors conquerors  
We are conquerors conquerors  
  
Ive seen His face  
Ive touched His hands  
Finally now I understand  
Why He saved a wretch  
Saved a wretch like you and me  
And by His blood Ive been redeemed  
  
Chorus  
  
No matter what we go through  
We are conquerors  
Lord Im gonna give my problems to You  
We are conquerors
