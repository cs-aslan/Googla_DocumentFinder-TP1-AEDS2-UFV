Oh Candy why did you do it  
You shouldve called me on the telephone  
I didnt expect for you call me  
Cause I didnt think that you were alone  
So alone  
  
Chorus  
Oh Candy worked so hard  
At doin what he thought was right  
It really really doesnt mean a thing  
Oh Candy worked so hard  
At doin what he thought was right  
It really really doesnt mean a thing  
  
Oh Candy why did you do it  
You didnt stick a needle in your vein  
You just got so damned depressed  
We all liked you except yourself  
  
Chorus  
  
You you wont be comin around no more  
You you wont be comin around no more  
Oh Candy why did you do it  
I didnt think you heard a word that I said
