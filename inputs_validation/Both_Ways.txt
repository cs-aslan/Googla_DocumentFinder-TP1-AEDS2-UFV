Be honest with me  
Did you ever think  
That these things that you did  
Would come back to haunt you  
And fail you again  
Dont ever question  
My will to admit  
That when were alone  
Its too hard to resist  
Making believe  
That were bigger than this  
For choosing a road  
That is different but similar  
To the same one I took before  
  
Why dont we breathe  
Why cant you see  
That things arent always  
What they appear to be  
And as simple as it sounds  
I think Ive found  
The perfect way to grow old  
  
The simpleness describes  
The iron that is you  
And your rusty old life  
Get on with the mattress  
And telltale lies  
Watch everything  
That you touch turns to ice  
Following the sheep  
And theyre at it again  
Making believe  
That therere free as it seems  
But only finding out that  
Theyre on a sinking ship  
That doesnt care  
How many it saves today  
  
Why dont we breathe  
Why cant you see  
That things arent always  
What they appear to be  
And as simple as it sounds  
I think Ive found  
The perfect way to grow old  
  
Watch out now  
I see the light  
At the end of the tunnel  
It seems realistic  
That getting there will make us fine  
But watch out now  
Its full of glass  
Dont take the chance  
Youll surely pass  
At least some day  
Well know the reason  
Why  
  
Why dont we breathe  
Why cant you see  
That things arent always  
What they appear to be  
And as simple as it sounds  
I think Ive found  
The perfect way to grow old  
  
The perfect way  
The perfect way
