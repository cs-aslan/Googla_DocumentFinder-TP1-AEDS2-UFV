Well Ive been turnstyled  
Junkpiled  
And railroaded too  
Ive been laid low  
But dont you know  
Im still in love with you  
Ive been took down many a road  
If anybody says I aint day lie  
But aint got no plans  
Except to be your man  
And love you til I die  
  
Well you got me under your spell  
Wont you tell  
Me all bout your wonderful charms  
I got time to burn  
And a lot to learn  
Mama take me in your lovin arms  
Well I know that probably  
You feel quite oddly  
Bout you hear say  
But if you hold me tight  
Its gonna be all right  
Mama chase my blues away
