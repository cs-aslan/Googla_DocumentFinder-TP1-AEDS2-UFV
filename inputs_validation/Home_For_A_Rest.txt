Youll have to excuse me  
Im not at my best  
Ive been gone for a month  
Ive been drunk since I left  
These socalled vacations will  
Soon be my death  
Im so sick from the drink  
I need home for a rest  
We arrived in December  
And London was cold  
We stayed in the bars  
Along Jarring cross road  
We never saw nothing  
But brasstops and nook  
Kept a shine on the bar  
With the sleeves of our coats  
Youll have to excuse me  
Im not at my best  
Ive been gone for a week  
Ive been drunk since I left  
These socalled vacations will  
Soon be my death  
Im so sick from the drink  
I need home for a rest  
Take me home  
Houston station  
The trains heading North  
In the bucket car  
We looked back and forth  
I stole crooked dice  
Through Yorkshires green fields  
We were flung into dance  
As the train jigged and reeled  
Youll have to excuse me  
Im not at my best  
Ive been gone for a week  
Ive been drunk since I left  
These socalled vacations will  
Soon be my death  
Im so sick from the drink  
I need home for a rest  
Take me home  
By the light of the moon  
She drift through the streets  
A rare old perfume  
So seductive and sweet  
She teases and flirts  
As the pubs all close down  
Then walk us on home  
And deny us a round  
Youll have to excuse me  
Im not at my best  
Ive been gone for a month  
Ive been drunk since I left  
These socalled vacations will  
Soon be my death  
Im so sick from the drink  
I need home for a rest  
Take me home  
The gas heat is empty  
Its damn past two  
The spirits we drank  
Left ghosts in the room  
Im asking again  
Come on please take me soon  
And dont lift my head  
Til the twelve bells at noon  
Youll have to excuse me  
Im not at my best  
Ive been gone for a week  
Ive been drunk since I left  
These socalled vacations will  
Soon be my death  
Im so sick from the drink  
I need home for a rest  
Take me home
