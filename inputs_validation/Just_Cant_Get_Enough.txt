When Im with you baby  
I go out of my head  
And I just cant get enough  
And I just cant get enough  
All the things you do to me  
And everything you said  
I just cant get enough  
I just cant get enough  
  
We slip and slide as we fall in love  
And I just cant seem to get enough of  
  
We walk together  
Were walking down the street  
And I just cant get enough  
And I just cant get enough  
Every time I think of you  
I know we have to meet  
And I just cant get enough  
I just cant get enough  
  
Its getting hotter  
Its a burning love  
And I just cant seem to get enough of  
  
Repeat x2  
I just cant seem to get enough  
  
And when it rains  
Youre shining down for me  
And I just cant get enough  
And I just cant get enough  
Just like a rainbow  
You know you set me free  
And I just cant get enough  
And I just cant get enough  
  
Youre like an angel  
And you give me your love  
And I just cant seem to get enough of  
  
Repeats  
I just cant get enough
