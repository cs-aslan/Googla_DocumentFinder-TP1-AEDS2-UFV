You tell me you want a woman whos  
As simple as a flower  
Well if you want me to act like that  
Youd better pay me by the hour  
  
Dont want to travel in the danger zone  
Take another number  
Dont want a lover who can hold her own  
Baby step aside if you dont want to ride  
Because  
  
Chorus  
Wild women do  
And they dont regret it  
Wild women show  
What theyre goin through  
Wild women do  
What you think theyll never  
What you only dream about  
Wild women do  
  
You think that love is a vision of  
A princess in a picture  
Well let me tell you something little boy  
You wouldnt know love if it hit ya  
  
Scared of someone who is off the wall  
Kickin and a screamin  
Dont you want a lover who can do it all  
Listen to me Jack  
I aint holdin back  
cause  
  
Chorus  
Come on and wild with me baby  
Everybody come on  
Everybody get wild  
  
Chorus
