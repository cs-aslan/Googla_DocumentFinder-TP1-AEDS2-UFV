Do you remember me  
I sat upon your knee  
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies  
Well Im all grown up now  
Can you still help somehow  
Im not a child but my heart still can dream  
So heres my lifelong wish  
My grownup Xmas list  
Not for myself but for a world in need  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
Every man would have a friend  
That right would always win  
And love would never end  
This is my grownup Christmas list  
What is this illusion called  
The innocence of youth  
Maybe only in that blind belief  
Can we ever find the truth  
Thered be no more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And every man would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end  
This is my growup Xmas list  
This is my only lifelong wish  
This is my grownup Xmas list
