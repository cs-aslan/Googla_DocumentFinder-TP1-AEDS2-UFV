Heaven is a woman  
Dressed in blue  
And heaven is knowing  
Someone who is in love with you  
Heaven is a television  
Left on all day  
And heaven is making love  
And then running away  
  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
  
Heaven is believing  
What your eyes dont see  
And heaven is christy canyon  
Falling in love with me  
Heaven in waking up  
To be a millionaire  
And heaven is spending the whole next day  
Just walking on air  
  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
  
All these things you say and do  
It doesnt mean that much to you  
But all these things you said to me  
The memories wont set me free  
Heaven is a dream  
When it wont come true  
And heaven is the sky  
When its always blue  
Heaven is the girl  
With short black hair  
And heaven is a woman  
With enough to spare  
  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
  
Heaven is  
And heaven is taking a holiday  
And heaven is having you here to stay  
And heaven is never ever saying sorry  
And heaven is as easy as abc  
And heaven is your eyes when theyre always blue  
And heaven is just right here with you  
  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
Heaven is
