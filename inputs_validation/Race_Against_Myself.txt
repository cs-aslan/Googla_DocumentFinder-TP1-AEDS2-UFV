All I want  
All I need  
Always lies just out of reach  
Ive been coming up empty  
  
Ive run as fast  
As I can run  
Ive pushed as hard as anyone  
Still theres nothing for me  
  
Ive tried as hard as I can  
Ive taken all I can stand  
But I am running a race  
Against myself  
  
Burning out  
Strung along  
Now my sorrow is my song  
My whole world is halfhearted  
  
For my pain  
I have none  
After all is said and done  
Now Im back where I started  
  
Ive gone as far as I can  
Ive taken all I can stand  
But I am running a race  
Against myself
