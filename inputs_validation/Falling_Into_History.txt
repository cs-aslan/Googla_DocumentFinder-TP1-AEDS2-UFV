Dont matter what people say  
I never did believe them  
I know I know they know everything  
  
Ill be alright by myself  
And no ones gonna tell me Im defined  
Confined by love  
  
Now our days seem strange  
I guess my heart was bound to change  
  
I fell out out of you and me  
Youre fading from view  
And youre falling into history  
I fell out out of you and me  
Youre fading from view  
And youre falling into history  
  
I never thought that Id say  
That I dont really miss you  
I lived I breathed your breath through me  
  
Time has a way of passing by  
Until I dont remember why  
Or how to hurt for you  
  
Loves pain has gone somewhere  
And Im finally hanging it there  
  
I fell out out of you and me  
Youre fading from view  
And youre falling into history  
I fell out out of you and me  
Youre fading from view  
And youre falling into history  
  
Falling into  
Falling into  
Youre falling into history  
  
I fell out out of you and me  
Youre fading from view  
And youre falling into history  
I fell out out of you and me  
Youre fading from view  
And youre falling into history  
  
Ill be alright by myself  
And no ones gonna tell me Im defined  
Confined by love
