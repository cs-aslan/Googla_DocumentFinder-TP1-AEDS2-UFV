Chorus  
She had Hennessey hips and Belve eyes  
Grey Goose on her lips and cognac thighs  
Im hungover hungover from Ms Hangover Hangover  
She had a bubble like Cris Patron all night  
Had one mo sip too drunk to drive  
Im hungover hungover from Ms Hangover Hangover  
  
Flo Rida  
Hey hey hey shorty took me to tipsy from sober  
Looked at me so fatigued I must be her soldier  
Hopin she wouldnt tease and get in my Rover  
Lil momma you got to breathe like diamonds supposed ta  
Come closer can I hold ya just what I need  
Like my Gucci loafers hold the disappointment must be sealed inside  
Bowlegged woman thats what I need I dont mind  
Like how she flaunt it see thats my speed she a dime  
Thought for a moment how could this be so fine  
Body bangin I lay the language that walk is famous  
The proper anus like she was painted  
She got me tainted I gotta brang it this woman dangerous  
None other whos her lover this above her  
Get it from her mother did it to her brother  
Magazine cover glad to meet a hustler  
Shorty whats up She had  
  
Chorus  
  
Flo Rida  
Hey parking lot pimpin yeah thats the way I approached her  
Hips went up and down like a roller coaster  
Miss got her attention tapped her on the shoulder  
Serious she the business and I need closure  
So hood and Im startin Im blowin see no stuck up trumpin  
Bugari Im good and I smell like the fragrance of money  
Im sorry this lady take over just like a tsunami  
She had on the Jacob Im rockin my platinum my money  
This aint your normal every day baby  
The type to drive nothin less than that 600 Mercedes  
Its rare that you find a woman so vicious on the daily  
That grant all your wishes with looks to kill like a 380  
I feel like she put me under a spell  
Pretty ambitious about delicious full attention on the yell  
Shorty ridiculous I had a mission to conquer the gal  
I put her on my tab had her sippin call a cab  
  
Chorus

All my ballers if you with me let me hear you say Im hungover
