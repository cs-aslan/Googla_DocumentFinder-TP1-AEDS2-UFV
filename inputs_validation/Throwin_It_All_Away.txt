You couldnt feel the sunlight upon your face  
Your little world  
A little out of place  
You couldnt hear the ocean  
You couldnt hear the waves  
I know you meant to come back  
I know you meant to stay  
  
All you touched  
All you know  
All you loved  yeh  
  
Well I can see you smile  
Can you see my tears  
I reach to hold you  
But you aint there  
You left a hole so big lord Beyond repair  
Ill try to find forgiveness in talkin what  
Will never share  
  
All you touched  
All you know  
All you loved  
You just left em with nothing to say  
  
Chorus  
Youre just throwin it all away  
No you didnt care to see the light of day  
Youre just throwin it all away  
Like the sand upon the beach  
Your crashing waves came took you away
