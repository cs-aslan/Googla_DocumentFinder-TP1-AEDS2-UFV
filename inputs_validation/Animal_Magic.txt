What did you mean when you opened your mouth  
and let all our secrets out  
You told him what I was about  
my cover was completely blown  
I tell you darlin Ive been watching the war film  
I got a few ideas of my own  
cause after the film had ended the call for recruits was shown  
  
And Im joining the professionals  
I want to be a man  
with all that animal magic  
Ill do anything you can  
Im joining the professionals  
cause I want to be a man  
look I wave my wand watch the rabbit disappear  
Join the professionals and learn to fight  
  
I bet the two of you still laugh at me  
for being as timid as a lamb  
That may be still the way I look  
its no longer what I am  
Been across to Northern Ireland  
I came home with a new kind of charge  
I learned to hunt in the night  
I learned about camouflage  
  
Been joining the professionals  
and now that Im a man  
with all that animal magic  
Ill match anything you can  
Im joining the professionals  
this time Ill understand  
Theres no way youll get by me  
With the slightest sleight of hand  
Im joining the professionals  
I want to be a man  
look I wave my wand  
watch the rabbit disappear  
Join the professionals and learn to fight  
  
Animal magic
