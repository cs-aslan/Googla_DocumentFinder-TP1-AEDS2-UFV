Neither awake or asleep  
Dwell somewhere in between  
Neither someone or something  
Be it life alone  
I walk it like a park  
Half real half fancy  
  
A million tonight  
A million to fight  
A million to light  
A million is right  
  
Chorus  
  
Yonder wails on my sleeve  
In the arms of makebelieve  
Sleep will set you free  
In the arms of makebelieve  
In the arms that let me be  
  
Abide by a dreamers flight  
Cheater misfit on high  
Alone in the landscapes  
Periwinkle skies  
A worried pretender passes me by  
  
A million tonight  
A million to light  
A million to fight
