Im full of regret  
For all the things that I have done and said  
And I dont know if itll ever be okay to show  
My face round here  
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear  
  
Would you ever turn your head and look  
To see if Im gone  
Cause I fear  
  
Chorus  
There is nothing left to say to you  
That you want to hear  
That you want to know  
I think I should go  
The things Ive done are way too shameful  
  
Youre just an innocent  
A helpless victim of a spiders web  
And Im an insect  
Going after anything that I can get  
So youd better turn your head and run  
And dont look back  
Cause I fear  
  
Chorus  
  
And I have done you so wrong  
Treated you bad  
Strung you along  
Oh shame on myself  
I dont know how I got so tangled up  
Cause I fear  
  
Chorus
