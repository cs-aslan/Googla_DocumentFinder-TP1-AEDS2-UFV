Sexual sexual irresistible  
Sexual sexual irresistible  
I thought about it  
Me and you  
Its time to make my move  
Somethin good  
Is goin on  
A phenomenon  
Im not that kind of girl to be so sexual  
Maybe its physical but I dont care  
This time Im letting go  
So turn the lights down low  
Im gonna move it slow  
And I wont let go  
Were gonna ride it ride it  
Keep it goin on  
Til the break of dawn  
Baby all night long  
Were gonna ride it ride it  
No doubt about it  
I cant deny  
The way you make me feel  
Lets not imagine  
Its no dream  
Its somethin real  
I never thought that love could be so sexual  
But now Im here with you and Im not scared  
To let my feelings show  
Repeat chorus  
I thought about it  
Me and you  
Its time to make my move  
Somethin good  
Is goin on  
A phenomenon  
Im not that kind of girl to be so sexual  
Maybe its physical but I dont care  
Im not letting go  
Repeat chorus
