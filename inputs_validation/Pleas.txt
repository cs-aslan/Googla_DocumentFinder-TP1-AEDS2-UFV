They say turn the bright lights on  
And there youll find the truth  
Here open up this book  
And now youll find the proof  
It feels like a can of worms  
Keep the lid on tight and they say  
  
Dont let it get too bright  
Dont let it get too bright  
Dont let it get too bright  
No not this time  
  
They tell me it takes sorrow boy  
To help you feel the joy  
They say it takes poverty  
To let you love a toy  
Now you cant have the good  
Until youve shared the bad  
  
Dont let it get too sad  
Dont let it get too sad  
Dont let it get too sad  
No not this time time  
  
They say it takes hardship boy  
To let you love the rest  
Sometimes underneath the load  
Is where I show my best  
Go put your work clothes on  
Go and leave your mark  
And they say  
  
Dont let it get too dark  
Dont let it get too dark  
Dont let it get too dark  
No not this time
