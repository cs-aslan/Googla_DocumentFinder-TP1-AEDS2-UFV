You made me love you  
I didnt want to do it  
I didnt want to do it  
You made me want you  
And all the time you knew it  
I guess you always knew it  
  
You made me happy sometimes  
Sometimes you made me glad  
But there were times dear  
You made me feel so bad  
  
You made me sigh for  
I didnt want to tell you  
I didnt want to tell you  
I want some lovin thats true  
Yes I do indeed I do you know I do  
  
Give me give me give me what I cry for  
You know ya got the brand o kisses that Id die for  
You know you made me love you  
  
You made me sigh for  
I didnt want to tell you  
I didnt want to tell you  
I want some lovin thats true  
Yes I do indeed I do you know I do  
  
Give me give me give me what I cry for  
You know ya got the brand o kisses that Id die for  
You know you made me love you
