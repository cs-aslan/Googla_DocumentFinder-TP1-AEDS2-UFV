In your surrender  
As you laid down your life  
You took up a sinners cross  
And your life rescued mine  
  
In this redemption  
Love and mercy displayed  
You lifted my eyes to see  
That your truth never fails  
  
Bridge  
Lord of the heavens  
King of all days  
Without you my world slips away  
Redeemed by your mercy  
Consumed by your grace  
Now I live for you  
  
Chorus  
Im found in the arms of love  
For your love it has saved my soul  
Ill run to your arms of love  
Your lights gonna lead me home  
  
Glorious savior  
In your light I am free  
The things of this world will fade  
Still you are all that I need  
  
At your cross I lay my burdens  
At your feet where your love covers  
All Ive done  
Now I walk with you lord
