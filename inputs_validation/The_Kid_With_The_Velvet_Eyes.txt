Every day people sway  
Softly lulling me to sleep  
I look the other way  
But I still cant look too deep  
I think Ill fall asleep  
I think Ill fall asleep  
  
So call up and tell him that you will survive  
Good looking kid with the velvet eyes  
You and me and everythings gonna be fine  
  
Every night people fight  
Gently lulling me to sleep  
What gives me the right  
To waste away and weep  
I think Ill turn away  
Theres nothing left to say  
  
So call up and tell him that you will survive  
Good looking kid with the velvet eyes  
You and me and everythings gonna be fine  
So you wanna have everything your heart desires  
Theres a fist full of people with their hearts on fire  
Make your way on up to the front of the line  
  
Get out of my way  
Im here now to stay  
Get out of my way  
Im here now to stay  
  
So call up and tell him that you will survive  
Good looking kid with the velvet eyes  
You and me and everythings gonna be fine  
So you wanna have everything your heart desires  
Theres a fist full of people with their hearts on fire  
Make your way on up to the front of the line
