Im down on love  
An I dont give a damn  
I take my chances  
Whenever I can  
Like a lamb to the slaughter  
Another sacrifice  
For giving love to woman  
With a heart stone cold as ice  
  
Im down on love  
An Im clean out of pain  
I aint no stranger  
To the crying game  
Too scared to suffer  
An too blind to see  
But I played with fire  
An I got what was coming to me  
  
Now one more heartache  
Dont bother me  
Just one more lonely night  
To drown in misery  
  
I am a victim of love  
A victim of love  
Lord I never thought  
Id be a victim of love  
Victim of love victim of love  
Lord I never thought  
Id be a victim of love  
  
Im down on love  
An I feel like a fool  
To beg for mercy  
Cause I broke the rules  
So do me no favors  
With your cool advice  
I know the losing cost  
An Ill pay the price  
  
One more heartache  
Dont bother me  
One more lonely night  
To drown in misery  
  
I am a victim of love  
A victim of love  
Lord I never thought  
Id be a victim of love  
  
Victim of love  
A victim of love  
Lord I never thought  
Id be a victim of love  
  
One more heartache  
Dont bother me  
One more lonely night  
To drown in misery  
  
Victim of love  
A victim of love  
Lord I never thought  
Id be a victim of love
