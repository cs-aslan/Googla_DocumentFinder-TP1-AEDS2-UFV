Fast on a rough road riding  
High through the mountains climbing  
Twisting turning further from my home  
Young like a new moon rising  
Fierce through the rain and lightning  
Wandering out into this great unknown  
  
And I dont want no one to cry but tell em  
If I dont survive  
  
Chorus  
I was born free  
I was born free  
I was born free  
Born Free  
  
Free like a river raging  
Strong if the wind Im facing  
Chasing dreams and racing father time  
Deep like the grandest canyon  
Wild like an untamed stallion  
If you cant see my heart you must be blind  
  
You can knock me down and watch me bleed  
But you cant keep no chains on me  
  
Chorus  
  
And Im not good at long goodbyes but look down  
Deep into my eyes  
  
I was born free  
  
Hey yaya yayaya  
Oh hoo  
  
Calm facing danger  
Lost like an unknown stranger  
Grateful for my time with no regrets  
  
Close to my destination  
Tired frail and aching  
Waitin patiently for the sun to set  
  
And when its done believe that  
I will yell it from that mountain high  
  
Chorus  
  
And I will vow to the shining seas  
And celebrate Gods Grace on me  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh oh oh oh wah hoo
