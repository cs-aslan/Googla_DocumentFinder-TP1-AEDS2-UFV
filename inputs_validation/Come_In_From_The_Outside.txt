Come in from the outside  
Dont be ashamed  
Come in from the outside  
And bless His name  
Its all on the inside  
Where His glory reigns  
Enter in  
  
Come in from the outside  
Just as you are  
Come in from the outside  
Youre not too far  
Its all on the inside  
Simply open your heart  
Enter in
