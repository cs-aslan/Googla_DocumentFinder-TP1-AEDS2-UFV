Im here to collect your hearts  
Its the only reason that I sing  
I dont believe a word you say  
But I cant stop listening  
  
This is the story of how they met  
Her picture was on the back of a pack of cigarettes  
And when she touched him he turned ruby red  
A story that theyll never forget  
Never forget  
  
And all the boys are smoking Menthols  
Girls are getting back rubs  
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough  
  
My old aches become new again  
My old friends become exs again  
  
Oh where did the party go  
We were ending it on the phone  
Im not gonna go home alone  
Where where did the party go  
  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na  
  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na yeah  
  
I know I expect too much  
And not enough all at once  
You know I only wanted fun  
And you got me all fucked up  
Oh no  
  
I looked for your name on the Ouija board  
And youre making magic oh dear lord  
You and me are the difference between real love  
And the love on TV love on TV  
  
And all the boys are smoking Menthols  
Girls are getting back rubs  
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough  
  
My old aches become new again  
My old friends become exs again yeah  
  
Oh where did the party go  
We were ending it on the phone  
Im not gonna go home alone  
Where where did the party go  
  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na  
  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na  
  
All the kids who screamed we werent the same  
In sweaty rooms  
Now were doomed to organizing walkin closets like tombs  
  
Silent film stars stuck in talking cinema light  
So lets fade away together one dream at a time  
  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na  
  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na  
  
Oh where did the party go  
We were ending it on the phone  
Im not gonna go home alone  
Where where did the party go
