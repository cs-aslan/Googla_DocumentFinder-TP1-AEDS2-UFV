Somewhere theres a reason why things go like they do  
Somewhere theres a reason why some things just fall through  
We dont always see them for what they really are  
But I know theres a reason just cant see it from this far  
Maybe I dont like it but I have no choice  
I know that somewhere someone hears my voice  
I thought I knew it all  
I thought I had it made  
How could it end this way  
I thought I knew  
Somewhere theres a reason why things dont go my way  
Somewhere theres a reason that I cannot explain  
Just like the change of season just may not be my turn  
But I know theres a reason the lessons mine to learn
