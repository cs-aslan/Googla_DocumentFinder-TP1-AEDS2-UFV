Alright Ill take care of them part of the time but theres somebody else
that needs taking care of in Washington  
Whos that  
Rose Pilchitt  
Rose Pilchitt Whos that  
362436 does that answer your question  
Oi Ive got a little black book with me poems in  
Whos she  
She was Miss Armoured Division in 1961    
  
Ive got a little black book with my poems in  
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in  
When Im a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in  
  
I got elastic bands keepin my shoes on  
Got those swollen hand blues  
I got thirteen channels of shit on the TV to choose from  
Ive got electric light  
And Ive got second sight  
I got amazing powers of observation  
And that is how I know  
When I try to get through  
On the telephone to you  
Therell be nobody home  
  
Ive got the obligatory Hendrix perm  
And the inevitable pinhole burns  
All down the front of my favorite satin shirt  
Ive got nicotine stains on my fingers  
Ive got a silver spoon on a chain  
Ive got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains  
  
Ive got wild staring eyes  
And Ive got a strong urge to fly  
But I got nowhere to fly to  
Ooooh babe when I pick up the phone  
  
Surprise surprise surprise  
Theres still nobody home  
  
Ive got a pair of Gohills boots  
But I got fading roots
