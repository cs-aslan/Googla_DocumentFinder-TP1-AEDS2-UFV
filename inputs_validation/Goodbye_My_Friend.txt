Oh we never know where life will take us  
I know its just a ride on the wheel  
And we never know when death will shake us  
And we wonder how it will feel  
  
So goodbye my friend  
I know Ill never see you again  
But the time together through all the years  
Will take away these tears  
  
Its OK now  
Goodbye my friend  
  
I see a lot of things that make me crazy  
And I guess I held on to you  
I could of run away and left  
Well maybe  
But it wasnt time we both knew  
  
So goodbye my friend  
I know Ill never see you again  
But the love you gave me through all the years  
Will take away these tears  
  
Its now  
Goodbye my friend  
  
Lifes so fragile and loves so pure  
We cant hold on but we try  
We watch how quickly it disappears  
And we never know why  
  
But Im OK now  
Goodbye my friend  
I can go now  
Goodbye my friend
