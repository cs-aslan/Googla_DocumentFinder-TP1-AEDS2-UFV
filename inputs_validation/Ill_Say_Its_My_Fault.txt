Too many quarrels so now we break up  
No theres no chance to ever makeup  
But when they ask me  
  
Ill say its my fault  
Ill take all the blame  
Ill say I was wild  
When I should have been tame  
  
Ill say its my fault  
Ill give a good show  
Ill say Im a needle  
That just wouldnt sew  
  
Every one will be wondering  
All our friends will inquire  
Which one did the blundering  
Who put out the fire  
  
So Ill say its my fault  
Ill say theres no doubt  
Then cry as I wonder  
Why it didnt work out
