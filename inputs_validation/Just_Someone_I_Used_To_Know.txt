Theres a picture that I carry  
One we made sometime ago  
When they ask whos in the picture with me  
I say just someone I use to know  
Just someone I use to spend some time with  
Just a flame that lost its glow  
And I dont tell them how lost I am without you  
I say just someone I use to know  
Just someone I use to run around with  
Just a friend from long ago  
I dont tell them all the nights I cry without you  
I say just someone I use to know  
I say just someone I use to know
