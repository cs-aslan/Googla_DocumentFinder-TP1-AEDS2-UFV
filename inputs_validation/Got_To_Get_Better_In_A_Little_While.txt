Dont you know whats wrong with me  
Im seeing things I dont want to see  
Sniffing things that aint no good for me  
Im going down fast wont you say a prayer for me  
  
Its got to get better in a little while  
Its got to get better in a little while  
Its got to get better in a little while  
Its got to get better in a little while  
  
The suns got to shine on my guitar someday  
  
Revolution all across the land  
Just like Sly you got to take a stand  
Please dont hurt nobody dont knock them down
