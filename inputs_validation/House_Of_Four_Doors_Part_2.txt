Walking thru that door  
Outside we came  
Nowhere at all  
Perhaps the answers here  
Not there anymore  
  
Then in our hearts the light broke thru  
A path lost for years is there in view  
House of four doors  
Youll be lost now forever  
House of four doors  
Rest of lifes life forever  
House of four doors  
Youll be lost now forever  
House of four doors  
Rest of lifes life forever
