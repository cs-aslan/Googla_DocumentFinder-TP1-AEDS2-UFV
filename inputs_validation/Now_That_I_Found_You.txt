I can still remember  
When all I had was time  
A time when I had nothin  
But this empty heart of mine  
  
When I needed inspiration  
When the night was all I knew  
You were the light shinin into my life  
The reason for all the love Im feelin  
  
Chorus  
Now that Ive found you  
I dont know how I lived without you  
I dont know how I survived without your love  
Now that Ive found you  
I only know Id be lost without you  
I found the love  
That Ill never find again  
Cause all I ever needed  
And all I ever wanted  
Has come true  
I found it all now that Ive found you  
  
I couldve searched forever  
And never realized  
The treasure of a lifetime  
Was the love inside your eyes  
When I reach for inspiration  
In your touch its always there  
Givin me faith every step of the way  
Givin me all I ever needed  
  
Chorus  
  
And every step of the way  
Gonna dedicate my heart to you  
Promise you my world forever  
Pledgin my love my whole life through
