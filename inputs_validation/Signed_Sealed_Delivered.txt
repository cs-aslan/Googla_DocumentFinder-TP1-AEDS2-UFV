Like a fool I went and stayed too long  
Now Im wondering if you loves still strong  
Ooh baby here I am signed sealed delivered Im yours  
  
Here I am baby you got the future in your hands  
Here I am baby you got the future in your hands  
  
Ive done a lot of foolish things  
That I really didnt mean  
  
Seen lot of things in this old world  
When I touched them they did nothing for this girl  
Ooh baby here I am signed sealed delivered Im yours  
  
Chorus  
Here I am baby signed sealed delivered Im yours  
Here I am baby signed sealed delivered Im yours  
Here I am baby signed sealed delivered Im yours  
Here I am baby you got the future in your hands  
  
Ive done a lot of foolish things  
That I really didnt mean  
  
Oh baby you set my soul on fire  
Thats why I know youre my hearts only desire  
Here I am signed sealed delivered Im yours
