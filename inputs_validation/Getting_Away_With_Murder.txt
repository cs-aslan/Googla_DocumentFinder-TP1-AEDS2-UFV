She thought she had the only key  
She thought you only opened up to her well you see  
I dont know why you call it love  
She thought she was the brightest light  
But someone else was lighting up your life what I think  
I dont know why you call it love  
  
Im not suspicious no not me but Im not blind  
And Id have to be not to see  
  
Chorus  
Gettin away with murder you can love a girl and hurt her  
Thats gettin away with gettin away with murder  
You can tell a girl you love her while youre working on another  
Thats gettin away with gettin away with murder  
  
You have had to love and run  
Two in the hand has left you holding none and I dont  
I dont know how you call it love no no  
  
Youre not demanding no not you youre understanding  
You do what you want to do  
  
Chorus  
  
You said she was the only one but you were cheating all along  
There ought to be a law for what youve done  
  
I got to save you from yourself I got to stop you from hurtin someone else  
  
Chorus
