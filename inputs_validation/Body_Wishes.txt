The night closes in on another day  
As the oldest games gettin underway  
On the minds of a million people  
Body wishes  
  
So you climb on the carousel and then take a chance  
The same old ritual the same old dance  
The hardest thing to resist is  
Body wishes  
  
If the fire down belows gettin worse and worse  
Youre so close to shootin that you want to burst  
Somebodys sponge needs squeezin  
Body wishes  
  
What do I say  
Nobody gonna tell ya  
Where do I go  
Somewhere someonell have ya  
  
Who do I tell  
Anybody thatll listen  
No one should know  
Wont solve the problem  
  
Body wishes  
Body wishes  
  
Away in the distance a baby cries  
But you know somebodys by her side  
The night drags on forever  
Body wishes  
  
You can hear the tickin of a lonely clock  
The howlin wind that just wont stop  
Somebodys cherries need pickin  
Body wishes  
  
What do I say  
Nobody gonna tell ya  
Where do I go  
Somewhere someonell have ya  
  
Who do I tell  
Anybody thatll listen  
No one should know  
Wont solve the problem  
  
Itll tear you apart like an angry sea  
Keep you warm like a summer breeze  
Its all weve got in a cold cold world  
Is to love someone  
  
Body wishes  
Body wishes  
  
Somethings happenin in the air  
It feels so close but you dont know where  
The poorest peoples riches  
Body wishes  
  
And the cheatin hearts never learn  
Someday somewheres gonna be your turn  
Dont start what you cant finish  
Body wishes  
  
What do I say  
Nobody gonna tell ya  
Where do I go  
Somewhere someonell have ya  
  
Who do I tell  
Anybody thatll listen  
No one should know  
That wont solve the problem  
  
Where do I run  
Anywhere thatll hide ya  
Wholl be the one  
Yeah  
  
Body wishes  
Body wishes  
Body wishes  
Body wishes  
Body wishes
