Honey I love to go to parties  
And I like to have a good time  
But if it gets too pale after a while  
Honey and I start looking to find  
One good man  
Hmm dont you know Ive been searching  
Oh yes I have  
One good man  
Oh aint much honey aint much  
Its only everything whoa  
  
An I dont want much outta life  
I never wanted a mansion in the South  
I justa want to find someone sincere  
Whod treat me like he talks  
One good man  
Oh honey dont you know that Ive been looking  
Oh one good man
