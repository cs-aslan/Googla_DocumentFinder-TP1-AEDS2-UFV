M Greaves  
  
Youre so near  
We could touch  
Youre so sad  
You cry too much  
Youre so warm  
To hold on to  
We dont do  
The things we want to  
  
We can fly to the moon  
So why cant I reach you  
Oh oh why cant I reach you  
  
Futures bright  
For me alright  
I close my eyes  
You saw the light  
Here its dark  
And Im so blue  
Here its cold  
Wanting you  
  
I love you  
Oh I love you so  
God give me  
Some control
