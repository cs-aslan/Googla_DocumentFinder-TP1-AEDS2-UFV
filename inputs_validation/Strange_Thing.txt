Here lives a pocket full of lives with no future  
Take it for what it is its only drunken lies  
You should open up your mind look to the future  
You could be waiting for the ship that sails you home  
Im going home  
  
What would you give me for the songs that Ive been singing  
How could you ever say that youve got more than me  
Mick says that he can never get no satifaction  
These days I think I know exactly what he means  
What does he mean  
  
You wont get  
You dont get  
What you need  
Life is a strange thing  
  
You wont get  
You dont get  
What you need  
Life is a strange thing now  
  
Here lives a pocket full of lives with no future  
Take it for what it is its only drunken lies  
You should open up you mind look to the future  
You could be waiting for the ship that sails you home  
Im going home  
  
You wont get  
You dont get  
What you need  
Life is a strange thing  
  
You wont get  
You dont get  
What you need  
Life is a strange thing now
