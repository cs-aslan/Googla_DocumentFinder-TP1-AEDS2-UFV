College Kids turning twentyone  
and their senior year spring break was here  
they headed south but not for sun  
On their skin where the storms had been  
It was hard  
fixing windows and shigles and doors  
and the tide never felt so good before  
  
Chorus  
Everyday People are the ones who are making miracles  
and its beautiful  
Everyday People lifting up the world  
like an answered prayer  
I thank God their there  
Theyre the ones who care  
Everyday People  
  
Doctor said Good News we caught it soon enough we can clear this up  
But shes 30 and single with two kids to raise  
times are tough these days  
So her friends made some calls and the word spread around  
How her bills got paid she dont know how  
  
Chorus  
  
A little girl takes her Mamas hand  
and walks inside saying Please dont cry  
As the people who built this house just for them  
Laugh through the tears as a family moves in  
  
Everyday People are the ones who are making miracles  
and its beautiful  
Everyday People lifting up the world  
like an answered prayer  
I thank God their there  
Theyre the ones who care  
Everyday people everyday people everyday people
