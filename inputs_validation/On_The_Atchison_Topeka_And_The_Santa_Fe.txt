Do you hear that whistle down the line  
I figure that its engine number fortynine  
Shes the only one thatll sound that way  
On the Atchison Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
See the old smoke risin round the bend  
I reckon that she knows shes gonna meet a friend  
Folks around these parts get the time of day  
From the Atchison Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
Here she comes  
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo  
Hey Jim youd better get the rig  
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo  
Shes got a list of passengers thats pretty big  
  
And theyll all want lifts to Browns Hotel  
Cause of lots of them been travelin for quite a spell  
All the way from Philadelphia  
On the Atchison Topeka and the Santa Fe
