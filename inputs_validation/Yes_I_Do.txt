Ooo ooo ooo  
  
Do I cry in the night  
Do I long to hold you tight  
Do I wake wanting you  
Yes I do  
  
Do I recall every day  
How you took my breath away  
Do I remember loving you  
Yes I do  
  
Chorus  
Yes I do dream of all we had together  
Yes its true we lost it all forever  
Do I pray anyway  
Yes I do  
  
I dont live in the past  
Wanting love that wouldnt last  
And I dont ache like I used to  
Yes I do  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Yes I do  
Do I pray  
Yes I do dream of all we had together  
  
Yes I do  
And yes I do
