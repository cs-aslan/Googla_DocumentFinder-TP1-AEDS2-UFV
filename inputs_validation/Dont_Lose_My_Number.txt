They came at night leaving fear behind  
Shadows were on the ground  
Nobody knew where to find him  
No evidence was found  
Im never coming back  
They heard him cry  
And I believe him  
Well he never meant to do anything wrong  
Its gonna get worse if he waits too long  
  
Billy Billy dont you lose my number  
Cause youre not anywhere  
That I can find you  
Oh now Billy Billy dont you lose my number  
Cause youre not anywhere that I can find you oh no  
  
Searching through the day and into the night  
They wouldnt stop till they found him  
They didnt know him and they didnt understand  
They never asked him why  
Get out of my way  
They heard him shout  
Then a blinding light  
Ooh all I could see was him running down the street  
Out of the shadows and into the night  
  
Now Billy Billy dont you lose my number  
Cause youre not anywhere  
That I can find you oh  
Now Billy Billy dont you lose my number  
Cause youre not anywhere that I can find you oh  
  
Dont give up  
Keep running keep hiding  
Dont give up  
Billy if you know youre right  
Dont give up  
You know that I am on your side  
Dont give up  
Oh Billy you better you better you better run for your life  
  
Now Billy Billy dont you lose my number  
Cause youre not anywhere  
That I can find you oh  
Now Billy Billy dont you lose my number  
Cause youre not anywhere that I can find you oh  
  
They came at night leaving fear behind

Cause youre not anywhere

Cause youre not anywhere that I can find you oh
