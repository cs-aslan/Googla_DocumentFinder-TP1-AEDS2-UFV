You got curves like the ocean gonna take it in slow motion  
Got emotions thatll make it last  
You got freckles on your shoulder ammunition like a soldier  
And visions ambitions to be the best  
  
Oh and Jenny why dont we Jenny why dont we be getting together  
I said Jenny shouldnt we Jenny shouldnt we be getting together  
  
JJJJennys got a body just like an hourglass  
But Im taking my time Im taking my time  
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass  
Take it slow oh oh gonna make it last  
  
Jenny got your number and Ive got you for the summer  
Its a bummer that things go so fast  
Its been a ride like Days of Thunder but these days have been arunning  
Like sand through the hourglass  
  
Ive been dreaming that we could dreaming that we could be sticking together  
I got evidence cause every time I turn a corner its up against the wall  
And as the rest of the world fades out  
As the rest of the world fades out  
  
Im thinking Jennys got a body just like an hourglass  
But Im taking my time Im taking my time  
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass  
Take it slow oh oh  
Jennys got a body just like an hourglass  
But Im taking my time Im taking my time  
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass  
Take it slow oh oh  
But Im not gonna take it from you Ill let you give it to me  
  
I said Im not gonna take it from you Ill let you give it to me  
  
JJJJennys got a body just like an hourglass  
But Im taking my time taking my time  
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass  
Take it slow oh oh  
Jennys got a body yeah  
Jennys got a body yeah  
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass  
Take it slow oh oh gonna make it last
