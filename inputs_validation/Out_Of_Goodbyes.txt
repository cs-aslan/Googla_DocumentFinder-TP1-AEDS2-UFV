Tell me actions speak louder  
But theres something about her words that hurt  
Closing up and its so late and  
Im the last one still waiting for ya to lock the door  
  
On our way home I realize  
Theres some kind of storm brewing in his eyes  
Only veiled by a thin disguise  
  
Now that Ive done my time  
I need to move on and I need you to try  
Cause were out of goodbyes  
Were out of goodbyes out of goodbyes  
  
Never asked you to change  
But sadly you dont feel the same about me  
I wonder does your man still shudder when you touch his hand  
Like this man  
  
On our way home I realize  
Theres some kind of storm brewing in his eyes  
Only veiled by a thin disguise  
  
Now that Ive done my time  
I need to move on and I need you to try  
Cause were out of goodbyes  
Were out of goodbyes were out of goodbyes were out of goodbyes  
Oh ooh
