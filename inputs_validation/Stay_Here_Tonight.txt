I know its late and youre tired  
And wed been talking for hours here  
You dont have to tell me  
  
I see that look in your eyes  
And I know soon well say our goodbyes oh yeah  
I feel it coming  
  
And I hear you take a deep breath  
And my hands are starting to sweat  
I dont want you to  
I dont want you to leave yeah  
  
Chorus  
Stay here tonight  
Stay here tonight  
Cause when your around me  
Everythings right dont go  
Oh dont leave me alone  
Stay here tonight  
Stay here tonight  
I wanna hold you in my arms  
Show you what thats like dont go  
I need you  
I need you  
  
You grab your coat and Im dying  
But I know that youre still deciding yeah  
Theres no bodies moving  
Time stops and everythings quiet  
Im begging on for my life in you  
You dont even see it  
  
And then you coming closer  
And baby its not over  
Till I hear you say  
Till I hear you say  
Goodnight oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Something about you saying is not  
Something about you makes me feel like Im nobody  
  
Stay here tonight  
Stay here tonight  
Cause when you around me everythings right dont go  
Dont leave me alone  
  
Chorus  
  
Stay with me tonight  
I need you  
Stay with me tonight  
I need you  
Stay with me tonight
