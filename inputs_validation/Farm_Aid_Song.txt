Well I hate to say the farmer  
Was the last of a dying breed  
Living off the land  
And taking what he needs  
Dont say much for the future  
When a family cant survive  
Id hate to say the farmer  
Was the last of his kind  
  
In the struggle for parity  
Not one mans voice can sound  
Cause the foundation  
Of the conglomerate  
Is firmly in the ground  
Yeah they want to feed the world  
But for power and for greed  
Then theyll cut off the supply  
Until they get what they need  
  
Well I dreamed I saw a dust bowl  
Where the farmers used to live  
Earth was flying through the sky  
It had nothing left to give  
Tractors were burning  
On the Whitehouse lawn  
Just woke up one morning  
And the farmers all were gone  
  
I hate to say the farmer  
Was the last of a dying breed  
Living off the land  
And taking what he needs  
Dont say much for the future  
When a family cant survive  
Id hate to say the farmer  
Was the last of his kind  
  
Dont say much for the future  
When a family cant survive  
Id hate to say the farmer  
Was the last of his kind
