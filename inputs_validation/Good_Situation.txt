That girl Im gonna make her mine  
If it takes all night  
That girl Im gonna make her mine  
If it takes all night  
  
Good evening sweet darling  
May I ask your name  
You seem to be lonely  
Well dont worry Im feeling the same  
  
Oh its a good situation  
A splendid combination  
That we should meet  
At a time like this  
Oh its a good situation  
A splendid combination  
Your something that  
I just cant miss  
  
That girl Im gonna make her mine  
If it takes all night  
That girl Im gonna make her mine  
If it takes all night  
  
Its been a long time sweet darling  
Since love has come my way  
But Im trying so hard  
To find the right words to say  
  
Oh its a good situation  
A splendid combination  
That we should meet  
At a time like this  
Oh its a good situation  
A splendid combination  
Your something that  
I just cant miss
