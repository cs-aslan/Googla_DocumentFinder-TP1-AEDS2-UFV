Every night I grab some money and I go down to the bar  
I got my buddies and a beer I got a dream I need a car  
You got me begging on my knees cmon and throw the dog a bone  
A man he doesnt live by rock n roll and brew alone  
Baby baby  
  
Chorus  
Rock n roll and brew rock n roll and brew  
They dont mean a thing when I compare em next to you  
Rock n roll and brew rock n roll and brew  
I know that you and I we got better things to do  
I dont know who you are or what you do or where you go when youre not
around  
I dont know anything about you baby but youre everything Im dreaming of  
I dont know who you are but youre a real dead ringer for love  
A real dead ringer for love  
  
Ever since I can remember you been hanging round this joint  
You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point  
I dont have to know your name and I wont tell you what to do  
But a girl she doesnt live by only rock n roll and brew  
  
Baby baby baby baby  
  
Chorus  
  
You got the kind of legs that do more than walk  
  
I dont have to listen to your whimpering talk  
  
Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see  
  
You got a lotta nerve to come on to me  
  
You got the kind of lips that do more than drink  
  
You got the kind of mind that does less than think  
  
But since Im feeling kinda lonely my defenses are low  
Why dont you give it a shot and get it ready to go  
Im looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction  
And I want to tell my daddy Ill be missing in action  
  
Ever since I can remember Ive been hanging round this joint  
My daddy never noticed now hell finally get the point  
  
You got me beggin on my knees cmon and throw the dog a bone  
A man he doesnt live by rock n roll and brew alone  
  
Baby baby baby baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Dead ringer for love  
  
Repeat x12  
Dead ringer for love dead ringer
