Though he heard her clearly  
She said it so sincerely  
Thats something that he doesnt understand  
Her words were choked and broken  
She left him with a token  
The note he is holding in his hand  
Dont let me down dont let me down  
Is this the end of the game  
And will you put out the flame  
And fly away  
Dont fly away  
Now lets find out whos too blame  
And start all over again  
Dont fly away  
Dont fly away  
Way across the city  
Waiting on a taxi  
Holding cases  
Standing in the hall  
Thinking well if only  
Shes feeling sad and lonely  
Hoping gainst all hope that he will call  
Dont let me down  
Dont let me down  
Is this the end of the game  
And should I put out the flame  
And fly away and fly away  
And if I walk out again  
Is it true that the pain  
Will fly away fly away  
Fly away  
The taxi drivers talking  
But she doesnt hear a single word he says  
Fly away  
The tears fall so easily  
Keep falling til she climbs aboard the plane  
And its the end of the game  
With only fortune to blame  
  
Solo  
  
Yes its the end of the game  
But love was given in vain  
Sail away sail away  
Just like the sunshine and rain  
Its true that one day will pain will fly away  
Fly away fly away
