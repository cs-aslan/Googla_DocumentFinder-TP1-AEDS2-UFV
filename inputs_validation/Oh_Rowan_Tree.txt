Oh rowan tree oh rowan tree  
Thoult aya be dear to thee  
Entwined thou art wi many ties  
Ohame and infancy  
Thy leaves were aye the first of spring  
Thy flowers the summers pride  
There was nae sic a bonnie tree  
In a the country side  
Oh rowan tree  
  
How fair was thou in summer time  
Wi athy clusters white  
How rich and gay thy autumn dress  
Wi berries red and bright  
On thy fair stem were mony names  
Which now nae mair I see  
But theyre engraven on my heart  
Forget they neer can be  
Oh rowan tree  
  
We sat aneath thy spreadin shade  
The bairnies round thee ran  
They pud they bonnie berries red  
And necklaces they strang  
My mither oh I see her still  
She smild our sports to see  
Wi little jeannie on her lap  
And jamie on her knee  
Oh rowan tree  
  
Oh there arose my fathers prayare  
In holy evnings calm  
How sweet was them my mothers voice  
In the martyrs psalm  
Now aare gane  
We meet nae mair aneath the rowan tree  
But hallowd thoughts around thee twine  
Ohame and infancy  
Oh rowan tree
