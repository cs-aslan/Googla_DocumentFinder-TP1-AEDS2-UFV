Youre making a choice to live like this  
And all of the noise  I am silence  
We already know how it ends tonight  
You run in the dark through a firefight  
And I would explode just to save your life  
Yeah I would explode  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me tell you why  
I would die for you  
Let me light up the sky  
  
I cant find a wall to pin this to  
Theyre all coming down since Ive found you  
I just wanna be where you are tonight  
I run in the dark looking for some light  
And how will we know if we just dont try  
We wont ever know  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me tell you why  
I would die for you  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me make this mine  
Ill ignite for you  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Just for you tonight  
Let me help you fly  
Cause you wont have time  
To cover your eyes  
Or get your disguise  
They wont ask you why  
Theyll just watch you die  
  
And its still so hard to be who you are  
So you play this part  
And the show goes on  
But youve come this far with a broken heart  
Yeah youve come this far  
And youre broken  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me tell you why  
I would die for you  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me make this mine  
Ill ignite for you  
Ill ignite for you  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me tell you why  
I would die for you  
  
And its still so hard to be who you are  
But youve come this far with a broken heart  
And its still so hard to be who you are  
But youve come this far and youre broken  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Let me light up the sky
