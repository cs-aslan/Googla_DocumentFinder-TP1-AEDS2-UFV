In an April dream once you came to me  
When you smiled I looked into your eyes and I knew  
Id be loving you and  
Then you touched my hand  
And I learned April dreams can come true  
  
Are we just April fools  
Who cant see all the danger around us  
If were just April fools I dont care  
True love has found us now  
  
Little did we know where the road would lead  
Here we are a million miles away from the past  
Traveling so fast now  
Theres no turning back if our sweet  
April dream doesnt last  
  
Are we just April fools  
Who cant see all the danger around us  
If were just April fools I dont care  
True love has found us now  
  
Are we just April fools  
Who cant see all the danger around us  
If were just April fools I dont care  
True love has found us now  
  
Are we just April fools  
Who cant see all the danger around us  
If were just April fools I dont care  
Well find our way somehow  
No need to be afraid
