Ill look around  
And when Ive found me somebody who laughs like you  
I know somewhere spring must fill the air with sweetness  
Just as rare as a flower that you gave me to wear  
  
So Ill look around  
Sweetheart and when Ive found me somebody  
Somebody who laughs like you  
Ill know this love that Ive been dreaming of  
And it wont be the old love that I always knew  
  
Mmm who laughs like you  
I know somewhere spring must fill the air with sweetness  
Just as rare as a flower that you gave me to wear  
  
So Ill look around  
And when Ive found me somebody who laughs like you  
Ill know this love that Ive been dreaming of  
And it wont be the old love that I always knew
