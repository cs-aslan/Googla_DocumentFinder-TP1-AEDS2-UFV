I was a fool  
Too blind to see  
I turned my back  
On all your needs  
What a price  
I almost let you get away  
  
Youre like the precious air I breathe  
Without your love  
Im not complete  
Now I know  
And my forever starts today  
  
Cause its alright now with me  
Yes its alright now you see  
Ill be all youll ever need  
This time  
  
I can believe in who I am  
Now that youre back with me again  
I can see  
That what is meant will always be

And take your hand  
Ill make you know
