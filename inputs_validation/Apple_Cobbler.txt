Uh uh uh uhhuh  
Uh uh that joint is hot baby  
  
Lights camera action hold up  
You know my style I been blowed up  
Paper was young now its growed up  
Stacks so thick its hard to fold up  
Yo b find another rubber band in the truck  
Count up the money Ima stand in the cut  
Stroll in the party and I toast Cris up  
Tell that a muhhucca gets this up  
Shake that cookie like what like what  
Toss me a drop its like lightning struck  
Look at that apple cobbler butt  
Whatchu want to do whatchu think Want cut  
NBA Live in my truck  
Parkin lot like all jammed up  
If theres beef its best you duck  
Im gon eat til Im filled up  
  
Chorus  
Throw it to me that apple cobbler  
Baby it can I see can I see that apple pie  
I said throw it to me that apple cobbler  
Baby it can I get hey can I get it deep fried  
  
So much sugar its makin my head rush  
Tell me what the recipe is for that stuff  
Break me off a piece of crust  
Im so full Im bout to bust  
Just one slice is not enough  
Dang that thang tight like handcuffs  
What I gotta say to you for you to give it up  
What if I was payin you so you could live it up  
Hoochie seats inside yo truck  
Tiffany rocks and trillion cuts  
You be Starsky I be Hutch  
Ride shotgun I pop that clutch  
Juicy sweatpants drive me nuts  
Take my 2way stay in touch  
Im gon scoop you heat you up  
Take you bake you eat you up  
  
Chorus  
  
Turn that hair round buck them hips  
Love when your hair get stuck to your lips  
Apple cobbler sweet and thick  
Im gon eat you til Im sick  
Yo dessert is worth a grip  
I admit you make me trip  
Make me want to run to the mall like Im a trick  
I cant believe youre makin a baller have a fit  
Trippin switchin past my clique  
Lick that juicy ask my clique  
Stretch them jeans girl make them fit  
Make me go outside and pit  
You know me my cake is sick  
Me and Timbo makin hits  
Apple cobbler thick and rich  
Just how hot can one girl get  
  
Chorus
