I dont want to ever fall in love again  
I dont want to worry if Ill hurt or hurt somebody  
You cant be happy when love comes to an end then youre alone  
I wont try to change again for a womans sake  
Cause I wont be around one who has rules for me to follow  
For when a love falls through it hurts and you will never be the same  
  
And it takes too long to heal a broken heart  
It hurts too bad when love gets pulled apart  
From now on I just wont let it start  
Cause it takes too long to heal a broken heart  
  
It dont really matter why when love is gone  
If cheatin is to blame or it died from natural causes  
The end is still the same it always causes pain at least to one  
  
And it takes too long to heal a broken heart  
It hurts too bad when love gets pulled apart  
From now on I just wont let it start  
Cause it takes too long to heal a broken heart  
  
Yes it takes too long to heal a broken heart  
It hurts too bad when love gets pulled apart  
From now on I just wont let it start  
Cause it takes too long to heal a broken heart  
Yes it takes too long to heal a broken heart
