It wasnt always like this  
It wasnt always so  
We did it in the darkness  
We did it in the cold  
  
Caught in a fairly extraordinary world  
Its emotional  
Where talking it rarely that necessary  
And time doesnt count at all  
  
Bohemian boys and Brazilian girls  
Make familiar noise in a familiar world  
Its like a million beats in a Parisian heart  
Theyre made of glass  
  
Working the west with the girls from the east  
Working a sweat from a million beats  
Where oblivion stops and oblivion starts  
Theyre made of glass  
  
Love makes the world go round  
I hold it in my hands  
But it slips away  
And I watch it fade  
  
Love is a mystery  
I hear it talk to me  
But the words are strange  
Like it knows my name  
  
Love makes the world go round  
I hold it in my hands  
But it slips away  
And I watch it fade  
  
Love is a mystery  
I hear it talk to me  
But the words are strange  
Were made of glass  
  
It wasnt always easy  
It wasnt always fun  
We intertwine naively  
But in the end were one  
  
Caught in a fairly extraordinary world  
Its emotional  
Where talking it rarely that necessary  
And time doesnt count at all  
  
Love makes the world go round  
I hold it in my hands  
But it slips away  
And I watch it fade  
  
Love is a mystery  
I hear it talk to me  
But the words are strange  
Like it knows my name  
  
Love makes the world go round  
I hold it in my hands  
But it slips away  
And I watch it fade  
  
Love is a mystery  
I hear it talk to me  
But the words are strange  
Theyre made of glass
