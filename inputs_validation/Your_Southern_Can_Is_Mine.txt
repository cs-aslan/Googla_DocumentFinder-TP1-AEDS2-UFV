Lookie here momma let me explain ya this  
If ya want to get crooked Ill even give ya my fist

Ya keep forgettin your southern can belongs to me  
  
So there aint no use in bringin no jive to me  
Your southern can is mine in the mornin  
Your southern can belongs to me  
  
Ya might go uptown have me arrested put in jail  
Some hotshots got money gonna pull my bail  
Soon as I get out hit the ground  
Your southern can is worth a thousand  
Half a pound  
  
So there aint no use in bringin no jive to me  
Your southern can is mine talkin about it  
Your southern can belongs to me  
  
Ya might take it from the south baby  
Hide it up North  
Understand ya cant rule me and be my boss  
Take it from the East and hide in the West  
But when I get ya momma you canll see no rest  
  
So there aint no use in bringin no jive to me  
Your southern can is mine Im screamin  
Your southern can belongs to me  
  
Now baby ashes to ashes sand to sand  
When I hit ya momma then ya feel my hand  
Give ya a punch through that barbed wire fence  
When I hit ya baby ya know I make no sense  
  
So there aint no use in bringin no jive to me  
Your southern can is mine I know it  
Your southern can belongs to me

You southern can belongs to me  
  
Well if I catch you momma  
Down in the heart of town  
Im gonna grab me a brick  
And tear your can on down  
  
So there aint no use in bringin no jive to me  
Your southern can is mine I know it  
Your southern can belongs to me

Im gonna make you moan like a graveyard hound  
  
So there aint no use in bringin no jive to me  
Your southern can is mine Im screamin  
Your southern can belongs to me
