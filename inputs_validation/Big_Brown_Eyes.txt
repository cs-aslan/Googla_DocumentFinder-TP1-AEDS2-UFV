Big brown eyes and a gust of wind  
And the cherry burns the corner of the page that says  
The end is coming soon but not soon enough  
Restring all your guitars pack up all your stuff  
Cause if Roberts dad is right  
We might not make it through the night  
And Id hate to go alone  
Please pick up the phone  
Well a box of red and a pill or three  
And Im calling time and temperature just for some company  
I wish you were here I wish I was too  
Ill drink myself to sleeplessness I always do  
You dont want me anymore  
Since fame and fortune broke down our door  
You dont give me no respect  
What did I expect  
If that phone dont ring one more time  
Im gonna lose whats left of my mind  
You made a big impression for a girl of your size  
Now I cant get by without you and your big brown eyes  
Her hands are cold her breath is warm  
Shes a port in a storm  
Im worried now but it wont be long  
It takes a worried man you know to sing a worried song  
Ive got issues yeah  
Like I miss you yeah  
And I wish I werent so thick  
Im making myself sick  
If that phone dont ring one more time  
Im gonna lose whats left of my mind  
You made a big impression for a girl of your size  
Now I cant get by without you and your big brown eyes
