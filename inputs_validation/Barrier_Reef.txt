Empty bottle was half empty tide was low and I was thirsty  
I saw her sitting at the bar well you know how some girls are  
Always making eyes well she wasnt making eyes  
So I sidled up beside her settled down and shouted Hi there  
My names Stewart Ransom Miller Im a serial ladykiller  
She said Im already dead thats exactly what she said  
So we tripped the lights fantastic we was both made of elastic  
Midnight came and midnight went and I though I was the President  
She said Do you have a car and I said Do I have a car  
Whats so great about the Barrier Reef  
Whats so fine about art  
Whats so good about a Good Times Van  
When youre working on a broken working on a broken  
Working on a broken man  
When youre working on a broken working on a broken  
Working on a broken man yeah  
My heart wasnt in it not for one single minute  
Oh then I went through the motions with her  
Her on top and me on liquor didnt do no good well I didnt think it would  
Whats so great about the Barrier Reef  
Whats so fine about art  
Whats so good about a Good Times Van  
When youre working on a broken working on a broken  
Working on a broken man  
When youre working on a broken working on a broken  
Working on a broken man  
When youre working on a broken working on a broken  
Working on a broken man
