I was lost until the day I found you  
And I know you know  
Theres not a thing for you that I wouldnt do  
But yesterday was rough on me  
I was under the weather  
So my dear I didnt have much to say  
  
And I rushed you off of the phone last night  
So I called you back to apologize  
But your line stayed busy through the night you see  
And it makes me wonder  
Are you mad at me  
  
I was right to fall in love this way  
And one things for sure  
The angels smiled on me  
When you came my way  
So my dear tonights the night  
Its gonna be special  
I cant wait to see the face of my love  
  
But even though I tried sorry I was late  
And I understand that you couldnt wait  
But youre pulling back honey I can see  
And it makes me worry  
Are you mad at me  
  
I wish I could be perfect for you  
Cant you see how hard I try  
  
When you talk to me I can hear the pain  
When I look in your face I can see the strain  
And I can hear the cries of the willow tree  
Somethings wrong I know it  
Are you mad at me
