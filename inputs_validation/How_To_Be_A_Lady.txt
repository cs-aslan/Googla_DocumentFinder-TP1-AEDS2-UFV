Spoken Its frightfully difficult to be a lady  
Theres so many Ps and Qs you have to mind  
Sung But the rewards Im sure youll find are rich and varied  
And worth all of the effort you will find  
Your posture must be perfect  
Your diction crisp and clear  
Your speaking voice mellifluous and pleasing to the ear  
Your legs are crossed when seated  
Your toes are pointed so  
Your pinkies raise while drinking  
But thats not all you need to know  
  
Tune changes to a heavier punk sound  
  
You mustnt curse or spit or tattle never gossip  
A lady never scratches sweats or burps  
She knows which knife and fork and spoon to use and when  
And if soup is served its impolite to slurp  
  
Its always please and thank you sir or madam  
Never brash or loud or putting on a show  
A lady is demure reserved and proper  
And that is really all you need to know
