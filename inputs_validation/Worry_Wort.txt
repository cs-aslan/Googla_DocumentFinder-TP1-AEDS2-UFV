You dont wanna talk to me  
You dont wanna say the words  
You try to get off the hook  
You try to get off the hook  
Sprawling on a pin  
Hanging off the hook  
Trying to get yourself away  
Trying to get yourself away  
  
Theres no use dwelling on  
On what might have been  
Just think of all the fun  
You could be having  
  
We know the way you talk  
We know what you want  
We know what you want  
What you really wanted  
  
Take a look around  
Theres candles on the cake  
On what might have been  
The road you should have took  
Mistakes mistaken  
  
Theres no use dwelling on  
No use dwelling on  
  
Its such a beautiful day  
Its such a beautiful day  
Find yourself a   
Go and get some rest  
  
Its such a beautiful day  
Its such a beautiful day  
Go up to the mic  
Go up to the mic  
Go and get some rest
