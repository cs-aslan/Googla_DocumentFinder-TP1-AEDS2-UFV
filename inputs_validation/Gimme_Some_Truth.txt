Im sick and tired of hearing things  
From uptight short sighted narrow minded hypocrites  
All I want is the truth  
Just gimme some truth  
Ive had enough of reading things  
By neurotic psychotic pig headed politicians  
All I want is the truth  
Just give us the truth  
  
No short haired yellow bellied son of George Porgy is  
Gonna mother hubbard soft soap me with just a pocket full of oil  
Money for oil

By tight lipped condescending mommys little chauvinists

Of schizophrenic egocentric paranoia prima donnas  
All I want is the truth  
Just give us the truth
