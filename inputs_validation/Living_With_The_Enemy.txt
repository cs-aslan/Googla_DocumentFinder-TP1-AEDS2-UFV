I gave you all that you wanted  
And still you come back for more  
You say that youre brokenhearted  
But then you walk out the door  
  
Maybe it is time for us to say goodbye  
Where are the tears you never cried  
Hey baby what you got on your mind  
Are you looking for some sympathy  
  
I can tell you if its a truth or a lie  
Cause its just like living  
Living with the enemy  
  
You got me going in circles  
Im slowly loosing my head  
What did I do to deserve this  
You make me wish I was dead  
  
Tell me Im wrong and ill be on my way  
See you around another day  
Hey baby what you doin tonite  
Are you giving me the perfect dream  
  
Im so tired and I dont wanna fight  
Cause its just like living  
Living with the enemy enemy  
Living with the enemy living with the enemy enemy  
Living with the enemy enemy  
Living with the enemy living with the enemy enemy
