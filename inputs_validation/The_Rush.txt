What happened  
It seems like every time love comes  
Youre never ready  
Thats why they call it  
The Rush  
  
Tell me are you there  
Could it be that youre the answer to my prayer  
See Ive prayed for peace and love  
Like so many of us do  
Then I prayed to find someone like you  
Up in the morning  
Fell out of my bed  
Worn out I couldnt sleep  
Thoughts of you filled my head  
How could it be  
This is scaring me  
  
Seems every time I try  
To rest my heart is when  
The rush is back again  
Maybe this time Ill  
Make it work somehow  
Guess Im gonna find out now  
  
I get a rush  
And its love for sure  
What else can it be  
Something beckons me  
And I go back for more  
Ooo such a rush  
Cant pass love by  
What else can I do  
Something tells me to  
Give it one more try  
  
Im not gonna die if love passes me by  
It goes and comes around I know  
So maybe the next time Ill be one of the few  
Chosen by love to do just what I wanna do  
I will carry on wading through every day till love needs me  
Waiting for the rush to come and find me  
I still remember when love was an angel send  
It will be back again  
  
I cant remember when I cant remember how  
Its very different now  
Its not a fantasy its very real to me  
True to the touch  
I get a rush
