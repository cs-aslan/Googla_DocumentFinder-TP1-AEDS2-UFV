St Jimmys comin down across the alleyway  
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade  
Light of a silhouette  
Hes insubordinate  
Coming at you on the count of one two one two three four  
  
My name is Jimmy and you better not wear it out  
Suicide commando that your momma talked about  
King of the forty thieves  
And Im here to represent  
That needle in the vein of the establishment  
  
Im the patron saint of the denial  
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal  
Cigarettes and Ramen and a little bag of dope  
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe  
Raised in the city under a halo of lights  
  
The product of war and fear that weve been victimized  
Im the patron saint of the denial  
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal  
Are you talkin to me  
Ill give you something to cry about St Jimmy  
  
My name is St Jimmy Im a son of a gun  
I am the one thats from the way outside  
A teenage assassin executing some fun  
In the cult of the life of crime  
Id really hate to say it but I told you so  
  
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down ol boy  
Welcome to the club and give me some blood  
Im the resident leader of the lost and found  
Its comedy and tragedy its St Jimmy  
And thats my name and dont wear it out
