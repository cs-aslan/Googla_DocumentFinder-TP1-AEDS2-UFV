I had a will of iron  
I had a heart of steel  
I always call the shots  
But honey you shoot to kill  
Ive spent a hundred other nights like this  
A little laughter and a strangers kiss  
  
But the next thing that I knew  
I was heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
Its too late to stop it now  
Im heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
  
I never once imagined  
A night like this before  
That love would last for hours  
And still I begged for more  
If I sound a little crazy  
Well forgive me please  
My head is swimmin  
And Im on my knees  
  
Cryin Love me love me do  
Because Im heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
Too late to stop it now  
Im heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
  
Cant seem to slow down  
Cant even touch the ground  
The harder I try  
The higher I fly  
  
Im fallin heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
Where did you get your touch  
Im heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
I like it much too much  
Heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
Too late to stop it now  
Im heart over head  
Over heart over head over you
