I was stood by the light as I looked through the window  
With the greatest intention not meaning to see  
I was there in the dark and I saw you together  
You were up in his arms  I was down on my knees  
Get the cards on the table  
No need to pretend  
Youve got to be cruel to be kind  
He can sell you his love and you know yo will pay cause  
  
Hes a liar  
Hes a liar and I should know liar  
Hes a liar and I should know  ahhh  
  
Well they told me I fell but I just dont remember  
I was standing face down they were there at my feet  
There was smoke in the air and sweet smell of leather  
I was through the window and down in the street  
Well Im cold and Im hungry but Im still alive  
And its not how I want it to be  
Theres a hand on my shoulder  
He said Ill survive but  
  
Hes a liar  
Hes a liar and I should know liar  
Hes a liarand I should knowahhh  
  
Release  
Was it not for the man that was blocking the drive  
Was it not for the red limousine  
Id be millions of miles from th scene of the crime  
And somehow in this madness believe she was mine but  
  
Im a liar  
Hes a liar  
And I should know liar  
Hes a liar  
And I should knowahhh  
Hes a repeat and fade
