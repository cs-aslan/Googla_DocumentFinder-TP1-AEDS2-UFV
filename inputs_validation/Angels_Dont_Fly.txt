Deep into midnight far from the warm light  
Beneath the shadows of a cold crescent moon  
I watched her leaving no shouting or screaming  
Just the sound of our hearts as they fall out of tune  
  
Angels dont fly they just walk out the door  
I know cause her footsteps I still hear on my floor  
You migh thtink Im crazy but I know its true  
Angels dont fly they just walk out on you  
  
Now Im lost in my memories and smoky nights bring me  
As close to the truth as any man should ever be  
Seems the love that I gave her could never quite save her  
From a wild restless heart that just had to be free  
  
Angels dont fly they just walk out the door  
I know cause her footsteps I still hear on my floor  
You might think Im crazy but I know its true  
Angels dont fly they just walk out on you  
  
Angels dont fly they just walk out on you
