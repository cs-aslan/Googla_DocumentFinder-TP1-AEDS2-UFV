Let us put man and woman together  
  
And see wich one is smarter  
  
Some say man but I say no  
  
The women got the man like a puppet show  
  
It aint me its the people that say  
  
The men are leadin the women astray  
  
But I say that the women today  
  
Are smarter than men in every way  
  
Well thats right the women are smarter  
  
Thats right the women are smarter  
  
Little boy sat down and cried  
  
An old man passin asked him why he said  
  
I cant do what the big boys do  
  
Old man sat down and he cried too  
  
Aint me its the people that say  
  
The men are leadin the women astray  
  
But I say that the women today  
  
Are smarter than men in every way  
  
Thats right the women are smarter  
  
Thats right the women are smarter  
  
Thats right the women are smarter  
  
Thats right the women are smarter  
  
Well thats right the women are smarter  
  
Smarter than man in every way
