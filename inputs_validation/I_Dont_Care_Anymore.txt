Well you can tell evryone Im a down disgrace  
Drag my name all over the place  
I dont care anymore  
You can tell evrybody bout the state Im in  
You wont catch me crying cause I just cant win  
I dont care anymore I dont care anymore  
  
I dont care what you say  
I dont play the same games you play  
  
Cause Ive been talking to the people that you call your friends  
And it seems to me theres a means to and end  
They dont care anymore  
And as for me I can sit here and bide my time  
I got nothing to lose if I speak my mind  
I dont care anymore I dont care no more  
  
I dont care what you say  
We never played by the same rules anyway  
  
I wont be there anymore  
Get out of my way  
Let me by  
I got better things to do with my time  
I dont care anymore I dont care anymore  
I dont care anymore I dont care anymore  
  
Well I dont care now what you say  
Cause evry day Im feeling fine with myself  
And I dont care now what you say  
Hey Ill do alright by myself  
Cause I know  
  
Cause I remember all the times I tried so hard  
And you laughed in my face cause you held all the cards  
I dont care anymore  
And I really aint bothered what you think of me  
Cause all I want of you is just a let me be  
I dont care anymore Dyou hear I dont care no more  
  
I dont care what you say  
I never did believe you much anyway  
  
I wont be there no more  
So get out of my way  
Let me by  
I got better things to do with my time  
I dont care anymore  
Dyou hear I dont care anymore  
I dont care no more  
You listening I dont care no more  
No more  
  
You know I dont care no more
