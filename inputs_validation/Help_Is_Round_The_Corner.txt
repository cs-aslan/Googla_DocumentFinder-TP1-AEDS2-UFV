Stuck here  
In the middle of no where  
With a headache  
And a heavy heart  
  
Oh well nothing  
Was going quite right here  
And Im tired  
I cant play no part  
  
Come on come on  
Oh what a stake  
Im in  
Come on come on  
Why wont it just  
Sake in  
The help is just around the corner  
For us  
  
Oh my head  
Just wont stop achin  
Im sat here lickin my ruins  
Im shattered  
But I really doesnt matter  
Cause my rescue is gonna be here soon  
  
Come on come on  
Oh what a stake  
Im in  
Come on come on  
Why wont it just  
Sake in  
The help is just around the corner  
For us  
The help is just around the corner  
For us  
Oh the help is just around the corner  
For us
