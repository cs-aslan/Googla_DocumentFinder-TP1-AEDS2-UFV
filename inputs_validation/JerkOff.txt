Someone told me once  
That theres a right and wrong  
And that punishment  
Would come to those  
Who dare to cross the line  
  
But it must not be true  
For jerkoffs like you  
Maybe it takes longer to catch a total asshole  
But Im tired of waiting  
Maybe its just bullshit and I should play God  
And shoot you myself  
Because Im tired of waiting  
  
Consequences dictate  
Our course of action  
And it doesnt matter whats right  
Its only wrong if you get caught  
If consequences dictate  
My course of action  
I should play God  
And shoot you myself  
Im very tired of waiting  
  
I should  
Kick you  
Beat you  
Fuck you  
And then shoot you in your fucking head
