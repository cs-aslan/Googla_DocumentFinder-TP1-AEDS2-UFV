Picture me ballin in the drop top open skies  
In something foreign soarin 145  
The God is calling for my body let my spirit fly  
I want it all no lie  
Picture me pourin poppin something imported  
Pedal flooring clutch poppin boppin to Lauryn  
Now picture me falling  
  
Never seen never heard never happened never occurred  
Now picture me flying 10000 feet above the sea  
Popping bubbly youd love to be me  
Now picture the servants in the cabin with the sweetest massage  
Picture having ice and only wanna speak to God  
Picture your dreams being shattered and your cream being lavished  
At the same time tell me what you think matters  
Picture all the money that Ive gotten off tours  
Now picture me plotting for more picture this nigga  
  
Do you like it yeah  
Wanna do the things that I do  
Tell me do you want it yeah  
Wanna know what its like in my shoes  
Do you need it yeah  
Wanna see the things that I see  
Tell me do you want it yeah  
Wanna know what its like to be me  
  
Picture me wildin fiendin reaching for tools  
Straight flipping losing my cool  
Now picture me gritty P Diddy bout to run in your house  
The guns with me put one in your mouth  
Now picture me dressed in white linen while your life is ending  
Slightly grinning picture that priceless image  
Picture me broke as fuck on your block about to open up  
Like Okay nigga whats up  
  
Picture me driving a course through your home bustin a U  
Screaming at the top of my lungs YOU FUCKING WITH WHO  
Picture me not being that hustler dude  
Picture the Benz a 5 and the drop not new  
Picture the watch aint platinum and the rocks not blue  
Picture yall niggaz not knowing how I do  
Picture me better yet picture you  
Painting a better picture than the one that I drew  
  
Do you like it yeah  
Wanna do the things that I do  
Tell me do you want it yeah  
Wanna know what its like in my shoes  
Do you need it yeah  
Wanna see the things that I see  
Tell me do you want it yeah  
Wanna know what its like to be me  
  
Where do you go from here when you felt youve done it all  
When what used to get you high dont get you high no more  
When you got a lot of cars dont even drive no more  
When youre expected to win they aint surprised no more  
  
Hold up stop wait reverse the tape  
How much money can one nigga make in one place  
How much dough could you hold in one safe  
How many hoes can a nigga really chase  
  
Where do you go after the applause  
After all the Soul Train and Grammy awards after the tours  
After asking these whores what they after me for  
Is it the money The fame The house take it all  
  
The skys the limit but I aint done jumping  
Money is fast but I aint done running  
Picture me driving some wack shit  
Picture me folding under pressure picture that shit  
  
Do you like it yeah  
Wanna do the things that I do  
Tell me do you want it yeah  
Wanna know what its like in my shoes  
Do you need it yeah  
Wanna see the things that I see  
Tell me do you want it yeah  
Wanna know what its like to be me

Wanna know what its like in my shoes  
Do you need it yeah  
Wanna see the things that I see  
Tell me do you want it yeah  
Wanna know what its like to be me
