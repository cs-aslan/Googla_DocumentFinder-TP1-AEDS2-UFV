Hey God Im just a little man  
I got a wife and family  
I almost lost my house  
I bought into the dream  
Were barely holdin on and Im in way too deep  
Were two paychecks away from livin out on the street  
  
Shes a workin single mom  
Like a saint she dont complain  
She never says a word but she thinks that shes to blame  
Her son just got convicted  
He blew some cop away  
She did her best to raise him but the world got in the way  
  
Hey God  
Tell me what the hell is goin on  
It seems like all the good shits gone  
It keeps on gettin harder hangin on  
But hey hey hey hey God  
Theres nights you know I want to scream  
These days youre even harder to believe  
I know how busy you must be  
But hey hey hey hey God  
Do you ever think about me  
  
Born into the ghetto 1991  
Just a happy child playin beneath the summer sun  
A vacant lots his playground  
By 12 hes got a gun  
The odds are bet against him  
Junior dont make 21  
  
Hey God  
Tell me what the hell is goin on  
It seems like all the good shits gone  
It keeps on gettin harder hangin on  
But hey hey hey hey God  
Theres nights you know I want to scream  
These days youre even harder to believe  
I know how busy you must be  
But hey hey hey hey God  
Do you ever think about me  
  
I get down on my knees  
Im gonna try this thing your way  
I seen a dyin man to proud to beg  
Spit on his own grave  
Was he too gone to save  
Or did you even know his name  
Are you the one to blame  
I got something to say  
  
Hey God  
Tell me what the hell is goin on  
It seems like all the good shits gone  
It keeps on gettin harder hangin on  
But hey hey hey hey God  
Theres nights you know I want to scream  
These days youre even harder to believe  
I know how busy you must be  
But hey hey hey hey God  
Do you ever think about me  
  
Do you ever think about me
