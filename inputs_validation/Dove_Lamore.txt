I cannot tell you of my life  
Here is my story  
  
Ill sing a love song  
Sing it for you alone  
Though youre a thousand miles away  
Loves feeling so strong  
  
Come to me baby  
Dont keep me waiting  
Another night without you here  
And Ill go crazy  
  
There is no other there is no other  
No other love can take your place  
Or match the beauty of your face  
Ill keep on singing til the day  
I carry you away  
  
With my love song  
With my love song

Where are you now my love  
I need you here to fold me  
  
Whispered so sweetly  
Feel my heart beating  
I need to hold you in my arms  
I want you near me  
  
Come to me baby  
Dont keep me waiting  
Another night without you here  
And Ill go crazy  
  
There is no other there is no other  
No other love can take your place  
Or match the beauty of your face  
Ill keep on singing til the day  
I carry you away  
  
With my love song  
With my love song  
  
Non seee nessuno  
there is no other  
Non seee nessuno  
Non seee nessuno  
Bello come te e ti amo  
as beautiful as you and I love you  
  
Come to me baby  
Come to me baby  
Another night without you here  
And Ill go crazy  
  
There is no other there is no other  
No other love can take your place  
Or match the beauty of your face  
Ill keep on singing til the day  
I carry you away  
  
With my love song with my love song  
With my love song with my love song
