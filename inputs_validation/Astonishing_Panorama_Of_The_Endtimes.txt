The boys got a head like an atom bomb  
Hang him from a cross like the number one son  
And hes been waiting so long  
To get it on  
  
The boys 15 but hes 16 gauge  
Wants to break out from his Jesus cage  
Hes already torn out the last page  
Its the latest rage  
  
Violence for the people  
They always eat the hand that bleeds  
Violence for the people  
Give the kids what they need  
  
Kill your god Kill your god  
Kill your TV  
The boys purified by the quitter gods  
Burning up his cross like a revelation  
  
And his glass jaw opens  
Like a puppet head  
This is what you should fear  
You are what you should fear
