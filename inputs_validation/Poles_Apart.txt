Did you know it was all going to go so wrong for you  
And did you see it was all going to be so right for me  
Why did we tell you then  
You were always the golden boy then  
And that youd never lose that light in your eyes  
  
Hey you did you ever realize what youd become  
And did you see that it wasnt only me you were running from  
Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway  
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes  
  
The rain fell slow down on all the roofs of uncertainty  
I thought of you and the years and all the sadness fell away from me  
And did you know  
  
I never thought that youd lose that light in your eyes
