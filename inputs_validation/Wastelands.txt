This is war with no weapons marching with no stepping  
Murder with no killing Ill in every direction  
First no sequel do the math no equal  
A John with no Yoko  
More power less people  
And yeah Im not afraid of that print in your paperback  
Every rappers made in fact to act as a delayed attack  
Every phrase a razor blade and save it till they play it back  
Slay em leave em laying on the paper bank fade to black  
  
In the wastelands of today  
When theres nothing left to lose  
And theres nothing more to take  
But you force yourself to choose  
In the wastelands of today  
When tomorrow disappears  
When the future slips away  
And your world turns into fear  
In the wastelands of today  
  
Roll credits forget it the shows done  
Theyre talking for just talkin  
Meaning they got none  
None of you come proper  
They talk like a shotgun  
But how many of you got bred with integrity not once  
So no Im not afraid to see you suckas hold a blade to me  
Aint no way to shake the ground I built before you came to be  
Take it how you take it  
Im the opposite of vacancy  
And this not negotiation  
I can hear you wait and see  
  
In the wastelands of today  
When theres nothing left to lose  
And and theres nothing more to take  
But you force yourself to choose  
In the wastelands of today  
When tomorrow disappears  
When the future slips away  
And your world turns into fear  
And your world turns into fear  
In the wastelands of today  
  
In the wastelands of today  
When theres nothing left to lose  
And and theres nothing more to take  
But you force yourself to choose  
In the wastelands of today  
When tomorrow disappears  
When the future slips away  
And your world turns into fear  
And your world turns into fear  
In the wastelands of today  
  
In the wastelands of today  
  
In the wastelands of today
