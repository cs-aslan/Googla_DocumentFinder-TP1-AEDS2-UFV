I am a poor wayfaring stranger  
While traveling through this world below  
There is no sickness toil no danger  
In that bright world to which I go  
  
I know dark clouds will gather over me  
I know my pathway is rough and steep  
But golden fields here lie out before me  
Where weary eyes no more shall weep  
  
Im going there to see my Father  
Im going there no more to roam  
I am just going over Jordan  
I am just going over home  
  
Ill soon be free from every trial  
And this form will rest beneath the sod  
Ill drop the cross of selfdenial  
And enter in my home with God  
  
Im going there to see my Savior  
Who shed for me His precious blood  
I am just going over Jordan  
I am just going over home  
  
Im going there to see my Father  
Im going there no more to roam  
I am just going over Jordan  
I am just going over home  
I am just going over home
