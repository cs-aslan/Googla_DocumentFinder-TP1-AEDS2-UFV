Baltimore Oriole  
Took one look at that mercury forty below  
No life for a lady  
To be draggin her feathers around in the snow  
Leaving me blue off she flew  
To the Tangipaho down in Louisiana  
Where a two timin Jaybird  
Met the divine Miss O  
  
Id like to ruffle his plumage  
That Baltimore Oriole  
Messed around with that big guy  
Till he singed her wings  
Forgivin is easy its a woman like now and then  
Could happen to thing  
Send her back home  
Home aint home without her warbling  
How she can sing  
Make a lonely man happy Baltimore Oriole  
Come down from that bough  
Fly to your daddy now
