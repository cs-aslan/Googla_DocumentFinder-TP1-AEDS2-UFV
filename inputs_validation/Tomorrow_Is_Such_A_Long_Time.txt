If today were not an endless highway  
If tonight were not a crooked trail  
If tomorrow werent such a long time  
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all  
And only if my own true love were waiting for me  
And if I could hear her heart softly pounding  
If only she was lying by me  
Then Id lie in my bed once again  
I cant see my reflection in the water  
Cant speak the sounds that show no pain  
I cant hear the echo of my footsteps  
Cant remember the sound of my own name  
And only if my own true love were waiting for me  
And if I could hear he heart softly pounding  
If only she was lying by me  
Then Id lie in my bed once again  
Theres beauty in the silver singing river  
Theres beauty in the sunrise in the sky  
None of these and nothing else can touch the beauty  
That I remember in my true loves eyes  
And only if my own true love were waiting for me  
And if I could hear he heart softly pounding  
If only she was lying by me  
And she could lie in my bed once again
