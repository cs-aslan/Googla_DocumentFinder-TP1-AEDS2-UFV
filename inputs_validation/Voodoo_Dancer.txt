What kind of person lives behind that face  
Inside your midnight eyes Im staring into space  
I dont understand  
What kind of man do you think I am  
  
Im falling out of control  
You took my body and you tore out my soul  
I dont understand  
Im just a simple man I am  
I am  
  
I dont really give a damn  
You take me just the way I am  
And only I have the answer  
Im not owned by Uncle Sam  
And youre still guessing who I am  
Im your voodoo dancer  
Voodoo dancer  
  
Consider my feelings just one time  
Ive done my sentence even though there was no crime  
Im an innocent man  
I should have learned to walk before I ever ran  
Im still running  
  
You never know the secrets that I have inside my head Im clever  
My crystal ball it tells me all the things I wanna know forever  
Now Im feeling the emptiness inside still concealing  
All the things I tried to hide forever  
I dont understand  
  
I dont really give a damn  
You take me just the way I am  
And I have the ultimate answer  
Im not owned by any man  
And now you know just who I am  
Yes Im your voodoo dancer  
  
Would you like to come and play in my fantasy  
Therell be no one there baby just you and me
