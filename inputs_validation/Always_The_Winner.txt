Always the winner baby  
Youre always the center baby  
But dont you ever get lonely at night  
When the clouds have gone away  
Its always  
Youre showing her the lady  
Always the lady  
Youre full of  
Yourself you know  
Gone crazy  
There was a time when you cared for their hearts  
And the need to show them love was tearing you apart  
But you changed you know  
Become the star of the show  
Now youve got nothing to give  
Where is the truth you once lived  
Youre just lonely  
Dont you feel lonely  
Turn out the spotlight Im tired turn out the spotlight  
My mind will die lord Im crying  
Oh Im to turn my gaze back lord to you  
Youre the only one who knows me  
Just mold me back to you
