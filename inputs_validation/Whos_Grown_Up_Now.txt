On this June morning I give you warning  
I might just fly away across the dawn  
I looked into my lovers eyes there I saw the sunrise  
There I saw the birth of something new  
And suddenly Im not the same little boy  
Cause I cant see the people that I meet  
All I see is her  
Since the time she went away I just exist from day to day  
I cant live I cant love without her near  
Sitting here in my darkened room whistling through the velvet gloom  
Wondering what the hell Im doing here  
For suddenly Im not the same little boy  
And I cant see the people that I meet  
All I see is her  
Theres just me and my conscience now theres no one to tell me why or how  
I fell away its time I must return  
We might recover what has been turn all the pieces round again  
Change and rearrange begin again
