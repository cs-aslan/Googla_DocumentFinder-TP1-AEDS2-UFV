Last night she ran away  
Left a letter by the telephone  
She didnt take the time to say goodbye  
He knows he has to find her  
Find a way to make her come back home  
She stretched her wings and learned to fly  
  
Carmen  
Carmen dont you care for me  
Carmen  
Carmen dont you care  
Carmen dont you care for me  
  
He calls but theres no answer  
Operator ring it one more time  
He thinks of her and shuts his eyes  
She wears the ring he gave her  
Something magic and it once was mine  
Will she be thinking of him tonight  
  
Carmen  
Carmen dont you care for me  
Carmen  
Carmen dont you care  
Carmen dont you care for me  
  
He has to find her  
I really miss that girl  
He steals into the night  
Hell go mad without her  
Im so mad about her  
  
Carmen  
Carmen dont you care for me  
Carmen  
Carmen dont you care  
Carmen dont you care for me
