Im older than I wish to be  
This town holds no more for me  
All my life I try to find another way  
I dont care for your attitude  
You bring me down I think youre rude  
All my life I try to make a better day  
  
Its hard enough being alone  
Sitting here by the phone  
Waiting for my memories  
To come and play  
  
Its hard enough sitting there  
Rockin in your rockin chair  
Its all too much for me to take  
When youre not there  
  
Its hard enough being alone  
Sitting here by the phone  
Waiting for my memories  
To come and play  
  
Its hard enough sitting there  
Rockin in your rockin chair  
Its all too much for me to take  
When youre not there
