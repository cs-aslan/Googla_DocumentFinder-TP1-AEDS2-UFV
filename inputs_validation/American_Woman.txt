American woman stay away from me  
American woman mama let me be  
Dont come hanging around my door  
I dont want to see your face no more  
  
I got more important things to do  
Than spend my time growin old with you  
Now woman stay away  
American woman listen what I say  
  
American woman get away from me  
American woman mama let me be  
Dont come knocking around my door  
I dont want to see your shadow no more  
  
Colored lights can hypnotize  
Sparkle someone elses eyes  
Now woman get away  
American woman listen what I say  
  
American woman I said get way  
American woman listen what I say  
Dont come hanging around my door  
Dont want to see your face no more  
  
I dont need your war machines  
I dont need your ghetto scenes  
Colored lights can hypnotize  
Sparkle someone elses eyes  
  
Now woman get away  
American woman listen what I say  
American woman stay away from me  
American woman mama let me be

Think I gotta go  
I want to fly away

Im gonna leave you woman  
Im gonna leave you woman

Bye bye bye bye  
Bye bye bye bye
