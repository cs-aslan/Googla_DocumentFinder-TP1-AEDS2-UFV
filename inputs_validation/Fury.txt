I now will tell you all a story  
That no one ever heard before  
It is the tale about the fury  
Remember wisdom is your strength  
  
It said youre such a fool  
Just let my evil rule  
  
No its burning like a flame  
Now nothing seems the same  
Ive lost control of mind and body  
My soul is in its hand  
Its wish is my command  
Enslaved forever by the fury  
By the fury no  
  
At first it came to me in visions  
And that was filling me with pain  
And when my fear became desire  
To let the demon burn my soul  
  
It said Dont fight in vain  
Ill make you love the pain  
  
No its burning like a flame  
Now nothing seems the same  
Ive lost control of mind and body  
My soul is in its hand  
Its wish is my command  
Enslaved forever by the fury  
By the fury no  
  
I now have told you all my story  
And still for you its not too late  
Dont draw your sword  
Just use your wisdom  
And never let this be your fate  
  
Oh no its here again  
This demon loves the pain  
  
No its burning like a flame  
Now nothing seems the same  
Ive lost control of mind and body  
My soul is in its hand  
Its wish is my command  
Enslaved forever by the fury  
By the fury no
