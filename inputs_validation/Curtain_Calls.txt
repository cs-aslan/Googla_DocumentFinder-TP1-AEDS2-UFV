In a western town beneath the northern lights  
Where the pine trees pine for the fall of night  
You believe in cards and you believe in signs  
And Ill be leavin soon but Im here tonight  
  
On a mountainside well below the stars  
Keep your lovers eyes in mason jars  
And I should be scared but I feel no fear  
Cause Ill be leavin soon tonight Im here  
  
And even if you are the one  
And even if the cards are all true  
When the curtain calls  
Oh baby whats a boy to do  
When the curtain calls  
Oh baby whats a boy to do  
  
Well the southern pea moved her family down  
Then along came me to her sleepy town  
I dont believe in cards I dont believe in signs  
But Ill be leavin soon Im here tonight  
  
And even if you are the one and even if I tried to be true  
When the curtain calls oh baby whats a boy to do  
When the curtain calls oh baby whats a boy to do  
  
In a western town beneath the northern lights  
Where the pine trees pine for the fall of night  
Dont believe in me did I make that clear  
Cause Ill be long gone soon but tonight Im here  
  
And even if you were the one  
I didnt wanna walk out on you  
But when the curtain calls  
Oh baby whats a boy to do  
When the curtain calls  
Oh baby whats a boy to do  
When the curtain calls  
Oh baby whats a boy to do
