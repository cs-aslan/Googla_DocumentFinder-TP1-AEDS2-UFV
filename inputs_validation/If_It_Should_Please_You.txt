If it should please you I have come to play  
A glad or a sad tune I wrote along the way  
And a few good songs about the old highway  
I been around so long Lord I guess Im here to stay  
So Im itching to please you with a topical song  
And a few golden oldies and a little hoedown  
And I think I know how to make you feel  
Were one and the same now like a big flywheel  
I have seen the best of all those things you cant explain  
Wanderlust I did not trust but I never did complain  
So if it should please you put away those blues  
Just settle on back now Ill do my licks for you  
Its my own way and thats the way it goes  
Youre a real good reason for a real good show  
I have seen the best of all those things you dont forget  
Wanderlust I did not trust and I aint been done in yet  
So if you got the dead end of the dealing shoe  
This is your last chance man we belong to you  
Its my own way and thats the way I feel  
Were one and the same now like a big flywheel  
So if it should please you I have come to play  
A glad or a sad tune I wrote along the way  
And a few good songs about the old highway  
I been around so long Lord I guess Im here to stay  
Were one and the same now lets take it away  
Were gonna take it real easy lets take it away  
Were gonna take it real easy take it away  
Were gonna take it real easy
