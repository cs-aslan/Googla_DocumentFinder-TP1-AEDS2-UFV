Intro  
Oh when we go numb  
Oh when we come down  
High up on this chasin hardly moving but it feels right  
  
Verse 1  
Drift away  
The haze slows down the pulse  
Latency  
A mind of cruise control  
  
PreChorus  
What you want  
What you need  
Well Ill give you all or nothing  
What you want  
What you need  
Is what Ive got trust me  
  
Chorus  
Static static static moves oh  
Static static stuck on you  
Static static moves oh oh  
  
Verse 2  
We escape  
Were lying on the moon  
Stay awake  
To see the naked truth  
  
PreChorus  
What you want  
What you need  
Well Ill give you all or nothing  
What you want  
What you need  
Is what Ive got trust me  
  
Chorus  
Static static static moves oh  
Static static stuck on you  
Static static moves oh oh  
  
Bridge  
Oh when we go numb  
Oh when we come down  
High up on this chasin hardly moving but it feels right  
  
Chorus  
Static static static moves oh  
Static static stuck on you  
Static static moves oh oh
