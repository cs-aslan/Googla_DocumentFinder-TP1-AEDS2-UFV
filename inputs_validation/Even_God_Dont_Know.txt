Chorus  
Ridin round town got a pocket full of dough  
Where Ill wind up even God dont know  
I take it just as fast and as far as itll go  
Ridin round town got a pocket full of dough  
Where Ill wind up even God dont know  
  
Aiyyo its hard knock livin doin hard luck time  
Tryin to make a dime still my only crime  
A man died tryin to circumcise my shine  
Buck your gun kiddo and Ill buck mine  
Cash walk the line police are the swine  
But knowledge is refined by the wise and divine  
And I can break it down for the dumb and the blind  
Unnatural acts to actual facts  
Like cats that move packs dont never pay tax  
You aint lie boy you need to relax  
You leave a five like a junkie leaves tracks  
A habit needs a home like a monkey needs backs  
  
Pistol in my lap got the pedal to the flo  
The whiskey in the flask and a head full of blow  
You got heaven up above got hell down below  
Pistol in my lap got the pedal to the flo  
Where Ill wind up even God dont know  
  
I need a hardheaded woman for a coldhearted man  
Never seen it comin thats just part of the plan  
Work the hidden hand walk forbidden land  
Do the best I can once shit hits the fan  
An hours worth of sand supply and demand  
Get high as you can the power of a grand  
Two in the bush is worth one in the hand  
Could cower in the van or burst into battle  
Back in the saddle the kid dont rattle  
Dont play me up the creek with no paddle  
We dont snitch while you bitches just tattle  
Poppin off at the lip gets you tipped like cattle  
  
Eyes full of hate got a heart full of love  
And youre the only woman that I ever dreamed of  
I get high as I can fly then I cry like a dove  
Eyes full of hate got a heart full of love  
And youre the only woman that I ever dreamed of  
  
Chorus
