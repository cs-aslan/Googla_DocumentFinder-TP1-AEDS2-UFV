Who who  
Twist yourself further from the middle of the floor  
Throw a little kiss to the woman next door  
Step on the gas put your hand in the air  
Make a Vsign and you throw back your hair  
Think about nothin now youre nice and high  
Youre advocating love but you dont know why  
Now youre getting vibrations all down to your feet  
Thats the brow beating heavy leather resurrection beat  
  
Put your hand on your hips  
Now you let your backbone slip  
Put out your tongue put your hand in the air  
Make a V sign you just dont care  
Now you feel free you gotta lose control  
All Gods children got a little bit of soul  
You dont have to think you dont have to move a muscle  
To do the brow beating heavy leather resurrection shuffle  
  
Alright  
Oh here we go again  
Oh thats it youre doin it  
Alright  
  
You Think about nothin now youre nice and high  
Youre advocating love but you dont know why  
Youre getting vibrations all down to your feet  
Thats the brow beating heavy leather resurrection beat  
  
Here we go  
Put your hand on your hip  
You gotta let your backbone slip  
Put out your tongue put your hand in the air  
Make a V sign like you just dont care  
Now you feel free you gotta lose control  
  
All Gods children got some soul  
You dont have to think you dont have to move a muscle  
To do the brow beating heavy leather resurrection shuffle  
  
You doin alright  
This is gonna last you for years and years and it alright  
You doin alright dont get uptight  
Uhhuh yea that sounds alright umhum  
Do do n do do do
