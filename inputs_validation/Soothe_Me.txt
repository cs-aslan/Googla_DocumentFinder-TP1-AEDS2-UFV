Maybe I should wander  
Through these streets a little longer  
Hey New York City  
Wont you welcome me back home  
And darling I love you  
But I swear that Ill be gone  
By the time you figure out what you want  
  
Maybe I should wander  
Through my solitude a little longer  
Turn your head now sailor  
Well I used to be so much stronger  
How in the hell did I get here  
In this city so alone  
Oh sometimes life seems so long  
  
Chorus  
You cant soothe me with your sweet voice  
If I cant be your first choice  
You cant soothe me with your deep eyes  
If I cant be your first prize  
You cant soothe me with affection  
If its pointed in the wrong direction  
Unless you think Im perfection  
Unless you think Im perfection  
  
Maybe I should wander  
Through these streets a little longer  
Find my ruthless angel  
That will carry me back home  
Cause we all want to go home  
And we search for love our whole lives  
I found a man who only wants to be alone  
  
Chorus  
  
Maybe down the road who knows  
Youll get it together  
With all your charm my hope grows  
Its wonderful  
But youre flirting only as a friend  
You touch my heart  
And promise everything  
  
Itll be a mighty cold winter  
Five million people  
Couldnt one of them be you  
And darling I love you  
But I swear that Ill be gone  
By the time you figure out  
What you want  
  
Chorus
