Well people look and people stare  
Well I dont think that I even care  
You work your life away and what do they give  
Youre only killing yourself to live  
  
Killing yourself to live  
Killing yourself to live  
  
Just take a look around you what do you see  
Pain suffering and misery  
Its not the way that the world was meant  
Its a pity you dont understand  
  
Killing yourself to live  
Killing yourself to live  
  
Im telling you  
Believe in me  
Nobody else will tell you  
Open your eyes  
And see the lies oh yeah  
  
You think Im crazy and baby  
I know that its true  
Before that you know it I think  
That youll go crazy too  
  
I dont know if Im up or down  
Whether black is white or blue is brown  
The colors of my life are all different somehow  
Little boy blues a big girl now  
  
So you think its me whos strange  
But youve never had to make the change  
Never give your trust away  
Youll end up paying till your dying day
