Everybodys got a million questions  
Everybody wants to know the score  
What you went through  
Its something you  
Should be over now  
Everybody wants to hear the secrets  
That you never told a soul before  
And its not that strange  
Because it wouldnt change  
What happened anyhow  
But you swore to yourself a long time ago  
There were some things that people never needed to know  
Guess theres one that you keep  
That you bury so deep  
No one can tear it out  
And you cant talk about it  
Because youre following a code of silence  
Youre never gonna to lose the anger  
You just deal with it a different way  
And you cant talk about it  
And isnt that a kind of madness  
To be living by a code of silence  
When youve really got a lot to say  
You dont want to lose a friendship  
Theres nothing that you have to hide  
And a little dirt  
Couldnt hurt no one anyway  
And you still have a rage inside you  
That you carry with a certain pride  
In the only part of the broken heart  
That you could ever save  
But youve been through it once  
You know how it ends  
You dont see the point  
Of going through it again  
And this aint the place  
And this aint the time  
And neithers any other day  
So you cant talk about it  
Because youre following a code of silence  
Youre never gonna to lose the anger  
You just deal with it a different way  
So you cant talk about it  
And isnt that a kind of madness  
To be living by a code of silence  
When youve really got a lot to say  
I know you well enough to tell youve got your reasons  
Thats not the kind of code youre inclined to break  
Some things unknown are best left alone forever  
And if a vow is what it takes  
Havent you paid for your mistakes  
After the moment passes  
And the impulse disappears  
You can still hold back  
Because you dont crack very easily  
Its a time honored resolution  
Because the danger is always near  
Its with you now  
But that aint how it was supposed to be  
And its hard to believe after all these years  
That it still gives you pain and it still brings tears  
And you feel like a fool  
Because its part of your rules  
Youve got a memory  
But you cant talk about it  
Because youre following a code of silence  
Youre never gonna to lose the anger  
You just deal with it a different way  
But you cant talk about it  
And isnt that a kind of madness  
To be living by a code of silence  
When youve really got a lot to say
