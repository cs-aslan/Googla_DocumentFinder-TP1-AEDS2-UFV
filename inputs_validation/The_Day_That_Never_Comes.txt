Born to push you around  
Better just stay down  
You pull away  
He hits the flesh  
You hit the ground  
  
Mouth so full of lies  
Tend to block your eyes  
Just keep them closed  
Keep praying  
Just keep awaiting  
  
Waiting for the one  
The day that never comes  
When they stand up and feel the warmth  
But the sunshine never comes no  
No the sunshine never comes  
  
Push you cross that line  
Just stay down this time  
Hide in yourself  
Crawl in yourself  
Youll have your time  
  
God Ill make them pay  
Take it back one day  
Ill end this day  
Ill splatter color on this grave  
  
Waiting for the one  
The day that never comes  
When they stand up and feel the warmth  
But the sunshine never comes  
  
Love is a four letter word  
And never spoken here  
Love is a four letter word  
Here in this prison  
  
I suffer this no longer  
I put it into  
This I swear  
This I swear  
The sun will shine  
This I swear  
This I swear  
This I swear
