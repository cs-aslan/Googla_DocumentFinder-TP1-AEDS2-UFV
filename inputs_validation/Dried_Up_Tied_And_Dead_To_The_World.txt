You cut off all of your fingers  
Trade them in for dollar bills  
Cake on some more makeup to  
Cover up all those lines  
Wake up and stop shaking  
Dont you want some of this  
Dont you need some of this  
You take but cannot be given  
You ride but cannot be ridden  
Pinch this tiny heart of mine  
Wrap it up in soiled twine  
You never read what youve written  
Ill be your lover Ill be forever  
Ill be tomorrow I am anything when Im high  
Dont you want some of this  
Dont you need some of this  
You shove your hair down my throat  
I feel your fingers in me  
Tear this bitter fruit to mess  
And wrap it in your soiled dress  
Now you must spit out the seeds  
  
All dried up and tied up forever  
All fucked up and dead to the world
