Looks like Ill go on through my life bound in sorrow  
Im a loser right from the start  
Now Ive lost the only one I really loved  
And Im bound to this pain in my heart  
I am bound because I am so much in love with you  
And I know that this loves all in vain  
When you let anyone have the love you say is mine  
It proves to me Im a loser again  
I am bound with so many sweet memories of you  
What more can a poor loser do   
I cant change your ways I cant make you love me more  
I am bound to this crave I have for you  
I was bound to lose you when I first fell in love with you  
I thought Id try and love again  
Oh I lost but kept my chin up and I would pull through every time  
But losing you has laid my head in my hands
