Youre perfect  
Oh perfect  
  
I just cant control myself  
I cant be with no one else  
It seems like Im addicted to the way you like to touch me  
I dont think they understand  
Why love at your command from  
The words you speak so deep  
Our bodies read  
I have to have you  
  
Chorus  
I love you  
Youre perfect  
A manifestation of my dreams  
  
You made my  
Body feel  
About a million different things  
  
I think God made you for me  
A mix of passionate fidelity  
Baby youre so complete  
I write this song to let you know  
That you will always be to me  
My lust my love my man my child my friend  
and my king  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres no way  
Id leave you  
Its just not a reality  
  
Sometimes I  
Feel like Im  
Livin in a fantasy
