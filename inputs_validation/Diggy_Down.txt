Chorus x4  
Down down diggy diggy down down blow  
Down down diggy diggy down  
  
Diggedy down down just look around my world is goin down  
Disease is spreadin everywhere I cancannot be found  
This the season for murder isnt no reason  
To hurt another brother but temptation is so pleasin  
And every alleyway theyre gettin high  
On playgrounds theyre sellin crack and every day another baby dies  
Pistol whippin kidnappin anything can happen  
Diggedy down diggedy down with Old Trafford  
  
Chorus  
  
Young people with no education politicians deny and segregation  
Young infants deserted and abandoned  
Step parents lack in understandin  
Homelessness all across the land war man against man  
Treachery and evil fillin our communities  
And all these hypocrites aiyyo theyre stealin from our charities  
  
Chorus x4  
  
Repeat x4  
People are gettin hurt people are gettin hurt up  
People are gettin done people are gettin done up we gotta rise  
  
Chorus x4  
  
Diggedy down down just look around my world is goin down  
Disease is spreadin everywhere I cancannot be found  
This the season for murder isnt no reason  
To hurt another brother but temptation is so pleasin  
And every alleyway theyre gettin high  
On playgrounds theyre sellin crack and every day another baby dies  
Pistol whippin kidnappin anything can happen  
Diggedy down diggedy down with Old Trafford  
  
Chorus x4  
  
Many poisonous chemicals and uh boom  
Many devilish goals are up uh soon  
No love where loves ya dwell in  
Motherearth transformed into hell an  
Ice murders conspiracy and uh schemes  
Young boys will reveal their dreams  
Handguns in the hands of the young  
And diss all this paranoia yo theres much slugs for everyone  
  
Chorus x4  
  
We need to rise rise as if we live with our eyes eyes  
Stay away from the hate hate before its too late before its too late  
We go ah  
  
Chorus x4  
  
We gotta rise
