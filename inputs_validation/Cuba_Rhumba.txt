Now if youre gonna cruise be sure that youll choose Habana  
Where the waters are green by that old Caribbean sea  
And if you stay awhile youll soon like their style of rhythm  
Youll learn the Cuba Rhumba the dance that everyone does  
And when you dance with the sweet senorita you meet in the moonlight  
Youll forget way of prom and youll never want to come home  
And in a tropical way youll learn how to say manana  
And the Cuba Rhumba will have you under its spell  
If youll hear Spanish guitars out under the stars in Cuba  
While the dancers are swayin as long as Im playin tune  
And if youre tappin your feet in the beat of that native music  
Then the Cuba Rhumba has got you under its spell  
Beneath the tropical sky youll be tryin to step to the rhythm  
And youll shout all day in the way the native all do  
And then youll walk in a trance and just want to dance to Rhumba  
Yes the Cuba Rhumba will have you under its spell
