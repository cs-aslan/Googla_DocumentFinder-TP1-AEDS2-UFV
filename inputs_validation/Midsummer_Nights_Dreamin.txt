Do it to me  
Do it to me  
Do it again  
Takin me high  
  
Takin me low  
Takin ma friends  
Think Im a fool  
Leavin the school  
  
Bending them rules  
But do it to me  
Do it to me  
Do it again  
  
Mid summer nights dreamin  
You might treat me right i  
Had too much to drink  
Dont ask me now  
  
Head in the sink  
Do it to me  
Do it to you  
Do it to them  
  
So much to see  
So much to do  
So little time  
Youre breakin ma heart  
  
Youre makin me cry  
Youre stealin ma soul  
You dont even try  
But do it to me  
  
Do it to you  
Do it to them  
Mid summer nights dreamin  
You might treat me right i  
  
Had too much to drink  
Dont ask me now  
Head in the sink
