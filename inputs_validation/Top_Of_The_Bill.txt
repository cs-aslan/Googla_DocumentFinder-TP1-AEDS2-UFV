Youre a rocknroll star  
You are out of the charts  
Your blood is cold youre getting old  
But your life is rocknroll  
  
That crazy rocknroll band  
Is spinning in your head in your head  
Each and every way ya make the thoughts  
Is about stars on the chart  
  
Ohhh and they are top of the bill  
  
Youre a rocknroll star  
Youve been the first one on the chart  
Youve had glory and fame  
Rocknroll was your game  
  
Ohhh and you were top of the bill
