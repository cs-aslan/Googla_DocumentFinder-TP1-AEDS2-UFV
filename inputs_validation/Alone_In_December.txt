You always amazed me  
But thats the past  
I kept silent and it rained for days  
My inside were drenched  
But I guess thats the part of growing up  
I never wanted to learn  
And I grew into the man  
That you never knew  
But I wouldnt be this way  
If it wasnt for you  
A hundred thank yous  
It this is love  
Fairy tales never came true  
Judies are black in full bloom  
And I died in the womb  
Take it back all thats gone  
Its all still there like you left it  
December stayed the same  
Nothing ever changed but you  
Every dream civered in dents  
Love cant fly tonight  
Couples will rest Ill be sleepless  
So cry yourself to sleep  
This is about broken hearts  
This is about me  
Bending again for nothing  
Id run to you but pain awaits  
Im coming home  
But Ill be late  
No deeper than imagination can be  
Sight with nothing to see  
Whats faith if I cant believe  
Its everything  
A cure but I make it a disease  
God take me because I hate me
