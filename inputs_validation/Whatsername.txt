Unforgettable face  
I cant think of her name  
Its on the edge of my tongue  
Gathering dust in the  
Back of my brain  
Something bout the way  
She ignores me  
Thats vaguely familiar  
Makes you wonder what it was  
You ever did to thrill her  
  
Here we go again  
Here we go again  
Here I go again  
  
I never felt the need to soothe  
Her savage breast  
She never felt obliged to tell me  
Of her change of address  
Caught me on a downward swing  
But I fell through her arms  
How could I be so careless  
I never meant to go so far  
  
Here we go again  
Here we go again  
Here I go again  
  
Oh shes back in town  
Oh shes back in town  
Im not leaving Im running away  
  
She took it all away  
Now shes back for the rest  
Took it all so easy  
Wouldnt settle for less  
She doesnt know what  
She wants  
But she knows how to get it  
I cant remember the time  
She never let me forget it  
  
Here we go again  
Here we go again  
Here I go again  
  
Oh Whatsernames back in town  
Shes back in town  
Im not leaving Im running away  
Oh shes back in town  
Oh shes back in town  
Im not leaving Im running away
