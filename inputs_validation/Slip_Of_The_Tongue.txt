Sometime after midnight the heat begins to rise  
Girl youd shame the devil with the look thats in your eyes  
I know whats on your mind and I cant run away  
If I dont give you what you want theres gonna be some hell to pay  
  
Creeping up behind me knocking at my door  
Id never be too blind to see just what youre looking for  
You roll me over make me moan  
Ooh such a velvet touch youd melt a heart of stone  
  
Chorus  
Anytime anyplace Im just the fool who puts a smile on your face  
A slave to love and keep you young  
All it takes and no mistakes is just a slip of the tongue  
  
And if I want a little love I gotta take a little pain  
Make me think a thousand times before I kiss again  
Im waiting on your every day and every night  
If I dont try to satisfy theres gonna be a fist fight  
  
Chorus  
  
The sun is slowly rising and Im sinking to my knees  
Im dying just to close my eyes Im begging darlin please  
I hear you calling and Im crawling cross the floor  
I give you everything I got and still you ask for more  
  
Chorus
