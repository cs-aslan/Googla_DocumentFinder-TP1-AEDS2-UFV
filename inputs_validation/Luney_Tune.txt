I slipped into my jeans  
Lookin hard and feelin mean  
I took a spit at the moon  
Its all in this luney tune  
Just a little insane  
A couple shots I cant feel no pain  
Hey where have I been  
And who are these scary men  
  
Is this all real  
Is this all necessary  
Or it this a joke  
  
Many know I dont regret at all  
They locked me up for good  
Pinned me against the wall  
  
I cant find the exit  
I quit looking for doors  
I stole a razor from the commissary  
I just couldnt take it no more  
  
Im swimmin in blood  
Like a rat on a sewer floor  
No longer insane  
Just part of this crazy dream
