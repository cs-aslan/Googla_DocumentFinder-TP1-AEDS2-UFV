Do you know the way to San Jose  
Ive been away so long I may go wrong and lose my way  
Do you know the way to San Jose  
Im going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose  
  
La is a great big freeway  
Put a hundred down and buy a car  
In a week maybe two theyll make you a star  
Weeks turn into years how quick they pass  
And all the stars that never were  
Are parking cars and pumping gas  
  
Do you know the way to San Jose  
Theyve got a lot of space therell be a place where I can stay  
I was born and raised in San Jose  
Im going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose  
  
Fame and fortune is a magnet  
It can pull you far away from home  
With a dream in your heart youre never alone  
Dreams turn into dust and blow away  
And there you are without a friend  
You pack your car and ride away  
  
Ive got lots of friends in San Jose  
Do you know the way to San Jose  
Cant wait to get back to San Jose
