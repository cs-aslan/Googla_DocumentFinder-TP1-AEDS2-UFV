I dont  
I dont know why  
In your boys life you become like a bull  
Like a bull in a china shop  
Smash it up into smithereens  
  
There you there you go again  
Breaking breaking porcelain  
Is that all I am just a doll you got used to  
Weve done weve done this before  
As Mars sauntered through his door  
Dont say its time to say  
Goodbye to Pisces  
Goodbye to Pisces  
  
I cried and I washed my tears  
That turned into diamond  
Ice into ice and if it could freeze  
My heart wouldnt float away  
  
So how how will I go  
Back on back on the shelf  
With a smile with a smile  
To the customer and say  
On sale by the owner  
  
Here I  
Here I go again  
Breaking  
Breaking porcelain  
Is that all I am  
Just a doll you got used to  
Weve done  
Weve done this before  
As Mars sauntered through his door  
Dont say its time to say  
Goodbye to Pisces  
Goodbye to Pisces  
Goodbye my Pisces
