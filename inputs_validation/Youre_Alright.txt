Youre Alright  
You take a look inside  
But you dont like what you see  
And so you choose to look away  
It doesnt coincide  
With how youd like to be  
And each glimpse of hope can easily fade  
  
Chorus  
Down on your confidence  
Its a fight that wont let go  
But youve got to realize  
That youre alright  
Cause under your rubble  
Lies a heart the Father holds  
And when you see your life  
through his eyes  
Youre alright  
  
To learn how He loves you  
Is to learn to love yourself  
To live the life Hes livin in you  
And what others think of you  
Could never measure to the wealth  
Of what hes paid and given to you  
  
Chorus
