In the church one day you will get hurt  
In the school teachers such a fool  
And if they would ever come round here  
They would ever come  
Blame it on my style take a pill  
Dont tell me how to feel  
Bad news and tunes  
Sing it from the high  
Singin some sad song  
Uncle Sam playin in the sand  
Understand hold my hand  
Time is never gonna stop runnin  
Never gonna stop  
Take me to the top of the trees  
Dont take me for a cracked window pane  
Bad news and tunes  
Are shinin from the high  
Singin some sad song  
Dont rehearse this is the last verse  
In the hearse goin through your purse  
And if they would ever laugh not here  
They would ever laugh  
Blame it on my style once again  
Dont take me for a ride in the rain  
Bad news and tunes  
Shinin from the high  
Singin some sad song
