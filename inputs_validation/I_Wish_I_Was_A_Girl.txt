The devils in the dreaming  
He tells you Im not sleeping in my hotel room alone  
With nothing to believe in  
You dive into the traffic rising up  
And its so quiet  
Youre surprised  
And then you wake  
  
For all the things youre losing  
You might as well resign yourself to try and make a change  
Im going down to Hollywood  
Theyre gonna make a movie from the things that they find  
crawling round my brain  
  
I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me  
And I could shake this static everytime I try to sleep  
I wish for all the world that I could say  
Hey Elizabeth you know Im doing alright these days  
  
The devils in the dreaming  
You see yourself descending from a building to the ground  
You watch the sky receding  
You spin to see the traffic rising up  
And its so quiet  
Youre surprised  
And then you wake  
  
For all the things Im losing  
I might as well resign myself to try and make a change  
But Im going down to Hollywood  
Theyre gonna make a movie from the things that they find  
crawling round my brain  
  
I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me  
And I could shake this static every time I try to sleep  
I wish for all the world that I could say  
Hey Elizabeth you know Im doing alright these days  
  
In one of these dreams you forgive me  
It makes me think of the bad decisions that keep you at home  
How could anyone else have changed  
All these wrong conclusions that leave you alone  
How could everyone rearrange  
How could everyone else have changed  
What I see I believe  
  
For all the things Im losing  
I might as well resign myself to try and make a change  
Well Im going down to Hollywood  
Theyre gonna make a movie from the things that they find  
crawling around my brain  
  
I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me  
And I could shake this static everytime I try to sleep  
I wish for all the world that I could say  
Hey Elizabeth you know Im doing alright these days  
  
But I cant sleep at night
