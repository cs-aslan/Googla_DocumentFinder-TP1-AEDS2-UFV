Oh its Christmas  
Oh ah  
Im so glad that you came my way  
From a million stars  
Here you are  
I swear your love is mine  
Somehow I knew that you were made for me  
I cant believe that my wish came true  
Ill never let ya go baby

People are celebrating all throughout the world  
And thats what we gonna do tonight  
Cause we got so much so much love to share  
Oh its Christmas  
And well share a love just like we did last year  
Oh its Christmas  
And you know Im gonna be right here  
And still my heart belongs to you and only you  
Merry Christmas darlin  
Let us share the joy of love tonight  
Girl when tonights may come and go  
Were still dancing slow  
Cant you hear my song  
The song I sing for you

You should know by now its true

Chorus   
  
And I wish you such a nice Christmas  
And a merry Christmas to all  
Merry Christmas to the world
