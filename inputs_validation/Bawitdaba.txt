Bawitdaba da bang da dang diggy diggy diggy said the boogie said up jump
the boogie  
  
My name is kid  
Kid rock  
  
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy  
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie  
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy  
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie  
  
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy  
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie  
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy  
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie  
  
And this is for the questions that dont have an answer  
The midnight glances  
And the topless dancers  
The can of freaks  
  
Cars packed with speakers  
The gs with the fortys  
And the chicks with beepers  
The northern lights  
  
And the southern comfort  
And it dont even matter if your veins are punctured  
All the crackheads the critics the cities  
And all my heroes at the methodone clinics  
  
All you bastards at the irs  
For the crooked cops and the cluttered desks  
For the shots of jack and the caps of meth  
Half pints of love and a fifth of stress  
  
All the hookers that are tricking out in hollywood  
And for my hoods of the world misunderstood  
I said its all good and its all in fun  
Now get in the pit and try to love someone  
  
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy

Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy  
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie  
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy  
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie  
  
For the time bombs clicking and the heads they hang  
All the gangs gettin money and the heads they bang  bang  
Wild mustangs  
The porno flicks  
  
All my homies in the county in cell block six  
The grits when there aint enough eggs to cook  
And to db cooper and the money he took  
You can look for answers but that aint fun  
  
Now get in the pit and try to love someone  
  
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy  
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie  
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy  
Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie
