Found out this morning  
Theres a circus coming to town  
They drive in Cadillacs  
Using walkietalkies and the Secret Service  
  
Their big top  
Imitation of life  
And all the flags and microphones  
We have to cover our eyes  
  
We play the sideshows  
And we like the tunnel of love  
And when we ride the Ferris wheel  
Were little children again  
  
And when theyre asking for volunteers  
Well be the first ones aboard  
And when the ringmaster calls our names  
Well be the first ones to goto sleep  
  
Stealing all our dreams  
Dreams for sale  
They sell em back to you  
  
On with the show  
Start the parade  
We sand along  
Sweep us away  
  
Its political party time  
Going down going down  
And the celebrities all come out  
Coming down coming down coming  
  
The sun is going down  
And the dogs are starting to howl  
We stay out after dark  
Eating cotton candy  
And the musics playing  
  
How we all laughed  
We split our sides  
The cameras flashed  
We almost died  
  
The rains gonna pour on down falling out of the sky  
Coming down coming down  
And the celebrities all run out and the rains  
Coming down coming down  
  
Gonna rain  
Gonna rain gonna rain  
Gonna rain gonna rain  
Rain rain  
Rain rain  
  
And now I wonder whos boss  
And who hes leavin behind
