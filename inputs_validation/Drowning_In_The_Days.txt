Ive been reading books when no ones lookin  
Ive been listenin to the sirens in the night  
Robert says Im goin straight to hell yeah  
If I hang around here I just might  
And Id like to take some medicine  
And like to drink some wine  
Id like to wake up numb like all my friends  
Theres a road to where I came from  
It gets longer all the time  
Theres a road to where Im goin  
It never ends  
And my moon it always sways  
And my guitar always plays and plays  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Ive been writing fairy tales on postcards  
Writing down the story of my life  
Carrie says I make everything so hard  
Carrie says Im difficult shes right  
And Id like to take some medicine  
Id like to take you home  
Id like to get that woman off my mind  
Well I like your pouty lips  
I like your pert little bones  
But Im sleeping with the porcelain tonight  
And my cloud it always rains  
Kens feedback always fades  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days
