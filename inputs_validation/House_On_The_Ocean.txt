All I ever wanted in my life  
Was a house on the ocean with my will  
Somethings tellin me in my eyes  
Youre not living youre dying  
In your world  
  
Chorus  
  
Please dont die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Please dont die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Try not to make make me cry  
  
All I ever wanted to do  
Is chop wood for my fire for winter  
But all you ever picked up as young  
Is get a job and youll go higher  
In your world  
  
Chorus  
  
Please dont die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Please dont die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Try not to make make me cry  
  
All I ever had to do  
Was with living or dying in this world  
All I ever wanted in my life  
Was a house on the ocean  
With my will  
  
Chorus  
  
Please dont die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Please dont die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Try not to make make me cry
