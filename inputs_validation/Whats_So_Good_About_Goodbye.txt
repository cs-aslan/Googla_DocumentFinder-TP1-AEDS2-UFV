Whats so good about goodbye  
All it does is make you cry  
Well if leavin causes grief  
Goodbye can break your heart  
Tell me whats so good about goodbye  
I could have done without it  
  
Wont somebody tell me now  
How can goodbye be good to a lover who really cares  
And another thing I would like to clarify  
Is how can farewell be fair  
I could have done without it  
  
Ah you and I could never say this is goodbye  
Girl well it makes me so sad  
Until its got to be bad  
Tell me whats so good about goodbye  
I could have done without it  
  
Whats so good about goodbye  
Baby baby whats so good about goodbye  
You said goodbye to me  
All Ive known is misery  
But if everything goes wrong lovers stay so long  
Tell me whats so good about goodbye  
I could have done without it  
  
Wont somebody tell me now  
How can goodbye be good to a lover who really cares  
And another thing I would like to clarify  
Is how can farewell be fair  
I could have done without it
