Im getting ready to rock  
Im getting ready to roll now baby  
Im in the mood to dance  
Im in the mood for sweet romance  
  
Take it easy let it go  
Sweet emotions start to flow  
  
Im ready to rock  
Ready to rock  
Ready to rock  
  
Im getting ready to move  
Im getting ready to groove now baby  
Im running so hot  
Im getting ready to shoot my shot  
  
Take it easy let it go  
Sweet emotions start to flow  
  
Im ready to rock  
  
Im going to lose control  
Of my heart and soul  
If I keep on watching you  
And those things you do  
Its going to be all right  
Were going to dance all night  
Anything you want to do  
Here it comes  
  
Im getting ready to rock  
Im getting ready to roll now baby  
Im in the mood to dance  
Im in the mood for sweet romance  
  
Take it easy let it go  
Sweet emotions start to flow  
Take it easy you will see  
Take my hand child come with me  
  
Im ready to rock  
Ready to rock
