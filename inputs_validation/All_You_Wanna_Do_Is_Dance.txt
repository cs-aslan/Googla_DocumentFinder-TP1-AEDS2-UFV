Oh baby you dont get turned on by the radio  
Oh baby you got nothing to play on your stereo  
Why dont the Beatles get back together  
Why dont nobody sing of romance  
Oh baby all you wanna do is dance  
Oh baby I think you are lost in the seventies  
Oh baby The music she aint what she used to be  
You dont understand what theyre saying  
Youve given it every chance  
Oh baby all you wanna do is dance  
Well you wish you were back in the good old days  
When tomatoes were cheaper  
And you never heard the words of your favorite songs  
Through a three inch speaker  
And you never messed around with dangerous drugs  
You were all getting sick on beer  
And you didnt get any unless you went steady and made out for a year  
Well you can hide away honey in your rock and roll dreams  
You can stand by your blue suede shoes  
But the party is over  
And Im getting tired of waiting for you  
Oh baby Where are the oldies they used to play  
Oh baby you want to crawl back into yesterday  
You dont want to deal with the future  
You dont want to make any plans  
Oh baby all you wanna do is dance
