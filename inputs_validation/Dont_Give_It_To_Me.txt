Your life is full of misery  
Well take something for it  
Or try to ignore it dont give it to me  
You trapped me in this corner  
Youre breathing it over me  
Next stops the Royal Infirmary  
  
The rooms started spinning  
Im finding it hard to breath  
I think Ill have to leave I need some air  
That little black cloud  
That follows you everywheres  
Floating my way and its raining despair  
  
Now Im not immune to misery myself  
But its just a bore in somebody else  
If you werent allowed to talk of yourself  
You would have nothing to say  
  
Your life if full of misery  
Well take something for it  
Or try to ignore it dont give it to me  
  
Your life is full of misery  
Well take something for it  
Or try to ignore it dont give it to me  
You trapped me in this corner  
Youre breathing it over me  
Next stops the Royal Infirmary  
  
Now Im not immune
