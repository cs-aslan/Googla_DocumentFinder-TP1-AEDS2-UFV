Blood rains down across the tundra  
Ice flows through my veins  
As my life drains  
Northern bound my dogs are dying  
But I still know  
That nothing is impossible  
  
I can feel Im getting stronger the longer  
Im pushed to the limit  
Said Id do it someday  
Someday is now  
When I see the world around me receding  
No time for bleeding  
Show the world how  
Someday is now  
  
Eight steps till I reach the summit  
My line breaks and I fall down  
The rocky terrain  
My bones are broken into pieces  
My mind cant wait  
To get up and do it again  
  
I can feel Im getting stronger the longer  
Im pushed to the limit  
Said Id do it someday  
Someday is now  
When I see the the sun is shining Im flying  
Theres no time for crying  
Im gonna win someday  
  
No turning back no more yesterdays  
I just wont get lost in the haze  
All my tomorrows no sadness no sorrow  
Watch out for the rest of my days  
  
Stronger the longer  
Im pushed to the limit  
Said Id do it someday  
Someday is now  
When I see the the sun is shining Im flying  
Theres no room for crying  
Im gonna win some way  
Someday is now
