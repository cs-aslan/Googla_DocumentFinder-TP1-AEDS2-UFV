This aint about the things Ive done  
Where Ive been or what I won  
Stand on your corner a thousand time  
Lose what I got keep what I find  
Its about you  
Its about you  
  
This aint about the things you say  
Or how you make me feel this way  
Stand on your corner a thousand time  
Lose what I got keep what I find  
Its about you  
Its about you  
  
And when I get this feeling  
Its hard for me to come back down  
And when I get this feeling  
Its hard for me to come back down  
And I could be  
That everything you need  
And I know this could be  
That free fall back to me  
  
This aint about the things Ive done  
Where Ive been or what I won  
Stand on your corner a thousand time  
Lose what I got keep what I find  
Its about you  
Its about you  
Its about you  
Its about you  
And when I get this feeling  
Its hard for me to come back down  
And when I get this feeling  
Its hard for me  
  
Cause I could be  
That everything you need  
And I know this could be  
That free fall back to me  
  
But keeping you aint easy  
With everyone that sees me  
Telling me get back on the ground  
It never could be easy  
Instead of you just pleasing me  
Youre keeping me down  
And I know this could be  
That free fall  
Come on jump to me
