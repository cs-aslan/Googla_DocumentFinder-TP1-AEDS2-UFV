She sits all alone reading books and drinkin wine  
Admires all the cracks by the doorway  
She tries to look happy but shes slowly running out of smiles  
Gracefully wasting away  
  
Who is gonna make the birds sing  
Who is gonna be her everything  
Everyday goodbyes  
  
She foolishly tries to convince herself that shell be fine  
She blows all her kisses to none  
As the phone rings again she just closes her eyes  
She covers her ears and screams please not today  
  
Who is gonna make the birds sing  
Who is gonna be her everything  
Everyday goodbyes  
  
She cries and then she sighs  
And gets down on her knees yelling I dont believe what has happened to me  
She cries and then she sighs  
And gets down on her knees yelling I dont believe what has happened to me  
  
Who is gonna make the birds sing  
Who is gonna be her everything  
Everyday goodbyes  
Repeat
