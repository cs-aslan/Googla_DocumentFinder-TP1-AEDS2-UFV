These days Im looking like a pitiful sight  
Got a suicide smile on my face every night  
I walk alone  
Talk to myself  
Shout angry words up to the sky  
People stop and stare  
Like Im out of my head  
But what do they know  
About the tears that I cry  
And I cry yes I cry and thats why  
Oooh oooh Im an inconsolable man  
Oooh oooh since shes gone away thats what I am  
Oooh oooh Im an inconsolable man  
Nobody understands  
An inconsolable man  
I stop into a church and I waste another prayer  
Well if theres someone listen to me  
No ones talkin up there  
So I walk down a street  
Where lonely men sleep  
With what money can buy  
I tell myself that life aint over just yet  
I can learn to forget if only I try  
And I try and I try but its a lie  
Oooh oooh Im an inconsolable man  
Oooh oooh since shes gone away thats what I am  
Oooh oooh Im an inconsolable man  
Nobody understands  
An inconsolable man  
Nobody  
Nobody  
Nobody understands  
And inconsolable man  
Oooh oooh Im an inconsolable man  
Oooh oooh since shes gone away thats what I am  
Oooh oooh Im an inconsolable man  
Nobody understands  
An inconsolable man
