Its freezing in Bristol  
Theres love on the tele  
A girl grinning at me  
Shes doing the shimmy  
  
And shes cruel  
And shes skinny  
And shes a fool  
For the last living rock king  
  
Its her thrill  
Its her wonder  
Its her will  
Its her way home  
  
Shes right where she always wanted to be  
She cant change  
Change  
Change  
  
Its lightening in London  
Its lightening in London  
Wheres shit on the tele  
theres shit on TV  
  
Youre pushing my buttons  
pushing my buttons  
You know how to touch me  
And I knew  
  
That youd choose me  
By the times  
That you tried to refuse me  
Its your thrill  
  
Its your wonder  
Its your will  
Its your way home  
Youre right where you always wanted to be  
  
You cant change  
Change  
Change  
woah  
  
Its morning in Philly  
its morning in Philly  
My heads feeling heavy  
my heads feeling heavy  
  
The sun makes me dizzy  
the sun makes me sick  
You monkey you left me  
And I know  
  
That you miss me  
By the way  
That you kiss and resist me  
Its my thrill  
  
Its my wonder  
Its my will  
Its my way home  
Im right where I always dreamed I would be  
  
I cant change  
Change  
Change  
woah
