Youve been sweet youve been good  
Ive been better than you ever cook  
Ive been yours youve been mine  
Dont be kind  
You got dreams Ive got plans  
Ill be gone before you understand  
I betrayed youve been blind  
Dont be kind  
Dont be kind  
Shoot it straight as an arrow  
Dont be kind  
To the quick to the marrow  
You can say what youve got on your mind  
Dont be kind  
Weve been friends weve been folks  
Weve been lovers clinging so close  
Weve believed but not this time  
Dont be kind  
When you hurt me oh you hurt me  
Then you feel you must be nice  
Well its bad enough to take it once  
Being kind makes it twice  
Its been great its been real  
Its been soft as silk and tough as steel  
You be yours and Ill be mine  
Dont be kind  
Dont be kind  
Shoot it straight as an arrow  
Dont be kind  
To the quick to the marrow  
You can say what youve got on your mind  
Dont be kind  
Dont be kind  
You can say what you got on your mind  
Dont be kind  
Shoot it straight as an arrow  
Dont be kind  
To the quick to the marrow  
You can say what youve got on your mind  
Dont be kind  
Dont be kind  
You can say what youve got on your mind  
Dont be kind  
Dont be kind  
You can say what youve got on your mind  
Dont be kind  
Dont be kind
