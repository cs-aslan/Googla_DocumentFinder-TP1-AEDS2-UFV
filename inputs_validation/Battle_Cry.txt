Just one more time before I go  
Ill let you know  
That all this time Ive been afraid  
Wouldnt let it show  
Nobody can save me now no  
Nobody can save me now  
  
Stars are only visible in darkness  
Fear is everchanging and evolving  
And I have been poisoned inside  
But I I feel so alive  
  
Nobody can save me now  
The king is crowned  
Its do or die  
Nobody can save me now  
The only sound  
Is the battle cry  
Is the battle cry  
Is the battle cry  
Nobody can save me now  
Its do or die  
  
Oh  
  
Nobody can save me now  
The king is crowned  
Its do or die  
  
Nobody can save me now  
The only sound  
Is the battle cry  
Is the battle cry  
Is the battle cry  
Nobody can save me now  
Its do or die  
  
Just one more time before I go  
Ill let you know  
That all this time Ive been afraid  
Wouldnt let it show  
Nobody can save me now no  
Nobody can save me now
