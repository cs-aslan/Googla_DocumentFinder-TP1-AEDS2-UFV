Man this shit aint fair  
Gimme the death penalty or the electric chair  
Im in the electric coupe with the electric roof  
Its electric blue with the electric top  
Just gives me a rush yea a electric shock  
N that mothafucker creepin got the navy seats  
Cause I be riding downtown with the navy piece  
Got that f rifle yea the navy heat  
Shit gone of goose told call me cranberry  
A traded in the scale for a new blackberry

A hood nigga straight turned in an entrepreneur

The game is in trouble  
But help is on the way  
I do it for the niggas that flip a brick erday  
Im killing these niggas  
Still the realest nigga in it

Gimme back my flock  
Gimme back my life

I kno what you thinkin thats a goddamn shame  
But nigga aint gay  
Gave me a motherfukin thang

Yea I stood out in the heat  
Nigga tryna short stop  
Im in the middle of the street

But now I ride good up n down the same road  
Got my spot in the hood even got the same stove  
N Im still lifestyle so I got the same coke  
  
Im killin these niggas  
The game is in trouble  
But help is on the way  
I do it for the niggas that flip a brick erday  
Im killin these niggas  
Still the realest nigga in it  
Is all I gotta say  
When you on the high way thats what you play  
Im killin these niggas
