Strong on the outside  
But coming apart at the seams thats me  
Tragically always together  
But bruised underneath thats me  
  
I stand just to stumble  
Tripping on my pride  
Why do I always try to hide  
  
Meanwhile back at my heart  
Im desperate for all that you are  
Undo me take me apart  
  
Meanwhile back at my soul  
Mend me Lord please make me whole  
You know just where to start  
Back at my heart back at my heart  
  
Patiently waiting to pick up the pieces of me thats you  
Healer of hearts when the world leaves it broken in two thats you  
  
Maker of Heaven sky and the sea  
You stretched you reached for me you reached for me  
  
Meanwhile back at my heart  
Im desperate for all that you are  
Undo me take me apart  
  
Meanwhile back at my soul  
Mend me Lord please make me whole  
You know just where to start  
  
Back at my heart back at my fear  
Back at my brokenness Lord meet me here  
No ones opposed Im not afraid anymore  
  
Im desperate for all that you are  
Undo me take me apart  
  
Meanwhile back at my soul  
Mend me Lord please make me whole  
You know just where to start  
Back at my heart  
  
Back at my heart back at my heart back at my heart  
  
Healer of hearts when the world leaves it broken in two thats you
