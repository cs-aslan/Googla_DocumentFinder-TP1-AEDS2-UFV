I know that youre with him just now as I write  
I know you need someone to hold you at night  
But Im begging you baby  
Please dont fall in love  
I knew it might happen when I was away  
And now that its happened I just want to say  
That Im begging you baby  
Please dont fall in love  
Im usually strong but Im feeling so weak  
It wells up inside me I cry when I speak  
But the more I call you on the phone  
The more I feel alone  
And the less we have to say  
I know that youre with him just now as I write  
I know you need someone to hold you at night  
But Im begging you baby  
Please dont fall in love  
I knew it might happen when I was away  
And now that its happened I just want to say  
That Im begging you baby  
Please dont fall in love  
We kissed at the airport we said we could wait  
I believe it is we who determine our fate  
And I love you more than I can say  
Dont throw it all away  
Dont let it go by  
I know that youre with him just now as I write  
I know you need someone to hold you at night  
But Im begging you baby  
Please dont fall in love  
I know you dont tell me to spare me the pain  
Dont want you to tell me I dont need his name  
That Im begging you baby  
Please dont fall in love
