Rodney Crowell  
Shes a rounder I can tell you that  
She can sing em all night too  
Shell raise hell about the sleep she lost  
But even cowgirls get the blues  
Especially cowgirls theyre the gypsy kind  
And need their laid on em loose  
Shes lived to see the world turned upside down  
Hitchin rides out of the blues  
But even cowgirls get the blues sometimes  
Bound to dont know what to do sometimes  
Get this feelin like shes too far gone  
The only way shes ever been  
Lonely nights are out there on the road  
Motel ceiling stares you down  
There must be safer ways to pay your dues  
But even cowgirls get the blues  
Even cowgirls get the blues sometime  
Bound to dont know what to do sometimes  
Get this feelin like shes too far gone  
The only way shes ever been  
Even cowgirls get the blues sometime  
Bound to dont know what to do sometimes  
Get this feelin like the restless wind  
The only way shes ever been
