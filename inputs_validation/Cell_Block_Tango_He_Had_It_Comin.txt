Intro Queen Latifah  
Dana Owens aka Queen Latifah yes Im here to testify  
No I gotta speak on my behalf you dont even know  
What happened  
Can I just tell you what happened  
  
Chorus Macy Latifah  
He had it comin He had it comin  
He only had himself to blame  
If youd a been there if youd a seen it  
I think that you would have done the same  
  
Verse 1 Queen Latifah Macy  
I mean imagine why was he hittin his woman  
Why was she takin that  
Now picture her fightin back picture the ass kickin  
Think of his ass flippin down the stairs  
And me at the top smilin he shoulda stopped wildin  
Now could you picture me tryin to finish him off  
See why I pictured me on this side of the law  
High heels leave holes youd a thought I was gunnin  
Now the cops comin I aint runnin  
He had it comin  
Girl you shoulda seen it shoulda bobbed and weaved  
Before the cops came got a coupla clean hits  
In word the Couldnt take the abuse  
But I couldnt explain that to the state troops  
But you know girl yeah you go girl  
Plus I look real cute in orange jump suits  
This the story Im tellin and I aint changin nothin  
I just needed you to know Your Honour  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
Verse 2 Lil Kim Macy  
Aiight aiight lets get this over with  
Take the mug shot hurry up the fingerprints  
What the blood clot  
Lil Kim aka Sofia Luchiani  
Keep your jump suit Im rockin Armani  
Yeah I bust at him once but that was just a warnin  
My lawyer will be here with bail money in the mornin  
Im not guilty just tryin to protect mine  
It aint my fault he ran into my knife 20 times He had it comin  
Just my luck the bastard aint die  
What you woulda did if every other day he blacked ya eye  
Broke ya nose til it started bleedin  
Kicked you in ya ribs chocked you til you stopped breathing  
Fuck that Im sick of bobbing and weaving  
Threatenin to kill me when I threaten to leave him  
I do a bid cause aint no way  
Nigga gonna do me like Ike and oj  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
Verse 3 Queen Latifah  
This is for the constantly accused mentally abused  
How many of you been in my shoes before aiight  
Or have you felt you caught the worse case  
Puttin up wit his tired ass in the first place  
Why am I flippin I just bought them condoms  
I aint used not one but there was two missin  
Get a new mission how to catch a cheater  
If he only use coach you shouldnt smell  
If you know he dont smoke you shouldnt smell reefer  
If you catch him cheatin you shouldnt yell either  
Run up on him quietly took him out silently  
It might sound cruel but you gotta love the irony  
So explain that just came back off a trip  
And I come home to this please  
He aint followed the guidelines  
So forgive me Your Honour he ran into my knife five times  
  
Chorus 3x
