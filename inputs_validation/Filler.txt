What happened to you  
Youre not the same  
Something inside your head made a violent change  
Its call it religion  
Youre full of shit  
Was she really worth it  
She cost you your life  
Shell never leave your side  
Shes gonna be your wife  
Its in yor head  
Filler  
You call it romance  
Youre full of shit  
Your brain is clay  
Whats going on  
You picked up a bible  
And now your gone  
Its in your head  
Its in your head  
Its in your head  
You call it religion  
Youre full of lshit  
You never knew  
You never did  
You never will  
You call it religion  
Youre full of shit
