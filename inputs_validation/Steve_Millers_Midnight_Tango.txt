You have a cup of coffee and another cigarette  
Youre waiting for your baby but she hasnt shown yet  
And if she doesnt make it well youve got no regrets  
Because you cant win or lose if you aint made no bets  
And then she comes in walkin lookin fine as you please  
You wanna stop and drop right down on your knees  
And say baby  
Whoa  
You say you never worry cause you dont need a home  
Dont need an address dont need a phone  
And you dont have to worry bout bein alone  
Cause you can make your music on a ten cent comb  
And then she comes in walkin lookin fine as you please  
You wanna stop and drop right down on you knees  
And say baby  
Whoa
