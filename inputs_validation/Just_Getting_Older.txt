Its nine oclock  
Im getting tired  
Im sick of all my records  
And the clothes I bought today  
  
Am I cracking up  
Or just getting older   
  
Im staying in  
I cant be bothered  
Making conversation with the friends  
That I dont know  
  
Am I cracking up  
Or just getting older   
  
And I bet that this is how life  
Turns out when youre finally grown  
And you know if this is my life  
Ill sit around all day and Ill moan  
  
Im half way up to the bottom  
Of another bottle of my next best favourite friend  
  
Im not cracking up  
Im just getting older  
  
No Im not cracking up  
Im just getting older  
  
No Im not cracking up  
Im just getting older
