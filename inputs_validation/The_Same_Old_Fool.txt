I havent changed Im still the same old me  
Yes Im still the same old fool I used to be  
  
I thought this heart of mine would never miss you  
I thought this heart of mine would never cry  
I told myself Id get along without you  
But I realise I told myself a lie  
  
Im still the same old fool I used to be  
I think of you and suddenly Im helpless  
I havent changed Im still the same old me  
Yes Im still the same old fool I used to be  
  
Although youve got the kind of love that hurts me  
Oh what Id give if we could start again  
If I could hold you close for just a moment  
Id gladly let you break my heart again  
  
Im still the same old fool I used to be  
I think of you and suddenly Im helpless  
I havent changed Im still the same old me  
  
Yes Im still the same old fool I used to be  
Yes Im still the same old fool I used to be
