When you look at me tell me what you see  
Do you see a man or just a jagged outline of one  
Do you hear my words or do they go straight through you  
  
We get it together now and then  
But I can feel we wont again  
Still I cant stop this endless strain of you  
  
Listen to my words and talk the sadness that I bring you  
Ill leave you today cos I am nothing to you  
  
Ohoh make me stay a bit longer  
Make my heart and my body get stronger  
Make me stay dont send me away or Ill be alone  
Make me stay a bit longer  
Make my heart and my body get stronger  
Make me stay dont send me away or Ill be alone

Make me stay dont send me away or Ill be alone
