Now Im supposed to understand  
Dont you think youre asking too much  
What kind of fool do you think I am  
Dont you think youve hurt me enough  
  
Still you want to be friends  
But I dont want to be just friends  
So before you start with your sympathy  
Just turn around and go  
  
And if he breaks your heart dont come crying to me  
I wont be there anymore  
Go ahead and cry your tears  
Cause Im not gonna dry your tears  
  
Ive got hard feelings  
When it comes to you and me  
And these hard feelings  
Just wont let me be  
  
These hard feelings run deep  
These hard feelings run deep  
Ill be alright dont you worry about me  
Ill take care of myself  
  
The first thing I need is you out of my life  
The last thing I need is your help  
Sorry I met you  
Sorry I met you  
  
I will forget you someday  
Ive got hard feelings  
When it comes to you and me  
And these hard feelings  
  
Just wont let me be  
These hard feelings run deep  
These hard feelings run deep  
Ive got hard feelings  
  
When it comes to you and me  
And these hard feelings  
Just wont let me be  
  
These hard feelings run deep  
These hard feelings  
Hard feelings  
When it comes to you and me  
  
And these hard feelings  
Just wont let me be  
These hard feelings run deep  
These hard feelings run deep  
  
Hard feelings  
Just wont let me be  
Hard feelings  
Hard feelings
