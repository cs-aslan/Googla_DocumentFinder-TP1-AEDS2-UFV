So Im down and so Im out  
But so are many others  
So I feel like tryin to hide  
My head neath these covers  
  
Life is like the seasons  
After winter comes the spring  
So Ill keep this smile awhile  
And see what tomorrow brings  
  
Ive been told and I believe  
That life is meant for livin  
And even when my chips are low  
Theres still some left for givin  
  
Ive been many places  
Maybe not as far as you  
So I think Ill stay awhile  
And see if some dreams come true  
  
There isnt much that I have learned  
Through all my foolish years  
Except that life keeps runnin in cycles  
First theres laughter then those tears  
  
But Ill keep my head up high  
Although Im kinda tired  
My gal just up and left last week  
Friday I got fired  
  
You know its almost funny  
But things cant get worse than now  
So Ill keep on tryin to sing  
But please just dont ask me how
