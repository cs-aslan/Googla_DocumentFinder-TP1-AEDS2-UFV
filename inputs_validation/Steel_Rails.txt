Steel rails chasing sunshine round the bend  
Winding through the trees like a ribbon in the wind  
I dont mind not knowing what lies down the track  
Cause Im looking out ahead to keep my mind from turning back  
  
Its not the first time Ive found myself alone and known  
If I really had you once then Id have you when Im gone  
Whistle blows blowin lonesome in my mind  
Calling me along that never ending metal line  
  
Steel rails chasing sunshine round the bend  
Winding through the trees like a ribbon in the wind  
I dont mind not knowing what lies down the track  
Cause Im looking out ahead to keep my mind from turning back  
  
Sun is shining through the open boxcar door  
Lying in my mind with the things Ive known before  
Ive lost count of the hours days and nights  
The rhythm of the rails keeps the motion in my mind  
  
Steel rails chasing sunshine round the bend  
Winding through the trees like a ribbon in the wind  
I dont mind not knowing what lies down the track  
Cause Im looking out ahead to keep my mind from turning back  
  
Cause Im looking out ahead to keep my mind from turning back
