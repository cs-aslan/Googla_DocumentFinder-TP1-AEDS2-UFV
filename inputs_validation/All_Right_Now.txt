There she stood in the street  
Smiling from her head to her feet  
I said Hey what is this  
Now baby maybe shes in need of a kiss  
I said Hey whats your name baby  
Maybe we can see things the same  
Now dont you wait or hesitate  
Lets move before they raise the parking rate  
  
All right now baby its all right now  
All right now baby its all right now  
  
I took her home to my place  
Watching every move on her face  
She said Look whats your game baby  
Are you tryin to put me in shame  
I said slow dont go so fast  
Dont you think that love can last  
She said  Love Lord above  
Now youre tryin to trick me in love  
  
All right now baby its all right now  
All right now baby its all right now
