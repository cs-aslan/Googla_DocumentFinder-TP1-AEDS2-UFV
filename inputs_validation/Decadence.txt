You dont care about nothing  
So you dont care about love  
If you want me to come back  
Youd better change  
  
Youd better give up talking about money  
Begin thinking of love  
If you want me to come back  
Youd better change  
  
Youd better change for the better  
It cost more than dollars and cents  
Take it from me theres  got to be  
An end to this decadence  
This decadence  
  
You dont care about people  
So you dont care about pain  
If you want me to come back  
Youd better change  
  
Youd better change for the better  
Start using some common sense  
Take it from me theres  got to be  
An end to this decadence  
  
For decadence  is fatal  
Its the beginning of the end  
In selfdefense  
I cannot recommend  
This decadence  
  
You dont care about real life  
Youre too distant and strange  
If you want me to come back  
  
Youd better change for the better  
It may be rather intense  
Stop this caprice youve got to cease  
This fidesiecle pretense  
  
For decadence  is fatal  
Its the beginning of the end  
In consequence  
I cannot recommend  
This decadence  
This decadence  
This decadence  
This decadence
