Dropped off the edge again down in Juarez  
dont even bat an eye  
If the eagle cries the rasta man says just cause the desert likes  
Young girls flesh and  
No angel came  
  
I dont think you even know  
What you think you just said  
So go on spill your seed  
Shake your gun to the rasta mans head  
And the desert  she must be blessed and  
No angel came  
  
Theres a time to keep it up  
A time to keep it in  
The Indian is told  
The cowboy is his friend  
You know that I can breathe  
Even when I cheat  
Should shouldve been over for me  
No angel came
