Standing in the doorway with her hand on her hip  
Eyes like the beacons on a rocketship  
Just about the bottom of a bottle of gin  
She baits her hook and she reelsem in  
  
Shes got a black leather jacket with a patch on the back  
No imitation cajun gonna get to that  
Got a red bandana and a rose tattoo  
She got a mind of her own nobody tells her what to do  
  
Diamonds pearls hey hey hey  
Theyre for all the other girls  
Some women just dont needem  
You can keepem  
  
She goes putt putt thats my queen  
Putt putt on her big machine  
Putt putt when the light turns green  
Putt putt shes so mean  
Nothin can stop my queen of the road  
  
Now if you wanna roll the dice you can try your luck  
She can melt the ice of an ice cream truck  
Cant holler uncle when youve had enough  
Her own brother wont fight her cause the girls so tough  
  
Devil of an angel shes a one of a kind  
Shes got a knucklehead harley and a one track mind  
Roadhouse reputation everywhere she goes  
As a big sled rider shes a queen of the road  
  
From Pamona to Daytona hey hey  
And every highway inbetween  
Theres not a one ofem she aint seen  
Wooh you know what I mean  
  
And Chorus  
  
Now when the partys over and the lights come on  
Dont have to try to find her cause the girl is gone  
She slithered into second and away she goes  
My motorheaded mama is the queen of the road  
  
Chorus  
  
Putt putt Chorus  
  
Yeah
