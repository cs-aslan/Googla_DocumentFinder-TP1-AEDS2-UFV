And Ive lived a dozen lifetimes in twentysomeodd years  
Got no use for trouble got no use for tears  
Cant you see its killing me Im old before my time  
I wont let you double the pain of a troubled life  
Ive had my share of sorrow more than you could know  
Save your lies and alibis Ive heard that tune before  
Cant you see its killing me Im old before my time  
I wont let you double the pain of a troubled life  
Youre out all night asleep all day so pack it up and leave  
Ive got no use for trouble troubles using me  
Dont you see my love wont be forever deaf and blind  
I wont let you double the pain of a troubled life  
Ive had my share of sorrow more than you could know  
Save your lies and alibis Ive heard that tune before  
Cant you see its killing me Im old before my time  
I wont let you double the pain of a troubled life  
Ive had my share of sorrow more than you could know  
Save your lies and alibis Ive heard that tune before  
Cant you see its killing me Im old before my time  
I wont let you double the pain of a troubled life  
Cant you see that love cant be forever deaf and blind
