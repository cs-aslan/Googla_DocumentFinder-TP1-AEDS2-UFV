Its great to be a nerd Its great to be a nerd  
The only light we ever see is from our moniter  
We argue about comic books and Internet connections  
The biggest highlight of the year is the Star Trek Convention  
Our towns not big enough to sign up any stars  
But we once met a red shirt who was phasered by a Borg  
Man he knew Mr Sulu What  
Its great to be a nerd Its great to be a nerd  
We wear our Star Trek uniforms and talk like Captain Kirk  
We have our own heroes who we try to emulate  
I dream of one day being as sexy as Bill Gates  
We hate watching sports cause were reading Carl Sagan  
But wed watch the Olympics if they played Dungeons and Dragons  
Im a Hobbitt Ha ha ha ha  
Its great to be a nerd Its great to be a nerd  
We think Tolkein was a genius and Shakespeare was a turd  
We rarely get a date or get talked to by a girl  
Unless theyre having trouble with their algebra homework  
Were emotionally bereft and were sexually frustrated  
But we can download photographs of Agent Scully naked  
Its great to be a nerd Its great to be a nerd  
We know the truth is out there but wed have to leave our room  
We are the nerds in your neighbourhood  
Polyesters a fashion statement  
But theres more room on the beach for you  
Cause were locked in our basement  
Its great to be a nerd Its great to be a nerd  
We like to wear colours that do not appear in nature  
Its great to be a  
Poorlydressed fashionless  
Star trekking roleplaying  
Ninety pound when wet down  
Pasty skinned pop drinking  
Underfed genius  
Yes its great to be a nerd
