When I wake up in the morning love  
And the sunlight hurts my eyes  
And something without warning love  
Bears heavy on my mind  
  
Then I look at you  
And the worlds alright with me  
Just one look at you  
And I know its gonna be  
A lovely day  
 Lovely day lovely day lovely day  
  
When the day that lies ahead of me  
Seems impossible to face  
When someone else instead of me  
Always seems to know the way  
  
Then I look at you  
And the worlds alright with me  
Just one look at you  
And I know its gonna be  
A lovely day  
  
When the day that lies ahead of me  
Seems impossible to face  
When someone else instead of me  
Always seems to know the way  
  
Then I look at you  
And the worlds alright with me  
Just one look at you  
And I know its gonna be  
A lovely day
