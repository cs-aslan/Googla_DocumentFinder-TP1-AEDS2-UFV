When things get bad at home you dont feel like being alone  
And you find yourself inclined to look around  
For the feelings we once shared are just no longer there  
And love comes from the other side of town  
  
Where love means just an hour with your stand in  
And not an empty house where love just has been  
Since everything weve built with love was not on solid ground  
Now love comes from the other side of town  
  
The life Im livin now just dont seem right somehow  
But its the best way to get by that Ive found  
Theres no love left at home were both just hangin on  
And love comes from the other side of town  
  
Where love means just an hour with your stand in  
And not an empty house where love just has been  
Since everything weve built with love was not on solid ground  
Now love comes from the other side of town  
  
Love comes from the other side of town
