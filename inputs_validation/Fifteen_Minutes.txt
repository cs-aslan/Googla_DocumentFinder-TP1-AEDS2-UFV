Seven times in seven days  
Ive sat and wished my life away  
I know the greyness comes and goes  
But the sun dont shine  
And the snow dont snow  
Theres suzyann with her tits and curls  
Where mediocrity excels  
For those vicious boys and their boring girls  
You know it makes me sick but its a bozos world  
Then theres always the cash  
Selling yourself for some trash  
Smiling at people that you cannot stand  
Youre in demand  
Your fifteen minutes start now  
City banker looks are in  
The heartless heart the chinless chin  
And youd spill your beans for just a pint of gin  
How you got so holy  
And became so thin  
In Sunday papers every week  
The silly words you love to speak  
The tacky photos and the phoney smiles  
Well its a bozos world and youre a bozos child  
Then theres always the cash  
Selling yourself for some trash  
Smiling at people that you cannot stand  
Youre in demand  
Your fifteen minutes start now  
Then theres always the fame  
Autographs now and again  
People who saw you on blankety blank  
Or in the bank  
Your fifteen minutes start now
