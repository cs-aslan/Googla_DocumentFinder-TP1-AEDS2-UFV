Im gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you  
  
Im gonna write words so sweet  
Theyre gonna knock me off my feet  
A lot of kisses on the bottom  
Ill be glad I got them  
  
Im gonna smile and say  
I hope youre feelin better  
And close with love  
The way you do  
  
Im gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you  
  
Im gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you
