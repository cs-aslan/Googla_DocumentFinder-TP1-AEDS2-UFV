Verse 1  
Could you see the aisles of women  
Could you see them screaming and weeping  
Could you see the storm rising  
Could you see the guy who was driving  
Could you climb higher and higher  
Could you climb right over the top  
Why does a multimillionaire  
Fill up his home with priceless junk  
  
Refrain  
The wind is whistling  
The wind is whistling  
Through the house  
  
Chorus  
Elvis are you out there somewhere  
Looking like a happy man  
In the snow with Rosebud  
And king of the mountain  
  
Verse 2  
Another Hollywood waitress  
Is telling us shes having your baby  
And theres a rumour that youre on ice  
And you will rise again someday  
And that theres a photograph  
Where youre dancing on your grave  
  
Refrain  
The wind is whistling  
The wind is whistling  
Through the house  
  
The wind is whistling  
The wind is whistling  
Through the house  
  
Chorus  
Elvis are you out there somewhere  
Looking like a happy man  
In the snow with Rosebud  
And king of the mountain  
  
Elvis are you out there somewhere  
Looking like a happy man  
In the snow with Rosebud  
And king of the mountain now
