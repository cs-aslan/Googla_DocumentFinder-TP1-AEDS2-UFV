Well come on pretty baby  
Wont you walk with me  
Come on pretty baby  
Wont you talk with me  
Come on baby  
Give me one more chance  
Try to save me and our romance  
Slow down  
Baby

You better give me a little love  
Give a little love  
Baby what I love the best  
So I used to walk you home  
Baby after school  
Carry your books home too  
And now you got a boyfriend  
Down the street  
Baby what you tryin to do  
You better slow down

You better give a little love  
Give a little love  
Baby what I love the best  
Solo

Come on pretty baby  
Walk two by two

The best woman Ive ever had  
Slow down

You better give a little love  
Give a little love  
Baby what I love the best
