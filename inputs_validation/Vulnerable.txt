Everywhere I look I see her smile  
Her absentminded eyes  
And she has kept me wondering for so long  
How this thing could go wrong  
It seems to me that we are both the same  
Playing the same game  
But as darkness falls this true love falls apart  
Into a riddle of her heart  
  
Shes so vulnerable like china in my hands  
Shes so vulnerable and I dont understand  
I could never hurt the one alternately with someone I love  
Shes all Ive got  
But shes so vulnerable  
Oh so vulnerable  
  
Days like these no one should be alone  
No heart should hide away  
Her touch is gently conquering my mind  
Theres nothing words can say  
Shes colored all the secrets of my soul  
Ive whispered all my dreams  
But just as nightime falls this vision falls apart  
Into a riddle of her heart yea  
  
Shes so vulnerable like china in my hands  
Shes so vulnerable and I dont understand  
I could never hurt the one I love  
Shes all Ive got  
But shes so vulnerable  
Oh so vulnerable  
  
Dont hide your eyes  
  
Shes so vulnerable like china in my hands  
Shes so vulnerable and I dont understand  
I could never hurt someone I love  
Shes all Ive got  
But shes so vulnerable  
Oh so vulnerable  
  
Shes so vulnerable like china in my hands  
Shes so vulnerable and I dont understand  
I could never hurt the one I love  
Shes all Ive got  
But shes so vulnerable  
Oh so vulnerable  
  
Shes so vulnerable
