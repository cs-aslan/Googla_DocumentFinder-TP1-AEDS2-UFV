Words that pull the trigger  
Fear the laughing sound  
Haunts you  
To consider  
Love might turn you around  
To face a blind emotion  
Words like hey lets try  
Words like thinking it over  
They just dont apply  
  
Chorus  
Im the boy you made me  
Im the boy  
Im the boy  
Im the boy you made me  
Im the boy  
Im the boy  
  
Love is  
What you make it  
Love the overflow  
Play if you can take it some  
They just dont know  
If all the rules theyre making  
Break somebodys heart  
Whats the use in taking  
Babys fall apart  
  
Chorus  
  
You made me realize  
That love is just a word  
That goes unheard in a situation  
Where love is nothing  
And you  
Are all I can see  
  
This boys in love with you  
Youre everything  
I can see  
This boys in love with you  
You have taken it all  
Away from me
