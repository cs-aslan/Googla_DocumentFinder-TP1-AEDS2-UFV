Look here  
What dyou think youre  
Gonna be doin next year  
No lie  
How you know youre not  
Gonna up and die  
No doubt  
  
Soon enough your friends  
Will find you out  
Take care  
You know you might not have  
Too much time to spare  
I say  
  
How long have you been acting  
Up this way  
One knows  
When you gonna get  
Your own floor show  
Im hip  
And you could use a button  
On your lip  
  
Look here  
What dyou think youre  
Gonna be doing next year  
Im hip
