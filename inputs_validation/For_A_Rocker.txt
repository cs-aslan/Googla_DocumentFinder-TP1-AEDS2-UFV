Open the door baby turn on the light  
Were gonna have a party tonight  
For a rock for a rocker  
I know its late and youre already down  
You aint ready for people around  
Im gonna tell you something I found out  
Whatever you think your life is about  
Whatever life may hold in store  
Things will happen that you wont be ready for  
Ive got a shirt so unbelievably bright  
Im gonna dig it out and wear it tonight  
For a rocker for a rocker  
For a rocker for a rocker  
Dont have to change dont have to be sweet  
Gonna be too many people to possibly meet  
Dont have to feed em they dont eat  
Theyve got their power supplies in the soles of their feet  
They exist for one thing and one thing only  
To escape living the lives of the lonely  
For a friend of mine from the neighborhood  
Moving down the line after tonight hell be gone for good  
Here comes Ricky Danny and Doerge  
They got Petes number and theyre looking at me  
Russell and Bobby setting up the drums  
Gonna pound on till the landlord comes  
Dont want to argue I dont want to fight  
But there will definitely be a party tonight  
For a rocker for a rocker  
For a rocker for a rocker  
Till the morning comes till the car arrives  
Till we kill the drums till we lose our lives  
Hey Jenny tell Peggy Sue  
Were gonna do the only thing you can do  
For a rocker for a rocker  
For a rocker for a rocker  
Theres a party tonight  
Theres a party tonight  
Theres a party tonight  
Theres a party tonight
