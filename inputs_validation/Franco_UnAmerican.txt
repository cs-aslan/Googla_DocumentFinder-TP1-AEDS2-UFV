I never thought abouit the universe it made me feel small  
I never thought about the problems of this planet at all  
Global warming and radioactive sites  
The imperialistic wrongs and animal rights NO  
  
Why think all the bad things when life is so good  
Why help with an am when theres always a could  
Let the whales worry bout the poisons in the sea outside of California its
foreign policy  
No I dont want changes Ive no reactions your dilemmas are my distractions  
  
Thats no way to go Franco UnAmerican thats no way to go Franco UnAmerican  
  
I never looked around never second guessed then I read some Howard Zinn now
Im always depressed  
And now I cant sleep from years of apathy all because I read a little Noam
Chomsky  
Im eating vegetation cause a Fast Food Nation I wear uncomfortable shoes
cause of globalization  
Im watching Michael Moore expose the awful truth Im listening to Public
Enemy and Reagan Youth  
I see no world peace cause of zealous armed forces I eat no breath mints
cause theyre from dehoofed horses  
Now I cant believe what an absolute failure the presidents laughing cause
we voted for Nader  
  
Thats no way to go Franco UnAmerican where can we go Franco UnAmerican  
I want to move north and be a Canadian or hang down low with the nice
Australians  
I dont want to be another I dont careican what are we gonna do Franco
Franco
