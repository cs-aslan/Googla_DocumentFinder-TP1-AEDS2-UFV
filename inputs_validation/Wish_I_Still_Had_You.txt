Walking out on me must be the way you show me how it feels to be her  
I realize the fault is mine Im getting everything that I deserve  
Its over and older the tears seem much colder  
Sunshiney days seem to be so blue  
Its over and older the tears seem much colder  
Each passing day I wish I still had you  
My troubles would be all over now if I could only get you off my mind  
And I would give a fortune now if I could only hold you one more time  
Its over and older the tears seem much colder  
Sunshiney days seem to be so blue  
Its over and older the tears seem much colder  
Each passing day I wish I still had you
