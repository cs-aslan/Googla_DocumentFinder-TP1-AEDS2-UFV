Lord please forgive for what I do  
For I know not what Ive done  
  
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do  
I just never had the chance to ever meet You  
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be  
My mothers evil seed and do these evil deeds  
  
Mama had a baby and its head popped off  
head popped off  
head popped off  
head popped off  
head popped off  
head popped off  
But mama dont want me the next thing I know Im gettin dropped off  
getting dropped off  
getting dropped off  
getting dropped off  
getting dropped off  
Ring ring ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors on their front
porch  
Their front porch  
Their front porch  
Their front porch  
Their front porch  
But they didnt want me neither so they left me on someone elses lawn  
Elses lawn  
Elses lawn  
Elses lawn  
Til someone finally took me in my great aunt and uncle Edna and Charles  
Edna and Charles  
Edna and Charles  
Edna and Charles  
They were the ones who were left in charge  
My elementary theyd gang up on me and sing this song  
Sing this song  
Sing this song  
Sing this song  
It went a little something like  
Mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb  
Debbie had a Satan spawn Satan spawn  
Mama why do they keep saying this I just dont understand understand  
And by the way wheres my dad  
  
Chorus  
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do  
I just never had the chance to ever meet you  
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be  
My mothers evil seed and do these evil deeds  
  
Predominately predominately everythings always predominately  
Predominatelywhite predominatelyblack well what about me  
Where does that leave me  
Well I guess that Im between predominately both of em  
I think if I hear that fuckin word again Im a scream  
While Im projectile vomiting  
What do I look like a Comedian to you  
Do you think that Im kidding  
What do I look like some kinda idiot  
Wait a minute shit dont answer that  
Why am I so misunderstood  
Why do I go through so much bullshit  
Its such Bullshit its tush mull bish  
Woe is me there goes poor Marshall again  
Whining about his millions  
And his mansion and his sorrow hes always drowning in  
And the dad that he never had  
And how his childhood was so bad  
And how his mom was a dope addict  
And his exwife how they go at it man  
Id hate to have it as bad as that Mr Mathers  
Claims he had it I cant imagine it  
That little rich poor white bastard  
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank  
And take a bath in it  
Man if I only had half of it  
Shit if you only knew the half of it  
  
Chorus  
  
Evil deeds while I plant these evil seeds  
Please release me from these demons I never  
Had any of this shit planned Mom please believe  
I dont wanna be Satans spawn never got the chance to say Im sorry  
Now look at all the pain I caused  
Dear SantaClause why are you not coming this year again  
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this  
Everything could have been So perfect but life aint a fairy tale  
Im about to be hoisted up in the air  
Forty feet below me theres people everywhere  
I dont even know but who feel like they know me cause Im in this Ferris
wheel  
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hallie on the carousel  
Without this crowd everywhere I go but life is like a merrygoround  
Here we go now dosido now curtains up the show must go on now  
Ringaroundtherosie the shows over you can all go home now  
But the curtain just dont close for me  
This aint how fame was supposed to be  
Wheres the switch I can just turn offandon this aint what I chose to be  
So please God give me the strength  
To have what it takes to carry on  
Til I pass 50 back the baton the cameras on my soul is gone  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Ooh  
Last one baby  
Lets Go  
Detroit
