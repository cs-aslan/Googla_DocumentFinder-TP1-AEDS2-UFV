All the neighbors never see me  
But they wonder why I walk around at night  
he gets hungry  I go hunting  
In the moonlit streets  
For somebody thats right  
  
Fresh blood a sanguinary feast  
Is all hes living for  
And he craves it more and more  
Showgirls businessmen in suits in the midnight rain  
If they walk alone are never seen again  
  
In the paper seems a florist  
Found in Lincoln Park died of some anemia  
No one raped her poor Deloris  
Just detained her and drained her on the spot  
  
Fresh blood a sanguinary feast  
Is all hes living for  
And he craves it more and more  
Old men ladies of the night walking in the rain  
If they walk alone are never seen again  
  
Fresh blood it goes through me flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me cry to me  
Fresh blood it goes through me flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me cry to me  
  
No one calls and no one visits  
Were like a couplet out of Desolation Row  
We dont want them to want to know us  
Cause when they do they get a little bit too close  
  
Fresh blood a sanguinary feast is all Im living for  
and I crave it more and more  
Bad girls cops on the beat in the midnight rain  
If theyre out alone are never seen again  
  
Fresh blood it goes through me flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me cry to me  
Fresh blood it goes through me flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me cry to me  
Fresh blood it goes through me flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me cry to me  
Fresh blood it goes through me flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me cry to me  
Fresh blood it goes through me flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me cry to me cry to me  
Fresh blood it goes through me flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me cry to me cry to me
