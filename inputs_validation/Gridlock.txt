Its 500 PM on a weekday friend  
Theres one of me and two million of them  
The whistle blows and the factories close  
Theres a million more commuters on the access roads  
The brake lights flash theres an RV  crashed  
Im in the passing lane going nowhere fast  
The traffic crawls and the engine stalls  
Im stuck on the edge of the urban sprawl  
  
Gridlock  
Up ahead  
Theres a line of cars as far as I can see  
Gridlock  
Goin nowhere  
Roll down the window let me scream  
  
Oh yeah aint it a shame  
Were all jammed up at the interchange  
The paramedics and the CHP  
Wait impatiently for catastrophes  
Im spending half my days like this  
I might as well be working on the midnight shift  
The radios tuned to the traffic news  
And everybodys choking on monoxide fumes  
  
Gridlock  
Up ahead  
Theres a line of cars as far as I can see  
Gridlock  
Goin nowhere  
Roll down the window let me scream  
I can close my eyes and dream  
I can close my eyes and dream  
I can close my eyes and dream  
  
Its 500PM on a weekday friend  
Im going home but I dont know when  
I hate this traffic and I hate this town  
Gotta honk my horn try to get around  
I feel like going on a killing spree  
Tomorrow Im going on the RTD  
The traffic crawls and the engine stalls  
Im stuck on the edge of the urban sprawl  
  
Gridlock  
Up ahead  
Theres a line of cars as far as I can see  
Gridlock  
Goin nowhere  
Roll down the window let me scream  
I can close my eyes and dream
