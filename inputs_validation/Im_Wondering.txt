Oh baby  
  
Jimmy was your sweetie pie  
Your precious one  
And I knew you used to love  
The very ground he walked upon  
One day Jims papa told him  
Things were looking down  
And they packed up everything  
They owned and left this little old town  
Each tear I dried for you  
The closer our lives grew  
I fell in love its true  
And you say you love me too

A little more than you loved Jim  
  
The day you see his face again  
Or hear his voice  
I dont want to be a loser  
If you have to make a choice  
Like a puppet to a string  
To you girl Im attached  
And I know Id be in trouble  
If he came and took you back  
I feel so insecure  
In my mind I can picture  
Losing you for sure  
And the pain I cant endure
