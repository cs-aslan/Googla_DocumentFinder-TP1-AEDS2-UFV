INTRO G C G DCG  
GNot so long ago just a Cfew years back  
GWe used to hang out down by the Crailroad track  
GThe guitars they played and the Csingers made rhyme  
DIt was a good time for being free G C G C  
  
GBouquet of flowers on her Ckitchen window sill  
GListen to Bob Dylans new stuff Ched just done in Jacksonville  
GLay down on the hillside and Clook up at the sky  
DWe had it all you and I G C G C  
  
GAnd the lives we were living started to Cfeel like yesterday  
GPeople started driftin and Cgoin their separate ways  
GThe wind started blowin and the Csky began to cry  
DYou and I we didnt make it I wished wed never said goodbye  
  
Chorus  
CI hope I never Dsee those eyes Gagain  
CEyes that used to Dbe my best Gfriends  
CAnd we gave it all Daway for the Gdiamonds in the Emdust  
CWith a hungry voice still howlin in the Dwind  
CA heart of stone no Dlonger lasts her Geyes no longer Emcry  
CI know Ill never Dsee those Ctombstone Deyes again G DCG  
CAnd I know Ill never Dsee those Ctombstone Deyes again G  
DCG  
  
Not real sure about this next verse but heres what it sounds like  
GNo more religious message just a Cstory to tell  
GI keep on track on Sunday Cpeace and love heaven and hell  
GIm a mean beat street drifter with the Csun shining from a face  
DAh but that was long ago another time another place  
  
Chorus
