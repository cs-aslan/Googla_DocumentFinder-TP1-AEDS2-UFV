I I was the lonely one  
Wondering what went wrong why love had gone  
And left me lonely  
I I was so confused feeling like Id just been used  
Then you came to me and my loneliness left me  
  
I used to think I was tied to a heartache  
That was the heartbreak but now that Ive found you  
  
Even the nights are better  
Now that were here together  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you oh  
Even the days are brighter  
When someone you loves beside ya  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you  
  
You you knew just what to do  
Cause you had been lonely too  
And you showed me how  
To ease the pain and  
You did more than mend a broken heart  
Cause now youve made a fire start  
And I I can see that you feel the same way  
  
I never dreamed thered be someone to hold me  
Until you told me and now that Ive found you  
Even the nights are better  
Now that were here together  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you oh  
Even the days are brighter  
When someone you loves beside ya  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you  
  
I never dreamed thered be someone to hold me  
Until you told me and now that Ive found you  
  
Even the nights are better  
Now that were here together  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you oh  
Even the days are brighter  
When someone you loves beside ya  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you
