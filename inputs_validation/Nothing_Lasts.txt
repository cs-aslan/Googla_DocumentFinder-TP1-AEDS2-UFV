All the things you think and say  
Float away into space  
Done in thought or done in haste  
They have no place they leave no trace  
All the things you think and do  
Have become a part of you  
All your deeds have come to pass  
Nothing lasts nothing lasts  
Like a river flowing past your windowpane  
Lifes never the same  
Like the sun youre born to set  
Youll die in sin  
And be born once again  
Now you know so damn well  
That your life is a heaven and a hell  
And its very easy to tell  
When youre sick and when youre well  
So the secret to this life  
Is so very easy to learn  
If you ever love another  
Never ask for anything in return  
Like a river flowing past your windowpane  
Lifes never the same  
Like the sun youre born to set  
Youll die in sin  
And be born once again  
All the things you think and say  
Float away into space  
Done in thought or done in haste  
They have no place they leave no trace  
All the things you think and do  
Have become a part of you  
All your deeds have come to pass  
Nothing lasts nothing lasts
