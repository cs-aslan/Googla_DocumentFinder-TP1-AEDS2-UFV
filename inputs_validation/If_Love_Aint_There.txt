Better face the facts ol buddy  
And be prepared to take the blow  
You dont have to sit and study  
Its something anyone should know  
Shake hands get your hat  
And go  
  
You can praise her eyes  
And adore her hair  
But if love aint there  
It aint there  
  
And you can walk her home  
In the warm spring air  
But if love aint there  
It aint there  
  
And you can look  
With a longing in your look  
And try every method in the book  
And worship the smile that kind of  
Took you unaware  
  
And you can weep and sigh  
You can say unfair  
You can almost die of despair  
But if love aint there  
It aint there
