Time goes so fast today  
Dont blink shell go away  
Dont close your eyes  
Not for one moment you feel so good right  
Now you have to stay somehow  
Dont let it slip let time  
Stay frozen  
She needs you  
You need her  
Just like the sun  
Dont think  
That its over  
Its just begun  
Oh mister moon and mister sun  
Our song has only just  
Begun oh mister sun and mister moon  
Dont let these  
Minutes go too soon  
If wishes were for free  
My only hope would be  
To stop the clock  
Lets keep this moment  
I guess thats just a dream  
As hollow as your own moon beam  
So let us revel in our time  
She needs you you need her  
Just like the sun  
It never is over  
Once its begun  
Oh mister moon and mister sun  
Our life has only just  
Begun oh mister sun and mister moon  
Dont let this  
Moment go too soon  
Oh mister moon and mister sun  
Our life has only just begun  
Oh mister sun and mister moon  
Dont let this moment go too soon  
Oh mister moon and mister sun  
Our song has only just begun  
Oh mister sun and mister moon  
Dont let these minutes go too soon
