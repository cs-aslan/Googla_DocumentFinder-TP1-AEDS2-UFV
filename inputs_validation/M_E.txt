And me I eat dust  
Were all so run down  
Id call it my death  
But Ill only fade away  
And I hate to fade alone  
Now theres only me  
  
We were so sure  
We were so wrong  
But theres no one left to see  
And theres no one left to die  
Theres only me  
  
Why shoud I care  
Why should I try  
Oh no oh no  
I turned off the pain  
Like I turned off you all  
Now theres only me
