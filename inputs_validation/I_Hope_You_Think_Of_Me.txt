She wound the thread around the pieces of my broken heart  
Had left me to believe  
That girls dont wanna girls dont wanna leave  
  
The starry nights without a fear of heights  
I cant recall but I learned after all  
That girls dont wanna girls dont wanna fall  
  
As you doze off tonight Ill toss and turn  
As your sweet dreams dissolve Ill crash and burn  
While your heart flutters free I still cant breathe  
As you stir in your sleep I hope you think of me  
  
A blissful way she whispered in my ear  
Before she left had me so convinced  
That girls dont wanna girls dont wanna leave  
  
And Juliets romantic balcony  
Wears out the wall and I learned after all  
That girls dont wanna girls dont wanna fall  
  
As you doze off tonight Ill toss and turn  
As your sweet dreams dissolve Ill crash and burn  
While your heart flutters free I still cant breathe  
As you stir in your sleep I hope you think of me  
  
I feel alone  
I hope my ghost never leaves  
Cause when Im home  
Your painful memory is always haunting me  
  
As you doze off tonight Ill toss and turn  
As your sweet dreams dissolve Ill crash and burn  
While your heart flutters free I still cant breathe  
As you stir in your sleep the thought is killing to me  
  
When I see you around my eyes get wide  
When you race through my mind I die inside  
While your heart flutters free I still cant breathe  
As you stir in your sleep I hope you think of me  
  
I hope you think of me I hope you think of me
