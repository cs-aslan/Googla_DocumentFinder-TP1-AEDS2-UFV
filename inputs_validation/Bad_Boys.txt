I know you you know me  
Im the black sheep of the family  
Im in an out of trouble  
Im the talk of the town  
I get wild in the street  
When the sun goes down  
I steal around like a thief in the night  
Dancing til the break of day  
  
Bad boys  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad bad boys  
Getting wild in the street  
Wild in the city  
I see you you see me  
Just a black street boy in society  
With highheeled women full of champagne an lies  
Getting wild in the street  
Til the hot sunrise  
Stealing round like a thief in the night  
Dancing til the break of day  
  
Bad boys  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad bad boys  
Getting wild in the street  
Wild in the city  
Wild in the city  
Wild in the city  
  
Bad bad boys  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad bad boys  
Getting wild in the street  
Wild in the city  
  
I know you you know me  
Im the black sheep of the family  
Im in an out of trouble  
Im the talk of the town  
I get wild in the street  
When the sun goes down  
  
I dont care what the people think  
I cant hear what the people say  
I steal around like a thief in the night  
Dancing til the break of day  
  
Bad bad boys  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad bad boys  
Getting wild in the street  
Bad bad bad boys  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad bad boys  
Getting wild in the street  
Wild in the city  
  
Undercover of moonlight
