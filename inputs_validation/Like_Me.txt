Drivin down the road again  
A highway that never ends  
Takin naps in my old car  
Singin in guitar bars  
Killin time with cafe queens  
And truckers playin slot machines  
I meet a lot of wannabes  
Dreamin big and livin free like me  
  
Charlie runs the Produce Shack  
Livin in a van out back  
Sellin peas and homemade syrup  
Cantaloupes and Elvis shirts  
Braggin on future plans  
With whiskey breath and shaky hands  
I meet a lot of wannabes  
Dreamin big and livin free like me  
  
Wearin wrinkled travelin clothes  
To another onenight show  
Cause thats where I was born to be  
Have guitar will travel light  
Here today and gone tonight  
Playin this lifetime lottery  
  
Heres to faces I have seen  
A carnival of those who dream  
Rodeos seekin fame  
Table dancers I cant name  
Willie T in Abilene  
Karaokes alltime king  
And every six string wannabe  
Dreamin big and livin free like me  
  
Wearin wrinkled travelin clothes  
To another onenight show  
Cause thats where I was born to be  
Have guitar will travel light  
Here today and gone tonight  
Playin this lifetime lottery  
  
To every dreamer I have known  
May Lady Luck take you home  
I pray for every wannabe  
Dreamin big and livin free like me  
I pray for every wannabe  
Dreamin big and livin free  like me  
  
Livin free like me  
Livin free like me  
Livin free like me
