Gonna raise hell gonna raise hell  
Gonna raise hell gonna raise hell  
Ambition ha  
If all ive heard is true  
Theres nothin much i can do  
To change the world its irreversible  
But in what it lacks  
Its got a taste that smacks of somethin irresistible  
  
Gonna raise hell gonna raise hell gonna raise hell  
Gonna raise hell gonna raise hell gonna raise hell  
  
Submission yes  
Now i wont name names and a secrets a secret  
But a hints a hint or a clue  
You really want to know you really want to go  
Theres only two things you got to do  
  
Gonna raise hell gonna raise hell gonna raise hell  
Gonna raise hell gonna raise hell gonna raise hell  
  
Mother mother  
Mother mother  
Mother mother  
  
My mission ah yes  
Everybody hear everybody here  
Its a fate i all agree  
Sometimes you win i never lose  
To me its no mystery  
  
Gonna raise hell gonna raise hell gonna raise hell  
Gonna raise hell gonna raise hell gonna raise hell  
  
repeat to coda
