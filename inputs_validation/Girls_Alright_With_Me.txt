This little girl of mine  
I wanna say that shes so fine  
And each and every day  
I make sure she has her way  
Now we dont feel tied down  
Although our hearts are bound  
I dont have to chase her all over town  
My baby shes always around  
  
Chorus x2  
The girls alright with me  
You know the girls alright  
  
Now shes so good to me  
I guess thats why I feel fancy free  
Just to see the glow in her eyes  
Makes me once again realize  
I love her with all of my heart  
And I know well never ever part  
I never heard about or caught her playin  
I guess thats why you always hear me sayin  
  
Chorus x2  
  
When I visit at her home  
Other fellas never never ring her phone  
She lets them know just where they stand  
She tells them all that Im her man  
And when were out on a date  
All the fellas wait till I walk away  
They try to beat my time  
She tells them in a nice way shes mine all mine  
  
Chorus
