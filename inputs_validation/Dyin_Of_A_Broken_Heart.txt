Hop up on the table now well take some blood

She called me in the morning and she said now here are the facts  
Well it isnt your liver and it isnt your back

Thats not what killing you  
  
Youre dyin of a broken heart  
It really wasnt very smart  
You lived through Nixon and a drug or two  
Just to get your due  
Dyin of a broken heart
