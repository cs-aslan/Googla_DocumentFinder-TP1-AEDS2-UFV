We will give ourselves no rest  
Til Your kingdom comes on Earth  
Weve positioned watchmen on the walls  
Now our prayers will flow like tears  
Til Youve shared Your heart with us  
God of heaven on our knees we fall  
  
Come down in power  
Reveal Yourself again  
Come hear our cries  
The tears that plead for rain  
  
Chorus  
Were knocking knocking on the door of heaven  
Were crying crying for this generation  
Were praying for Your Word to bear fruit  
In all of the earth  
Were watching watching on the walls to see You  
Were looking looking for a time of breakthrough  
Were praying for Your Word to bear fruit  
In all of the earth in all of the earth
