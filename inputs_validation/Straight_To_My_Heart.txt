Well in a hundred years from now  
They will attempt to tell us how  
A scientific means to bliss  
Will supersede the human kiss  
A sub atomic chain  
Will maybe galvanize the brain  
A biochemic trance  
Will eliminate romance  
But why ever should we care  
When there are arrows in the air  
Formed by lovers ancient art  
That go straight to my heart  
A future sugar coated pill  
Would give our lovers time to kill  
I think theyre working far too much  
For the redundancy of touch  
But what will make me yours  
Are a million deadly spores  
Formed by lovers ancient art  
That go straight to my heart  
Come into my door  
Be the light of my life  
Come into my door  
Youll never have to sweep the floor  
Come into my door  
Be the light of my life  
Come into my door  
Come and be my wife  
Ill be true To no one but you  
If its a future world we fear  
We have tomorrows seeds right here  
For you can hold them in your hand  
Or let them fall into the sand  
But if our love is pure  
The only thing of which were sure  
Then you can play your part  
And go straight to my heart  
If I should seek immunity  
And love you with impunity  
Then the only thing to do  
Is for me to pledge myself to you  
But they only dealt one card  
So for me it is not hard  
Youre the bright star in my chart  
You go straight to my heart  
Come into my door  
Be the light of my life  
Come into my door  
Youll never have to sweep the floor  
Come into my door  
Be the light of my life  
Come into my door  
Come and be my wife  
Ill be true To no one but you
