Chorus  
Its gotta be love  
That keeps us together  
Its gotta be a feeling from the heart  
Its gotta be love  
It must last forever  
Or I wont let the fire start  
Its gotta be love  
  
I dont have time for a part time love affair  
I cant pretend its love when its not really there  
So dont you lead me on if you dont really care  
Its gotta be real  
And I got a feeling  
  
Chorus  
  
I cant just let you take my love and walk away  
And you must know that love is not a game I play  
So when you say you love me  
You better mean just what you say  
  
Its gotta be real  
And I got a feeling
