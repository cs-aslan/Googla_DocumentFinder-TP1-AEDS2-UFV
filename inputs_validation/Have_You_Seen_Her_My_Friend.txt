The day begins with CNN  
And it looks like WWIII  
The forecast calls for freezing rain  
It doesnt matter much to me  
  
The Wheel of Fortune never turns  
Its all insanity  
Have you seen her my friend  
Ive been up all night  
  
Ive been out all day  
Though I try to pretend  
That shes still in town  
And Ill be ok  
  
Till I can hear her footsteps  
Outside my door again  
Ill wonder if shes lonely like me  
Oh no no  
  
Have you seen her my friend  
The dreams I have are troubled dreams  
I thought that I could change  
The winters come inside my head  
  
And its blowing through my brain  
The road Im on wont straighten out  
So here I go again  
Have you seen her my friend  
  
Ive been up all night  
Ive been out all day  
Though I try to pretend  
That shes still in town  
  
And Ill be ok  
Till I can hear her footsteps  
Outside my door again  
Ill wonder if shes lonely like me  
  
Oh no no  
Have you seen her my friend  
And if she calls you  
Say hello  
  
Dont tell her how things are  
The sun may shine tomorrow  
Tomorrow baby  
Maybe tomorrow  
  
I just dont know  
Have you seen her my friend  
Ive been up all night  
Ive been out all day  
  
Though I try to pretend  
That shes still in town  
And Ill be ok  
Have you seen her my friend  
  
Ive been up all night  
Out all day  
Though I try to pretend  
That shes still in town  
  
And Ill be ok  
Cause I can feel her  
I can sense her  
I can feel her everywhere  
  
I can feel her  
I can sense her  
I can breathe her  
  
In the air  
In my world  
I can sense her  
I believe  
  
And I still care  
I can feel her  
And I know shes  
In my world  
  
Shes everywhere  
Shes everywhere  
I can feel her  
Everywhere
