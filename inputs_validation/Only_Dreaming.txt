Oh when the night creeps  
Up over the hillside  
Oh its so quiet up here  
You can hear your thoughts from the inside  
Oh well it took me a while  
To take in the atmosphere  
Dark clouds of evil all around  
  
Youre only dreaming  
Youre only dreaming  
Youre only dreaming  
Youre only dreaming  
  
There is no hooded killer  
No dracula  
No frankenstein  
Oh well its all psychological  
Oh its all in your mind  
  
Oh when a boy  
Wed visit a haunted house  
And there were demons inside  
Of that there isnt a doubt  
And I would hide behind my hand every night  
With fear right there on my brow  
  
Oh I see danger in living  
Im on a runaway train without wheels  
Now Im crawling through a tunnel  
With bloodhounds at my heels  
Everywhere I turn there are screams all around  
Behind trees wolves howl
