Carry me back to old Virginny  
Theres where the cotton and the corn and taters grow  
Theres where the birds warble sweet in the spring time  
Theres where the darkeys heart am longed to go  
  
Theres where I labored so hard for old massa  
Day after day in the field of yellow corn  
No place on earth do I love more sincerely  
Than old Virginny the state where I was born  
  
Carry me back to old Virginny  
There let me live till I wither and decay  
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered  
Theres where this old darkies life am passed away  
  
Massa and misses have long gone before me  
Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore  
There well be happy and free from all sorrow  
Theres where well meet and well never part no more  
  
Carry me back to old Virginny  
Theres where the cotton and the corn and tators grow  
Theres where the birds warble sweet in the spring time  
Theres where the old darkies heart am longed to go
