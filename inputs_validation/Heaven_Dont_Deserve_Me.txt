Im not afraid that when Im dying  
Therell be no one to hold my hand  
If theres a God up there he loves me  
As much as my old women can  
  
I dont intend to be a martyr  
I dont give a damn what people say  
And if I never get to heaven  
Heaven dont deserve me anyway  
  
Ive tasted life both good and evil  
At times I was cruel and did not pay  
And if I never get to heaven  
Heaven dont deserve me anyway  
  
I dont know what it was I came for  
But Ive enjoyed it up till until now  
If theres a friend who ever needs me  
Ill do my best to help somehow  
  
I dont intend to keep no secrets  
I dont give a damn what people say  
And if I never get to heaven  
Heaven dont deserve me anyway  
  
I know and Ill admit my failures  
I dont give a damn what people say  
And if I never get to heaven  
Heaven dont deserve me anyway  
  
And if I never get to heaven  
Heaven dont deserve me anyway
