Humble Daisy  
Form a chain to hold all battleships in check  
Humble Daisy  
Knit a ladder down to natures sunken wreck  
Ragged rug unbound  
Tangle trip the lovers  
Royal barge aground  
Brighter than all of the others on the window sill  
Ill sing about you if nobody else will  
Humble Daisy  
Cast the milk and coins of mornings cash about  
Humble Daisy  
I fell down to heaven as you picked me out  
Well look up together  
Browsing through some old sky  
Sipping in the weather  
Youve got me dizzy the fly that climbed the sugar hill  
Ill lay upon you till somebody else will  
Humble Daisy  
Well look up together
