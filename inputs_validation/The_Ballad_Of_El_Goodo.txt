Years ago my heart was set to live oh  
And Ive been trying hard against unbelievable odds  
It gets so hard in times like now to hold on  
But guns they wait to be stuck by at my side is God  
And there aint no one going to turn me round  
There aint no one going to turn me round  
  
Theres people around who tell you that they know  
And places where they send you and its easy to go  
Theyll zip you up and dress you down and stand you in a row  
But you know you dont have to you can just say no  
And there aint no one going to turn me round  
There aint no one going to turn me round  
There aint no one going to turn me round  
There aint no one going to turn me round  
  
Ive been built up and trusted broke down and busted  
But theyll get theirs and we will get ours if we can  
Just hold on hold on hold on hold on  
  
Years ago my heart was set to live oh  
And Ive been trying hard against strong odds  
It gets so hard at times like now to hold on  
But Ill fall if I dont fight and at my side is God  
  
And there aint no one going to turn me round  
There aint no one going to turn me round  
There aint no one going to turn me round  
There aint no one going to turn me round  
  
Hold on hold on hold on hold on  
Hold on hold on hold on hold on  
Hold on hold on
