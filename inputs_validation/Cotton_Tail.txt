The man who only lives for making money  
Lives a life that isnt necessarily sunny  
Likewise the man who works for fame  
Theres no guarantee that time wont erase his name  
  
The fact is the only work that really brings enjoyment  
Is the kind that is for girl and boymeant  
Fall in love and you wont regret it  
Thats the best work of all if you can get it  
  
Holding hands at midnight  
neath a starry sky  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if you try  
  
Strolling with the one girl  
Sighing sigh after sigh  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if you try  
  
Just imagine someone  
Waiting at the cottage door  
Where two hearts become one  
Who could ask for anything more  
  
Loving one who loves you  
And then taking that vow  
Its nice work if you can get it  
And if you get it wont you tell me how  
  
Just imagine someone  
Waiting at the cottage door  
Where two hearts become one  
Who could ask for anything more  
  
Loving one who loves you  
And then taking that vow  
Nice work if you can get it
