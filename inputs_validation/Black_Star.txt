Every man has a black star  
A black star over his shoulder  
And when a man sees his black star  
He knows his time his time has come  
  
Black star dont shine on me black star  
Black star keep behind me black star  
Theres a lot of livin I gotta do  
Give me time to make a few dreams come true  
Black star  
  
When I ride I feel that black star  
That black star over my shoulder  
So I ride in front of that black star  
Never lookin around never lookin around  
  
Black star dont shine on me black star  
Black star keep behind me black star  
Theres a lot of livin I gotta do  
Give me time to make a few dreams come true  
Black star  
  
One fine day Ill see that black star  
That black star over my shoulder  
And when I see that old black star  
Ill know my time my time has come  
  
Black star dont shine on me black star  
Black star keep behind me black star  
Theres a lot of livin I gotta do  
Give me time to make a few dreams come true  
Black star
