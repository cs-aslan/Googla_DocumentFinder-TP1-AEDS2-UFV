She wore blue  
Her back of blue shoes  
She wore green they wear it anyway  
She and the car  
Went back through the red light  
Stop I forgot all my memories  
I see red when I see you  
Bells ring at 3 Am  
I get mad drinks get spilled  
Five past two I dont feel sad  
But then I see you and I see red  
I cant look down  
Or I might follow you  
I might follow in your footsteps  
I see your shoulder the sun down  
Whats the luck  
And I had to hunt I had to hunt you  
I see red when I see you  
Bells ring at 3 Am  
I get mad drinks get spilled  
Five past two I dont feel sad  
But then I see you and I see red  
dont feel sad  
But then I see you  
Dont feel sad  
But then I see you  
And I see red  
He sees the sun come up and she needs to rest  
Here it comes creeping so close to the bed  
Goodbye to darkness I see your shining face  
Shes always thinking about the facts of love  
I see red when I see you  
Bells ring at 3 Am  
I get mad drinks get spilled  
Five past two I dont feel sad  
But then I see you and I see red
