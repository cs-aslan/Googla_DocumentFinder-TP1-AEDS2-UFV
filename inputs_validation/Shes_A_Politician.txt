A broken mirror and razor blade  
Shes a politician  
Hot headed all the time  
Shes a politician  
  
She doesnt misaccuse  
She doesnt misabuse  
She dont listen even if she doesnt know what shes saying  
Shes a politician  
  
And when it comes to blows  
Shell get you on the ropes  
Shes got you beat you can tell by the company she keeps  
Shes a politician  
  
A broken mirror and razor blade  
Shes a politician  
Hot headed all the time  
Shes a politician  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Shes got you all confused  
With her machine gun talk  
She wont give it cause she knows shes got a lot
