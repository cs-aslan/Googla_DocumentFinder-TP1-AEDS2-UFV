Hey where are you going  
Out  
Out where  
Out to have a good time  
Oh can I go  
Only if youre into it  
Into what  
Twistin  
  
Let me tell you about a place  
Somewhere out in New York way  
Where the people are so gay  
Twistin the night away  
  
Here they have a lot of fun  
Putting trouble on the run  
Man youll find the old and young  
Twistin the night away  
  
Chorus  
Twistin twistin everybodys feeling great  
Twistin twistin twistin the night away  
  
Hit a man in evening clothes  
How he got here I dont know  
But man you oughta see him go  
Twistin the night away  
  
Hes dancing with the chick in slacks  
Shes mvoing up and back  
Man there aint nothing like  
Twistin the night away  
  
chorus 2x  
  
Lean up lean back  
Lean up lean back  
Walk two steps take five  
Now turn now twist  
  
Lean up lean back  
Lean up lean back  
Push in pull out  
Now thrust now twist  
  
Heres a fellow in blue jeans  
Whos dancing with an older queen  
Whos younger than her diamond rings  
Twistin the night away  
  
Man you oughta see her go  
Twistin to the rock n roll  
Here youll find the young and old  
Twistin the night away  
  
chorus 2x
