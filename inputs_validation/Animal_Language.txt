Miss Riley had a dog  
she used to keep it in her backyard  
And when the dog began to bark  
all the neighbors began to shout  
Then came a stormy night  
Miss Riley let her dog out  
And when the neighbors found him round  
they put a gun down his mouth and shot him down  
and he went  
  
Ooohhhwow bowwow  
Ooohhhwow bowwow  
  
Miss Murphy had a cat  
on her lap it sat  
And once in a great big while  
it looked like that Cheshire cat did smile  
But often it used to chase  
anything that crossed its face  
But one day it got so hot  
that Cheshire cat had a blood clot  
and she said  
  
Ooohhhmeow memeow  
Ooohhhmeow memeow  
  
Meow  
  
And then the dog met the cat  
the dog was hot and the cat was wet  
Then came some sweaty dude  
he put a board between the two  
Then they couldnt get at it  
got frustrated all about it  
So they did the only thing you could do  
they took the dudes sweat and shot it up between the two  
and they said  
  
Ooohhhwow bowwow  
Ooohhhwow bow me wow
