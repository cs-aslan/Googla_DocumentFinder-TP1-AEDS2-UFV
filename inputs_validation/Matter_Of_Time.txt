If I could I would tell you why  
The first time I saw her I could touch the sky  
I turned to stone and I could not speak  
She had the ability to make me weep  
  
Always wishing always hoping  
That shell get the message from the bottom of my heart  
Lets together share forever  
Its just a matter of time  
  
I had to wait and just let her breathe  
Thats never been easy for a man to see  
She moved slow and she took her time  
She kept me guessing what was on her mind  
  
Always wishing always hoping  
That youd get the message from the bottom of my heart  
Lets forever be together  
Its just a matter of time
