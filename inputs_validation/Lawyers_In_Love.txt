I cant keep up with whats been going on  
I think my heart must just be slowing down  
Among the human beings in their designer jeans  
Am I the only one who hears the screams  
And the strangled cries of lawyers in love  
God sends his spaceships to America the beautiful  
They land at six oclock and there we are the dutiful  
Eating from TV trays tuned into to Happy Days  
Waiting for World War III while Jesus slaves  
To the mating calls of lawyers in love  
Last night I watched the news from Washington the capitol  
The Russians escaped while we werent watching them like Russians will  
Now weve got all this room weve even got the moon  
And I hear the USSR will be open soon  
As vacation land for lawyers in love
