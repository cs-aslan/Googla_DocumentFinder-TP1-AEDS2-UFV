I was dressed to kill I was ready  
Oh girl I was stepping out yeah  
I was on my way to meet my steady  
When this fire thing turned me right around  
At first I was frightened  
Because he took me he took me by surprise whoo  
But my heart knew that it was a holdup  
I could see the love light shining in his eyes  
Right then I was held up  
Girl I was held up

Yes I was held up
