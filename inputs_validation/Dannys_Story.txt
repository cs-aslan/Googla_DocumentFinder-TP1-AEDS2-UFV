When I was a boy down in South Illinois  
I heard a man playing blues what a wonderful noise  
He had an old guitar but not a dollar to his name  
Making music so sad but he was happy just the same  
He gave me a wink and said son let me share the news  
If you want a happy life youve got to learn to sing the blues  
I asked my daddy for a guitar I begged and I plead  
I said I wanted to play the blues and he just nodded his head  
Daddy said when he was my age boogywoogy was the thing  
Just take the blues a round trip and add a little swing  
Music has the power that without it hed have sworn that hed have never had
met my mom and I wouldnt have been born  
So whats this  
This is psychedelia  
Its where the guitar solo came from  
No I mean what with all the colors  
I have no idea  
  
I kept learning all the powers my guitar had  
I made it go walkawalka till it was so good it was bad  
Just make a face and stop that face you can make that rhythm pump  
So this is the blues just in a way that makes you want to shake your rump  
I can make you clap your hands I can make you do a dance  
If you want to shake your booty my friend youve got to give the funk a
chance  
  
Metal  
Pound your fist in the air  
Metal  
Wave your head full of hair  
Its crunchy and its nasty full of bad attitude  
Your parents will think youre crazy  
Your neighbors will think youre rude  
Believe it or not its all the blues again  
You just add a little fuss and turn your amp up to ten  
Music has the power to change your life forever
