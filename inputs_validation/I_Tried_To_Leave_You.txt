I tried to leave you I dont deny  
I closed the book on us at least a hundred times  
Id wake up every morning by your side  
  
The years go by you lose your pride  
The babys crying so you do not go outside  
And all your work its right before your eyes  
  
Goodnight my darling I hope youre satisfied  
The bed is kind of narrow but my arms are open wide  
And heres a man still working for your smile
