Silver screen such a disgrace  
I couldnt look her straight in the face  
A blue addiction I live in disgust  
Degradation Im being eaten by lust  
  
Chorus  
No bone movies  
No bone movies  
No bone movies  
  
Inspiration thats blue and uncut  
Cant kick the habit obsession of smut  
Voyeur straining in love with his hand  
A poison passion a pulsating gland  
  
Chorus  
  
Flaps  
  
I shouldnt do it the guilt tells me why  
I just cant stop it I try and I try  
X rated demon that lives in my head  
Hungary for bodge and he wants to be fed  
  
Chorus  
  
No bone movies
