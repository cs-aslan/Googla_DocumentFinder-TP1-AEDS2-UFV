Bad luck is doggin me around  
Bad luck is doggin me around  
And I cant change my ways  
Because Ive been made second grade  
  
And its better to have loved  
Loved and lost  
Yes its better to have loved  
Loved and lost  
Its better to have loved and lost  
Than never to have loved at all  
  
No love has come to me and stayed  
No love has come to me and stayed  
But I cant win this race  
But to try to run aint no disgrace  
  
Losin hands have always been my deal  
Losin hands have always been my deal  
Never have drawn drawn the ace  
But when trouble came  
I always looked it in the face
