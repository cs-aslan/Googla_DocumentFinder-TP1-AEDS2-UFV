Used to be a time  
We held the world  
Wrapped round our finger tips  
Laughing at what others missed Someday yesterday  
The magic we felt went away  
Grow up somebody said tell me where its gone  
So I can go find it now I cant live your way  
Go ahead without me  
Ill find my own way  
  
Some people fly and some of us worry about touching  
The sun with wings I know if I try Ill get where Im going  
Keeping my eyes on the sky  
  
The box you live within is strong and its up to you  
To see beyond the comfort zone youve grown to love  
Theres more to life than that The expectations  
That you hold will keep you down and make you old  
If you cant see what Im trying to say maybe you just  
Need to wear my shoes for awhile I cant live your way  
Go ahead without me  
Ill find my own way  
  
Some people fly and some of us worry  
Id risk it all to have wings  
I know if I try Ill get where Im going  
Keeping my eyes on the sky  
  
While you sit there and think about it theres another  
Unfolding their wings I can tell you what its like but  
Until you try youll never see what I mean  
  
Some people fly and some of us worry  
Ill touch the sky with my wings  
I know if I try Ill get where Im going  
Keeping my eyes on the sky  
Keeping my eyes keeping my eyes on the sky
