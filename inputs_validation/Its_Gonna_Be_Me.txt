Hey Jack I better shake it off put her out of my head  
Thinking I balled just another young girl last night  
Oh brother I left a woman in that morning bed  
Been on that trip so many times  
Good God was it really yesterday  
  
Ive tried so many many many many many many ways  
Ive lied and taken off into the day  
Leaving another girl to weep over the breakfast tray  
Loved her before I knew her name hit me Jack cos Im  
Gonna love her way  
  
Come back my babe  
Come back my babe  
Be holy again I gave her  
I gave her maybe maybe  
Maybe gotta give her ooh baby baby baby  
  
That kind of love can only destroy  
I gave her maybe maybe  
Get it down if Im gonna be her baby cos baby  
Gonna be me its gonna be me  
  
There was no rein to check me  
When all of those little things walked on by  
Oh but I couldnt really stammer out a word  
When that angel stuck in my mind  
Looking for love wont hold me back  
No Im gonna love her way  
  
Come back my babe  
Come back my babe  
Be holy again I gave her  
I gave her maybe maybe  
Maybe gotta give her ooh baby baby baby  
  
That kind of love can only destroy  
I gave her maybe maybe  
Get it down if Im gonna be her baby cos baby  
Gonna be me its gonna be me  
  
Just playing that latest record  
Waiting for the telephone to ring  
Wiped out and bitter with a bag clutched in her hand  
All the cars sound like theyre pulling in the drive  
No no no  
  
I see her now a little tear running down her cheek  
Lost let down people looking for me  
I want to race down her street  
And knock hard  
  
Hard hard on the door until  
Until she breaks down into my arms like a  
Treasured toy and I feel her pain  
Ill be so strong again and again  
  
Come back my baby  
Im hold you again Ill take you  
Ill take you baby baby baby  
Baby were gonna have ooh baby baby baby  
  
My kind of love can only bring you joy Im gonna  
Yeah baby baby yeah Ill give you baby baby baby  
Cos its gonna be me its gonna be me
