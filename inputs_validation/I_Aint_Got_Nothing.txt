You know every house has a door and every room has a floor  
Every fence has a gate and every beast has a mate  
Everybody everybodys got something but me  
I aint got nothing  
  
Every stove has a fire and every car has a tire  
Every fish has a bowl and every shoe has a sole  
Everybody everybodys got something but me  
I aint got nothing  
  
Now I dont care about politics and things across the sea  
All I want all I want to do is love  
And have somebody love me I need I need somebody  
  
Every lion has a den and every little pig has its pen  
Every road has a way and they tell me every dog has its day  
Everybody everybodys got something but me  
I aint got nothing I aint got nothing Oh no  
repeat to fade
