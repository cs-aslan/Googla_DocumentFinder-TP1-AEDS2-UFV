Chorus  
Im lookin for a reason to stay  
Im all wound up and tied in knots today  
Im lookin for a reason not to go  
When the morning comes Ill be on my way  
  
Evry night I ask myself again  
Just what it was that made our dream begin  
It seemed like a good idea way back then  
But Im wondrin now what daydream took me in  
  
Chorus  
  
Yesterday I tried once more to find  
A way to share the trouble on my mind  
It seems like you turn away evry time  
I used to like it here I cant remember why
