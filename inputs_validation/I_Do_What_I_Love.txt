Intro  
I do what I love  
I do what I love and I love what I do  
  
Verse 1  
How many times do I need to  
Need to fight you baby  
Just to get that its no good  
And I know that Im strong  
But my minds almost gone  
And its getting on my mood  
And all this buzzing you been doing  
See you got me hanging up  
See you really got me worse  
  
PreChorus  
But I got to move on baby  
Because bitches got to eat  
Got to get back to work  
I cant ask for your permission  
I cant wait for it  
Because I was born free  
I aint taking shit  
  
Chorus  
I do what I love and I love what I do  
Stop me stop me  
Im stopping you  
Get the move right baby Ill show what I mean  
Dont stop me stop me I like how it feels  
I do what I love and I love what I do  
Stop me stop me  
Im stopping you  
Get the move right baby Ill show what I mean  
Dont stop me stop me I like how it feels  
  
Verse 2  
How many hits do you need for  
Me to get it in you  
Get it in you  
And Im strong and my heart  
In my heart it wont change  
For anyone or anything  
And if youre crying about your lover  
Because your lover is a dick  
This will get you over it  
  
PreChorus  
But you got to move on baby  
Because bitches got to eat  
Got to get back to work  
I cant ask for your permission  
I cant wait for it  
Because I was born free  
I aint taking this  
  
Chorus  
I do what I love and I love what I do  
Stop me stop me

Get the move right baby Ill show what I mean  
Dont stop me stop me I like how it feels
