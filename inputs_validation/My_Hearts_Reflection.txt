Got something to say sit down on the bed  
Something that I usually leave unsaid  
It doesnt come so easily I guess thats no surprise  
I wanna see my hearts reflection in your eyes  
Lets lock the door hide the key  
Ill try to look like you if youll dress up like me  
And you play dumb and Ill play too nobody has to know  
I wanna see my hearts reflection in your eyes  
In your eyes  
Lets jump this ship lets cut out  
Lets get into the wagon and drive until the motor falls out  
I want just us two I dont want to have to hide my heart  
I wanna see it in your eyes as we ride on and on
