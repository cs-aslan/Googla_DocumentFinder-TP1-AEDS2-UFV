Shut down  
Fallin over once again  
Dropped out  
Hand extended for a friend  
Looked up  
And theres you lookin in  
And who cares  
Cause no ones lookin anyway  
Impaired  
My vision lost it yesterday  
And thats fine  
Dont mind feelin that way  
Just dont let me lie here by my self  
Lets go  
I know Im faded  
Outta sight  
Tonight  
Just stay with me I dont wanna go home  
Outta sight  
Tonight  
Just rescue me  
I dont wanna go  
Rewind and take me back to start again  
Ducked out cause paranoias settin in  
But Im with you until the end  
  
One ride  
Well drive around the parkin lot  
No pride  
Cause I dont seem to care a lot  
No cash  
This change is all I got  
Just dont let me ride here by myself now  
Lets go  
I know Im faded  
Outta sight  
  
Tonight  
Just stay with me I dont wanna go home  
All right  
Tonight  
Just rescue me I dont wanna go  
So set still  
One last thrill  
Just stay with me and well never go home  
Outta sight  
Tonight  
Just rescue me and well never go home  
Yeah well never go home Yeah  
I dont wanna go  
  
One more ride  
One time once again  
Just climb in  
Im still climbing yeah  
One more ride  
One time once again  
Just climb in  
Im still climbing  
Outta sight  
  
Tonight  
Just stay with me I dont wanna go home  
All right  
Tonight  
Just rescue me I dont wanna go  
So set still  
One last thrill  
Just stay with me and well never go home  
Outta sight  
Tonight  
So rescue me and well never go home
