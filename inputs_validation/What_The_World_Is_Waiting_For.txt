Here comes the wise man  
And there goes the fool  
You see that burnt out world that he is living in  
I dont need to look for the rules  
Here comes the donkey  
Chained to a ten ton plough  
Hell never make that hill in a million years  
Whip crack beating down  
  
He loves his brother but hed sell him for a fistful of gold  
He needs a slave for his vision of the promised land  
No I dont believe a word  
Take me any way the wind blows  
Youll never know just what you want to do  
Or where you want to go i think its time  
That you found what the world is waiting for  
I think its time To get real  
  
Here comes the wise man  
And there goes the fool  
You see that burnt out world that he is living in  
I dont need to look for the rules  
  
Here comes the donkey  
Chained to a ten ton plough  
Hell never make that hill in a million years  
Whip crack beating down  
  
Anytime you want it then its there  
All you gotta do is stop it  
On the corner and ask  
Say hey you dont live today  
Stop the world  
Stop the world  
Im getting off  
Im getting off  
Cant get enough  
Im getting off
