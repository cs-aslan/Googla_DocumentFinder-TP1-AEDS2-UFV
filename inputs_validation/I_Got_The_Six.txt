Living room passing time talking trash sipping wine  
I need something more substantial  
New deck of playing cards I dont like to work this hard  
I think Ill have to cancel  
  
Im running out of time  
Im about to lose my mind  
I got the six  
gimme your nine  
  
Slow hand on the clock Im sitting here like a rock  
Im feeling so abnormal  
Pictures in the magazines all my thoughts are so obscene  
Cover up that centerfold  
  
Im running out of time  
Im about to lose my mind  
I got the six  
gimme your nine  
  
Look at this what a pair she wont let me touch her there  
shes so discriminating  
This is weird its time to blow I just heard the rooster crow  
I guess Ill have to spank my monkey  
  
Im running out of time  
Im about to lose my mind  
I got the six  
gimme your nine
