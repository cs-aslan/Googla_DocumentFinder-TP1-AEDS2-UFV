Raise your hands now to testify  
Your confession will be crucified  
Youre a sacrificial suicide  
Like a dog thats been sodomized  
Stand up All the white boys  
Sit down And the black girls  
Youre the soldiers of the new world  
  
Put your faith in a miracle  
And its nondenominational  
Join the choir we will be singing  
In the church of wishful thinking  
  
A fire burns today  
Of blasphemy and genocide  
The sirens of decay  
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics  
  
Oh bless me Lord for I have sinned  
Its been a lifetime since I last confessed  
I threw my crutches in the river of a shadow of doubt  
And Ill be dressed up in my Sunday best  
  
Say a prayer for the family  
Drop a coin for humanity  
Aint this uniform so flattering  
I never asked you a god damned thing  
  
A fire burns today  
Of blasphemy and genocide  
The sirens of decay  
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics  
  
Dont test me  
Second guess me  
Protest me  
You will disappear  
  
I want to know whos allowed to breed  
All the dogs who never learned to read  
Missionary politicians  
And the cops of a new religion  
  
A fire burns today  
Of blasphemy and genocide  
The sirens of decay  
Will infiltrate the inside  
Yeah
