Lifes good friends are hard to find and now one of mine is dead  
And things I should have said to her I shall say to you instead  
Mona Mona so much of you to love too much of you to take care of Mona
Mona  
You got too big to keep and too damn old to eat  
  
When you where just a football at your mamas side  
I reckon everyone figured you for a barbecue when you died  
And here Im thinking about you lying underground pushing up a pine tree in my
field  
Oh Mona Mona you can close your eyes Ive got a twelvegauge surprise
waiting for you  
  
Since the day she passed away everythings just the same  
Everywhere I go somebody mentions her name  
Sometimes its easiest to tell a friend a lie they dont understand the way I
feel  
Oh Mona Mona so much of you to love too much of you to take care of so
long  
  
Now she is gone and I am left alone as you can see  
But ever since I caused her death I do miss her company
