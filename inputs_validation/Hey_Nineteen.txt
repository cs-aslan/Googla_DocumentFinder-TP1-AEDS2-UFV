Way back when in sixtyseven  
I was the dandy  
Of Gamma Chi  
Sweet things from Boston  
So young and willing  
Moved down to Scarsdale  
And where the hell am I  
  
Hey Nineteen  
No we cant dance together  
No we cant talk at all  
Please take me along  
When you slide on down  
  
Hey Nineteen  
Thats Retha Franklin  
She dont remember the Queen of Soul  
Its hard times befallen  
The Soul Survivors  
She thinks Im crazy  
But Im just growin old  
  
Hey Nineteen  
No we got nothin in common  
No we cant talk at all  
Please take me along  
When you slide on down  
  
The Cuervo Gold  
The fine Colombian  
Make tonight a wonderful thing  
  
We cant dance together  
No we cant talk at all
