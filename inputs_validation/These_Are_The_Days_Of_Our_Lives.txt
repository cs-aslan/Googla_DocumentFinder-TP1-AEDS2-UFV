Sometimes I get the feelin  
I was back in the old dayslong ago  
When we were kids when we were young  
Things seemed so perfectyou know  
Thedays were endless we were crazywe were young  
The sun was always shininwe just lived for fun  
Sometimes ot seems like latelyI dont know  
The rest of my lifes beenjust a show  
  
Those were the days of our lives  
The bad things in life were so few  
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true  
When I look and find I still love you  
  
You cant turn back the clock  
You cant turn back the tide  
Aint that a shame aint that a shame  
Id like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride  
When life was just a game  
No use sitting and thinkin on what you did  
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids  
Sometimes it seems like lately I just dont know  
Better sit back and gowith the flow  
  
cause these are the days of our lives  
Theyve flown in the swiftness of time  
These days are all gone now but some things remain  
When I look and I findno change  
  
Those were the days of our lives  
The bad things in life were so few  
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true  
When I look and find I still love you  
  
I still love you  
I love you  
I still love you  
I still love you  
I still love you  
Still love you
