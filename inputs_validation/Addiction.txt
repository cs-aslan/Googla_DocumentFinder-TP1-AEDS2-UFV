Chorus  
Why everything thats supposed to bad make me feel so good  
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would  
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could  
But You make me smile  
  
Whats your addiction Is it money Is it girls Is it weed  
Ive been afflicted by not one not two but all three  
Shes got the same thing about me but more about us  
Shes coming over so I guess that means Im on drugs  
Just let me peek now I mean damn Im so curious  
Shes got a lover so the lies and the lust is a rush  
Times of the essence I need you to be spontaneous  
Roll up the doge and he aint see youcut the quarter then Im co coming
over  
Cause its never over  
  
Chorus  
  
I see the emotion in your eyes that you try not to show  
We get the closest when you high or you drunk or you blow  
So I pour the potion so we could both get high as we could go  
Then Ill get the lotion and do something to me when your thighs is exposed  
Theres no turning back now I mean I dont mean to impose  
Not now but right now I need you to undress and then pose  
Im into that now catch a vibe when the doors get closed  
Roll up the doge and he aint see youcut the quarter and I keep co coming
over  
Cause its nenever over  
  
Chorus x2  
  
You make me smile with my heart  
  
I just wanted to ask you  
Just wanted to um  
Let how would I put this uhh  
Lets say all your friends  
Remember the one  
You said if you ever she would be the one  
OK OK OK You make me smile with my heart  
I was thinking hypothetically  
I mean dont take this seriously  
Dont take me I mean just  
Uhh not credibly  
Im feeling incredibly  
I mean lets see  
Just maybe  
I mean you are in me You make me smile with my heart  
Maybe baby baby  
You know I was just kidding  
Unless you gon do it  
  
You make me smile
