Sat on a cliff wondering what did I miss  
I watched the waves come in  
Roll in roll out without a single doubt  
Lone on the bluff is there ever enough  
I stare into the air somewhere out there  
The family affair bring home the night  
  
There I know that you turn off the light  
Theeere so slow but you gave me the love of my life  
She gave me the love she gave the love  
  
Coming up short and Im sad to report with us invite tonight  
Your kiss my kiss another day to waste  
Lovers dont miss when they cant even face a plot that has a twist  
To share my Wrayer I need my baby bed  
Come home tonight  
Whoa  
  
There I know that you turned off the light  
Theeere so slow but you gave me the love of my life  
There I know that you turned off the light  
Theeere so slow but you gave me the love of my life  
Love of my life  
  
There I know that you turned off the light  
Theeere so slow but you gave me the love of my life  
There I know that you turned off the light  
Theeere so slow but you gave me the love of my life  
  
There I know that I waited so long  
Theeere so slow but you gave me the love of my life  
Oh she gave me the love of my life  
Tell em Frank go ahead
