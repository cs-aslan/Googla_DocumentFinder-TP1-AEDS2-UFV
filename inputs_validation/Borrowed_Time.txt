Yeah yeah  
Dont look now but here come the eightees  
  
I was so cool back in sixtyfive  
I had it made cause I understood what to do to survive  
I had my car and I made the scene  
Didnt give a damn about no gasoline  
They can go to hell  
My friend we never thought about the world  
And its realities  
The promised land was ours  
We were the Great Society  
  
Im so confused by the things I read I need the truth  
But the truth is I dont know who to believe  
The left say yes and the right says no  
Im in between and the more I learn  
Well the less that I know  
I got to make a show
