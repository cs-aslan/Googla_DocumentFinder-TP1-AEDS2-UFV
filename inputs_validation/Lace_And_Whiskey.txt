I find myself running in circles  
Lost and half insane  
And I need a cure sometimes  
To knock out the pain  
  
So I yell out for some kind of angel  
To come down and rescue me  
Be as soft as you can  
Put a drink in my hand  
Im as scared as I ever could be  
  
Gimme lace and whiskey  
Mamas home remedy  
Double indemnity  
Fills me with ecstasy  
Laaaaace and whiskey  
  
Lots of things I really want here  
Lots of things I really need  
Theres an animal soul inside  
That Ive gotta feed  
My hot mamas feminine body   
Always gets a rise from me  
Shes so soft in my hands  
I give her all she can stand  
Make a full fledged man outta me  
  
Gimme lace and whiskey  
Mamas home remedy  
Double indemnity  
Fills me with ecstasy  
Laaaace and whiskey  
Laaaace and whiskey  
  
I aint hard assd  
So babe dont make me mean  
I want a hot place  
To go and show you things  
  
Gimme lace and whiskey  
Mamas home remedy  
Double indemnity  
Fills me with ecstasy  
Laaaace and whiskey  
  
Ill end up a broken old hobo  
With red and yellow eyes  
Swear and drunk and dyin  
But no ones surprised  
Thats a long long way from today babe  
As far as I can see  
So shake off your shoes  
Go and get me my booze  
Lay your love and your laces on me  
  
Gimme lace and whiskey  
Mamas home remedy  
Double indemnity  
Fills me with ecstasy  
Laaaace and whiskey  
Laaaace and whiskey  
Laaaace and whiskey  
Laaaace and whiskey
