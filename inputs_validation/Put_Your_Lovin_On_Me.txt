Lady oh lady youre  
Driving me crazy  
You brought out the devil in me  
You turned on my fire  
With words of desire  
You sure put the lovin  
Sure put the lovin on me  
  
Youre sending me reeling  
With love that youre giving  
Spinning my poor heart around  
The feelings that should be  
Have finally saved me  
You sure put the lovin  
Sure put the lovin on me  
  
Aint no use in trying  
I never would deny that  
I love you love you  
Aint no doubt about it  
I just cant live without it  
I love you love you  
Yes I love you I really love you  
  
Dont know what it is  
That youre putting down  
I only know it aint no game  
I only know what youre doing to me  
And baby youre the one to blame  
  
Lady oh lady youre  
Driving me crazy  
Youre flying me high  
With your eyes  
Theres no use in trying  
Aint no use denying  
You sure put the lovin  
Sure put the lovin on me  
Yes you did

Sure put your lovin on me  
  
Put your lovin put your lovin on me
