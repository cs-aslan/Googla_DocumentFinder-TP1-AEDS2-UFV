You go to my head till Im losing my mind  
Your beautiful words stretch me out on a blanket of sky  
I dont want to come down no I dont want to come down  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes  
You go to my head I dream I am loved  
Youre flowing through me like a river of poetry  
I dont want to come down no I dont want to come down  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes  
So keep feeding the fire I cant get any higher  
Till the night burns with the fire of a thousand stars  
You go to my head and I know Im alive  
You could waken the dead with your beautiful mind  
I dont want to come down no I dont want to come down  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes  
I dont want to come down no I dont want to come down  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes
