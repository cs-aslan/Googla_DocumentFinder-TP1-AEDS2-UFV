Sing me a song of praise and glory  
Help this wandering child to understand  
That when I close my eyes in sleep eternal  
Ill be clinging to a saving hand  
I want you to sing to me about the rock of ages  
And sing about eternity so sweet  
So that when I take my last breath of life  
Ill awaken at my saviors feet  
I want you to tell me about Paul and Matthew  
And sing about my dear saviors birth  
And tell about his trials and tribulations  
While he walked upon his heathen Earth  
Come on and sing me a song of praise and glory  
Help this wandering child to understand  
That when I close my eyes in sleep eternal  
Ill be clinging to a saving hand  
Ill be clinging to a saving hand
