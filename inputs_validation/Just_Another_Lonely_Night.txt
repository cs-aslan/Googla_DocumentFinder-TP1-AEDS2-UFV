Morning  
Morning  
Seems to come so slow  
Knowing  
Knowing  
How I need this warming glow  
  
Foolishly Ive made you cry  
Confident you never say goodbye  
Darling thats the reason why  
  
That even in a crowd laughing out loud Im lonely  
Lonely  
For I love you only and without you  
Every nights just another lonely night  
  
Falling  
Just another  
Tears are falling from my eyes  
Im calling  
Just another  
Out your name tearful sigh  
  
How I pray its not too late  
All my life for you I wait  
Just call me I wont hesitate  
For when you left you took the best of me  
  
I love you cant you see  
Since youve been gone  
Every nights just another lonely night  
  
Just another  
Since youve been gone my life is so lonely baby baby  
Its just a  
Just another  
Even my sun is hoping  
  
Just another  
Oh its all I need is you only  
Just another  
Im just no good without you baby  
Im just a lonely lonely
