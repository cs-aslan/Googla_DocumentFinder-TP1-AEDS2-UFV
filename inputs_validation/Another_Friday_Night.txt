Gonna cash my check before the drivethrough closes  
Get my baby a couple QuickSak roses  
Put five dollars worth of gas in my pride and joy  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
Gonna take her out to the TastyFreeze then  
Well go dancing at the American Legion  
When ole Bobby does Elvis you swear it was the real McCoy  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
Aw there aint much to do in the onelight town  
But we dont let that slow us down  
If its too quiet we make our own noise  
Now you can bet your boots by the end of the week  
My pretty little girl is ready for me  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
When weve had enough of that shakin and a shoutin  
We go fog up the windows in the Smoky Mountains  
Have more fun than a couple of tourists and a Polaroid  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
Aw there aint much to do in the onelight town  
But we dont let that slow us down  
If its too quiet we make our own noise  
Now you can bet your boots by the end of the week  
My pretty little girl is ready for me  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy
