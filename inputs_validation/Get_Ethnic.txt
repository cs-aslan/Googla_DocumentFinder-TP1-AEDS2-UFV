Rap  
Lying here in the sun just trying to get a tan  
Trying to find a look to go with the plan  
  
Everyones different  
Everyones go their thing  
Spin man give me a rhythmswing swing  
  
You dont have to dance alone  
You get on the floor and make yourself at home  
Do anything you want to do  
Its alright its all up to you  
  
Ethnic chorus  
It doesnt matter what skin youre in  
Baby let the groove begin  
Get ethnicall day  
Get ethnicall night  
gonna chill and ride the day out  
People let me tell you what its all about  
Get ethnicall day  
Get ethnicall night long  
  
Talk  
Walk my way  
Talk my way  
  
This is a new direction  
Were gonna take it to the street  
Spinman throw down a funky beat  
Ooh sweet  
Dont really care where you come from  
You may move to a different drum  
Jump right in and take you place  
Were all part of the human race  
  
Ethnic chorus  
Like you mama do  
And your daddy too  
Its an attitude  
  
Ethnic chorus x 2  
Everybodys different  
And we all have a song to sing  
Spin man do your rhythm thingswingswing  
Spin man do your rhythm thingswingswing  
  
Ethnic chorus  
Seemon seemon baby  
Smooth me out  
Smooth me out  
chant fade
