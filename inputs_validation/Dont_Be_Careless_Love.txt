Burn the midnight lamp  
Down until the dawn  
Ill keep watch until Im sure your coming home  
Shadows play and flicker on the bedroom wall  
They turn into a bad dream overnight  
Something could be terribly wrong  
  
Dont be careless love  
Dont be careless love  
Dont be dont be careless  
  
In my dream youre running nowhere  
Every step youve taken turns to glue  
Walking down a spiral staircase  
Failing through failing through  
  
Dont be careless love  
Be careless love  
  
The lamp burns down and out  
Im getting pretty tired of this  
I feel so bad something might be going amiss  
  
I wont be there so look out for yourself  
Youre getting in deep whatever you do  
Dont let me go back to sleep  
  
Dont be careless love  
Dont be careless love  
Dont be dont be careless  
  
Saw your face in the morning paper  
Saw your body rolled up in a rug  
Chopped up into two little pieces  
By some thug  
  
Dont be careless love  
Be careless love  
But in the morning light  
When I wake up again  
Youre by my side and thats the way its always been  
But in the dark your mind plays funny tricks on you  
Your mind plays funny tricks on you  
Your mind plays funny tricks on you  
  
Dont be careless love
