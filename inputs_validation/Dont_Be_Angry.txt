Dont be angry with me darling if I fail to understand  
All your little whims and wishes all the time  
Just remember that Im dumb I guess like any foolish man  
And my head stays sorta foggy cause youre mine  
  
Well I recall the first time that I flirted with you dear  
When I jokingly said come and be my bride  
Now that time has turned the pages its the sweetest joke on earth  
That I have you dear forever by my side  
 steel   
Maybe someday youre gonna hurt me Ive been hurt in love before  
Only God can know and time alone will tell  
But in the mean time Ill keep loving you with all my heart and soul  
And pray God to let it last if its his will  
  
So dont be angry with me darling if I fail to understand  
All your little whims and wishes all the time  
Just remember that Im dumb I guess like any foolish man  
And my head stays sorta foggy cause youre mine
