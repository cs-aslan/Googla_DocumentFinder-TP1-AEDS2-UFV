Id be lost here inside myself  
Id be nothing without You  
If Your ways didnt pull me in  
Like they do  
  
Chorus  
Its the hope I know the grace you show  
That drawing me closer drawing me closer  
Its the peace I feel its your love so real  
Thats drawing me closer  
  
And my heart beats with pure amazement  
Every time I fell the tender touch of your love  
Drawing me closer  
Tell me how when You hold me near  
I can feel so free  
Where would I be if not for You  
Moving me  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Your love  
I can hear your voice its calling me  
To the shelter of Your arms  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Its the hope I know the grace You show  
Thats drawing me closer  
Its the peace I feel its Your love so real  
Thats drawing me closer  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Your love  
Closer Closer  
Hey hey now drawing me closer  
Hey hey now  
Everybody come and see  
Hey hey now yeah  
Drawing me closer  
Hey hey now
