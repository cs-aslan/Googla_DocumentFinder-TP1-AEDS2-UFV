Youre the one I would pick out in a million  
Youre the one I would wish for as the friend of my life  
If the whole world decided for a colour  
Would pixels be any different in you  
  
Brave and smart against the rules  
You smile upon the fools  
I follow where you go  
I want you to know  
  
Dont stop being crazy  
Wherever you go  
Dont stop being crazy  
Its a lie  
Its a lie  
Its a lie we could not learn to fly  
Oh no  
Dont stop being crazy  
  
When you walk you walk higher than the others  
When you talk you talk merciless the bothering truth  
Everybody seems remotecontrolled nowadays  
Only you have a frequency far beyond their ways  
  
Still and strong you walk alone  
Dont wonder where theyre gone  
Ill follow where you go  
I want you to know  
  
Dont stop being crazy  
Wherever you go  
Dont stop being crazy  
Its a lie  
Its a lie  
Its a lie we could not learn to fly  
Oh no  
Dont stop being crazy
