Here is my heart you can take it  
Theres a time in your life for believing  
That impossible dream in your heart  
When you find in one magical moment  
The one you search for from the start  
On a night like tonight when youre holding me  
I can see in your eyes its you Ive dreamed of  
Here is my heart you can take it  
Love so strong cant be wrong  
Here is my heart please dont break it  
Come what may here Ill stay  
Here is my heart only for you  
If I gave you the keys of a kingdom  
If I dressed you in diamonds and pearls  
It would never compare to the feeling  
We have together right now  
On a night like tonight youre everything  
For once in my life it feels like Heaven  
Here is my heart you can take it  
Love so strong cant be wrong  
Here is my heart please dont break it  
Come what may here Ill stay  
Here is my heart only for you  
Here is my heart now and forever yours  
Making love under the stars  
Paradise is where we are  
Living it up well never stop  
Dancing together  
Round and round and round we go  
Feel the rhythm in your soul  
Nothing is going to stop us  
When were dancing together  
All night long forever  
Here is my heart you can take it  
Here is my heart please dont break it  
Here is my heart you can take it  
Love so strong cant be wrong  
Here is my heart please dont break it  
Come what may here Ill stay  
Here is my heart  
Here is my heart  
Love so strong cant be wrong  
Come on and take it  
Here is my heart please dont break it  
Come on and take it  
Come what may here Ill stay  
Please dont break it  
Dont break it girl  
Ohh here is my heart  
Here is my heart  
Now and forever yours
