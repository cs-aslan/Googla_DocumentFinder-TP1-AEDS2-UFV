Dropping out and getting in the mix now  
Here in the backroom nothing to do  
Were not bored were just sick of you yeah  
Yeah sick of you

Well no hell no  
What you gonna do  
When they keep coming for you

Yesterdays dreams are dead and gone  
Dead and gone  
Hear em cheering up above  
Down below is push and shove  
Yeah push and shove
