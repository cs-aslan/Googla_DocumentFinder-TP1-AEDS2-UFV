Verse 1  
She is the life of the party  
Dont stick that knife in my body  
Its something she always wanted  
Its for a good cause youre doing a good job  
And were off where the wind blows  
And I dont care where we go  
Just like the ocean  
You change what I see  
  
PreChorus  
They dont know what I know  
How long Ive had to hold  
Youre like a commotion  
All because of me  
  
Chorus  
So take it off lets break down all of our walls  
Right now I wanna see it all  
I dont wanna cool off so lets cross the lines we lost  
Right now I wanna see it all  
You were right on the border  
Give me all of this  
Give me all of you  
Dont fall on me  
Dont lean on me

Youre like a movie change the scene  
Taste your sweet profanity  
Its is all for a good cause think youre doing a good job  
  
PreChorus  
They dont know what I know  
How long Ive had to hold

All because of me  
  
Chorus

Right now I wanna see it all

Give me all of this  
Give me all of you

No falling in dont need no proof  
  
Chorus

Give me all of you

Dont lean on me  
You were right on the border
