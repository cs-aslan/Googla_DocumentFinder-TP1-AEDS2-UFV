I own this horse and saddle  
And that old Cadillac  
This broken down horse trailer  
And the clothes that are on my back  
Well I know that it aint a hell of a lot  
But its all that I can show  
  
My wife left me five years ago  
In one of those rodeo towns  
I cant say that I blame her much  
She just wanted to settle down  
Oh god how I miss that woman  
It hurt so to see her go  
If I was smart I woulda stuck by her  
But Im hooked on this rodeo  
  
Chorus  
And Im just a lonesome cowboy  
Im a little bit over the hill  
I shoulda quit this thing a long time ago  
But I guess I never will  
So I keep on movin from show to show  
Hopin to change my luck  
My good ol days are just a memory  
But I just cant give it up  
  
There was a time I used to do alright  
And bring home my share of the dough  
But now Im losin out to the younger boys  
I guess I must be gettin slow  
But theres one thing you learn from this  
You gotta make it on your own  
Cause when your on top youve got a million friends  
But when your down buddy youre all alone  
  
Chorus  
  
My good ol days are just a memory  
But I just cant give it up
