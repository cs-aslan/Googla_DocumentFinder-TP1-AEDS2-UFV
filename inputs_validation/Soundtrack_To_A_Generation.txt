The smell of trees Can only be that way On a sunny day  
Floating through the open window To the cool inside  
Where we lay side by side How can anything we feel Ever  
mean so much As a summer love How can anything we  
need Ever get in touch With the meaning of  
A whole life waiting Wishing suddenly That its going to be  
the real thing Or separating Try your luck again Its just  
part of the adventure  
Holy Cow You do it to me now The Soundtrack to a  
Generation Oh Wow Youre getting to me now The  
Soundtrack to a Generation  
Another tune Before the light has gone And well be on  
our way The sounds and smells Will always linger on  
Theyre in my heart today  
We feel so lucky then The worlds a massive place But we  
run into each other Just one small happening An accident  
of fate Or the work of coconspirators But if we knew  
What could it do To help us now  
Holy Cow You do it to me now The Soundtrack to a  
Generation Anyhow Just give it to me now The  
Soundtrack to a Generation Oh Wow You really got me  
now The Soundtrack to a Generation Holy Cow Youre  
getting to me now The Soundtrack to a Generation  
Years have gone on in between But all I knew at  
seventeen Is all I know now now Through times of joy and  
suffering The music flavours everything Thats all I know  
now  
Holy Cow You do it to me now The Soundtrack to a  
Generation Oh Wow You really got me now The  
Soundtrack to a Generation Anyhow just give it to me  
now The Soundtrack to a Generation  
Just give it Youre getting You do it you really got me now  
The Soundtrack to a Generation Oh Wow Just give it  
Youre getting You do it  
You really got me now The Soundtrack to a Generation  
Oh Wow You really got me now The Soundtrack to a  
Generation
