When youre down and confused  
And you dont remember who you been talking to  
Concentration slips away  
Because your baby is so far away  
  
Well theres a rose in the fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
And if you cant be with the one you love honey  
Love the one youre with  
Love the one youre with  
  
Dont be angry dont be sad  
When you sit down and think about  
All those good times that weve had  
Theres a girl right next to you  
And shes just waiting for something to do  
  
Well theres a rose in the fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
And if you cant be with the one you love  
Love the one youre with  
Love the one youre with  
  
Do doot doot doot doot doot doot doot  
Do doot doot doot doot doot doot doot  
Do do doot Do do doot  
  
Turn your heartache right into joy  
Shes a girl and youre a boy  
Get it together and make it nice  
You aint gonna need no more advice
