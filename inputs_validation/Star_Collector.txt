Think Ill let her keep on going  
Where ever it is shes goin to  
Give her my autograph and tell her  
Its been nice knowin you  
  
Chorus  
Shes a star collector collector of stars  
She only seems to please young celebrities  
Shes a star collector collector of stars  
How can I love her when I just dont respect her  
  
When everything is goin my way  
She wants to be close at hand  
She moves to some other doorway  
When things dont go the way she planned  
  
Shes a star collector collector of stars  
She only seems to please young celebrities  
Shes a star collector collector of stars  
How can I love her when I just dont respect her  
  
It wont take much time before I get her off my mind  
  
Shes a star collector collector of stars  
She only seems to please young celebrities  
Shes a star collector collector of stars  
How can I love her when I just dont respect her  
  
Shes a star collector collector of stars  
She only seems to please young celebrities  
Shes a star collector collector of stars  
How can I love her when I just dont respect her
