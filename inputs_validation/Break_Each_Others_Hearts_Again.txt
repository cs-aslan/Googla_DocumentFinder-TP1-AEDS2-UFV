Do you still drink whiskey  
Can I buy you a round  
If nobodys sitting here do you mind if I sit down  
I was nervous when I saw you  
I almost walked away  
And now I cant believe what Im about to say  
  
Chorus  
These arms want to hold you  
These lips want to kiss you  
These eyes are glad to see you  
Well baby I miss you  
Lets drive each other crazy  
Like we did back then  
Why dont we get together  
And break each others hearts again  
  
Maybe Ive had one too many  
I dont want to say too much  
We both know the reasons  
Why we didnt keep in touch  
Were no good for each other  
Still its hard to let it go  
Im trying to be strong but babe youve got to know  
  
Chorus  
  
Loving you should be the last thing on my mind  
It feels so good to let you hurt me one more time  
  
Chorus
