Just take some loneliness  
And add a tear or two  
Throw in some emptiness  
Mix till youre bluer than blue  
Keep it all under cover  
Next to your broken dreams  
When youre through  
Then youll know how I  
Sit alone and cry  
As the nights go by  
Makes you wanta die  
Cause  
  
Chorus  
Your baby doesnt love you anymore  
Your baby doesnt love you anymore  
  
You try to make believe  
It doesnt bother you  
For your own sake believe  
Youll make it through  
Just make a vow evry morning  
That today you will change  
Your point of view  
But its all a game  
That you play in vain  
And you live in pain  
Cuz its very plain  
  
Chorus  
  
And theres nothin that you can do  
But just break down and cry  
Its over for you  
When  
  
Chorus
