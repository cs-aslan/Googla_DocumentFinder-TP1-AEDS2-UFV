Crusade after crusade  
Defending the faith and the holy light  
I come to your aid  
Fear not my fair maiden fear not  
Im set to attack  
No demons or dragons  
Will hold me back  
Theres strength in my sword  
Fall into my arms and Ill take you back  
  
When the cold wind starts to blow  
Into battle I shall go  
Any tower I will climb  
I can fight you folded blind  
  
I would die for my king and my land  
But I must die  
With my sword in my hand  
Raise my cup in honor of the Lord  
Gives the power I need  
To wield my sword  
  
So much stronger than you  
No power no God cannot heed you  
Youre my sacrifice  
You know in the end  
You must pay the price  
You are my Prey  
I am the slayer the predator  
Youll never grow old  
No armor or sword will save your soul  
  
Clash of lance clash of shield  
In the end you must yield  
Youre a ghost inside my head  
I will see you good and dead  
  
I would die for my king and my land  
But I must die  
With my sword in my hand  
Raise my cup in honor of the lord  
Gives the power I need  
To wield my sword
