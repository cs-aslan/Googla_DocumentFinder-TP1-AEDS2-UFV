You made me leave my happy home  
You took my love and now youre gone  
Since I fell for you  
  
Love brings such misery and pain  
I guess Ill never be the same  
Since I fell for you  
  
Its so bad Its so sad  
Im in love with you  
You love me then you snub me  
But what can I do  
Im still in love with you  
  
I guess Ill never see the light  
I get the blues bout every night  
Since I fell for you  
Since I fell for you
