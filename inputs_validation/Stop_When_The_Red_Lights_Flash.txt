Uncomfortable silence  
Ill kill it if you want me to  
Im like ultraviolence  
Ill kill it if you want me to  
Out of sight out of mind  
Im not the hurting kind  
  
Ill make you surrender Ill make you surrender  
Ill make you surrender Ill make you surrender  
  
Stop when the red lights flash  
Ill trade you blood for dirty cash  
  
Life in the catacombs  
You make me feel like Im at home  
Out of sight out of mind  
Im not the hurting kind  
  
Ill make you surrender Ill make you surrender  
Ill make you surrender Ill make you surrender  
  
Out of sight out of mind  
Just give in one more time  
  
Ill make you surrender Ill make you surrender  
Ill make you surrender Ill make you surrender  
Ill make you surrender Ill make you surrender  
Ill make you surrender Ill make you surrender
