Just one look  
I felt so I I Im in love  
with you  
I found out  
  
How good it feels  
To have your love  
Say you will  
Will be mine  
  
Forever and always  
Just one look and I knew  
That you were my only one  
  
I thought I was dreaming  
But I was wrong yeah yeah yeah  
Oh but Im gonna keep on scheming  
Til I can make you  
Make you my own  
  
Cant you see  
That I really care  
Without you  
Im nothin  
Just one look  
And I knew  
Ill get you some day  
  
Chorus  
  
Just one look thats all it took  
Just one look
