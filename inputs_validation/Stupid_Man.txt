Stupid man hitchhiking out of a good life  
He says Catch you when   
And he thinks hes got big big planes  
Gonna build a house upon some land  
Oh Casey dont it make you crazy  
Oh when youre living all alone by that damp water  
Oh Casey dont it make you crazy  
When youre living all alone by those still waters  
Please say hello please say hello  
To my little baby daughter  
Oh Casey tell her that her fathers gonna be coming home  
So soon so soon to see her  
Well Im shooting down the turnpike  
With a driver doing ninetyfive or maybe more  
Dont you think hes loaded drunk  
Or the many things that lifes are for  
Oh Casey oh Casey dont you know  
Ill make you so damn crazy  
Living all alone by those waters  
But please say hello  
But please say hello to my little baby daughter  
Please please wont you just give her a great big kiss  
And tell her daddy stupid daddy will be coming home soon  
Oh Casey oh Casey dont you know I make me so damn crazy

But please tell please tell my baby baby baby daughter
