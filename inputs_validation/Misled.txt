I thought I knew you  
Thought that I knew you well  
We had a rhythm  
But I guess you never can tell  
  
Oh I learned early  
Never to ignore the signs  
Youll be forgiven  
It aint worth that much to my mind  
  
Lovin you so easy  
Its hard to say goodbye  
But if its the way it goes it goes  
  
Just a page in my history  
Just another one of those mysteries  
One more lover that used to be  
If you think youre in my head  
You been seriously misled  
  
Loving somebody aint your average nine to five  
It takes conviction it takes a will to survive  
Im not somebody who commits the crime  
And leaves the scene  
But when Ive been dissed  
I dont spend much time on what mightve been  
Im not about selfpity  
Your love did me wrong  
So Im movin movin on  
  
Just a page in my history  
Just another one of those mysteries  
One more lover that used to be  
If you think youre in my head  
You been seriously misled
