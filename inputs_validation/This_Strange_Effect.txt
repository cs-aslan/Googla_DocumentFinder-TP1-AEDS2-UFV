Chorus x2  
Youve got this strange effect on me  
And I like it  
  
You make my world in white  
You make my darkness bright oh yes  
Youve got this strange effect on me  
And I like it and I like it  
  
And I like the way you kiss me  
Dont know if I should  
But this feeling its love and I know it  
Thats why I feel good  
  
Chorus x2  
  
You make my world in white  
You make my darkness bright oh yes  
Youve got this strange effect on me  
And I like it and I like it
