We are all living for the game for the game  
Oh heaven is weeping  
We are all living for the game for the game  
Oh heaven is weeping  
Please dont let my memory fail me now  
Cause Ive waited all this time and I cant run another mile  
Another mile  
Oh please dont let the world know now  
Please dont let the world know now  
We are all living for the game for the game  
Oh heaven is weeping  
We are all living for the game for the game  
Oh heaven is weeping
