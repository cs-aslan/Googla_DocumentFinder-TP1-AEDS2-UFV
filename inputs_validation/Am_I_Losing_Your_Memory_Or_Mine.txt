Did I wake up this mornin thinkin of you  
Am I losin your memory or mine  
Do I remember makin coffee for two  
Am I losin your memory or mine  
  
I know that youre gone and Im almost alone  
Were just about over it this time  
Hon am I losing your memory or mine  
  
Ive misplaced my favorite picture of you  
Am I losing your memory or mine  
Was it accidental or did I really want to  
Am I losing your memory or mine  
  
I dont know myself but memory is late  
For they both had a long uphill climb  
Oh am I losing your memory or mine  
  
Am I comin or going am I doin all right  
Am I gainin or fallin behind  
Im beginnin to wonder if I ever loved you  
And am I losing your memory or mine  
  
Ill get over you oh but I really dont want to  
But Im losing your memory or mine
