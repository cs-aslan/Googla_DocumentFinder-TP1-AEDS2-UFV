Well Ive been on the road  
For a year or more  
And Ive done a lot of things  
I never did before  
Now I want everyone  
To listen to my song  
And you can tell me  
When youve heard it  
If you think Im wrong  
  
Cause Im so tired  
Of everybody staring at me  
Yes Im so tired  
And Im so uninspired  
Please help me  
  
Well Ive seen em rise  
And Ive seen em fall  
And I use to think that  
I was having a ball  
But I was kiddin myself  
For a long long time  
But now I got myself a spoon  
And Im feeling fine  
  
But Im so tired  
Of everybody staring at me  
Yes Im so tired  
And Im so uninspired  
Wont you please help me  
  
Where can you go  
Where can you go  
When there is no one  
To show a guiding light  
What did you say  
What did you say  
Have you been thinking about me  
Day and night  
  
Cause Im so tired  
Of everybody staring at me  
And Im so so tired  
Im so uninspired  
Please help me  
Wont you please me
