When I was a boy  
There was no limit on what I could eat  
Shake after shake after shake after shake  
Followed by all kinds of red meat  
Metabolism runnin around so fast  
My body never gained no weight  
That pissed off all my Mommas friends  
And made my bigboned sister irate  
But now Im a man  
And all that food frolicking has caused my ego to hurt  
Cause even when Im in the shower alone  
Im too embarrassed to remove my shirt  
What made a millionaire out of Mr FritoLay  
Made a fat motherfucker outta me  
What made a millionaire out of Mr FritoLay  
Made a fat motherfucker outta me  
And all them cookies I been munching lately  
My feets are becoming difficult to see  
I believe it was my Daddy  
Who led to this eating disease  
By calling me The Little Candyass  
When I couldnt finish a burger with cheese  
Or maybe it was my Momma  
Who got me addicted to the wrong foods  
Only when I gobbled down every chicken cutlet  
Would I get to see Mommas good moods  
They said eat this they said eat that  
To stay skinny there was no chance  
And now when I walk I hear corduroy  
Even though I aint wearing pants  
What made a millionaire out of Mr FritoLay  
Made a fat motherfucker outta me  
You fat fuck you fat fuck  
What made a millionaire out of Mr FritoLay  
Made a fat motherfucker outta me  
You fat fuck you fat fuck  
And all that ice cream I been eatin lately  
My chins alone weigh 203  
The diet starts tomorrow  
I have a grapefruit for breakfast  
For lunch a bowl of white rice  
Dinnertime its a saltless potato  
I aint allowed no spice  
If this diets gonna work  
Tonight I cant eat no more  
Just go to sleep I say to myself  
As I close the bedroom door  
Two in the morning I wake up to piss  
My bellys hungry and achin  
Tiptoe to the kitchen fuck the diet  
Bring on the chips flavored with bacon  
What made a millionaire out of Mr FritoLay  
Made a fat motherfucker outta me  
What made a millionaire out of Mr FritoLay  
Make a tub o shit outta me  
And all them crumbcakes I been eating lately  
I shoulda bought stock in Sara Lee
