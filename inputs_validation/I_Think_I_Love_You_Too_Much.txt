Im not alone sitting right there  
How come I get the feeling youd vanish into the air  
I love you more than anybody else babe  
Cant you tell Im an easy touch  
Baby baby I think I love you too much  
If I picked you up oh youd slip right away  
If I locked you up youd find a way to make me pay  
Youre gonna hurt me more than anybody else babe  
Cant you tell Im an easy touch  
Baby baby I think I love you too much  
  
Guess Im gonna get you what you want  
Cause Im so into you  
You dont even give an inch to me baby  
Though Ive been giving you a mile or two  
  
Im not alone sitting right there  
How come I get the feeling youd vanish into the air  
I love you more than anybody else babe  
Cant you tell Im an easy touch  
Baby baby I think I love you too much  
If I picked you up oh youd slip right away  
If I locked you up youd find a way to make me pay  
Youre gonna hurt me more than anybody else babe  
Cant you tell Im an easy touch  
Baby baby I think I love you too much  
  
Baby baby I think I love you too much repeat
