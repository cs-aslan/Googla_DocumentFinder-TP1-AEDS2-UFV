You keep comin to me tryin to look inside my mind well what you see  
Are you wonderin if youre in there well you are but baby you got company  
Im not looking for a place to go when Ill leave I wont be coming back no
more  
Im more like a circus show I pitch my tent and then Ill go  
So git in line at least one time  
  
Im not just a side show either step up front but dont just stand and stare  
Yeah Im the main attraction but understand Ill sell my tickets anywhere  
Im not looking for a place to go  
  
You keep comin to me tryin
