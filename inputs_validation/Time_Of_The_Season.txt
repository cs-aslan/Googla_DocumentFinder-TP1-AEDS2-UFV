Its the time of the season  
When the love runs high  
In this time give it to me easy  
And let me try  
With pleasured hands  
  
To take you and the sun to  
Promised lands  
To show you every one  
Its the time of the season for loving  
  
Whats your name

Whos your daddy

Is he rich like me  
  
Has he taken

Any time  
Any time to show  
To show you what you need to live  
Tell it to me slowly  
Tell you what  
I really want to know  
Its the time of the season for loving  
  
Whats your name

To show you what you need to live  
Tell it to me slowly  
Tell you what
