kirsty maccoll  
Youve been around for such a long time now  
Or maybe I could leave you but I dont know how  
And why should I be lonely every night  
When I can be with you oh yes you make it right  
  
And I dont listen to the guys who say  
That youre bad for me and I should turn you away  
Cause they dont know about us  
And theyve never heard of love  
  
I get a feeling when I look at you  
Wherever you go now I want to be there too  
They say were crazy but I just dont care  
And if they keep on talkin still they get nowhere  
  
So I dont mind if they dont understand  
When I look at you and you hold my hand  
Cause they dont know about us  
And theyve never heard of love  
  
Why should it matter to us if they dont approve  
We should just take our chances while weve got nothing to lose  
  
Baby  
Theres no need for living in the past  
Now I found good loving gonna make it last  
I tell the others dont bother me  
Cause when they look at you they dont see what I see  
  
No I dont listen to their wasted lines  
Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs  
But they dont know about us  
And theyve never heard of love  
  
No I dont listen to their wasted lines  
Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs  
But they dont know about us  
And theyve never heard of love
