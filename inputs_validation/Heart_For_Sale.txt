Ive got a heart for sale  
Its a little worn and torn and pale  
If it beats then Ill make you a deal  
Ill give it to you for free  
If you can love it carefully  
And get it away from me  
  
Chorus  
I know that I  
Should keep it for a while  
And learn what it  
May need to survive  
But I cant no I wont  
Make it through  
One more loveless bruise  
  
I cant seem to get it right  
But I try and try and try  
In the end I just lose all the fights  
And crawl back home to hope my heart  
Can make it through  
Another night of the same Oh pain  
  
Chorus  
I know that I  
Should keep it for a while  
  
And learn what it  
May need to survive  
But I cant No I wont  
Make it through One more loveless bruise  
  
Bridge  
Ill give you a try  
If your not satisfied  
Then send it back  
And Ill mend the cracks  
And Ill look for another buyer  
  
Chorus  
I know that I  
Should keep it for a while  
And learn what it needs to survive  
But I cant No I wont  
Make it through  
One more loveless bruise  
  
Tired of being used  
You dont know What Ive been through
