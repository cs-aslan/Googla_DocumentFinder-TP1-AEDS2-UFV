Molly Brown waits for me  
In a little onehorse town  
And Boley Oklahoma  
Where white folks dont come around  
Im thinkin about you Molly  
Im forbidden to come round  
Lord knows I love you Molly  
Molly Brown  
Molly Brown Molly Brown  
Lay down by my side  
Show me how you spread your wings  
And let that pony ride  
Im crazy about you Molly  
I dont care that your skin is brown  
Lord knows I need you Molly  
Molly Brown  
Molly Brown  
Oh Molly Brown  
We met down by the river  
She wore her wedding gown  
I never saw it coming  
And no one heard the sound  
My daddy used both barrels  
And left me there to drown  
Lord knows Id die for Molly  
Molly Brown  
Molly Brown Molly Brown  
Dont you weep for me  
Im going to a place the Lord  
Prepared for you and me  
Ill meet you up in Heaven  
Upon that Holy ground  
Ill be waitin for you Molly  
Molly Brown  
Molly Brown Molly Brown Molly Brown  
Lord Ill be waitin up in Heavenly  
My sweet little brown Molly Brown
