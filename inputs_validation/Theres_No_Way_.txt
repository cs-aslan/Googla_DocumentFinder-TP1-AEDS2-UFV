As I lay by your side and hold you tonight  
I want you to understand this love that that I feel  
Is so right and so real I realize how lucky I am  
And to you ever wonder if my love is true  
There is something that I want to make clear with you  
  
Theres no way I could make it without you  
Theres no way that Id even try  
If I had to survive without you in my life  
I know I wouldnt last a day oh baby theres no way  
  
It means so much to me whenever I see that wanting me look in your eyes  
I dont know how I could do without holding you close every night  
Ive waited so long just to have you to hold  
Now that Ive got you Ill never let go  
  
Theres no way I could make it without you  
Theres no way that I d even try  
If I had to survive without you in my life  
I know I wouldnt last a day oh baby theres no way  
  
I never knew what to do what I was missin  
Now you say forever I find my heart is listenin yes Im listenin  
  
Theres no way I could make it without you  
Theres no way that I d even try  
If I had to survive without you in my life  
I know I wouldnt last a day oh baby theres no way
