Nowadays people want more more and so do I  
My brother told me once  
You always wnat what you dont have  
But take a look at all the things you do have  
So the reason why I wrote this song  
Was to express what I think is wrong  
Id like to be just a little bit taller  
Id like to be just a little bit prettier  
Id like to be just a little bit stronger  
But hey whatever  
Chorus  
Dont always want what you dont have  
But be grateful for what you have  
Dont always want what you dont have  
But be grateful for what you have  
Well you can call me the consumator  
Cause I never stop  
Feeding myself with all these obstacles untill I drop  
I want a house a fat cat my own sauna and a pool  
Have a yacht my own piano and finally be cool  
Im like that kid screaming to his mama I want that toy  
Cause my filled room at home no longer gives me that joy  
And I dont recommend myself as someone to employ  
Cause I want it all  
Chorus  
I want the world just to leave me alone  
Wanna move to New York and learn the saxophone  
I wanna jam with Miles Davis and John Coltran  
Ive got so many wishes I think Im going insane  
But what the hell am I supposed to do  
Cause Im trying real hard to undo all the emptiness inside me  
Which is why I want so much  
Chorus
