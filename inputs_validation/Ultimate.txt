Youre the kind of friend who always bends when Im broken  
Like remember when  
You took my heart and put it back together again  
Ive been wasting time with clueless guys  
But now its over  
Let me tell you why Im through  
Ive meet someone new  
Whos just like you  
But youre it  
Youre the ultimate  
Its automatic  
Im sure of it  
No lie  
So dont even try  
To tell me that youre not the guy  
Cause Ive been waiting all my life  
For someone just like you  
But youre it  
Youre the ultimate you  
Youre the kind of guy whos hands and mind  
Send shivers up and down my spine  
You took my heart and put it back together again  
Youre the kind of guy that blows my mind  
But now its my turn  
Youve been right in front of me  
Everything I need  
Why didnt I see  
Youre it  
Youre the ultimate  
Its automatic  
Im sure of it  
No lie  
So dont even try  
To tell me that youre not the guy  
Cause Ive been waiting all my life  
For someone just like you  
But youre it  
Youre the ultimate you  
Youre it  
Youre the ultimate  
Its automatic  
Im sure of it  
No lie  
So dont even try  
To tell me that youre not the guy  
Youre it  
Youre the ultimate  
Its automatic  
Im sure of it  
No lie  
So dont even try  
To tell me that youre not the guy  
Cause Ive been waiting all my life  
For someone just like you  
But youre it  
Youre the ultimate you  
Youre it  
Youre the ultimate you
