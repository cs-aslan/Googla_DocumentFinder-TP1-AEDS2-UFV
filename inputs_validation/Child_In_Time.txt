Sweet child in time  
Youll see the line  
The line thats drawn between  
Good and bad  
  
See the blind man  
Shooting at the world  
Bullets flying  
Ohh taking toll  
  
If youve been bad  
Oh Lord I bet you have  
And youve not been hit  
Oh by flying lead  
  
Youd better close your eyes  
Ooohhhh bow your head  
Wait for the ricochet  
  
Oooooo ooooooo ooooooo  
Oooooo ooooooo ooooooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
  
Oooooo ooooooo ooooooo  
Oooooo ooooooo ooooooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
  
Aaaahh aaaahh aaaahh  
Aaaahh aaaahh aaaahh  
Aahh aahh aahh  
Aah I wanna hear you sing
