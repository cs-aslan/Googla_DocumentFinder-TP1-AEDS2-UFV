Turn around you say  
Scuse the tude but I havent eaten today  
And my eyes are turning gray  
Whats your name  
I cant remember I cant remember  
Bring me down you try  
Feel the pain and keep it all in till you die  
Without eyes you cannot cry  
Whos to blame  
  
I cant rememberI cant  
Remember identity the visions in my mind from  
Screamin at me  
And mama mama ooh my angry brains of infancy  
Knocked down but I have enough hate to breathe  
down your throat and steal your energy  
You took everything but my will to be  
Now the loss of your god wont make me bleed  
I am alive
