No tricks  
Up my sleeve  
I kicked the downs  
And now Im clean  
No shakes  
Up my spine  
I beat the speed and I  
Dumped the wine  
No tracks  
That was yesterday  
I changed my style  
The way I play  
Dont you believe it  
No blues  
No depression  
No more panic  
Or obsession  
Dont you believe  
Anything he said  
All them junkies talk that way  
Its just as bad as it was before  
I see the man knockin at his back door  
 this kids straight  
And put on ice  
The street corner deals at any price  
Come on and check my veins  
And check my eyes  
No tracks  
That was yesterday  
I changed my style  
The way I play  
Dont you believe it  
No blues  
No depression  
No more panic  
Or obsession  
Some tricks  
Just go away  
And other tricks  
Theyre here to stay  
Oh dont you know me  
Sometimes my spirits willin  
The flesh is weak and  
Thats whats killin  
Dont you believe  
Anything he said  
All them junkies talk that way  
Its just as bad as it was before  
I see the man knockin at his back door  
Hey now this kids straight  
Put on ice  
The street corner deals at any price  
Come on and check my veins  
And check my eyes  
I tried so hard  
But Im hurting for another fix  
Its just this habit  
I I can always kick  
What do you say there friend  
Dont you call me  
Its just a game  
And I can beat it any day  
No matter what this lovely lady say  
Hey want to be my friend  
Some tricks  
They go away  
And other tricks  
Theyre here to stay  
Oh dont you know me  
Sometimes my spirits willin  
My flesh is weak and  
Thats whats killin  
Dont you believe  
Anything he said  
All them junkies talk that way  
Its just as bad as it was before  
I see the man knockin at his back door  
I said this kids straight  
And put on ice  
The street corner deals at any price  
Come on and check my veins  
And check my eyes
