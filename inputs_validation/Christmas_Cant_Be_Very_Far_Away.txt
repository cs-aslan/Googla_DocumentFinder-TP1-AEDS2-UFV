Little bits of heaven  
Floating gently by the window  
Soon this dirty city will be  
Covered with a new snow  
  
Lets put on our winter boots  
Go outside and play  
Christmas cant be very far away  
  
Weather girl says bundle up  
Its gonna be a cold one  
Ill put on my wooly hat  
Youll wear your dads old Stetson  
  
Pretty lights are everywhere  
Shining night and day  
Christams cant be very far away  
  
Lets take a walk downtown and  
Go dream shopping in the mall  
The kids can do the Santa thing  
Photographs and all  
  
Well get the biggest tree this year  
And trim it to the top  
And spend a whole lot more  
Than what weve got  
But so what  
  
Come next spring  
I know we will be  
Ready for the sunshine  
Right now throwin snowballs  
At each others such a fun time  
  
Kids will think were crazy  
For awhile and thats okay  
Christmas cant be very far away  
Christmas cant be very far away
