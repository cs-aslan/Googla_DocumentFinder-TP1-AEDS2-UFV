My brother sarah  
Doesnt know what clothes to wear  
Its a dilemma  
To get the stuff to match your hair  
  
But mother and father  
Sister and brother  
Say they just dont know  
  
My brother sarah  
Really wish you understood  
Why hes got to show it  
For it to be any damn good  
  
But mother and father  
Sister and brother  
Say they just dont know  
  
My brother lies awake at night  
Wishing this world could just be right  
  
But mother and father  
Sister and brother  
You and all the others  
Say you just dont know
