Hana steps out of a storm  
Into a strangers warm but  
Hardup kitchen  
She sees what must be done  
So she takes off her coat  
Rolls up her sleeves  
And starts pitchin in  
  
Hana has a special knack  
For getting people back on the right track  
Cause she knows  
They all matter  
So she doesnt argue or flatter  
She doesnt fight the slights  
She takes it on the chin  
Like a champ  
  
Hana says when lifes a drag  
Dont cave in  
Dont put up a white flag  
Raise up  
A white banner  
In this manner  
Straighten your back  
Dig in your heals  
And get a good grip on your grief  
  
Hana says Dont get me wrong  
This is no simple Sunday song  
Where God or Jesus comes along  
And they save ya  
Youve got to be braver than that  
You tackle the beast alone  
With all its tenacious teeth  
Light the lamp
