Im just a city boy  
But theres a small town side to me  
And I feel it closin in  
  
Are we too blind to see  
That shes diein more each day  
And shes cryin out to you and me  
  
Chance is comin when thier gone  
They curse a fool who waits too long  
So lets take care of what we have  
Before the good we know goes bad  
And the beauty fades and just slips away  
  
The dirty air and the diein seas  
Will this be the world we leave  
To the wild and young  
And say just look at what weve done  
  
And right before our eyes  
Todays yesterday could be tomorrows goodbye  
  
Here comes the rain it might wash her tears away  
But it doesnt change a thing  
Like my brother before me  
All I can do is write this song and for her I sing  
  
Chance is comin when were gone  
They carve in stone what weve done wrong  
So lets take care of what we have  
Before the good we know goes bad  
And the beauty fades and just slips away  
  
The dirty air and the diein seas  
Will this be the world we leave  
To the wild and young  
And say just look at what weve done  
  
And right before our eyes  
Todays yesterday could be tomorrows goodbye  
  
Do you ever think about the future or the past  
Do you ever wonder how long this world will last  
  
So lets take care of what we have  
Before the good we know goes bad  
And the beauty fades and just slips away  
  
The dirty air and the diein seas  
Will this be the world we leave  
To the wild and young  
And say just look at what weve done  
  
And right before our eyes  
Now its right before our eyes  
Todays yesterday will be tomorrows goodbye
