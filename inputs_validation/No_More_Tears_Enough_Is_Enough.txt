Barbra Streisand  
Its raining its pouring  
My lovelife is boring me to tears after all these years  
  
Donna Summer  
No sunshine no moonlight no stardust no sign of romance  
We dont stand a chance  
  
Barbra  
Ive always dreamed I found the perfect lover  
But he turned out to be like every other man  
Our love our love  
  
Both  
Raining raining  
Pouring pouring  
Theres nothing left for us here  
And we wont waist another tear  
  
Donna  
If youve had enough dont put up with his stuff dont you do it  
  
Barbra  
If youve had your fill get the check pay the bill you can do it  
  
Donna  
Tell him to just get out  
  
Barbra  
Nothing left to talk about  
  
Donna  
Pack his raincoat show him out  
  
Both  
Just look him in the eye and simply shout  
Enough is enough  
I cant go on I cant go on no more no  
Enough is enough  
I want him out I want him out that door now  
  
Enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
Thats enough  
  
Donna  
If youve reached the end dont pretend that is right when its over  
  
Barbra  
Its over  
If the feeling is gone dont think twice just move on get it over  
  
Donna  
Over over  
  
Both  
Tell him to just get out say it clearly spell it out  
Enough is enough is enough  
I cant go on I cant go on no more no  
Enough is enough is enough  
I want him out I want him out that door now  
  
Enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
Thats enough  
  
Barbra  
Ive always dreamed to find the perfect lover  
But he turns out to be like every other man  
Our love I had no choice from the start  
Our love Ive gotta listen to my heart  
Our love Tearing us apart  
  
Enough is enough is enough  
I cant go on I cant go on no more no  
Enough is enough is enough  
I want him out I want him out that door now  
  
Enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
Thats enough  
  
Both  
No more tears No more tears  
No more tears No more tears  
No more tears No more tears  
No more tears No more tears  
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough  
Ive had it youve had it hes had it weve had is  
  
Donna  
I always dreamed I find the perfect lover  
  
Barbra  
But he turned out to be like every other man  
  
Both  
I had no choice from the start  
Ive gotta listen to my heart  
Tearing us apart  
  
Enough is enough is enough  
I cant go on I cant go on no more no  
Enough is enough is enough  
I want him out I want him out that door now  
  
Goodbye mister goodbye goodbye mister  
Goodbye sugar  
  
Its raining its pouring  
Theres nothing left for us here  
And we wont waist another tear  
  
No more tears  
Is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough  
Is enough
