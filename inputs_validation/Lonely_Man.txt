So lonely Im a lonely man from Gainesville  
He aint got nowhere to go got nowhere to go  
Said I dont want doin wrong over this land  
Yes his blood is growin cold cold gettin colder  
  
Yeah I believe that all the people on the street  
Take the time time to stare  
Not lonely in their eyes for thinkin that Im nowhere  
Lord I wasnt born wasnt born to wander aimlessly  
Lord it cant be  
I dont want it to be my destiny  
Lord woman come an help me  
  
Oh I wish that I could find me a turkey  
all he needs is good sweet love  
Yeah gotta go quack quack  
Oh baby I would know in my heart I would be lucky  
Thats the only way to go  
Yeah be fine  
  
Yeah I wanna tell you that all the people on that street  
They take the time to stare  
I can see in their eyes for thinkin that Im nowhere  
Lord I wasnt born wasnt born to wander round aimlessly  
Cant be cant be  
Dont want it to be my destiny Lord take ahold of me  
  
Sure dont wanna be a lonely man
