Strolling down the highway  
Im gonna get there my way  
Just keep on downawalking  
You hear my guitar rocking  
Well I stroll  
On down  
On down the highway  
  
People think Im a crazing  
Lot about how theyrealazing  
Sunshines all day long  
Narcotics far too strong  
Well I stroll  
On down  
On down the highway  
  
Cars wont stop for no one  
But dont you think that youre just rolling down  
Think you are a spy  
Gonna shoot them as they go by  
Well no cars  
No cars  
Wont stop for no one  
  
Strolling down the highway  
Im gonna get there my way  
Just keep on downawalking  
You hear my guitar rocking  
Well I stroll  
On down  
On down the highway
