It wasnt very long ago  
I met youI saw you  
It wasnt very long ago  
You whispered I love you  
  
Look at us now  
Crying our hearts out through the night  
Trying to remember what love was like although  
  
It wasnt very long ago  
I thrilled when I kissed you  
It wasnt very long ago  
I cried when I missed you  
  
Look at us now  
Crying at hearts out through the night  
Trying to remember what love was like  
Although It wasnt very long ago  
  
Look look my eyes arent shining with love  
And they wont  
Look Im not crying cause I need you  
Im crying cause I dont oh  
  
It wasnt very long ago  
I held you so closely  
It wasnt very long ago  
I dreamed ofyou mostly  
  
Look us now  
Crying at hearts out through the night  
Trying to remember what love was like  
Although it wasnt very long ago  
  
It wasnt very long ago  
It wasnt very long ago  
Not so very long ago
