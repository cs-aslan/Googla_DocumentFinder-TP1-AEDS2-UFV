Now that the low life has no meaning  
Cause youve been there  
Now youre gone  
But your heart wont keep from cheating  
Its stringing you along  
Stranger to me  
Well whats the lowdown  
Are you man enough to pray  
For a better way of living  
I believe Ive lost my way  
Oh May could you please hold me  
I believe I might fall  
I believe that I might fall  
Could there be a better way of living  
Better than the easy way  
Could the wretched be forgiven  
Are you man enough to pray  
Wore my heart upon my sleeve  
To court the wretched and the free  
But if by chance Id lost my way  
Would you help me find it babe  
Oh May could you please hold me  
I believe that I might fall  
I believe I might fall  
Now that the low life has no meaning  
Cause youve been there  
Now youre gone  
But your heart wont keep from cheating  
Its stringing you along  
Wore my heart upon my sleeve  
To court the wretched and the free  
But if by chance Id lost my way  
Would you help me find it babe  
Oh May could you please hold me  
I believe that I might fall  
I believe that I might fall  
Wore my heart upon my sleeve  
To court the wretched and the free  
But if by chance Id lost my way  
Am I man enough to pray  
Am I man enough to pray  
Are you man enough to pray  
Are you man enough to pray
