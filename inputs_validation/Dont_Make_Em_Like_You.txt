Im checking the forecast they say it may be cloudy  
We might luck up and get sunshine  
Its what you deserve the sound of the birds  
And your hair flying free in the wind girl  
So go on girl youre the only flower that blooms in the summer  
Aint no need to stop and wonder  
Cause therell never be another

But mines you keep so wide open  
We both know theres no guarantee yeah

Cause if you leave someones gotta replace ya  
Cause I realize that you are truly something special
