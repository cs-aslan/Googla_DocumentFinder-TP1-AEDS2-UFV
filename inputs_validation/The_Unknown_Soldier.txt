Wait until the war is over  
And were both a little older  
The unknown soldier  
Breakfast where the news is read  
Television children fed  
Unborn living living dead  
Bullet strikes the helmets head  
And its all over  
For the unknown soldier  
Its all over  
For the unknown soldier  
Hut  
Hut  
Hut ho hee up  
Hut  
Hut  
Hut ho hee up  
Hut  
Hut  
Hut ho hee up  
Compnee  
Halt  
Preeeezent  
Arms  
Make a grave for the unknown soldier  
Nestled in your hollow shoulder  
The unknown soldier  
Breakfast where the news is read  
Television children fed  
Bullet strikes the helmets head  
And its all over  
The war is over  
Its all over  
The war is over  
Well all over baby  
All over baby  
Oh over yeah  
All over baby  
Wooooo hahhah  
All over  
All over baby  
Oh woayeah  
All over  
All over
