You got your head in your supper  
And the eyes of your mother baby  
Locked on you  
Everybody wants a piece of you oh yeah  
And your phone keeps ringing  
Cause your cousins singing at the local bar  
Everybody wants to be a star  
Just like you are  
  
You kept your face in the gutter for years  
Kept your eyes on the road  
You always felt you were meant for me  
Baby now you know  
  
Everybody wants a glimpse of the one that got away  
Everybody wants to see you  
And everybody wants to be you too  
Its funny how they put you down  
But now they think youre alright  
And everybody loves you now that  
Youre the one that got away the one that got away  
  
See you were raised in the town  
Where the kids hang around the pizza hut parking lot  
Everybody talks a lot no one likes to do no  
And all the cub scout leaders at the local theaters  
Said you couldnt sing a song that well  
You told em all to go to hell  
And went out on your own  
  
You got a head shot picture to  
Sell yourself to the world  
You tucked your scars up under your dress  
Like an American girl  
  
Everybody wants a glimpse of the one that got away  
Everybody wants to see you  
And everybody wants to be you too  
Its funny how they put you down  
But now they think youre alright  
And everybody loves you tonight  
Youre the one that got away yeah  
  
Everybody wants a glimpse of the one that got away  
Everybody wants to see you  
And everybody wants to be you too  
Its funny how they put you down  
But now they think youre alright  
And everybody loves you now that  
Youre the one that got away  
  
Everybody wants a glimpse of the one that got away  
Everybody wants to see you  
And everybody wants to be you too  
Its funny how they put you down  
But now they think youre alright  
And everybody loves you now that  
Youre the one that got away  
the one that got away
