Words and Music by Bob Seger  
  
A gypsy wind is blowing warm tonight  
The sky is starlit and the time is right  
And still youre tellin me you have to go  
Before you leave theres something you should know  
Yeah something you should know babe  
  
Ive seen you smiling in the summer sun  
Ive seen your long hair flying when you run  
Ive rnade my mind up that its meant to be  
Someday lady youll accompny me  
  
Someday lady youll accompny me  
Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea  
Youre high above me now youre wild and free ah but  
Someday lady youll accompny me  
Someday lady youll accompny me  
  
Some people say that loves a losin game  
You start with fire but you lose the flame  
The ashes smolder but the warmths soon gone  
You end up cold and lonely on your own  
  
Ill take my chances babe Iii risk it all  
Ill win your love or Iii take the fall  
Ive made my mind up girl its meant to be  
Someday lady youll accompny me  
Someday lady youll accompny me  
  
Its written down some where its got to be  
Youre high above me flyin wild and free  
Oh but someday lady youll accompny me  
Someday lady youll accompny me  
  
Someday lady youll accompny me  
Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea  
I feel it in my soul its meant to be  
Oh someday lady youll accompny me  
Somedaylady youll accompny me
