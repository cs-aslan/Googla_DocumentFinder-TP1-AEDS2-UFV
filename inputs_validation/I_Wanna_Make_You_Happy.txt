What a nice party  
And I know just why Im feeling so new  
Cause I came along and I found you  
  
I want to make you happy tonight  
I want to make you happy tonight  
  
Its just like magic  
Dancing with you  
While were sharing a kiss  
Oh Ive been in love  
But never no never like this  
  
I want to make you happy tonight  
I want to make you happy tonight and every day I live yeah  
I want to give you all I have to give  
Oh I want to make you so happy yeah oh  
  
Yes Ive been in love  
But never no never like this  
I want to make you happy tonight  
I want to make you so happy child  
Come on I want to make you so
