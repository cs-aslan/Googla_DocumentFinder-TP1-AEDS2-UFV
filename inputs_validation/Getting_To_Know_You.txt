Spoken Its a very ancient saying  
But a true and honest thought  
That if you become a teacher  
By your pupils youll be taught  
  
Singing As a teacher Ive been learning   
Youll forgive me if I boast   
And Ive now become an expert  
On the subject I like most  
  
Spoken Getting to know you  
  
Singing Getting to know you  
Getting to know all about you  
Getting to like you  
Getting to hope youll like me  
  
Getting to know you  
Putting it my way  
But nicely  
You are precisely  
My cup of tea  
  
Anna and the mothers  
  
Getting to know you  
Getting to know all about you  
Getting to like you  
Getting to hope youll like me  
  
Getting to know you  
Putting it my way  
But nicely  
You are precisely  
  
Anna

Because of all the beautiful and new  
Things Im learning about you
