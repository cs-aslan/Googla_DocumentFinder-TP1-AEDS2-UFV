Chorus  
Why was I the last to know  
That you werent coming to my show you coulda  
Called me up to say good luck  
You coulda called me back you stupid fuck  
Why was I the last to know  
  
Verse  
First date we ate sushi and  
It went well I was funny and  
You said I was a cutie  
Thats the last thing I heard from you  
I left the tickets at the door for you  
I had to tell my mom that there was  
No more room  
You didnt show that was so uncool  
You coulda called me back  
  
So I guess this means that were  
Not friends anymore I heard  
Its me youre asking for I thought  
Id see you at the show  
You said youd go  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2  
After the date I wouldnt go  
Home with you  
I wouldnt put my heels in the  
Air for you  
You tried to get me to do things  
I just wont do  
Last I heard from you  
Here is how I guess the story goes  
You woulda came if I was a ho  
Fuck for parts thats just not how  
I roll move it on down the road  
  
So I guess we shouldnt be  
Friends anymore sick of hearin  
That its me youre askin for  
Cause I thought Id see you at the  
Show you said youd go  
  
Chorus  
  
You thought you know me  
I guess you didnt  
You thought you had me  
I think you didnt  
You thought you knew me  
But you didnt  
  
Chorus Out
