Id go anywhere for you  
Anywhere you asked me to  
Id do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
  
Id walk halfway around the world  
For just one kiss from you  
Far beyond the call of love  
The sun the stars the moon  
As long as your loves there to lead me  
I wont lose my way believe me  
Even through the darkest night you know  
  
Chorus  
Id go anywhere for you  
Anywhere you asked me to  
Id do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
Your love as far as I can see  
Is all Im ever gonna need  
Theres one thing for sure  
I know its true  
Baby Id go anywhere for you  
  
I used to think that dreams were just  
For sentimental fools  
And Id never find someone  
Whod give their love so true  
But I knew the very minute  
Couldnt live my life without you in it  
And now I want the whole world  
To know  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey baby hey baby hey baby oh Repeat x3  
  
Chorus x2
