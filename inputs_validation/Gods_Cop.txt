I can virtually do anything I read  
Someone somewhere swa between your knees  
Hand me out fish did some big tease  
Oh man did you fuck it Baby brother I took it  
Then I pilfered the bag and the amex gold  
Because the lord chief constable knows Im Owen  
And everybody said I told you so  
  
God made it easy  
God made it easy on me  
God made it easy on me  
  
God rains it Es  
God rains it Es all on me  
God made it Es all on me  
  
Chorus  
Cause me and the chief got soul to soul  
Me and the chief got slowly stoned  
Me and the chief got soul to soul  
Oh me and all the chiefs get slowly stoned  
  
I like it and I want it and I just dont need to stop it  
Cos me and all the rich got mobile homes Holmes  
Me and all the rich got mobile phones Bones  
  
God made it easy  
God made it easy on me  
God made it easy on me  
  
God rains it Es  
God rains it Es all on me  
God made it Es all on me  
  
Chorus  
  
God made it easy  
God made it easy on me  
God made it easy on me  
  
God rains it Es  
God rains it Es all on me  
God made it Es all on me
