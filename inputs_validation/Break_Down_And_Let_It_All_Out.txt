Break down and let it all out  
Break down and let it all out  
Ive held back my tears  
Just as long as I could  
But now my eyes can see  
Its all over for you and me  
And holding back aint gonna do no good  
Im gonna break down and let it all out  
Break down and let it all out  
Ive hidden my heart too many times before  
Now my aching heart knows that were apart  
And I cant hide it anymore  
So Im gonna break down and let it all out  
Break down and let it all out  
I remember when you used to love me and oh how sweet it was  
But its not enough just to remember cause  
What good is the past  
Once upon a time  
All those old memories can set my heart at ease  
So before I lose my mindyeah  
Im gonna break down and let it all out  
Break down and let it all out  
My eyes are open and now I see its all over for you and me  
Break down and let it all out  
Break down and let it all out  
Now my aching heart knows that were apart  
Break down and let it all out  
Break down and let it all out  
All those old memories can set my heart at ease  
Break down and let it all out  
Break down and let it all out
