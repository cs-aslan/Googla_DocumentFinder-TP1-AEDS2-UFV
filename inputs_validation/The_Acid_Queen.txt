Gypsy  
If your child aint all he should be now  
This girl will put him right  
Ill show him what he could be now  
Just give me one night  
Im the Gypsy  the acid Queen  
Pay before we start  
Im the Gypsy  The acid queen  
Ill tear your soul apart  
  
Give us a room and close the door  
Leave us for a while  
Your boy wont be a boy no more  
Young but not a child  
Im the Gypsy  the acid queen  
Pay before we start  
Im the Gypsy the acid queen  
Ill tear your soul apart  
  
Gather your wits and hold on fast  
Your mind must learn to roam  
Just as the Gypsy Queen must do  
Youre gonna hit the road  
  
My work is done now look at him  
Hes never been more alive  
His head it shakes his fingers clutch  
Watch his body writhe  
Im the Gypsy  the acid queen  
Pay before we start  
Im the Gypsy  Im guaranteed  
To break your little heart
