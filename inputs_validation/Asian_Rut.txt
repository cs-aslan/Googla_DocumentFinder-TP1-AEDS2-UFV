Day oh so late  
Strangely the sun still shone  
Ooh Asian boy  
What are you on  
Day oh so late  
Strangely the sun still shone  
Oh Asian boy  
What are drugs are you on  
  
Ohstrange  
  
Tooledup Asian boy  
Has come to take revenge  
For the cruel cold killing  
Of his very best friend  
Tooledup Asian boy  
Has come to avenge  
The cruel cold killing  
Of his only friend  
  
Ha La la la oh  
  
Theres peace through our school  
Its so quiet in the hall  
Its a strange sign for one  
Of whats to come  
Tough and cold and pale  
Oh they may just impale you on railings  
Oh English boys  
It must be wrong  
Three against one  
  
Oh  
  
Brakes slammed and  
His gun jammed and  
As far as I could tell  
Brave Asian boy  
Was dealt a blow and fell  
  
Im just passing through here  
On my way to somewhere civilized  
And maybe Ill even arrive  
Maybe Ill even arrive
