You feel like a candle in a hurricane  
Just like a picture with a broken frame  
Alone and helpless like youve lost your fight  
But youll be all right youll be all right  
  
Chorus  
Cause when push comes to shove  
You taste what youre made of  
You might bend till you break  
Cause its all you can take  
On your knees you look up  
Decide youve had enough  
You get mad you get strong  
Wipe your hands shake it off  
Then you stand then you stand  
  
Lifes like a novel with the end ripped out  
The edge of a canyon with only one way down  
Take what youre given before its gone  
And start holdin on keep holdin on  
  
Cause when push comes to shove  
You taste what youre made of  
You might bend till you break  
Cause its all you can take  
On your knees you look up  
Decide youve had enough  
You get mad you get strong  
Wipe your hands shake it off  
Then you stand yeah then you stand  
  
Every time you get up  
And get back in the race  
One more small piece of you  
Starts to fall into place  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah then you stand yeah  
Yeah baby  
Woo hoo woo hoo woo hoo woo hoo  
Then you stand yeah yeah
