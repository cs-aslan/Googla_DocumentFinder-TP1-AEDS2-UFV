Ive been swinging in trees  
A paid up member  
Ive been eating fleas  
Running naked in the breeze  
Catatonia itch  
Catalonia stitch  
Oh Ive been running for miles  
I start to tingle from my head to my toes  
Oh tomorrow its a taint on the nose  
Hetty hetty hetty hetty oh its a taint on the nose
