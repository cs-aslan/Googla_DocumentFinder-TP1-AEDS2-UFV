Well it looks like its another Skynyrd Family Christmas time  
Seems like it was just New Years day  
Started out in old LA  
  
Those big wheels keep turning once again  
Well this bus we ride we call our home  
And its what keeps us moving on  
But eleven months on this road  
Im going home  
  
Familys there trimming the tree  
Cooking that turkey waiting on me  
Just like Santa Ill be right on time  
38ll be there too  
  
CDB will be guiding you to another Christmas time  
Sleigh bells ringing  
Children singing  
Its another Skynyrd family Christmas time  
Sleigh bells ringing  
Children singing  
Its another Skynyrd family Christmas time  
Sleigh bells ringing  
Children singing  
  
Its another Skynyrd family Christmas time  
Its another Skynyrd family Christmas time  
Its another Skynyrd family Christmas time  
Its another Skynyrd family Christmas time
