Oh dig my shallow grave  
Its not me youll save  
Cause Im a lost cause  
Im a lost cause  
A lost lost cause  
  
Wait all this time that I have spent away  
Makes me think that I might be okay  
For this the deaf will have to wait  
My head is holding on to all those things you said  
You taught me to be strong and get through it the mist of darkness  
In my head  
  
Oh dig my shallow grave  
Its not me youll save  
Cause Im a lost cause  
Im a lost cause  
A lost lost cause  
  
Wait no one said whats lost cannot be found  
You are here to make it safe and sound  
Oh we can make it out alive  
Fate hath its way when all thats learned is sin  
Nothing really matters in the end  
As long as you are with me friend  
  
Oh dig my shallow grave  
Its not me youll save  
Cause Im a lost cause  
Im a lost cause  
A lost lost cause  
  
No one can understand me  
Like you can understand  
No one can fill your shadow  
Cause you are all I am  
  
Oh dig my shallow grave  
Its not me youll save  
Cause Im a lost cause  
Im a lost cause  
A lost lost cause
