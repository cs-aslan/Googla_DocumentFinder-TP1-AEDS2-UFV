Were so young and pretty were so young and clean  
So many things that we have never seen  
Lets move from Ohio sell this dam old store  
Big Apple dreamin on a wooden floor  
  
Skyscrapers and subways and stations  
Staring up at the United Nations  
  
New York is waiting for you and me baby  
Waiting to swallow us down  
New York were coming to see what youre made of  
Are you as great as you sound  
  
Heard about them massages and all those dirty shows  
I read somewhere some places never close  
While we waste time on yokels comin through the door  
Big Apple dreamin on a wooden floor  
  
Skyscrapers and subways and stations  
Staring up at the United Nations  
  
New York is waiting for you and me baby  
Waiting to swallow us down  
New York were coming to see what youre made of  
Are you as great as you sound  
  
New York is waiting for you and me baby  
Waiting to swallow us down  
New York were coming to see what youre made of  
Are you as tough as you sound  
  
Oh New York is waiting for you and me baby  
Waiting to swallow us down whoooo
