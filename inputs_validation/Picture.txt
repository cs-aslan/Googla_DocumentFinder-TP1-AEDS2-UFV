Waiting by the telephone  
Breathing through a giant rubber hose  
God only knows  
Photographs of you and me  
Pictures of the friends  
You used to know  
Where did they go  
  
Chorus  
Dont take my picture down  
Dont erase everything that we had  
Dont think Id let you down  
I might be gone but well meet again  
Cant find you  
So Ill call your name  
  
Riding on the satellite  
Sun faded and sweaty but thats all right  
Cause Im still alive  
Im stranded in this memory  
Your mouth is wide open you cant scream  
Oh you cant scream  
  
Chorus  
  
Please pick up the phone  
Please pick up the phone  
Please pick up the phone  
Please pick up the phone  
I wanted you to know  
I wanted you to know  
I wanted you to know  
I wanted you to know  
  
Chorus
