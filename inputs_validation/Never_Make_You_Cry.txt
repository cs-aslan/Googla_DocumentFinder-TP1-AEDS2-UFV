Its so easy loving you  
With everything I feel inside  
And holding me the way you do  
Its here Im staying all of my life  
  
Chorus  
Ill never ever make you cry  
Ill never ever say goodbye  
Cant you see it in my eyes  
Im yours until the day I die  
  
Ill watch you fall asleep at night  
Ill smile and kiss you hold you tight  
Ill hold your hand and close my eyes  
Its here Im staying all of my life  
  
Chorus x2
