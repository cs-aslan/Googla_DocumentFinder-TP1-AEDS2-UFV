Aey yeah you motherfucker  
You know who Im talkin to  
Yeah you that motherfucker that betrayed  
Your homeboys and you aint shit  
Yeah you about to get your motherfuckin  
Ghetto pass revoked motherfucker  
Punkass Mark bitchmade punkass trick in a basket  
You got caught up in the mix  
Its the nigga ya love to hate with a new song  
So what really goes on  
Nothin but a comeup but aint that a bitch  
They hate to see a young nigga rich  
But I refuse to switch even though  
Cause I cant move to the snow  
Cause soon as yall get some dough  
Ya wanna put a white bitch on your elbow  
Movin out your neighborhood  
But I walk through the ghetto and the flavors good  
Little kids jumpin on me  
But you you wanna be white and corny  
Living way out  
Nigger go home spraypainted on your house  
Tryin to be white or a Jew  
But ask yourself who are they to be equal to  
Get the hell out stop bein an uncle Tom  
You little sellout house nigga scum  
Give somethin back to the place  
Where you made it from  
Before you end up broke  
Fuck around and get your ghetto pass revoked  
I aint sayin no names you know who you are  
You little punk be true to the game  
Yeah motherfucker  
Yeah you thought we forgot huh  
Yeah get a little money  
And moves out the neighborhood and shit  
But you still aint shit  
When you first start rhymin  
It started off slow and then you start climbin  
But it wasnt fast enough I guess  
So you gave your other style a test  
You was hardcore hiphop  
Now look at yourself boy you done flipflopped  
Givin our music away to the mainstream  
Dont you know they aint down with the team  
They just sent they boss over  
Put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over  
On MTV but they dont care  
Theyll have a new nigga next year  
You out in the cold  
No more white fans and no more soul  
And you might have a heart attack  
When you find out the black folks dont want you back  
And you know whats worse  
You was just like the nigga in the first verse  
Stop sellin out your race  
And wipe that stupidass smile off your face  
Niggas always gotta show their teeth  
Now Im a be brief be true to the game  
Yeah motherfucker I see you got your fancy cars and shit  
But you know what you still aint shit  
Thats right I caught you slippin  
You know I couldve gat you  
Yeah but I didnt even trip  
A message to the Oreo cookie  
Find a mirror and take a look G  
Do you like what you see  
But youre quick to point the finger at me  
You wanna be the big fish you little guppy  
Black man cant be no yuppie  
You put on your suit and tie and your big clothes  
You dont associate with the Negroes  
You wanna be just like Jack  
But Jack is callin you a nigga behind your back  
So back off genius  
I dont need you to correct my broken English  
You know thats right you aint white  
So stop holdin your ass tight  
Cause you cant pass  
So why you keep tryin to pass with your black ass  
Mister big  
But in reality youre shorter than a midge  
You only got yourself to blame  
Get a grip Oreo and be true to the game  
And Ice Cube practices what he preaches  
He continues to live in South Central Los Angeles  
And he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood  
Be true to the game
