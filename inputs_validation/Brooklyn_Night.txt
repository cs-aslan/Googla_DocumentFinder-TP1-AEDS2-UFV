Verse 1  
I always thought it was you  
You always thought it was me  
We always thought we were it  
Seemed like a real perfect fit  
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free  
  
I always thought even though  
We were so young we could grow  
Up in the end itd be us  
Wed take the F or the bus  
Where Brooklyn Nights set us free  
  
Chorus  
Its not that I dont wanna love you  
Its not that Im really over it you know you know  
Its just that I cant watch us bleed to death  
When we used to be  
Brooklyn Nights happy  
  
Verse 2  
I miss our cheap chandalier  
Member when dad hung it there  
And we would watch Rocky IV  
The one where the Russian scored  
I loved Brigitte Nielsens hair  
  
Id call you my champion  
Thought we had already won  
And cracked open our last beer  
Falling asleep in our tears  
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free  
  
Chorus  
Its not that I dont wanna love you  
Its not that Im really over it you know you know  
Its just that I cant watch us bleed to death  
When we used to be  
Brooklyn Nights happy  
  
Bridge  
I found an old pair of  
Keys in my purse that opened  
The walkup we shared  
How did they get there jerk  
I wanna see you there  
I wanna make it work  
  
I didnt brush my hair  
And my lashes are falling  
Off of seven years  
Of our bad luck dating  
I want one last night there  
A Brooklyn Night affair  
  
Chorus  
Its not that I dont wanna love you  
Its not that Im really over it you know you know  
Its just that I cant watch us bleed to death  
When we used to be  
Brooklyn Nights happy  
  
Outro  
Its not that I dont want to love you  
Cause I really tried and I  
Just wanna hang with the old you  
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu  
  
Have a drink with your former self  
We both wont act like someone else  
Maybe then wed both tell the truth  
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu
