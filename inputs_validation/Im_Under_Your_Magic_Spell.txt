Like a light coming down from the sky  
Thundering venus and apollo  
And my invitation of the physical kind  
Out of control I just tend to follow  
  
Youre close to me like the air that I breathe  
I touch too much I never wanna leave  
  
Seems Im under a magic spell magic love  
Any way I try I just cant hide  
Im under your magic spell under a magic   
And nothing enough Im on the hunt for your love  
  
Holding the fire out of the road  
Straight from the heart to the end of the rainbow  
Turning electric and going for gold  
Body and soul just has to follow  
  
Youre close to me like the air that I breathe  
I touch too much I never wanna leave  
  
Seems Im under a magic spell   
  
Baby for your love
