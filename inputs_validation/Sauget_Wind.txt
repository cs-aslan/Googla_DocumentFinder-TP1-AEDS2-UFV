Its a long way to heaven  
Its a short way to hell  
Painkillers wont help  
When the weights not yourself  
  
Theyre poisoning the air  
For personal wealth  
Its a long way to heaven  
Its a short way to hell  
  
I dont know what Im breathing for  
Cause the air around here aint so good anymore  
The weatherman says fair  
But he looks like a lie  
  
Nothings free in this country  
And theres no place to hide no more  
Industrial wind  
It blows from the west  
  
Itll burn out your eyes  
And suck out your breath  
Its waiting in the wings  
For damage down the line  
  
Save your tears for the soaps  
Leave your money behind  
I dont know what Im breathing for  
Cause the air around here aint so good anymore  
  
The weatherman says fair  
But he looks like a lie  
Nothings free in this country  
And theres no place to hide no more  
  
No place to hide no more
