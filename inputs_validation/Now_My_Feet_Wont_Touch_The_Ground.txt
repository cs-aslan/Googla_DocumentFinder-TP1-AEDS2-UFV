Let me go boys let me go  
Push my bone from the highest cliff to the sea below  
Rocks are waiting boys rocks are waiting  
Swoop down from the sky and catch me like the bird to prey  
  
Now my feet wont touch the ground  
Now my head wont stop  
You wait a lifetime to be found  
Now my feet wont touch the ground  
  
Singing now my feet wont touch the ground  
Now my head wont stop  
You wait a lifetime to be found  
Now my feet wont touch the ground  
  
Now my feet wont touch the ground
