Mmm  
Oh in the dead of night  
Adrift on the ocean wide  
High on the mountain side  
You can count on me  
If youre deep in the jungle boy  
Caught in a winter storm  
Kidnapped by anyone  
Ill set you free  
Say the word  Ill be there  
To give you loving care  
Theres nothing that I wouldnt do for you  
Say the word  Ill be there  
Ill reach you anywhere  
Nothing can keep me away from you  
If youre lost in the wilderness  
Cant tell the East from West  
Just feeling second best  
I wont let you down  
When night comes around again  
And youre without a friend  
Im yours til the very end  
Im come around  
Say the word  Ill be there  
To give you loving care  
Theres nothing that I wouldnt do for you  
Say the word  Ill be there  
Ill reach you anywhere  
Nothing can keep me away from you  
If youre deep in the jungle boy  
Caught in a winter storm  
Kidnapped by anyone  
Ill set you free  
Say the word  Ill be there  
To give you loving care  
Theres nothing that I wouldnt do for you  
Say the word  Ill be there  
Ill reach you anywhere  
Nothing can keep me away from you  
Say the word  Ill be there  
To give you loving care  
Theres nothing that I wouldnt do for you  
Say the word  Ill be there  
Ill reach you anywhere  
Nothing can keep me away from you  
Say the word  Ill be there  
To give you loving care  
Theres nothing that I wouldnt do for you  
Say the word  Ill be there  
Ill reach you anywhere  
Nothing can keep me away from you
