Esther be the one that shoots a machine gun  
Whether you like it or not  
Midnight or daylight stay out of her sight  
Cause I heard shes one heck of a shot  
  
Esther be the one shes the only one  
Shell get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin at the moon  
  
And you will feel her love bullets when you look her in the eyes  
There aint no way to escape  
And thats when her fever will materialize  
But it aint no unfortunate fate  
  
Esther be the one shes the only one  
Shell get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin at the moon  
  
It aint nothing but its something so dear  
Dont get branded cause her ammo is real  
  
If she gets you in a corner dont let her mess you round  
And dont let her blow you away  
If you cant dig on Esther you turn and leave town  
cause if you think shes bad you ought to see her sister  
  
Esther be the one but shes not the only one  
Shell get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin at the moon
