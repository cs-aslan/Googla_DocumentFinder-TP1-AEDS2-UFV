Everybody always asks me  
How I got to play so fine  
And friends Im gonna tell ya  
It really did take some time  
  
Yes after years and years of practice  
And a case of real bad knees  
While the other guys were out playin with the football  
I was home bangin on the keys  
And it got me  
  
Right were I am this is me  
Playing the piano  
I hope ya like what I do  
Its for you and Ill try and sing right too  
  
I guess Im really very lucky  
That Ive got this thing to play  
Cause it can really make me feel good  
Even when its cloudy and grey  
  
Yes after years and years of practice  
And awful allergies that made me sneeze  
And now the other guys are out playin with their girlfriends  
And I was still bangin on the keys  
And it got me  
  
Right where I am this is me  
Playing the piano  
I hope ya like what I do  
Its for you  
And Ill try and sing right too
