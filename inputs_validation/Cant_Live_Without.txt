All the dreams  
You cant live without  
All the love that you made  
You cant live without  
If you look at the grief in your heart  
And the dreams that you had are all gone  
Youd better stop it now  
You just cant take it hard  
Youd better stop it now  
You just cant take it so hard right now  
All the praise  
You cant live without  
All the highs in the days you cant live without  
When you look to the right and the one  
Who was saying goodbye is now gone  
Youd better stop it now  
You just cant take it hard  
Youd better stop it now  
You just cant take it so hard right now  
All left behind  
Im not here to find and amaze you  
All left my mind  
Im not here to try and appraise you now  
I didnt wanna hold you up  
You know I wanna hold you  
But never wanna hold you up  
I didnt wanna call  
All the love you cant live without  
All above you cant live without  
Well you look to the right and the one  
Who was saving your love for a song  
Is telling you shes gone  
Right now oh now  
Youd better stop it now  
You just cant take it so hard right now  
Youd better stop it now  
Or shes gone  
Well shes gone
