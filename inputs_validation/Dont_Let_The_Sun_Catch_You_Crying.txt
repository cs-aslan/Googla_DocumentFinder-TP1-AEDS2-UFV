Dont let the sun catch you cryin  
Cryin on my front door  
You done daddy dirty now  
And honey he aint gonna love you no more  
  
And dont let the sun catch you cryin  
Cryin on my front door  
You done daddy dirty now  
And honey he aint gonna love you no more  
  
Well you can cry cry cry cry  
Oh now baby you can wail  
You can bang your little head on the pavement  
Till the man comes and throws you in jail  
  
Cryin on my front door  
You done daddy dirty now  
Yeah and honey he aint gonna love you no more  
  
Well you can cry cry cry cry  
Oh now baby baby you can wail  
You can bang your hear on that hard hard pavement  
Till the man comes and throws you in jail  
  
Cryin on my front door  
You done daddy dirty now  
And honey he aint gonna love you no more  
  
Yeah you know you done him dirty now  
You know you done him dirty  
And I just cant love you no more
