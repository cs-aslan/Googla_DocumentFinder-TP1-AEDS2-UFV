Our love  
Our loves in danger  
If you dont hurry home  
I might  
Give it to a stranger  
I never wanted you to go  
I told you many times before  
I need your loving day to day  
I get so tired when youre far away  
You got me staring at the ceiling  
Better come quick  
You cant make it too soon  
I never want to do you wrong  
But you been gone away so long  
I dont know what you expect of me  
Thats what Im trying so hard to be  
Dont force me into anothers arms  
Our love  
Our love  
Our love  
Get the picture Im here all alone  
Aint you worried  
About your happy home  
What Im thinking  
Makes me feels ashamed  
Tell me whos to blame  
Tell me what to do about the  
Strangers coming from everywhere  
Strangers calling my name  
Just dont know what to do about it
