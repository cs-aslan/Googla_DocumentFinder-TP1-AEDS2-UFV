Breaker number nine big buddy  
Put your ears on me now  
This trucker got to have a big line tonight  
Come on sucker come back brother trucker  
I keep seeing double unless I close one eye  
  
And Ive got to roll roll roll brother trucker Sure enough a shame about
the shape Im in  
Roll roll roll brother trucker  
Im back on my wheels again  
Roll roll roll brother trucker  
Someone to love the truck driving man  
Roll roll roll brother trucker  
Im back on my wheels again  
  
Im a driving fool  
I make my own rules  
One part man and one part mule  
One part fossil fuel  
I got the heart of steel  
I pull eighteen wheels  
Mister nine to five  
In his Coup de Ville  
No never know how it feels  
  
To really roll roll roll brother trucker Holding my own just the best as I
can  
Roll roll roll brother trucker  
Im back on my wheels again  
Roll roll roll brother trucker  
Outward bound from South Bend  
Roll roll roll brother trucker  
Im back on my wheels again  
  
Moon over New Jersey big state police  
Well Im in a hurry  
Could you let me go in peace  
Im an independent  
I dont make no teamster dough  
Cause the AFL and the CIO  
Still dont own the road  
And the only man telling me where to go  
Is the man who owns my load  
  
And he says roll roll roll brother trucker  
I say where and you say when  
Roll roll roll brother trucker  
Get back on your wheels again  
Turn the goddamn thing around and do it again  
Roll roll roll brother trucker Im back on my wheels again  
Fat bucket Im back on my wheels again
