You made me feel good  
After all this time  
Welcomed me home  
With my name in lights  
Took me by the hand  
Shook away my fear  
Brought back the memory  
Of those earlier years

Gotta help you get up  
And get rid of your blues  
Cheatin the devil or whatever you choose  
Even if youve got nothin boy  
Youve got somethin to lose  
Youve got the  
Eatin out of your hand  
Got the answer if youve got the time  
Cant go on forever in lotus land  
Dont end up doing one night stands  
Ive seen your face in every cloud  
Ive followed the sun  
Which brought me back to your side  
Ive lived some time  
By what the fortunetellers say  
But now I know in love with uk
