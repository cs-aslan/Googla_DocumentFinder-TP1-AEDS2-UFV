Its not that funny is it  
When you dont know what it is  
But you cant get enough of it  
Ifs not that funny is it  
Dont blame me  
Please please please  
I didnt wanna bleed so  
I didnt wanna be this late  
So dont make me wait  
Its not that funny is it  
No one to turn you on  
All your hope is gone  
Its not that funny is it  
Dont blame me  
Please please please  
Youre here cause I say so  
Didnt wanna be this late  
So dont make me  
Dont make me wait  
Here comes the nightime looking for a little more  
Waiting on the right time somebody outside the door
