Show me yours  
I ll show you mine  
Maybe mine is bigger than yours  
Maybe mine goes deeper than yours  
That is why I cry the most  
I played your game  
But I didn t know the rules  
Everytime weve played  
You d come out a winner  
Now I ve learned to play the game  
And I will never cry again  
  
Chorus  
These crying games we play  
It s your turn to cry  
  
They say the winner takes it all  
But in my case the winner didnt  
Take the pain  
In my case the winner didnt  
Take the hurt  
That is why I cry the most  
I played your game  
But I didnt know the rules  
Everytime we ve played  
You d come out a winner  
Now Ive learned to play the game  
And I will never lose again  
  
Chorus  
These crying games we play  
It s your turn to cry
