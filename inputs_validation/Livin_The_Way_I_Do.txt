Well Ive gont to stop livin the way I do  
And give my heart back to you  
All those nights away from home  
Caused my lonely heart to roam  
Now Ive got start livin the way I do  
  
Ive spent a lifetime hurting you  
And I expect someday youll say were through  
It aint two late for me to change  
So please donot write our final page  
Still Ive got to stop livin the way I do  
  
Ive gone from honeymoons to heartaches  
From faithful love to a fool  
From hangin out in honkey tonks  
With any girl but you  
  
Well Ive got to stop livin the way I do  
And give my heart back to you  
All those nights away from home  
Caused my lonely heart to roam  
Now Ive got to stop livin the way I do  
  
Ive said all that I can say  
But you turned and walked away  
Its too late to stop livin the way I do
