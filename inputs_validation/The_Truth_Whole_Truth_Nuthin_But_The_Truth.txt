Lonely days lonely nights  
Hoping things gonna turn out right  
You had me hanging on a string  
For you I did most anything  
You dont give me no  
The truth the whole truth nothing but the truth  
Its a blind mans eye baby aint no youth  
The truth the whole truth nothing but the truth  
Dont need your lies I got my proof  
  
Put your face up to my window  
Ask me baby what did I see  
Well I know I know you aint right  
I know you aint right for me  
You dont give me no  
The truth the whole truth nothing but the truth  
Gods little babys got nothing to shoot  
The truth the whole truth nothing but the truth  
Get your kicks on a different route  
All I want is the truth  
All I want is the truth  
  
All I want is  
The truth the whole truth nothing but the truth  
Blind mans eye baby aint no use  
The truth the whole truth nothing but the truth  
Dont need your lies I got nothing to prove  
The truth the whole truth nothing but the truth  
Gods little babys got nothing to shoot  
The truth the whole truth nothing but the truth  
Get your kicks on a different route  
Dont hurt ya  
Dont hurt ya  
The truth dont hurt ya  
The truth dont hurt ya  
Dont hurt ya dont hurt ya  
The truth dont hurt ya
