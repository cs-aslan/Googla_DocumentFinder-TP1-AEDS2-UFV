I got a past  
Thatll last me forever  
And enough memories for one mans life that is true  
The one I love  
She aint comin back ever  
So it looks like Ive got my future on ice  
  
I got bottles and cans  
That just left my hand  
And a chill to just the right Fahrenheit  
O love let me down  
Now a truer friend Ive found  
Why Ive got my future on ice  
  
There was a time  
She was my one and only  
Until someone else caught her eye  
Then for awhile  
Can you believe I was acting so lonely  
Now Ive got my future on ice  
  
I got bottles and cans  
That just left my hands  
And a chill to just the right Fahrenheit  
Yes love let me down  
Now a truer friend I found  
Now Ive got my future on ice  
  
O love let me down  
Now a real true friend I found  
Why I got my future on ice
