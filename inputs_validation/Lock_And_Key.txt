I dont want to face  
The killer instinct  
Face it in your or me  
  
We carry a sensitive cargo  
Below the waterline  
Ticking like a time bomb  
With a primitive design  
  
Behind the finer feelings  
This civilized veneer  
The heart of a lonely hunter  
Guards a dangerous frontier  
  
The balance can sometimes fail  
Strong emotions can tip the scale  
  
Dont want to silence  
A desperate voice  
For the sake of security  
No one wants to make  
A terrible choice  
On the price of being free  
I dont want to face  
The killer instinct  
Face it in you or me  
So we keep it under lock and key  
  
Its not a matter of mercy  
Its not a matter of laws  
Plenty of people will kill you  
For some fanatical cause  
  
Its not a matter of conscience  
A search for probable cause  
Its just a matter of instinct  
A matter of fatal flaws  
  
No reward for resistance  
No assistance  
No applause  
  
We dont want to be victims  
On that we all agree  
So we lock up the killer instinct  
And throw away the key
