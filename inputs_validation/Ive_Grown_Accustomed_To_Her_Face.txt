Ive grown accustomed to her face  
She almost makes the day begin  
Ive grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon  
Her smiles her frowns her ups and downs  
Are second nature to me now  
Like breathing out and breathing in  
I was serenely independent and content before we met  
Surely I could always be that way again and yet  
Ive grown accustomed to her looks accustomed to her voice  
Accustomed to her face  
  
Shes second nature to me now  
Like breathing out and breathing in  
Im very grateful shes a woman and so easy to forget  
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet  
Ive grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air  
Accustomed to her face
