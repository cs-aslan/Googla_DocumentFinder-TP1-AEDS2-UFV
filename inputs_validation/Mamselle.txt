It was Montmartre  
It was midnight Come to think of it  
It was spring  
There was music I was listening  
Then in the room somewhere someone began to sing  
This serenade made for remembering  
  
A small cafe Mamselle  
Our rendezvous Mamselle  
The violins were warm and sweet  
And so were you Mamselle  
And as the night danced by  
A kiss became a sigh  
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle  
Just like wine does  
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you  
And yet I know too well  
Some day youll say goodbye  
Then violins will cry  
And so will I Mamselle
