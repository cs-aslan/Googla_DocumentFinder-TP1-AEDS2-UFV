The innocence is gone  
But still Im holding on  
Searchin for love that lasts forever  
Lookin for a place  
Where love can hide away  
Takin a chance its now or never  
  
Maybe its time to draw the line  
Theres just one thing thats on my mind  
  
Is it lust is it love  
Whatever it is I cant get enough  
Is it lust is it love  
When I look around tell me who can I trust  
Is it love  
  
Lovers come and go  
Sometimes its hard to know  
If this will be a night to treasure  
When the damage has been done  
And the hurting has begun  
Youll justify a moments pleasure  
  
Is it lust is it love  
Whatever it is I cant get enough  
Is it lust is it love  
It aint nothin that I cant rise above  
  
Is it lust is it love  
When I look around tell me who can I trust  
Is it love  
Lust or love  
  
Maybe its time to draw the line  
Theres just one thing thats on my mind  
  
Is it lust is it love  
Whatever it is I cant get enough  
Is it lust is it love  
It aint nothin that I cant rise above  
  
Is it lust is it love  
Still lookin for more its never enough  
Is it lust is it love  
When I look around tell me who can I trust  
  
Is it love is it love is it love  
Is it love is it love
