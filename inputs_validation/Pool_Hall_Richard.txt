Sweatin hard I didnt get a shot  
All I did was stand around and get too hot  
Knowin all the people walkin on my side  
Losin all my money and Im getting tired  
Ol Bill he come arunnin like hes gettin some  
Makes you kind of jealous but it sure is fun  
I dont mind but he wants my lady too  
  
You know the crowd gets bigger as the word goes round  
Pool hall king was playin back in town  
Minnesota Fats standin up at the back  
Tryin to hide himself in a plastic mack  
You ought to hear the silence when the kid walks in  
His reputations bigger than gasoline  
I dont mind but hes tryin to fill my lady too  
Pool Hall Richard youre far too wicked we know  
Pool Hall Richard kid youre wicked we know  
You broke my heart  
Same as you could ever do  
With your yellow carnation and your pink satin shoe  
You make me jealous but I worship you  
One day soon Im gonna beat you clean  
Wipe that smile right off your chin  
Everybody gonna drive from miles around  
Cuein up to see me take away your crown  
Then youll never never ever take my lady then  
  
Pool Hall Richard youre far too wicked we know  
Pool Hall Richard kid youre wicked we know  
You broke my heart  
Same as you could ever do  
Dig this  
Bam goes the brown thats another one down  
Know they play much better when the sun goes down  
Bang goes the green youre so obscene  
Your hands are dirty but your scent is clean  
Bam goes the blue lock away your cue  
The pool hall king is hustlin you  
Bam goes the 8ball didnt see it spin at all  
This kid can play oh yeah  
  
Bam goes the brown ooh another one down  
Know they play much better when the sun goes down  
Bang goes the green youre so obscene  
Your hands are dirty your scent is clean  
Damn the pink one more to sink  
Gonna beat you someday cause youre makin me sick  
Down on the black at the back of the pack  
Aw you nearly missed you aint so hot  
  
Pool Hall Richard kid youre wicked we know  
You broke my heart  
Same as you could ever do  
Youre breakin my heart  
But youre stealin my tart  
Shut up
