Through the door it slithers in  
Accompanied by its peers  
Always groveling for attention  
While no one really hears  
In its mind its full of wit  
And quite the social king  
It plants itself among the rest  
To give its deadly sting  
  
Its just a matter of opinion  
  
Further now theres a man of taste  
Of talent and precision  
To work and strive at his art form  
Has been his lifes decision  
The stage is set The perfect show  
Is put before the mass  
Only to be ridiculed  
By some slimy pompous ass  
  
Its just a matter of opinion
