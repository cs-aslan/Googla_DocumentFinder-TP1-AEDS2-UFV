Young man is angry girl is afraid  
She want to get high and he want to get paid  
She had to jump up he had to sit down  
When they heard those words about the trouble downtown  
He had to shout she had to cry  
He wanted to kill and she wanted to die  
Citys burning  
Cities burning  
Citys burning  
Cities burning  
Grab for the dial tune out the fright  
But he turns left and she turns right  
She look for love songs he buys the drive  
But all they can pull is bad news in tonight  
Citys burning  
Cities burning  
Citys burning  
Cities burning  
Ooh mama tell me what to do  
Aah daddy you better pull us through  
Ooh mama mama mama tell me what to do  
Daddy you better pull us through  
Young man is angry girl is afraid  
He want to get high and she want to get paid  
Citys burning  
Cities burning  
Citys burning  
Cities burning burning burning burning  
Citys burning  
Cities burning  
Citys burning burning burning burning burning ohh  
Cities burning burning burning
