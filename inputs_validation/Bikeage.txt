Running out of time again  
Where did you go wrong this time  
When your problems overwhelm you  
  
Go get drunk its party time  
Take a Quaalude relax your mind  
Relax your body too  
  
Run from problems but  
Youll never get away  
No one loves you  
And you wonder why  
  
Sitting there with your mouth full of beer  
Your eyes are glazed your face is red  
Whos gonna pick you up and use you for tonight  
  
And when youre on the streets  
With a needle in your arm  
Selling your body for another fix  
Whos gonna pick you up and take you home with them tonight  
  
Not me Running out of breath again  
Youre an Old Maid but youre only 15  
Youre losing your little girls charm  
Cry all night but youll never get it back  
  
Dont be afraid its not too late  
Save yourself I need you here  
Wearing off wearing out  
I cant think about this cause it makes me sick
