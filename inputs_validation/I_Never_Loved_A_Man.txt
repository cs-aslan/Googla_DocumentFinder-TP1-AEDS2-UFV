Youre no good heart breaker  
Youre a liar and youre a cheat  
And I dont know why  
I let you do these things to me  
  
My friends keep telling me  
That you aint no good  
But oh they dont know  
That Id leave you if I could  
  
I guess Im uptight  
And Im stuck like glue  
Cause I aint never  
No I aint never I aint never loved  
Loved a man the way that I love you  
  
Some time ago I thought  
You had run out of fools  
But I was so wrong  
You got one that youll never lose  
The way you treat me is a shame  
How could you hurt me so bad  
Baby dont you know that Im the best thing  
That youll ever had  
Kiss me once again  
  
Dont you never never say that we were through  
Cause I aint never  
No I aint never I aint never loved  
Loved a man the way that I I love you  
  
I cant sleep at night  
And I cant even fight  
I guess Ill never be free  
Since you got your hooks in me  
  
Whoa oh oh  
Yeah Yeah  
I aint never loved a man baby  
I aint never loved a man  
Aint never had a man hurt me so bad  
I aint never loved a man
