Id like to say we gave it a try  
Id like to blame it all on life  
Maybe we just werent right  
But thats a lie  
Thats a lie  
  
And we can deny it as much as we want  
But in time our feelings will show  
Cause sooner or later well wonder why we gave up  
The truth is everyone knows  
  
Almost  
Almost is never enough  
So close to being in love  
If I would have known that you wanted me  
The way I wanted you  
Then maybe we wouldnt be two worlds apart  
But right here in each others arms  
  
And we almost  
We almost knew what love was  
But almost is never enough  
  
If I could change the world overnight  
Thered be no such thing as goodbye  
Youll be standing right where you were  
And wed get the chance we deserve  
  
Try to deny it as much as you want  
But in time our feelings will show  
Cause sooner or later well wonder why we gave up  
The truth is everyone knows  
  
Almost  
Almost is never enough  
So close to being in love  
If I would have known that you wanted me  
The way I wanted you oh  
Then maybe we wouldnt be two worlds apart  
But right here in each others arms  
  
And we almost  
We almost knew what love was  
But almost is never enough

The truth is everyone knows
