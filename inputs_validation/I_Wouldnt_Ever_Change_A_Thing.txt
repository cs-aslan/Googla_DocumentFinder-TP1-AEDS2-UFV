I wouldnt change a thing if I could live it all again  
  
Ah listen  
Its funny you know when you sit down  
And think about what you had  
About the friends you used to know  
What happened where did they all go  
Can you remember happy hours  
Spent drinkin and thinkin  
We thought we could change the world  
And we never never never never never  
Never thought we could get much older then  
  
We were the ones who loved to love the right to love  
Wed bring it on home with the right song  
Played at the right time  
What happened to the girl that you loved once and left  
Young man did you break her heart  
Did she live and did she marry  
Did she ever think on your face again  
Ah now hold on a minute  
  
I wouldnt change a thing if I could live it all again  
Ah yeah  
  
I think what you say is all so right  
But I find it hard to jog my memories  
Dont worry Lou you may never get another chance yeah  
  
Yes I think what you say is all so right  
But I find it hard to move my memories  
Say it again with a lot more feelin  
  
And I think what you say is all so right  
But I find it hard to find my memories  
Dont sing so serious you make me feel so sad  
  
But if I was true to myself  
I would probably find it was a tear in my eye  
That stopped me from believing you  
Dont worry dont worry dont worry dont worry  
  
You know my tongue gets tired  
When I think back on all of the things we do  
But I wonder if Ill remember these few precious things  
As years pass me by  
Ah when young bodies thatve grown older  
And minds become dimmer  
Ill point the finger back in time  
  
I said I wouldnt change a thing if I could  
If I could if I could live it all again yeah
