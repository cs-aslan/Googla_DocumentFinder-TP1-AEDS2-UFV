Intro  
Heres the tale of me Matilda  
And my fight with cousin Stephen to succeed  
Henry firsts throne  
My wifes also called Matilda  
Quite confusing cause we choose to claim  
Matildas throne as our own  
Im Henry that Matildas son  
You got that  
Heres the story of our spat  
  
Verse 1  
Starts in 1135 when king Henry my father died  
And I think youll find named me Matilda as his heir  
But his nephew Stephen said  
That crown should be upon my head  
Im a man and men come first  
What Its only fair  
  
Verse 2  
Had married Geoffrey of Anjou  
Stuck in France not Waterloo  
When Steve without a voulez vous  
Took throne from me  
Should be dancing queen  
Oh stop causing such a scene  
  
Chorus  
Gimme gimme crown and take a chance on me  
Im heir to the throne not you Ahha  
Think youll get it back  
Now that Id like to see  
  
Oh I do I do I do  
  
Verse 3  
Fought in Lincoln  
She caught me  
Was proclaimed first English Lady  
But she made many enemies  
Remember me Im Stephens wife  
  
Verse 4  
Made royal councilors agree  
That she lacked femininity  
Took Stephens army and besieged her  
Eugh More strife  
  
Verse 5  
I was trapped so faked my death  
Hid in coffin held my breath  
Escaped  
You think that Im impressed  
Well Im not  
Just look who Ive got  
Your half brother want to swap  
  
Chorus  
Gimme gimme hubby and well fight again  
The winner takes it all Ahha  
In Oxford Ill besiege  
And Ill escape and then  
Ill join the battle call  
  
Verse 6  
Age 14 I fought but lost  
So Uncle Stephen stayed as boss  
Who should be ruler mamma Mia  
Here we go again  
  
Verse 7  
Sadly my darling Matilda  
Caught a fever and it killed her  
I gave up my dream  
To build a royal dynasty  
When my son died  
Had no heir which was a bind  
  
Chorus  
Gimme gimme crown cause next in line its me  
You can have it when Im done Ahha  
So Empress Matilda never did make queen  
The throne went to my son  
  
Knowing Mum knowing you  
Everybody happy Good
