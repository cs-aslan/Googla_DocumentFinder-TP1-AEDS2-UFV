A little girls dream world with ribbons and long curls  
Reflections of yesterdays past  
Now headlines and foot lights  
The hours of long nights keep everything  
Moving so fast  
  
Its taken a long time  
And shes walked a thin line  
The fame and fortune arrived  
  
She kept on striving  
Way of surviving  
Till part of those dreams came alive  
  
Chorus  
And she wishes she looks like  
They tell her she looks like all the time  
What shed give just to feel like  
She tells them shes feeling  
Just fine  
All that money she makes every night  
Aint as much as it seems  
A dollar a wrinkle and less then a nickel a dream  
  
Her heart may be breaking  
But she keeps on taking  
What she thought she wanted way back when  
Its too late to change her  
Theres always a stranger  
To tell her shes someone again  
  
Chorus  
  
Nickel a dream  
Nickel dreams
