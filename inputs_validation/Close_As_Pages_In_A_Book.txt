Well be close as pages in a book  
My love and I  
So close we can share a single look  
Share every sigh  
  
So close that before I hear your laugh  
My laugh breaks through  
And when a tear starts to appear  
My eyes grow misty too  
  
Our dreams wont come tumbling to the ground  
Well hold them fast  
Darling as the strongest book is bound  
Were bound to last  
  
Your life is my life  
And while life beats away in my heart  
Well be close as pages in a book  
Never to part  
  
Your life is my life  
And while life beats away in my heart  
Well be close as pages in a book  
Never to part
