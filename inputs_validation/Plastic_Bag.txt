1977 and we are going mad  
Its 1977 and weve seen too many ads  
1977 and were gonna show them all  
That apathys a drag  
  
My mind is like a plastic bag  
That corresponds to all those ads  
It sucks up all the rubbish  
That is fed in through by ear  
I eat Kleenex for breakfast  
And use soft hygienic Weetabix  
To dry my tears  
  
My mind is like a switchboard  
With crossed and tangled lines  
Contented with confusion  
That is plugged into my head  
I dont know whats going on  
Its the operators job not mine  
I said  
  
My dreams I darent remember  
Or tell you what Ive seen  
Ive dreamt that I was Hitler  
The ruler of the sea  
The ruler of the universe  
The ruler of the supermarket  
And even fatalistic me
