Just when everythings in order and good things fall apart  
Just when life should be resolving Im back at the beginning  
And it comes back to the heart   
Im not really sadIm not running Im looking  
Did I tell you Ive saved all your letters and cards  
Theres just nothing left for me to do here but unhook the stars  
  
Do you remember when I told you all that I could and it seemed like too
much  
Well I was living your life hoping youd never fall  
If I held on tight enough  
And letting go now is like a passport to anywhere  
With time on my hands I can make a new start  
I just didnt want to stay here and unhook the stars  
I just didnt want to stay here and unhook the stars  
  
Dont worry for me its just Im inspired  
Waiting in the wings made me drunk with possibility  
It rivals my memories
