Do you mean it   
Do you mean it   
Do you mean it   
Why dont you mean it   
Why do I follow you and where do you go  
Aah aah aah aah aah aah  
  
Youve never seen nothing like it no never in your life  
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive  
Let me tell you all about it  
And the world will so allow it  
Ooh give me a little time to choose  
Water babies singing in a lilypool delight  
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night  
  
Here comes the Black Queen poking in the pile  
Fiefo the black Queen marching single file  
Take this take that bring them down to size  
March to the Black Queen  
  
Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys  
A little nigger sugar then a rubaduba baby oil  
aah aah black on aah aah black on every finger nail and toe  
Weve only begun  begun  
Make this make that keep making all that noise  
March to the Black Queen  
Now Ive got a bellyfull  
You can be my sugarbaby you can be my honeychile yes  
  
La laa la laa la laa la laa la la la la la laa  
La laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa la laa  
A voice from behind me reminds me  
tra la laa tra la laa aaah  
Spread out your wings you are an angel  
Remember to deliver with the speed of light  
A little bit of love and joy  
Everything you do will bear a will bears a will and a why and a wherefore  
A little bit of love and joy  
In each and every soul lies a man very soon hell deceive and discover  
But even till the end of his life hell bring a little love  
  
Aah ah aah  
La la la la laa  
Ah ah ah ah aah  
Ah la la la laa  
I reign with my left hand I rule with my right  
Im lord of all darkness Im Queen of the night  
Ive got the power  now do the march of the Black Queen  
My life is in your hands Ill fo and Ill fie  
Ill be what you make me Ill do what you like  
Ill be a bad boy  Ill be your bad boy  Ill do the march of the Black
Queen  
  
Ah aah ah aah  
Ah aah ah aah  
Walking true to style  
Shes vulgar buse and vile  
Fiefo the Black Queen tattoos all her pies  
She boils and she bakes and she never dots her Is  
  
Shes our leader  
La la la la laa la la laa  
La la la la la laa  
  
Forget your singalongs and your lullabies  
Surrender to the city of the fireflies  
Dance with the devil in beat with the band  
To hell with all of you handinhand  
But now its time to be gone  la la la laaa forever  forever  
La la la laaa aaah aah aah aaah
