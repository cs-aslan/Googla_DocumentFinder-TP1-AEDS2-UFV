An El Paso hellhole I couldnt higher  
White lightning moonshine tastes like fire  
I drank for free till I couldnt see  
I fell on the floor what I said is  
  
Im blind in Texas the lone star is hot tonight  
Im blind in Texas the cowboys have taken my eyes  
I drank Dallas whiskey and lost my mind  
Had highballs in Houston three for a dime  
Everything starts to spin loaded on gin  
I fell out the door what I said is  
  
Im blind in Texas the lone star is hot tonight  
Im blind in Texas the cowboys have taken my eyes  
  
San Antonio and the West Texas town El Paso  
Corpus Christi and Waco the Yellow Rose is wild  
  
Hey dude lets party  
Raisin hell in Austin just after sundown  
When the hoosegow police decided to come roundthey said  
Boy whats the matter with you what you trying to do  
I looked at the man and I said  
  
I think Ill have another one  
We aint got no more  
What do ya mean you aint got no more liquor  
We aint got no more  
Go home what do ya mean go home  
What am I supposed to do get on a horse and ride back to LA  
The hell you say suffer  
  
Im blind in Texas the lone star is hot tonight  
Im blind in Texas Im blind Texas texas texas
