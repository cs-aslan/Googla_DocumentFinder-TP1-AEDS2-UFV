One too many days  
Ive felt forgotten  
And one too many nights  
Ive slept alone  
  
And every time I watch  
The fruit turn rotten  
I tell myself Ill  
Try a little harder  
Next time  
  
Sacred are the ties  
That love entrusts us  
Even if they fray  
Before they bind  
And Im afraid I never  
Did you justice  
So Im going to feel my  
Love a little stronger  
Make it last a little longer  
Next time  
  
Next time  
I aint gonna fall on my knees  
And come out of love empty handed  
But next time Ill be  
Even harder to please  
When will the next time be  
  
One too many days  
Ive felt forgotten  
And one too many nights  
Ive slept alone  
And every time I watch  
The fruit turn rotten  
I tell myself Ill  
Try a little harder  
Play my cards a little smarter  
Next time  
Whoa oh  
Next time
