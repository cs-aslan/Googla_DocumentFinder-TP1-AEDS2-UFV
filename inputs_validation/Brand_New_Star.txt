Every now and then you like to take it easy  
Sit right back and view the situation  
The future is brighter  
Soon well be riding on the crest of a wave  
  
Chorus  
Goodbye to all your troubles  
Change of heart the world will start today  
Its like a new beginning  
See it shining like a brand new star  
  
Well if youre thinking that youll end up crying  
Maybe all you need is to get away from friends  
And the walls around you  
Find a shore step into the sun  
  
Chorus  
  
Brand new star  
  
I wont be a burden upon your shoulder  
I will give you wings so you can fly  
To lands where youre dreams surround you  
Find a shore and step into the sun  
  
Chorus  
  
Brand new star  
Like a brand new star
