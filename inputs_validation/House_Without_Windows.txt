Im gonna move into  
A house without windows  
So I wont see you walking by walking by  
With your new love  
  
There in the darkness of  
My house without windows  
I will never see the stars that shine  
Shine on you and your new love  
  
Id rather wonder through this endless night  
Than to face the light of another lonely day  
Knowing that you wont be there  
There to share these two arms ever again  
  
Ill take all my broken dreams  
And Ill take my broken heart  
And from now on you will find me there  
Crying there trying to forget  
In my house without windows  
In my house without windows  
And without love
