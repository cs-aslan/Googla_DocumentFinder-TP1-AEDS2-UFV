Ive got a feeling 21  
Is going to be a good year  
Especially if you and me  
See it in together  
  
So you think 21  
Is going to be a good year  
It could be good for me and her  
But you and her  no never  
I had no reason to be over optimistic  
But somehow when you smiled  
I could brave bad weather  
  
What about the boy  
What about the boy  
What about the boy  
He saw it all  
  
You didnt hear it  
You didnt see it  
You wont say nothing to noone  
Ever in your life  
You never heard it  
Oh how absurd it  
All seems without any proof  
You didnt hear it  
You didnt see it  
You wont say nothing to noone  
Never tell a soul  
What you know is the Truth
