Put yourself in my place  
If only for a day  
See if you can stand  
The awful hurt I feel inside  
  
Put yourself in my place  
For just a little while  
Live through the loneliness  
The endless emptiness  
I go through  
  
And when you lose a little sleep at night  
Cause you aint been treated right  
Then you know heartaches are sad  
Sitting by the telephone  
Being left all alone  
Then you know why Im feeling bad  
Put yourself in my place  
  
And when youre just about to go insane  
Cause it hurts to love in vain  
Ask a girl whos been in love  
I believed your evil line  
Now Im left alone and crying  
Alone to count the stars above  
  
Put yourself in my place  
If only for a day  
See if you can stand  
The awful emptiness  
I feel inside  
Put yourself in my place  
  
Put yourself in my place  
For just a little while  
Why dont you try it  
Why dont you try it  
Why dont you try it baby
