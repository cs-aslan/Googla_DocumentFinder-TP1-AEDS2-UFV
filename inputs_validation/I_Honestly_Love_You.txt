Maybe I hang around here  
A little more than I should  
We both know I got somewhere else to go  
But I got something to tell you  
That I never thought I would  
But I believe you really ought to know  
  
I love you  
I honestly love you  
  
You dont have to answer  
I see it in your eyes  
Maybe it was better left unsaid  
This is pure and simple  
And you should realize  
That its coming from my heart and not my head  
  
I love you  
I honestly love you  
  
Im not trying to make you feel uncomfortable  
Im not trying to make you anything at all  
But this feeling doesnt come along everyday  
And you shouldnt blow the chance  
When youve got the chance to say  
  
I love you  
I honestly love you  
  
If we both were born  
In another place and time  
This moment might be ending in a kiss  
But there you are with yours  
And here I am with mine  
So I guess well just be leaving it at this  
  
I love you  
I honestly love you  
I honestly love you
