I aint superstitious  
When a black cat crosses my path  
And I aint superstitious  
As I break the looking glass  
Aint afraid of no demons  
Dont make me laugh  
I aint superstitious  
Under the ladder I go  
I aint superstitious  
Its all bullshit dont you know  
Aint afraid of the shadows  
I like the dark anyway and thats a fact  
Superstitious  
  
I aint superstitious  
No such thing as bad luck  
I aint superstitious  
I couldnt really give a fuck  
Take your stupid superstitions  
And find some other paranoidal  
Chickenshit sissy worm and tell it to him  
Superstitious
