Feel the pain wash over me  
Feel the salt thats burning from my eyes  
Feel the world move underneath me  
Know there is no need for my disguise  
Feel the screams as you take my hand  
  
I understand the terror in your eyes  
Feel Ive lost myself completely  
I need to know youre right here by my side  
I wont pretend that we could live forever  
  
I think its gunna be alright now  
I think its gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
Just we are just sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
I see the daylight start to fade  
I see the cold move softly with the night  
I feel the darkness stop to take me  
Now I know there is nowhere to hide  
  
Feel the world start caving in  
I feel the hollow nothing left inside  
No Ive lost myself completely  
I need to know youre right here by my side  
I wont pretend that we could live forever  
  
I think its gunna be alright now  
I think its gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
Cause we are only sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
I think its gunna be alright now  
I think its gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
Cause we are only sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
Yeah together burning bright  
dah dah dah  
We are only sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
I wont pretend that we could live forever  
I think its gunna be alright now  
I think its gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
Cause we are only sparks  
Together burning bright  
  
I get the feeling its alright now  
I get the feeling its okay  
Just close your eyes  
Cause we are only sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
I think its gunna be alright now  
I think its gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
Cause we are only sparks  
But together burning bright
