Sew this up with threads of reason and regret  
So I will not forget I will not forget  
How this felt one year six months ago i know  
I cannot forget I cannot forget  
  
Im falling into memories of you  
Things we used to do  
Follow me there a beautiful somewhere  
A place that I can share with you  
  
I can tell that you dont know me anymore  
Its easy to forget sometimes we just forget  
Being on this road is anything but sure  
Maybe well forget I hope we dont forget  
  
Im falling into memories of you  
Things we used to do  
Follow me there a beautiful somewhere  
A place that I can share with you  
  
So many nights  
Legs tangled tight  
Wrap me up in a dream with you  
Close up these eyes  
Try not to cry  
All that i got to pull me through  
Is memories of you  
  
Im falling into memories of you  
Things we used to do  
Follow me there a beautiful somewhere  
A place that we can share  
  
Falling into memories of you  
Things we used to do
