CHERRY RED  
Bee Gess  
  
Where are you  
Cherry red  sweeter than the honeycomb  
Sweeter still when were alone  
Cherry red my cherry red  
  
Turquoise green  greener than the deeper sea  
Greener still when shes with me  
Cherry red  my cherry red  
  
I wonder why wonder why  
The stars that night shine big and bright for me  
I wonder why wonder why  
Shes true to me the way that she will always be  
  
Cherry red  sweeter than the honeycomb  
Sweeter still when were alone  
Cherry red  my cherry red  
  
I wonder why wonder why  
The stars that night shine big and bright for me  
I wonder why wonder why  
Shes true to me the way that she will always be  
  
Cherry red  sweeter than the honeycomb  
Sweeter still when were alone  
Cherry red my cherry red
