One time for my freaks  
That know what to do when I  
Skeet Skeet That like it  
Hard rough face down ass up  
Yes sir That like their hair pulled  
When you beat from the back  
Thats what I like  
But mami can you really get down like that  
  
Chorus  
Shes Freaky She knows how to do what I like just right  
Shes Freaky She likes you to talk dirty all night  
Shes Freaky She likes her ass slapped when she rides  
Shes Freaky And a freak is what I need in my life  
  
One little two little three little four  
Five little six little seven little hoes  
Now calling all freaks that like blind folds  
Fi fi fo From go ahead and blow me now  
I need a freak to hold me down  
I like the way you move  
And the way you do the things you do  
Can I get at you  
Im just telling you the truth  
Maybe Im too blunt but why front  
You got it going on just pull up your skirt  
I know what to do with your thong  
Ima Pull it to the side and rub it down right  
Let me know if Im wrong  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Look at those eyes look at those thighs  
I could tell by the way she act that  
Shes Freaky and knows how to keep secrets  
And knows how to throw it back right  
Go ahead and hurt me  
Put it on me put it on me  
Throw it back like an old jersey  
I want yall I want yall  
To get loose get crunk get high get drunk  
To the point of no return take one more shot  
And feel the burn now work it out  
Shake that thing til you cant no more now  
Work it out take that thing ddown to the floor now  
Work it out Shake that thing til you cant no more now  
Work it out take that thing ddown to the floor now  
  
Chorus x2
