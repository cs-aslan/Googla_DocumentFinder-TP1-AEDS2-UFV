Just when I say  
Boy we cant miss  
You are golden  
Then you do this  
You say this guy is so cool  
Snapping his fingers like a fool  
One more expensive kissoff  
Who do you think I am  
Lord I know youre a special friend  
But you dont seem to understand  
We got heavy rollers  
I think you should know  
Try again tomorrow  
  
Cant you see theyre laughing at me  
Get rid off him  
I dont care what you do at home  
Would you care to explain  
  
Who is the gaucho amigo  
Why is he standing  
In your spangled leather poncho  
And your elevator shoes  
Bodacious cowboys  
Such as your friend  
Will never be welcome here  
High in the Custerdome  
  
What I tell you  
Back down the line  
Ill scratch your back  
You can scratch mine  
No he cant sleep on the floor  
What do you think Im yelling for  
Ill drop him near the freeway  
Doesnt he have a home  
  
Lord I know youre a special friend  
But you refuse to understand  
Youre a nasty schoolboy  
With no place to go  
Try again tomorrow  
  
Dont tell me hell wait in the car  
Look at you  
Holding hands with the man from Rio  
Would you care to explain  
  
Who is the gaucho amigo  
Why is he standing  
In your spangled leather poncho  
With the studs that match your eyes  
Bodacious cowboys  
Such as your friend  
Will never be welcome here  
High in the Custerdome
