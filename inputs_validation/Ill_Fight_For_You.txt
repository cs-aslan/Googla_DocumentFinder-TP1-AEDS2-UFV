Im turning to you when love is on my mind  
Youre all I want woman and loves so hard to find  
I know that I hurt you and I know that I was wrong  
But I want you back back where you belong  
  
And I wont give you up no I wont walk away  
I hope and I pray I hope and I pray  
Youll forgive me someday  
  
Ill fight for you Ill give you all I got to give  
Ill fight for you as long as we both should live  
Ill search for heaven each day  
And together well find a way  
And Ill fight for you darlin  
Ill fight for you baby cause Ive waited too long for love  
  
Youre all of my life and every time I look at you  
I keep tellin myself youre the one thing I just cant lose  
Our love runs so deeply cant you feel it in your heart  
Cause girl weve got something that no one can tear apart  
  
Im tellin you now this love it just cant be wrong  
Oh it cant be wrong  
And I wont give you up cause Ive waited too long  
Oh Ive waited too long for love  
  
Ill fight for you Ill give you all I got to give  
Ill fight for you as long as we should live  
Ill search for heaven each day  
And together well find a way  
And Ill fight for you darlin  
Ill fight for you
