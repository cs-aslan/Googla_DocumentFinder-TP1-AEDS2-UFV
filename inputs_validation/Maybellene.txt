Maybellene  
  
Maybellene why cant you be true  
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true  
Youve started back doing the things you used to do  
  
As I was motivatin over the hill  
I saw Maybellene in a coup de ville  
A Cadillac arollin on the open road  
Nothin will outrun my V8 Ford  
The Cadillac doin bout ninetyfive  
Shes bumper to bumper rollin side by side  
  
Maybellene why cant you be true  
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true  
Youve started back doing the things you used to do  
  
Pink in the mirror on top of the hill  
Its just like swallowin up a medicine pill  
First thing I saw that Cadillac grille  
Doin a hundred and ten gallopin over that hill  
Offhill curve a downhill stretch  
Me and that Cadillac neck by neck  
  
Maybellene why cant you be true  
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true  
Youve started back doing the things you used to do  
  
The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford  
The Ford got hot and wouldnt do no more  
It then got clody and it started to rain  
I tooted my horn for a passin lead  
The rain water blowin all under my hood  
I knew that was doin my motor good  
  
Maybellene why cant you be true  
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true  
Youve started back doing the things you used to do  
  
The motor cooled down the heat went down  
And thats when I heard that highway sound  
The Cadillac asittin like a ton of lead  
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead  
The Cadillac lookin like its sittin still  
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill  
  
Maybellene why cant you be true  
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true  
Youve started back doing the things you used to do
