Theres a little white duck sitting in the water  
Little white duck doing what he oughta  
He took a bite of a lily pad  
Flapped his wings and he said Im glad  
That Im a little white duck sitting in the water  
Quack quack quack  
  
Theres a little green frog swimming in the water  
Little green frog doing what he oughta  
He jumped right off of the lily pad  
That the little duck bit and he said Im glad  
That Im a little green frog swimming in the water  
Gulp gulp gulp  
  
Theres a little black bug floating on the water  
A little black bug doing what he oughta  
He tickled the frog on the lily pad  
That the little duck bit and he said Im glad  
That Im a little black bug floating on the water  
Quick quick quick  
  
Theres a little red snake lying in the water  
A little red snake doing what he oughta  
He frightened the duck and the frog so bad  
And he ate the little bug and he said Im glad  
That Im a little red snake lying in the water  
Sss sss sss  
  
And now theres nobody left left sitting in the water  
Nobody left doing what he oughta  
Nothing left but the lily pad  
The duck and the frog ran away  
Theres nobody left sitting in the water  
Boo hoo hoo  
  
Because of the snake that ate the bug  
That tickled the frog that went kerchug  
Theres nobody left to sing about alas and alak  
Not even the little white duck  
Quack quack quack quack
