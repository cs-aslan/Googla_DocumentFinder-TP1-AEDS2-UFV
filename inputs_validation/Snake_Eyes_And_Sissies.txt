Wrench is just a household god but I carry mine with pride  
I dont work but I can work with it to split your smile  
Run you down without a twitch your cars just not as big as mine  
Tear the son out of your bitch and sprinkle your remains with lime  
I aint no workin man I do the best I can I got the devils hand rollin
sixes  
I am the habit man I use up all I can I got the slackers hand  
My afternoons remote control daydream milk and genocide  
Tranquility with broken knees silly putty enemies  
Butter knife in your side  
What I got I got for free middle finger technology  
Whats yours is mine yours is mine told you fucker yours is mine  
Snake eyes for sissies  
I am the pedophiles dream a messianic peter pan  
Just a boy just a boy just a little fucking boy I can never be a man
