Rain comes down on a misty bay  
Light on the water and shes coming my way  
To be fair shes only wearing a smile  
Ease all my trouble just by driving me wild  
  
And like moon dont function without the night  
We come together and shes hanging on tight  
She makes me tremble like I never before  
Bringing me up to keep me begging for more  
  
In every hour to be let me satisfy your heart  
I can take the lonely days  
In return for the midsummer nights  
  
Chorus  
We know the journey to a better life better life  
And we never to be letting go  
You got to learn to be lonely to find  
What youre living for  
Making love on a midsummer night  
I love those midsummer nights   
  
There may be one fool falling in love with you  
You are the vision that Im hanging on to  
Any world any dream you can see  
Is yours and mine if we just want it to be  
  
Let me lie in your arms  
Let me understand your heart  
I can take the lonely days  
In return for those midsummer nights  
  
Chorus  
  
Making your love to me only  
Running forever Im following you  
And Im not afraid  
For every hour to be  
Let me satisfy your heart  
I can take the lonely days  
In return for those midsummer nights
