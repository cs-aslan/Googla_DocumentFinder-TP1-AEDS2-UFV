After our affair  
I swore that Id leave Dublin  
And in that line Id left behind  
The years the tears the memories and you  
  
In Dublin  
  
At the quays friends come and say farewell  
Wed laugh and joke and smoke  
And later on the boat  
Id cry over you  
  
In Dublin  
  
How can I leave the town that brings me down  
That has no jobs  
Is blessed by God  
And makes me cry  
  
Dublin  
  
And at sea with flowing hair  
Id think of Dublin  
Of Grafton Street and Derby Square  
And those for whom I really care and you  
  
In Dublin
