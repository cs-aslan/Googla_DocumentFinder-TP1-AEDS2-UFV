I have been unfaithful  
I have been unworthy  
I have been unrighteous  
And I have been unmerciful  
  
I have been unreachable  
I have been unteachable  
I have been unwilling  
And I have been undesirable  
  
Chorus  
Sometimes I have been unwise  
Ive been undone by what Im unsure of  
But because of you and all that you went through  
I know that I have never been unloved  
  
I have been unbroken  
I have been unmended  
I have been uneasy  
And Ive been unapproachable  
  
Ive been unemotional  
Ive been unexceptional  
Ive been undecided  
And I have been unqualified  
  
Chorus  
  
Unaware I have been unfair  
Ive been unfit for blessings from above  
But even I can see the sacrifice you made for me  
To show that I have never been unloved
