Sweet dreams of you  
Every night I go through  
Why cant I forget you and start my life anew  
Instead of having sweet dreams about you  
  
You dont love me its plain  
I should know Ill never wear your ring  
I should hate you the whole night through  
Instead of having sweet dreams about you  
  
Sweet dreams of you  
Things I know cant come true  
Why cant I forget the past start loving someone new  
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
