I wish we  
Were stuck up a tree  
Then wed know  
That its nicer below  
  
I dont know any lullabies  
I dont know how  
To make you mine  
But I can learn  
In lonely days long ago  
I saw lovers put on a show  
Well now its my turn  
  
Drive you home  
And then wait by the phone  
For that call  
For a walk in the fall  
  
No harm will come of this  
One little midnight kiss  
It will not burn  
Too many lonely days  
Feel like a throw away  
Well now its my turn  
  
Falling down  
Is no longer around  
Feeling sun  
Im no longer one  
Well isnt this fun
