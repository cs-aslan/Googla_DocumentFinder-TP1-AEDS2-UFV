Wide river she opens her mouth to the sea  
Singin dear dear ocean now here is a kiss from me  
And she runs like a river to the setting sun  
She runs like a river that has never been won  
She runs like a river that will always be free  
  
Wide river carry me back home  
To the place I love that I call my own  
And we can run like a river to the setting sun  
Run like a river that has never been won  
Run like a river that will always be free  
  
Wide river do you remember me  
It was not so long ago that you set me free  
And now I run like a river to the setting sun  
I run like a river that has never been won  
I run like a river that will always be free  
  
Come on baby lets run in circles  
Come on darlin lets circle each other  
And find our love all the love that we need  
  
Come on baby lets circle each other  
What we can do do for each other  
Ill do for you and youll do for me  
  
And we can run like a river to the setting sun  
Run like a river that has never been won  
Run like a river that will always be free
