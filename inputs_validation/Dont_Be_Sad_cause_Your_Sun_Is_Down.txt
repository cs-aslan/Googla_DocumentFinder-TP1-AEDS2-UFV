Dont be sad cause your sun is down you can rise above it  
Dont be sad cause youre on your own you have to learn to love it  
Dont be sad cause your sun is down youre gonna find your way  
Dont be sad cause your day is done theres another day everyday  
Everyday I wake up just the same waiting for something new  
Every night I have myself to blame for the dreams that havent come true  
But especially today Im feeling blue  
  
Dont be sad cause your son is down little mama hes bound to feel it  
Dont be sad cause your boy is blue it wouldnt do to conceal it from you  
Dont be sad cause your sun is down the night doesnt need your sorrow  
Dont be sad cause the light is gone just keep your mind on tomorrow and
carry on  
Everyday I wake up just the same waiting for something new  
Every night I have myself to blame for the dreams that havent come true  
But especially today Im feeling blue
