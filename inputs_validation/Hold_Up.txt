If the weapon is your love I got my hands up  
If the weapon is your love I got my hands up  
  
Id say hold up  
Broken out of nowhere showed up  
Im in love  
This heist got me skipping a heart beat  
Im giving up  
  
I wanna run run run away  
In your getaway car make a getaway  
  
Chorus  
If the weapon is your love I got my hands up  
If youre gonna take me down I surrender  
Ill give you anything you want  
Just dont leave me alone  
This is a hold up this is a hold up  
If the weapon is your love I got my hands up  
  
Hey stranger  
Im addicted to the danger of the touch  
Now youre wanted  
Better keep me as your hostage  
Tie me up  
  
I wanna run run run away  
In your getaway car make a getaway  
  
Chorus  
  
Everybody get down  
Get down on the floor floor  
Everybody get down  
Nobody gets hurt hurt  
  
Repeat x2  
If the weapon is your love I got my hands up  
If youre gonna take me down I surrender  
Ill give you anything you want  
Just dont leave me alone  
This is a hold up this is a hold up  
  
If the weapon is your love I got my hands up  
If the weapon is your love I got my hands up
