I feel so happy I wanna shout  
Well tell me Bing  
Tell me what its all about  
I found my one idea  
And this time Im sure its real  
  
Yip yip de hootie  
Got me a beauty  
She sure is a dream  
My baby said yes  
She said yes she said yes  
She didnt say no  
  
Cock cockadoodle  
Youre off your noodle  
Youre way off the beam  
Cause baby said yes  
She said yes she said yes  
She couldnt say go  
  
Knock me a daisy  
Now what would I do  
With a daisy all day  
You wear it and bear it  
There you sound kinda crazy  
Im happy that way

Cause baby said yes  
She said yes she said yes  
Yes she couldnt say no
