Ive got a bitter pot of je ne sais quoi  
Guess whatIm stirring it with a monkeys paw  
Since I saw you coming out of my barbers shop  
In that skimpy little halter top  
  
Did you light the candles Did you put on Kind of Blue  
Did you use that Ivy Leaage voodoo on him too  
He thinks hell be alright but he doesnt know for sure  
Like every other unindicted coconspirator  
  
Mata Hari had a house in France  
Where she worked on all her secret plans  
Men were falling for her sight unseen  
She was a genius  
  
Theres a face in every window of the Songwriters Neighborhood  
Everybodys your best friend whey youre doing wellI mean good  
The poet who lived next door when you were young and poor  
Grew up to be a backstabbing entrepreneur  
  
Albert Einstein was a ladies man  
While he was working on his universal plan  
He was making out like Charlie Sheen  
He was a genius  
  
When you dropped me and you staked your claim  
On a VIP who could make your name  
You latched on to him and I became  
A minor inconvenience  
  
Your protege dont care about art  
Im the one who always told you you were smart  
You broke my heart into smithereens  
And that took genius  
  
You and the barber make a handsome pair  
Guess whatI never liked the way he cut your hair  
I didnt like the way he turned your head  
But theres nothing I can do or say I havent done or said  
  
Everybody needs a place to stand  
And a method for their schemes and scams  
If I could only get my record clean  
Id be a genius
