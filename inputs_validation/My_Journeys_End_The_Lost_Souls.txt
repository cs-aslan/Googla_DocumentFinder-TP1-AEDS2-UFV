Well I climb the highest mountain and I swim the deepest sea  
If I knew you were riding at my journeys end and waiting for me  
And Ill be there I know that youll love me  
I know whatever that youll say and I know any way  
If I knew you were waiting there at my journeys end  
  
Somehow it makes fine ways til the end of the earth  
But it really doesnt matter what I say Ill come back someday  
  
Now I know someone whos telling and I said now that it makes  
If I knew you were there at my journeys end  
To be mine for the rest of my day but now it really doesnt matter  
Now I really if I may say cause I go anywhere  
If I knew you were waiting there at my journeys end  
Whoa oh oh at my journeys endOh oh oh oh atmyjourneysend
