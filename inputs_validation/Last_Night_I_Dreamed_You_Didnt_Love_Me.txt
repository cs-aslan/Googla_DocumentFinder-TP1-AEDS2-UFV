You kissed my fingers and made me love you  
Last night when we went to hell  
When the bloodstarred curtain fell  
Men were turning on their machines making everything mean  
Fires burned cold values clashed  
Good and evil were all dry grass  
No childghost no singing bird no last laugh no last word  
  
Oh last night I dreamed  
Last night I dreamed darkly nurtured dreams  
None of them were quite as frightening  
Oh Canada emptied there was me featureless and freezing  
Last night I dreamed you didnt love me  
  
You kissed my fingers and made me love you  
  
Last night you left me derelict  
And disappeared for ages  
You said honey save those tears of yours for the show  
Oh last night I dreamed  
Last night I dreamed darkly nurtured dreams  
None of them were half as frightening  
Oh Canada emptied there was me beside you  
Featureless and freezing  
Last night I dreamed you didnt love me  
You didnt love me  
  
Whats happening to you  
Why dont you love me like you used to  
When you kissed my fingers and you made me love you  
When you kissed my fingers and you made me love you  
  
Last night I dreamed  
Last night I dreamed darkly nurtured dreams  
None of them none as frightening  
Oh awake empty and out of sleep  
You were beside me gently breathing  
Last night I dreamed you didnt love me  
  
You didnt love me  
You didnt love me  
Why dont you love me like you used to  
When you kissed my fingers and you made me love you
