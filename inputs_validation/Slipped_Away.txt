Youre a soul with no religion  
Theres ice in your embrace  
In your dance of indecision  
I see the anger in yor face  
A little drink to help my vision  
A little something for the pain  
Theres no drug for my condition  
Theres no sweetness in the taste  
  
Tell me where the rides gonna lead you  
Do I have to pay to be your friend  
Theres nothing left to say  
When you slipped away  
  
I can see you fading fast  
I wont let you take me  
When you slipped away  
I can see your burning stare  
Nothings gonna shake me  
As you slip away  
  
Youre a world of blind ambition  
Staring through the looking glass  
You will meet your own collision  
When your conscience comes to ask  
  
Steal the love from those around you  
Help yourself to everything  
Take the shelter that surrounds you  
It leaves you standing in the rain  
  
Tell me if the money can heal you  
Do I have to pray to make it end  
Theres nothing left to say when you slipped away  
  
I can see you fading fast  
I wont let you take me  
When you slipped away  
I can see your burning stare  
Nothings gonna shake me  
As you slip away  
As you slip away
