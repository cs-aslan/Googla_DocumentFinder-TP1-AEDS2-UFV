Halleys Comet Isaida Halleys Comet  
  
How could you know that I lived in a desperate world  
How could you dream that we were all made out of stone  
What is the truth what is the faithful lasting proof  
What is the central theme to this everlasting spoof  
Knock on my windows link up the chains  
Its gotta be easy no splinters no pain  
Its Cadillac rainbows and lots of spaghetti  
And I love meatballs so you better be ready  
Im going down to the central part of town  
Im going down to the central part of town  
Central part of town Im going down  
Im going down to the central part of town  
Halleys Comet over doowop  
What did I do  
And dont be blamin eat my cashew  
For everything I do to get the story  
And everything I do to pull me in  
And everything I say to get the title  
But when they use it on me I reject it  
What would you do if you ate my daddys shoes  
What would you say if it was naturally for you  
How would you feel if it rained on   
How would you like to have your thick strawberry goo  
Im sinking down its a glorious feeling  
To make a big difference my body is reeling  
Even Carl Sagan cant shine my shoes  
Cause I know deep inside its got to   
mighty fine something  
Im going down to the central part of town  
Im going down to the central part of town  
Im going down to the central part of town  
Im going down to the central part of town
