Amazing how we all want this life a little more everyday  
Its crazy how we pick ourselves up just to let us down anyway  
The one thing that youre missing is loungin on the log right next to you  
So pick up that precious something and relax for a delicate few

Its crazy how we all need this time a little more every way  
Its wild how we stay up nights losing part of the day  
The one time that youre loathing is there for you oh so well  
So pick up that precious someone relax for a delicate spell  
  
Rising up early the sun barely before me I could have sworn I just went to
bed  
I smell the blizzard in the air Winters bitter love affair  
I grab my coat my hat my jacksI put my hat on my head and I was off again
as she said  
Rising up early the sun barely before me I could have sworn I just laid my
head to bed about an  
hour ago  
  
Blizzard in the air Winters bitter love affair  
I grab my coat again hat on my head lit my jack and I was off again she
said  
Rising up early that sun rose barely before me I could have sworn I just laid
my head to bed  
Ive got to but it was so cold Ive got trouble keeping hold of my lady
sleeping next to me  
  
But I swear today Im gonna go off in a delicate way and Ill have so much
fun I swear  
No matter what goes wrong Ill be moving on  
I promise you jack in my mouth hat on my head and I was off again she said  
Relax for a delicate few  
  
Just me and you  
I swear to you true I do  
Relax for a delicate few
