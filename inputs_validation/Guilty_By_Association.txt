Youve been sanctified  
And Ive been tried  
Guilty by association  
  
Youve been canonized  
And Ive been fried  
Guilty by association  
  
All the little loonies  
With a salient obsession  
Come out from the boonies  
With their sharpies and their guns  
And were loaded with questions  
  
Guilty by association  
Guilty by association  
  
Youve been idolized  
And Ive been tried  
Spoken Ive been tried  
Guilty by association  
  
Youve been terrorized  
And Ive been fried  
Guilty by association  
  
All the little loonies  
With a salient obsession  
Come out from the boonies  
With their sharpies and their guns  
Theyre all loaded with questions  
  
Loaded with questions
