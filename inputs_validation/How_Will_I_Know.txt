Theres a boy I know hes the one I dream of  
Looks into my eyes takes me to the clouds above mm mm  
Oh I lose control cant seem to get enough uh huh  
When I wake from dreaming tell me is it really love ooo  
  
How will I know Dont trust your feelings  
How will I know  
How will I know Love can be deceiving  
How will I know  
How will I know if he really loves me  
  
I say a prayer with every heart beat  
I fall in love whenever we meet  
Im asking you what you know about these things  
How will I know if hes thinking of me  
I try to phone but Im too shy cant speak  
Falling in love is so bitter sweet  
This love is strong why do I feel weak  
  
Oh wake me Im shaking wish I had you near me now uh huh  
Said theres no mistaking what I feel is really love ooo tell me
