Todays the Macys Day parade  
The night of the living dead is on its way  
With a credit report for duty call  
Its a lifetime guarantee  
Stuffed in a coffin ten percent more free  
Redlight special at the mausoleum  
  
Give me something that I need  
Satisfaction guaranteed to you  
Whats the consolation prize  
Economy sized dreams of hope  
  
When I was a kid I thought  
I wanted all the things that I havent got  
Oh I learned the hardest way  
Then I realized what it took  
To tell the difference between  
Thieves and crooks  
Lesson learned to me and you  
  
Give me something that I need  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
Because Im thinking about  
A brand new hope  
The one Ive never known  
Cause now I know  
Its all that I wanted  
  
Whats the consolation prize  
Economy sized dreams of hope  
Give me something that I need  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
Because Im thinking about  
A brand new hope  
The one Ive never known  
And where it goes  
And Im thinking about  
The only road  
The one Ive never known  
And where it goes  
  
Because Im thinking about  
A brand new hope  
The one Ive never known  
Cause now I know  
Its all that I wanted
