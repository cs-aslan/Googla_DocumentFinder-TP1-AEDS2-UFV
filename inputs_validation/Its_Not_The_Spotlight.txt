If I ever feel the light again shining down on me  
I dont have to tell you what a welcome it will be  
I felt the light before but I let it slip away  
But I still keep on believing that itll come back some day  
  
Its not the spotlight its not the camra light  
Its not the street lights of some old street of dreams  
It aint the moonlight not even the sunlight  
But Ive seen it shining in your eyes and you know what I mean  
  
Some times I try to tell myself the light was never real  
Just a fantasy that used to be the way I used to feel  
But you and I know better even though its been so long  
If your memory really serves you well youll never tell me no wrong  
  
Its not the spotlight its not the camra light  
Its not the streetlights of some old street of dreams  
It aint the moonlight not even the sunlight  
But Ive seen it shining in your eyes you know what I mean  
  
So if I ever feel the light again shining down on me  
I dont have to tell you what a welcome it would be  
I felt the light before but I let it slip away  
But I still keep on believing that itll come back some day  
  
Its not the spotlight its not the camra light  
Its not the streetlights of some old street of dreams  
It aint the moonlight not even the sunlight  
But Ive seen it shining in your eyes and you know what I mean
