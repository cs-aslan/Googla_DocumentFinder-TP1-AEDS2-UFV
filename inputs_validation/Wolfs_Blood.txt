You dont know what Ive spoken to  
While Ive been gone  
Know what Ive gotta do and  
You wont kill me  
Cause of my head  
  
My blood feels wolfs blood  
Pumping in my veins  
When I feel like murdering a baby  
And I feel my heart extend  
And I feel my muscles break  
And I feel my gums extend  
And I know Im not a man  
And I still dont have my head  
  
My blood its wolfs blood  
Pumping in my veins  
When Im killing a five year old  
And I feel my heart extend  
And I feel my muscles break  
And I feel my gums extend  
And I know Im not a man oh  
  
You dont know what Ive spoken to  
While Ive been gone  
You dont know what Ive gotta do and  
You wont kill me  
Cause of my head  
  
My blood its wolfs blood  
Pumping in my veins  
When Im killing a five year old  
And Im gonna take him up  
To my house on a hill  
I know why youre dead
