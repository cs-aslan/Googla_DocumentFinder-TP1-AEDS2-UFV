You just gotta walk on both sides of the line  
Youve thrilled at the thought of each strangers arms you find  
Everything thats yours to hold just cant satisfy your mind  
Cause you just gotta walk on both sides of the line  
If you had me in a mansion filled with gold  
If I lay at your feet my heart and my soul  
Youd still crave the grapes on your next door neighbors vine  
Cause you just gotta walk on both sides of the line  
  
You just gotta walk  
Cause you just gotta walk on both sides of the line
