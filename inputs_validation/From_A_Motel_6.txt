You shouldnt hide but you always do  
Cause even when youre gone I can see right through  
You want disconnection  
You want me there enough for two  
pull a woollen blanket across my eyes  
Dream a quiet place for us to fight  
Oh no your heart is broken  
Dont you think thats a little trite  
I climb where I can see  
Youre close but I wont reach  
Blank stare at the tv  
CNNs on channel 3  
in the passing lane on 1 and 9  
Stuck in sad car stuck in drive  
Oh no your heart is broken  
Well you can have whats left of mine  
I climb where I can see  
Youre close but I wont reach  
Blank stare at the TV  
The howling IIs on channel 3  
Oh I drift off to sleep  
While the snow falls on the screen
