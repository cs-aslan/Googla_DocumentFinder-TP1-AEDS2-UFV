It was a Monday night when you told me it was over babe  
And by the Friday night I knew that I would be okay  
Dont say it was a good thing  
Dont say it was the right thing to do  
Dont say it was the best thing for the both of us  
When Im the one playing the fool  
  
What do you want from me when I just wanna restart  
You keep coming back for me when youre the one who tore us apart  
The truth is Im better on my own  
And I dont wanna live in the past  
So let me restart  
So let me restart  
So let me restart  
  
Youve been lightin up my phone  
Worried that Ill be alone tonight  
Wanna to make sure that Im fine  
But baby youre not on my mind no more  
I know it was the best thing for the both of us  
Cause youre the one who looks like a fool  
  
What do you want from me when I just wanna restart  
You keep coming back for me when youre the one who tore us apart  
The truth is Im better on my own  
And I dont wanna live in the past  
So let me restart  
So let me restart  
So let me restart  
  
So let me restart  
  
What do you want from me when I just wanna restart  
You keep coming back for me when youre the one who tore us apart  
And the truth is Im better on my own  
And I dont wanna live in the past  
So let me restart  
So let me restart  
So let me restart  
So let me restart  
So let me restart
