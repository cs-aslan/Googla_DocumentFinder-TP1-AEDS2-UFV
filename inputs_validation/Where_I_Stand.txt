Haa huh  
Well Im a wreck and Im a tangle  
And though I try to find an angle  
Cant find my way around you  
No matter what I do  
And nothings right since you left me  
My life was full but now its empty  
Cant find my way around you  
You say that you cant see a way  
No matter what I do  
That I can be a part of you  
It doesnt matter what I do  
Tried every trick that I can think of  
But you dont seem to think its true love  
You take no notice of me  
Oh my chance has passed me by  
Oh why cant you see  
See a way to change your mind  
Just let me know and Ill keep trying  
All my confidence is gone  
I was pretty sure that you would come along  
Thought that I would be your man  
But now I never know just where I stand with you  
I used to be the kind of guy  
Who could be in your arms before youd realize  
Now the tables have been turned  
If you play with fire you know you sure get burned  
Now all my confidence is gone  
I was pretty sure that you would come along  
Thought that I would be your man  
But now I never know just where I stand with you  
Oh where I stand with you  
Just where I stand where I stand where I stand with you  
I never know you had to go  
Where I stand with you  
You broke my heart it came apart  
Where do I stand with you  
Where I stand  
Where I stand  
Where I stand  
Where I stand  
Just where I stand with you  
Where I stand with you  
I never know  
I never know  
You have to go  
Where I stand with you
