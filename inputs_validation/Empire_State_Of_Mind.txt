Yeah Im out that Brooklyn now Im down in Tribeca  
Right next to Deniro but Ill be hood forever

I used to cop in Harlem all of my Dominicanos  
Right there up on Broadway pull me back to that McDonalds  
Took it to my stash box five sixty State Street  
Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons with them pastries  
Cruisin down eighth Street off white Lexus  
Drivin so slow but BK is from Texas

Now I live on billboard and I brought my boys with me  
Say whatup to TyTy still sippin mai tais  
Sittin courtside Knicks and Nets give me high five

Tell by my attitude that Im most definitely from

But I got a gang of brothers walkin with my clique though  
Welcome to the melting pot corners where we sellin rock  
Africa Bambata home of the hiphop  
Yellow cab gypsy cab dollar cab holla back  
For foreigners it aint for they act like they forgot how to act  
Eight million stories out there in it naked

Lights is blinding girls need blinders  
So they can step out of bounds quick  
The sidelines is lined with casualties who sip to life casually  
Then gradually become worse dont bite the apple leaf  
Caught up in the incrowd now youre in style  
End of the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out  
City of sin its a pity on the wind  
Good girls gone bad the citys filled with them  
Mommy took a bus trip now she got her bust out  
Everybody ride her just like a bus route  
Hail Mary to the city youre a virgin  
And Jesus cant save you life starts when the church end  
Came here for school graduated to the high life  
Ball players rap stars addicted to the limelight  
MDMA got you feelin like a champion  
The city never sleeps better slip you an Ambien
