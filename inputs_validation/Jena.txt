An all white jury hides the executioners face  
See how we are me and you  
Everyone here needs to know their place  
Lets keep this blackbird hidden in the flue  
  
Chorus  
Oh oh oh Jena  
Oh oh oh Jena  
Oh oh oh Jena  
Take your nooses down  
  
So what becomes of boys that cannot think straight  
Particularly those with paper bag skin  
Yes sir no sir well wipe that smile right off your face  
Weve got our rules here and you must fit in  
  
Chorus  
  
Some day some way sanity will prevail  
But who knows when that day might come  
A shot in the dark well it just might find its way  
To the hearts of those that hold the keys to kingdom come  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Take those nooses all down
