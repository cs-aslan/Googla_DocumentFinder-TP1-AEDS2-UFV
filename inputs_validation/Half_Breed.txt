My father married a pure Cherokee  
My mothers people were ashamed of me  
The Indians said I was white by law  
The white man always called me  
Indian Squaw  
  
Chorus  
Halfbreed thats all I ever heard  
Halfbreed how I learned to hate the word  
Halfbreed shes no good they warned  
Both sides were against me  
Since the day I was born  
  
We never settled went from town to town  
When youre not welcome you dont hang around  
The other children always laughed at me  
Give her a feather shes a Cherokee  
  
Chorus  
  
We werent accepted and I felt ashamed  
Nineteen I left them tell me whos to blame  
My life since then has been from man to man  
But I cant run away from what I am  
  
Chorus
