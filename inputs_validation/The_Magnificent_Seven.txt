Ring Ring Its 700 AM  
Move whyself to go again  
Cold water in the face  
Brings you back to this awful place  
Knuckle merchants and you bankers too  
Must get up an learn those rules  
Weather man and the crazy chief  
One says sun and one says sleet  
AM the FM the PM too  
Churning out that boogaloo  
Gets you up and gets you out  
But how long can you keep it up  
Gimme Honda Gimme Sony  
So cheap and real phony  
Hong Kong dollars and Indian cents  
English pounds and Eskimo pence  
  
You lot What  
Dont stop Give it all you got  
You lot What  
Dont stop Yeah  
  
Working for a rise better my station  
Take my baby to sophistication  
Shes seen the ads she thinks its nice  
Better work hard  I seen the price  
Never mind that its time for the bus  
We got to work  an youre one of us  
Clocks go slow in a place of work  
Minutes drag and the hours jerk  
  
When can I tell em wot I do  
In a second maaanoright Chuck  
  
Wave bubbubbubbye to the boss  
Its our profit its his loss  
But anyway lunch bells ring  
Take one hour and do your thanng  
Cheeesboiger  
  
What do we have for entertainment  
Cops kickin Gypsies on the pavement  
Now the news  snap to attention  
The lunar landing of the dentist convention  
Italian mobster shoots a lobster  
Seafood restaurant gets out of hand  
A car in the fridge  
Or a fridge in the car  
Like cowboys do  in TV land  
  
You lot What Dont stop Huh  
  
So get back to work an sweat some more  
The sun will sink an well get out the door  
Its no good for man to work in cages  
Hits the town he drinks his wages  
Youre frettin youre sweatin  
But did you notice you aint gettin  
Dont you ever stop long enough to start  
To take your car outta that gear  
Dont you ever stop long enough to start  
To get your car outta that gear  
Karlo Marx and Fredrich Engels  
Came to the checkout at the 711  
Marx was skint  but he had sense  
Engels lent him the necessary pence  
  
What have we got Yeho magnificence  
  
Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi  
Went to the park to check on the game  
But they was murdered by the other team  
Who went on to win 50nil  
You can be true you can be false  
You be given the same reward  
Socrates and Milhous Nixon  
Both went the same way  through the kitchen  
Plato the Greek or Rin Tin Tin  
Whos more famous to the billion millions  
News Flash Vacuum Cleaner Sucks Up Budgie  
Oooohhbubbye
