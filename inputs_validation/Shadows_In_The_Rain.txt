I woke up in my clothes again this morning  
I dont know exactly where I am  
And I should heed my doctors warning  
He does the best with me he can  
  
He says I suffer from delusion  
But Im so confident Im sane  
It cant be an optical illusion  
So how can you explain  
Shadows in the rain  
  
And if you see us on the corner  
Were just dancing in the rain  
I tell my friends there when I see them  
Outside my window pane  
Shadows in the rain
