You know  
You decorate the garage wall  
Hang in peoples halls  
Live in secret drawers  
If you could look around you  
Wonder what youd see  
  
Fiction  
Thats all you really are I know  
Editorial dreams  
They cant make you real  
Tell me where you came from  
And where youre going to  
  
I wont ever no Ill never get to know her  
Or be the cause of anything she does  
I wont ever no Ill never get to hold her  
Do you think this aching could be love  
  
Oh you know  
Youve figured in some fantasies  
You would not believe  
What youve had to do  
Life goes on around you all because of you  
  
I wont ever no Ill never get to know her  
Or be the cause of anything she does  
I wont ever no Ill never get to hold her  
Do you think this aching could be love  
  
You know  
That in twenty years or more  
You still look the same  
As you do today  
Youll still be a young girl  
When Im old and grey  
  
I wont ever no Ill never get to know her  
Or be the cause of anything she does  
I wont ever no Ill never get to hold her  
Do you think this aching could be love
