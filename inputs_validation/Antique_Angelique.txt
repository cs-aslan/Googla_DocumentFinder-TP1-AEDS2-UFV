Theres a grandfather clock in the corner  
With a smile on its face  
Chairs and tables expensive labels  
Velvet curtains and lace  
Every day when I go in there  
I will buy a thing or two  
But money cant buy everything  
Cos what I really want is you  
  
Oh Antique Angelique you mean more to me  
Than everything I have  
Oh Antique Angelique you mean more to me  
Than everything I have  
  
Now my house is an empty garden  
And the shop is so bare  
All these things that I bought mean nothing  
Cos Angelique is still there  
Its too late now to forget her  
She means far too much to ignore  
Now Im haunted with memories  
That I just cant stand anymore  
  
Oh Antique Angelique you mean more to me  
Than everything I have  
Oh Antique Angelique you mean more to me  
Than everything I have  
  
Take back the table the velvet and lace  
The chairs and the clock with the smile on its face  
Take them all and stand them where they were before  
  
Antique Angelique you mean more to me  
Than everything I have  
Oh Antique Angelique close the door and now  
Youre everything I have  
Antique Angelique you mean more to me  
Than everything I have  
Antique Angelique
