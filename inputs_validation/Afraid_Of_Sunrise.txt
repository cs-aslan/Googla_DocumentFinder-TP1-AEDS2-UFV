Dressed in black no turning back  
We blanked out on the Great White Way  
Fingers in desires crack  
Wed bridge and tunnel into day  
Abandoned to the salt of skin  
Abandoned to the highway  
Sand running in the hourglass  
Heat of leather and mirages  
  
So how do we now come to be afraid of sunlight  
So how do we now come to be afraid of sunlight  
  
DayGlo Jesus on the dash  
Scorch marks on the road ahead  
Friendly fire in hostile waters  
Keep the faith dont lose your head  
Dont lose your head  
  
So how do we now come to be afraid of sunlight  
Afraid of Sunlight  
  
Agave flower  
Sleep beside me  
Driving on  
Nevadas burning  
Phoenix rising  
Driving on  
To sunlight  
  
DayGlo Jesus on the dash  
Scorch marks on the road ahead  
Friendly fire in hostile waters  
Keep the faith dont lose your head  
Dont lose your head  
  
So how do we now come to be afraid of sunlight  
How do we now come to be afraid  
Afraid of sunlight
