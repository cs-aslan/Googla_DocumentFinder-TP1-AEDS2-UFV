Another sleepless night  
I sit alone and cry  
Twilight time til dawn  
Memories linger on  
Since we said goodbye  
  
Throughout that sleepless night  
No matter what I do  
Youre always on my mind  
And though youre gone I find  
Im still in love with you  
  
Shadows fall and I recall  
The love that you once had for me  
Miss you so when lights are low  
I think of things that use to be  
  
Youre always in my heart  
Although youre out of sight  
Lonely teardrops burn  
As I toss and turn  
Another sleepless night  
  
Although youre out of sight  
Lonely teardrops burn  
As I toss and turn  
Another sleepless night
