We hate it when our friends become successful  
We hate it when our friends become successful  
Oh look at those clothes  
Now look at that face its so old  
And such a video   
Well its really laughable  
Ha ha ha  
  
Chorus  
We hate it when our friends become successful  
And if theyre Northern that makes it even worse  
And if we can destroy them  
You bet your life we will  
Destroy them  
If we can hurt them  
Well we may as well  
Its really laughable  
Ha ha ha  
  
You see it shouldve been me  
It couldve been me  
Everybody knows  
Everybody says so  
They say   
  
Ah you have loads of songs  
So many songs  
More songs than theyd stand  
  
We hate it when our friends become successful  
We hate it when our friends become successful  
Oh look at those clothes  
Now look at that face its so old  
And such a video   
Well its really laughable  
Ha ha ha  
  
Chorus  
  
Just listen  
La lala lala
