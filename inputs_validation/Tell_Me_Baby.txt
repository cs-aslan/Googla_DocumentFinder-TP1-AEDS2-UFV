They come from every state to find  
Some dreams were meant to be declined  
Tell the man what did you have in mind  
What have you come to do  
  
No turning water into wine  
No learning while youre in the line  
Ill take you to the broken sign  
You see these lights are blue  
  
Come and get it  
Lost it at the city limit  
Say goodbye  
Cause they will find a way to trim it  
Everybody  
Lookin for a silly gimmick  
Gotta get away  
Cant take it for another minute  
  
This town is made of many things  
Just look at what the current brings  
So high its only promising  
This place was made on you  
  
Chorus  
Tell me baby whats your story  
Where you come from  
And where you wanna go this time  
Tell me lover are you lonely  
The thing we need is  
Never all that hard to find  
Tell me baby whats your story  
Where you come from  
And where you wanna go this time  
Youre so lovely are you lonely  
Giving up on the innocence you left behind  
  
Some claim to have the fortitude  
Too shrewd to blow the interlude  
Sustaining pain to set a mood  
Step out to be renewed  
  
Ill move you like a baritone  
Jungle brothers on the microphone  
Getting over with an undertone  
Its time to turn to stone  
  
Chitty chitty baby  
When your nose is in the nitty gritty  
Life could be a little sweet  
But life could be a little shitty  
What a pity  
Boston and a Kansas city  
Looking for a hundred  
But you only ever found a fitty  
  
Three fingers in the honeycomb  
You ring just like a xylophone  
Devoted to the chromosome  
The day that you left home  
  
Chorus x 2
