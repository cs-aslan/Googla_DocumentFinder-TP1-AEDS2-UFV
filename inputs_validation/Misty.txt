Look at me  
Im as helpless as a kitten up a tree  
Ah Im walkin on a cloud  
I cant understand Lord  
Im misty holdin your hand  
  
Walk my way  
And a thousand violins begin to play  
Or it might be the sound of your hello  
That music I hear Lord  
Im misty the moment youre near  
  
You can say that youre leadin me on  
But its just what I want you to do  
Dont ya notice how hopelessly Im lost  
Thats why Im followin you  
  
Ooh on my own  
Should I wander through this wonderland alone now  
Never knowin my right foot from my left  
My hat from my glove Lord  
Im misty and too much in love  
  
You can say that youre leadin me on  
But its just what I want you to do  
Dont ya notice how hopelessly Im lost  
Thats why Im followin you  
  
Ooh on my own  
Should I wander through this wonderland alone now  
Never knowin my right foot from my left  
My hat from my glove Lord  
Im misty and too much in love  
  
Misty too much in love  
Misty too much in love  
Misty  
Misty too much in love
