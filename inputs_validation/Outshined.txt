I got up feeling so down  
I got off being sold out  
Ive kept the movie rolling  
But the storys getting old now  
I just looked in the mirror  
Things arent looking so good  
Im looking California  
And feeling Minnesota oh yeah  
So now you know who gets mystified  
  
Show me the power child  
Id like to say  
That Im down on my knees today  
It gives me butterflies  
Gives me away  
Till Im up on my feet again  
Im feeling outshined  
  
Someone let the dogs out  
Theyll show where the truth is  
The grass is always greener  
Where the dogs are shedding  
Im feeling that Im sober  
Even though Im drinking  
I cant get any lower  
Still I feel Im sinking  
So now you know who gets mystified  
  
Show me the power child  
Id like to say  
That Im down on my knees today  
It gives me butterflies  
Gives me away  
Till Im up on my feet again  
Im feeling outshined
