Their shadows danced closer on the honky tonk walls  
As the band plays the last verse to that goin home waltz  
And theyll start to peril neath the parking lot moon  
And some cars and a pickup wont be picked up til noon  
  
Somewhere between midnight and daylight  
Its an after hours merrygoround  
Somewhere between midnight and daylight  
Theres a whole lot of love lost and found  
  
I wish I could say now that Ive learned it all  
From my observations as a fly on the wall  
But if lonesomes a crime oh Im guilty as sin  
Cause tomorrow Ill pickup my ol pickup again  
  
Somewhere between midnight and daylight  
Its an after hours merrygoround  
Somewhere between midnight and daylight  
Theres a whole lot of love lost and found  
Theres a whole lot of love lost and found
