The life that Ive been living  
From the day I first drew breath  
Has been my way of forgetting  
Im on the journey to my death  
  
You make my soul rise up  
You make my eyes to see  
When I place my faith in you  
And I lose my belief in me  
  
The less I believe in me  
The more I believe in thee  
The less I believe in me  
The more I believe in thee  
  
I dont believe in beads or crystals  
Instant karma or mother earth  
I dont believe that what I think  
Makes any difference to what Im worth  
  
I dont believe in reincarnation  
Im not coming back as a flower  
I dont bow my head to kings or priests  
Cause I believe in your higher power  
  
The less I believe in me  
The more I believe in thee  
The less I believe in me  
The more I believe in thee  
  
Oh youve given me a plan  
That I dont understand  
Cause Ive wandered over half the world  
But Ive remained an ignorant man  
  
One thing That I know  
Is when the final bell tolls  
Human love wont be enough  
Good deeds cant save my soul  
  
Well Im not afraid of dying  
But I am afraid of you  
Because you hear me when Im lying  
And you see the things I do  
  
So the hands go round the clock  
As the light goes from the room  
And I cant help thinking to myself  
Im going to find out much to soon  
  
Oh youve given me a plan  
That I dont understand  
Cause Ive wandered over half the world  
But Ive remained a ignorant man  
  
One thing that I know  
Is when the final bell tolls  
Human love wont be enough  
Good deeds cant save my soul  
I believe etc etc
