Down town  
Im homeward bound  
The city lights are looking bright tonight  
  
No love  
Lost between us  
When I see you things are looking up  
  
Although its cold inside Im warm  
Devoid of worries no love is forlorn  
  
How can I say what must remain unspoken  
Dont want to spoil all that we said before  
So many crybaby hearts to be broken  
Dont want to join in with their crazy wars  
  
You tease  
I try to please  
Though I know im not looking my best tonight  
  
Hard pressed  
Youve had the rest  
Of all the choices time to make your mind up  
  
And though you smile youre sad inside  
But do not worry cause Ill make it right  
  
How can I say what must remain unspoken  
Dont want to spoil all that we said before  
So many crybaby hearts to be broken  
Dont want to join in with their crazy wars  
  
How can I say what must remain unspoken  
Dont want to spoil all that we said before  
So many crybaby hearts to be broken  
Dont want to join in with their crazy wars  
  
How can I say what must remain unspoken  
Dont want to spoil all that we said before  
So many crybaby hearts to be broken  
Dont want to join in with their crazy wars
