I told you before dont you hear what I say  
I wont take it no more no more making me stay  
Down on my knees you know Im down on my knees yea  
Yes Ive been down on my knees  
But Im through begging please  
I wont get back on my knees  
  
Nobody knows what your putting me through  
Nobody knows if its worth it for you  
Nobody sees you got me down on my knees  
Well Ive been down on my knees  
And Im through begging please  
Dont put me back on my knees  
  
You know how I always loved you  
Never placed myself above you  
  
Dont let me go if I wish that I could  
Dont tell me no if I wish that you would  
Down on my knees you know Im down on my knees  
Well Ive been down on my knees  
But Im through begging please  
Dont put me back on my knees
