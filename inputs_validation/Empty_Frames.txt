I can feel the raindrops  
Slowly falling  
And they calling for  
They keep calling for  
My knight in shining armour  
Come and save me  
Cause Im drowning in pain  
  
Ive been hurt  
By his mistakes  
So come and take me away  
I put him first  
I thought hed stay  
But he couldnt weather the storm  
So he left me the rain  
  
Over time pictures fade  
All thats left are these empty frames  
Sleepless nights and stormy days  
Ive got proof that people change  
And all thats left are these empty frames  
All thats left are these empty  
  
Can you hear these teardrops  
In my pillow  
They keep falling cause  
I kept falling for your dozen thorny roses  
Now Im bleeding  
And Im lonely again  
  
Now Im hurt  
Its my mistake  
I should have known right away  
I put him first  
I thought hed stay  
But he couldnt weather the storm  
So he left me the rain  
  
Over time pictures fade  
All thats left are these empty frames  
Sleepless nights and stormy days  
Ive got proof that people change  
Long after the smiles all fade away  
All this endless pain  
All this empty space  
  
Sleepless nights and stormy days  
Ive got proof that people change  
Over time pictures fade  
And all thats left are these empty frames  
  
Over time pictures fade  
All thats left are these empty frames  
Sleepless nights and stormy days  
All thats left are these empty  
  
Over time pictures fade  
And all thats left are these empty frames  
Sleepless nights and stormy days  
Ive got proof that people change  
  
All thats left are these empty frames
