Say something shout it from the rooftops off your head  
Make it sort of mean something make me understand  
Or Ill forget  
The people here on lifes beaches  
They wish upon the waves that hide the sand  
Let them know that life theaches you  
To build a castle in your hand  
Maybe the songs that we sing are wrong  
Maybe the dreams that we dream are gone  
Bring it on home and it wont be long  
Its getting better man  
  
Hey what was that you said to me  
Just say the word and Id be free  
And when the stars are shining bright  
Were getting better man  
  
And crashing in upon a wave  
Its calling out beyond the grave  
And were the fire in the sky  
Were getting better man  
  
Build something build a better place and call it home  
Even if it means nothing youll never ever feel that your alone  
  
Cos maybe the songs that we sing are wrong  
Maybe the dreams that we dream are gone  
Bring it on home and it wont be long  
Its getting better man  
  
Hey what was that you said to me  
Just say the word and Id be free  
Yeah as the fire in the sky  
Its getting better man  
  
And crashing in upon a wave  
Its calling out beyond the grave  
And when the stars are shining bright  
Its getting better man  
  
Its getting better man  
  
And what was that you said to me  
You told me one day Id be free  
And when the fires burning bright  
Im getting better man  
  
And crashing in upon a wave  
Its calling out beyond the grave  
And when the stars are in the sky  
Were getting better man  
  
Were getting better man  
Were getting better man  
Were getting better man
