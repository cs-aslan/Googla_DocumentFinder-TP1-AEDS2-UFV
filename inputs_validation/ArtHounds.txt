Arthounds look like nothing  
  
So Arthounds write something  
And those that do are judged by those  
Who tried and found they couldnt do  
  
Arthounds see the Greek ideal  
And gaze on what theyll never feel  
Oh the pitiless revenge of those without friends  
The pitiless the pitiless revenge  
  
Arthounds know whats around  
Because theyve seen it somewhere written down  
And everything theyve seen on the moving screen  
Helps them fill up the page  
  
In European museums  
Will I see you  
Will I see you  
Will I see you  
Will I see you  
In European museums  
Will I see you  
  
My life is opera  
My life is opera  
My life is opera  
My life is opera  
  
Arthounds in a restaurant  
They bring along their loving Aunt  
But when they cant find a table for their fat Aunt Mable  
They stamp their feet and cry

Arthounds very funny very witty but very lonely  
And below the belt is shriveled and small  
It functions only as a word

And below the belt is shriveled and small  
It knows a thousand woes

If you cannot stand this fake world

Take my hand  
If you cannot stand this fake world

If you cannot stand this fake world  
Take my hand

I take 16 pills to send me to sleep  
And 16 pills to shake me awake
