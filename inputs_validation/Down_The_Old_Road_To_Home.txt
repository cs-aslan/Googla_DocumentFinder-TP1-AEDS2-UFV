Im thinking of you while here all alone  
Im wishing and longing for you and for home  
Id give this whole world if I could only say  
Im climbin that old hill headin that way  
For Im lonesome and blue for some place to roam  
And I wish it could be down that old road to home  
With a troubled mind and a heart full of pain  
Ive searched this whole world for fortune and fame  
But Im longing to be with you once again  
So we could go strolling down old memry lane  
  
Theres a little white house on the top of the hill  
Not very far from an old sawmill  
And Id give this world if I could only say  
Im climbin that old hill heading that way  
For Im lonesome and blue for some place to roam  
And I wish it could be down that old road to home
