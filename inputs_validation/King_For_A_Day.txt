Everyones creeping up to the money god  
Putting tongues where they didnt ought to be  
On stepping stones of human hearts and souls  
Into the land of nothing for free  
  
Well the way that were living  
Is all take and no giving  
Theres nothing to believe in  
The loudest mouth will hail the new found way  
To be king for a day  
  
Everyones licking up to the new king pin  
Trying to get way up with a smile  
Sing for your supper boy and jump to a finger click  
Aint my way of living in style  
  
Cause the ladder gets longer  
And ambition gets stronger  
I cant satisfy the hunger  
That bad old moon has got you in its sway  
To be king for a day  
  
Youre only here once so you got to get it right  
No time to fuss and fight  
Cause life dont mean much if measured out with someone elses plight  
In time youll see the light  
  
Cause the way that were living  
Is all take and no giving  
Theres nothing to believe in  
The loudest mouth will hail the new found way  
To be king for a day
