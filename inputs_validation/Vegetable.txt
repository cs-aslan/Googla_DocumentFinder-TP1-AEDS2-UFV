I never wanted anything like this  
I worked hard tried hard  
I ran around in domestic bliss  
I fought hard died long  
Every time youre running out of here  
Every time youre running I get the fear  
  
I never wanted any broken bones  
Scarred face no home  
Your words surround me and asphyxiate  
And I burn all hate  
  
Every time youre running out on me  
Every time youre running I can see  
  
Im not a vegetable  
I will not control myself  
I spit on the hand that feeds me  
I will not control myself  
  
The waters spray the waters run all over me  
The waters spray the waters run  
And this time you gonna pay  
  
Im not a vegetable  
I will not control myself  
I spit on the hand that feeds me  
I will not control myself
