Im just your fool cant help myself  
I love you baby and no one else  
I aint crazy you are my baby

To still love you baby and take your mess

You must be tryin to drive me crazy  
Treat me the way you do

Gonna buy me a shotgun shoot it at you  
I aint lyin no use a jivin  
Im just your fool  
  
Im just your fool cant help myself  
I love you baby and no one else  
I aint crazy you are my baby  
Im just your fool
