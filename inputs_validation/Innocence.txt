It wouldnt take a long time to explain what lies between us  
And it wouldnt take a genius to work out what the scene is  
It might just take a pilot to give you a natural high  
But youre sending off those bottle tops for your free piece of mind  
And are you just waving or drowning  
Its so hard to tell when youre so far away  
Oh innocence has passed you by a long long time ago  
I was the fly upon your wall and I saw what you know  
Your pornographic priestess left you for another guy  
You frighten little children and you always wonder why  
Always wonder why  
The mercury is rising and its not all that surprising  
In the land of milk and honey where you make big money  
And it always keeps the rain off and it always keeps you dry  
But back home the people hate you and you never did know why  
But I think Im going to tell you  
Just give me fifty thousand lire for my thoughts  
Oh innocence has passed you by a long long time ago  
I was the fly upon your wall and I saw what you know  
The supermarket checkout girl once smacked you in the eye  
When you eat no one else does but you always wonder why  
Always wonder why  
It would take a gunshot just to clear your head awhile  
And after all this time how can you stand there  
Look at me and smile  
Now are you just waving or drowning  
Its so hard to tell when youre so far away  
Oh innocence has passed you by a long long time ago  
I was the fly upon your wall and I saw what you know  
Degeneration suits you now Im going home to cry  
You wont be seeing me again but youll always wonder why  
Always wonder why
