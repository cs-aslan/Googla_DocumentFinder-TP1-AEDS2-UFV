Lord I dont know which way I am going  
Which way the river gonna flow  
Its just seems that upstream I keep rolling  
Still got such a long way to go  
Still got such a long way to go  
  
Then at last its your right I know I swear  
Well find somewhere the streets are paved with gold  
But its fly split the sky  
But thats all right sometimes  
The sunlight comes streaming through the holes
