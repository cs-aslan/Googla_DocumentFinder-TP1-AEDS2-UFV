Looks like she really did you in  
Youre a broken hearted lover  
Just tryin to recover  
You need to find a place to mend  
All your time aint necessary  
But I dont want to be a temporary thing  
Gimme just half a chance  
  
When this woman loves a man  
Shell do anything she can  
To keep the fire alive in your soul  
And when all the chips are down  
Im still gonna be the one around  
To build you up and be your friend  
When this woman loves  
When this woman loves a man  
  
Dont play it cool no dont be shy  
Oh theres no need to worry  
No Im not in a hurry  
So let your conscience be your guide boy  
Come here and let me show you  
Just how much I adore you  
Let me help you understand  
  
When this woman loves a man  
Shell do anything she can

To build you up and be your friend  
When this woman loves  
When this woman loves a man
