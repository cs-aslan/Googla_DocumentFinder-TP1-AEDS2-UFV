Say what you mean  
Mean what you say  
Say what you mean  
Mean what you say  
Think about the words  
That youre using  
Speak for yourself  
Say whats on your mind  
Think about the life  
That youre choosing  
Whenever you need somebody  
Whenever youre looking  
For somebody who knows  
When trouble wont leave you alone  
  
Say what you mean  
Mean what you say  
Look into the world of tomorrow  
Say what you want  
Want what is true  
Check out of the room  
Full of sorrow  
Im ready to take you with me  
Im ready to be the one  
Whos there by your side  
When youve just got  
Nowhere to hide  
  
And oh  
The angels will walk with you  
Whenever you need them  
Yeah the glory that comes with love  
Yeah yeah yeah  
And oh  
The treasure that waits for us  
Whenever we need it  
Now I just cant hold it back  
Yeah yeah yeah Yeah yeah yeah  
  
The work and the pain  
The thunder and the rain  
The word of the earth has been spoken  
The bird on the wing  
Free as the wind  
Knowing that the spell  
Has been broken  
Now you can laugh with meaning  
Now you can throw away  
The cloak of disguise  
As you turn your face  
To the sky  
  
The blue of the night  
The secrets of the light  
The touch of the hand  
That can lead you  
I known you recognize  
The shiver of surprise  
Then you realize  
That hes seen you  
Into the strange unknown of love  
Standing before me  
How your nakedness shows  
Now I just cant leave you alone  
  
Ah oh  
Im ready to take you now  
Whenever you want to go  
Yeah my heart is there for you  
Yeah yeah yeah  
And oh  
The glory that comes with love  
For always and ever now  
Now you can feel me love  
Yeah yeah yeah Yeah yeah yeah  
Say what you mean mean what you say  
Tell me about the love that youre feeling  
Say what you mean what you say
