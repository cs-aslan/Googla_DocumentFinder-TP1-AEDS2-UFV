Hey little girl with the red dress on  
Theres a party tonight down in  
Yeah and Im goin if you need a ride  
Come on come on lets go tonight  
  
Well baby the dreamers  
They ride down the streets with death in their eyes  
And the new worlds defeat baby it eats your eyes  
Come on come on lets go tonight  
I said come on come on lets go tonight  
  
Well a man  
And he lost his wife  
He walks down the streets babe with death in his eyes  
Well everybody wants heaven  
But nobody wants to die  
Come on come on lets go tonight  
Baby come on come on lets go tonight  
I said come on come on lets go tonight
