Anythings hard to change  
But hey I got you down on your knees again  
You watch the sky  
Its a pale parade of passing clouds  
That cover  
The bed upon which we laid  
In the dark  
And the memories that I made  
Of a laughing girl  
But youre just my toy  
And I cant stop playing with you baby  
  
Chorus  
If you think you need to go  
If you wanted to be free  
Theres one thing you need to know  
And thats that you cant count on me  
  
Coming along real good  
But I still cant do most of the things I should  
I watch the sky coming down to bury me and  
I cant stop this crawling out of my skin  
I know that you see yourself flying in  
Out of the sky  
Coming down  
To carry me  
But I wont come out  
  
Chorus  
  
No you cant count on me  
  
I watched all of the same parades  
As they passed on the days that you wish youd stayed  
All this pain gets me high  
And I get off and you know why  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Aw you cant count on me  
No you cant count on me
