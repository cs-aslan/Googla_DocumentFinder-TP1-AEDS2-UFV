Weve been seeing what you wanted got us cornered right now  
Fallen asleep from our vanity might cost us our lives  
I hear theyre getting closer  
Their howls are sending chills down my spine  
And time is running out now  
Theyre coming down the hills from behind  
  
When we start killing  
Its all coming down right now  
From the nightmare weve created  
I want to be awakened somehow  
I want to be awakened right now  
  
When we start killing it all will be falling down  
From the Hell that were in  
All we are is fading away  
When we start killing  
  
Weve been searching all night long but theres no trace to be found  
Its like they all have just vanished but I know theyre around  
I feel theyre getting closer  
Their howls are sending chills down my spine  
And time is running out now  
Theyre coming down the hills from behind  
  
When we start killing  
Its all coming down right now  
From the nightmare weve created  
I want to be awakened somehow  
I want to be awakened right now  
  
When we start killing it all will be falling down  
From the Hell that were in  
All we are is fading away  
When we start killing  
When we start killing  
  
I feel theyre getting closer  
Their howls are sending chills down my spine  
And time is running out now  
Theyre coming down the hills from behind  
  
The sun is rising  
The screams have gone  
Too many have fallen  
Few still stand tall  
Is this the ending of what weve begun  
Will we remember what weve done wrong  
  
When we start killing  
Its all coming down right now  
From the nightmare weve created  
I want to be awakened somehow  
I want to be awakened right now  
  
When we start killing it all will be falling down  
From the Hell that were in  
All we are is fading away  
When we start killing  
When we start killing  
When we start killing
