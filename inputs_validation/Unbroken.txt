If I lived and breathed before you loved me I dont recall  
If I walked around at all it was in bits and pieces  
Of a jagged heart  
You kissed me and every piece went back in place every pain got erased  
You held me up to the sunlight now it feels like  
  
No one ever left me out in the rain  
Cold words still remain unspoken  
And I never got lost spent years in the dark  
Youre here now my hearts unbroken  
When I see you smile feel my soul again  
And Im unbroken  
  
If I doubted the power of love baby now I understand  
I thank God for every day I wake up to the soft touch  
Of your magic hands  
In this world sometimes the only thing thats real is the way you make me feel  
Babe the changes day and night  
I swear its life  
  
No one ever left me out in the rain  
Cold words still remain unspoken  
And I never got lost spent years in the dark  
Youre here now my hearts unbroken  
When I see you smile feel my soul again  
Im unbroken  
  
I still see the night I fell into your eyes  
And when we made love it felt like the first time  
  
No one ever left me out in the rain  
Cold words still remain unspoken  
And I never got lost spent years in the dark  
Youre here now my hearts unbroken  
When I see you smile feel my soul again  
Im unbroken  
  
Im unbroken oh yeah  
Im unbroken  
  
No one ever left me out in the rain  
Cold words still remain unspoken  
And I never got lost spent years in the dark  
Youre here now my hearts unbroken  
No one ever left me out in the rain  
Cold words still remain unspoken  
I never got lost spent years in the dark  
Youre here now my hearts unbroken  
No one ever left me out in the rain
