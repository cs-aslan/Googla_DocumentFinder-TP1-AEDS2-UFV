I will dedicate  
And sacrifice my everything  
For just a seconds worth  
Of my storys ending  
Ill be willing to  
Never come in suddenly  
Will I ever get to see  
The ending to my story  
  
Chorus  
Show me what its for  
Make me understand it  
Cause Ive been crawling in the dark  
Looking for the answer  
Is there something more  
Than what Ive been handed  
Cause Ive been crawling in the dark  
Looking for the answer  
  
You carry on  
Show me  
Its ok to  
Use my heart and not my eyes  
To navigate the darkness  
Will the ending be  
Ever coming suddenly  
Will I ever get to see  
The ending to my story  
  
Chorus  
  
So when and how will I know  
How much further will I have to go have to go  
How much longer til I finally know finally know  
Because Im looking and I just cant see  
Whats in front of me  
In front of me  
  
Chorus
