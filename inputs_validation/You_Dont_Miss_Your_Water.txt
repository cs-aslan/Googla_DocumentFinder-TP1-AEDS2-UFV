In the beginning  
You really loved me oh  
I was too blind  
I could not see now  
  
But now that you left me  
Ooh how I cried out I keep crying  
You dont miss your water  
Till your well are undried  
  
I kept you crying  
Sad and blue oh my oh  
I was a playboy  
I just wouldnt be true  
  
But now that you left me  
Good Lord how I cried I keep crying I keep crying  
Ooh Ive been miss my water  
No I never miss my water  
Till my well are undried  
  
I sit here and wonder  
How in the world this could be my oh my  
I never thought oh I never thought  
You ever leave me  
  
But now that you left me  
Good Lord good Lord how I cried out  
You dont miss your water  
You dont miss your water  
Till your well are undried  
  
Ooh You dont miss your water oh  
You dont miss your water  
Till your well are undried  
I miss my water  
I keep missing my water  
I keep missing my water  
And I want my water  
I need my water  
I love my water  
And I want my water  
And Im little destined now  
And Im little destined now  
I want my water  
I need wanting my water
