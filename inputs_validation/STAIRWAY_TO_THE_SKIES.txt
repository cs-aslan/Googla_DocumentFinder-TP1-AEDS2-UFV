Seven seconds to the rise  
Cant believe Im still alive  
And heaven was waiting for me  
I thought this would be the end  
But I know youll understand  
All that is keeping me here  
  
I dream of a stairway to the skies  
My angel is coming down from heaven to take me  
I reach out but then you fade away  
Whenever you call for me  
Know that Im only one step behind  
  
I sense this time I may have changed  
But one this still remains  
Im torn and the hate still lingers  
I slowly start to realize  
We wont reunite  
I still have to march on through  
  
I dream of a stairway to the skies  
My angel is coming down from heaven to take me  
I reach out but then you fade away  
Whenever you call for me  
Know that Im only one step behind  
  
Is it a curse or a fortune  
Have I been blinded by regret  
Redemption awaits  
My soul is at stake  
Will I find a stairway to the skies  
In the end  
  
I dream of a stairway to the skies  
My angel is coming down from heaven to take me  
I reach out but then you fade away  
Whenever you call for me  
Know that Im only one step behind  
Know that Im only one step behind
