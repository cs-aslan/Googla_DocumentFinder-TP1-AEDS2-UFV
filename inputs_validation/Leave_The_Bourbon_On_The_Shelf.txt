Shakin like the Devil when she lets me go  
Got a new place and how its so much better  
Falling over myself the televisions on  
I turn it off and smile  
Oh Jennifer you know I always tried  
Before you say goodbye  
  
Leave the bourbon on the shelf  
And Ill drink it by myself  
And I love you endlessly  
Darling dont you see Im not satisfied  
Until I hold you tight  
Give me one more chance tonight  
And I swear Ill make it right  
But you aint got time for this  
And that wreckin bell is ringin  
And Im not satisfied  
Until I hold you  
  
Jennifer tell me where I stand  
And whos that other boy holdin your hand  
Oh Jennifer you know Ive always tried  
Before you say goodbye  
  
Leave the bourbon on the shelf  
And Ill drink it by myself  
And I never liked your hair or those people that you lie with  
And Im not satisfied  
Until I hold you tight  
And I love you endlessly  
Darling dont you see I cant be satisfied  
Until I hold you tight  
  
Leave the bourbon on the shelf  
And Ill drink it by myself  
And I love you endlessly  
Darling dont you see  
Im not satisfied
