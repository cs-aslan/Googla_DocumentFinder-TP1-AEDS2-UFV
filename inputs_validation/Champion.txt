I dont even care  
No more  
Thats my word  
Thats for sure  
I dont even cry  
No more  
Thats absurd  
Im so cured  
  
Im so secure  
With who I is  
Oops who I am  
And Im a champion  
For sure boy  
Im a champ  
Oh yes I am  
  
But what  
I thought about  
When those people  
Put me down  
They can laugh  
For now  
But watch it  
When I turn  
This thing around  
I know I believe  
Aint nobody gonna do  
It but me  
Im fly no lie  
Im the truth  
Baby ask me why  
  
Im a champion  
Im a champion  
  
What you say  
Dont stick  
Im the best  
And I know it  
I know you tried  
To bring me down  
Look at me now  
Watch my smile  
  
Im so secure  
With who I am  
And Im a champion  
For sure  
Im a champ  
Oh yes I am  
  
But what  
I thought about  
When those people  
Put me down  
They can laugh for now  
But watch it  
When I turn  
This thing around  
I know I believe  
Aint nobody gonna do  
It but me  
Im fly no lie  
Im the truth  
Baby ask me why  
  
Im a champion  
Im a champion  
  
Keep your head up  
They hatin  
Cause you  
Majored in minor  
Gonna celebrate  
Like you won  
The finals  
Hold your trophy up  
In your parade  
In your honor  
And pour some champagne  
And put your glass  
To the sky  
Cause you a champion  
Youre a champion  
  
Im a champion  
Im a champion
