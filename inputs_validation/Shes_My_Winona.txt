Lifes just a pay stub on death  
Only less diligent  
And when the two collide  
Its no coincidence  
The lights are on and everybodys home  
  
The only thing suicidal here is the door  
We had a good run  
Even I have to admit  
Lifes just a pay stub on death  
Only less diligent  
  
Chorus  
Hell or Glory  
I dont want anything in between  
Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes  
Daddy said you gotta show the world the thunder  
Oh the thunder  
Oh the thunder  
Oh the thunder  
Oh  
  
Oh  
  
We didnt come to compete  
This is a demonstration  
Even the young ones become irrelevant  
They always bring up how you changed Oh oh  
Never the same person when I go to sleep  
As when I wake up as when I wake up  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh whoa  
Oh whoa  
  
Chorus  
  
He said Bring the thunder  
  
The thunder  
Oh the thunder  
Whoa
