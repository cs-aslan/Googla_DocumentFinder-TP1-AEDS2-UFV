Well youve got me dancing in a figure of eight  
Dont know if Im coming or going Im early or late  
Round and round the ring I go  
I want to know I want to know  
Why cant we travel a continuous line  
Make love reliable covenant all the time  
Up and down the hills I go I got to know I got to know  
Is is better to love another  
Than to go go for a walk in the dark  
Is it better to love than to give in to hate  
Yeah wed better take good care of each other  
Avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow  
Its better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eight  
  
Well figure it out for yourself little girl  
It dont go nowhere at all  
Its nothing more than a tape loop in a big dance hall  
  
Youve got me running  
  
Youve got me running
