We were standing all alone  
You were leaning in to speak to me  
Acting like a mover shaker  
Dancing to Madonna then you kissed me  
And I think about it all the time  
Sweet temptation rush all over me  
And I think about it all the time  
Passion desire so intense I cant take anymore because  
  
I feel the magic all around you  
Its bringing me to my knees  
Like a wannabe  
Ive got to be chained to you  
  
And when you look into my eyes  
Felt a sudden sense of urgency  
Fascination casts a spell and  
You became more than just a mystery  
And I think about you all the time  
Is this fate is it my destiny  
That I think about you all the time  
I no longer pretend to have my hand on the wheel because  
  
I feel the magic all around you  
Its bringing me to my knees  
Like a wannabe  
Ive got to be chained to you  
  
And I think about it all the time  
And I think about it all the time  
Tell me its madness I barely know you  
We were standing all alone  
You were leaning in to speak to me  
Ten steps back youre still a mystery  
Acting like a mover shaker  
Dancing to Madonna then you kissed me  
I cant take anymore because  
  
I feel the magic all around you  
Its bringing me to my knees  
Like a wannabe  
Ive got to be chained to you  
  
Tell me its madness  
I barely know you
