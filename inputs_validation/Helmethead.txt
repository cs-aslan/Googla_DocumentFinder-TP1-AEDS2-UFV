I was just seventeen when I made the AHL  
I couldnt skate in junior but my fists rang like a bell  
Ill never win a title and Ill never win the cup  
But when it comes to ladies Ive had the best of luck  
  
My first one was a sly one hanging round the rink  
But they sent me off to Cornwall as fast as you could blink  
In Moose Jaw I was right in love the daughter of the coach   
He traded me for nothing didnt take to my approach  
  
So goodbye fare thee well  
Theres no time for delay  
Youll see me at the faceoff or catch the playbyplay  
So goodbye fare thee well  
Im glad you shared my bed  
But never trust a fellow with a helmet on his head  
  
Chantal was from Moncton elle a jouer avec moi  
A tongue as sharp as razors but she had a fancy car  
Her husband was a bruiser played senior in Quebec  
If hed had the rights of it it would have been my neck  
  
Nancy couldnt watch me fight shed always be in tears  
Waving from the bleachers and screaming in my ears  
Dee I should have married and we had a dandy fling  
But I had a one way contract blew the money for the ring  
  
I should have sent a letter and it would have been polite  
But Im cleaning out my locker and time is getting tight  
Im calling from the station perhaps another day  
Cause theyre calling up a rookie and theyre trading me away
