Cant you feel the change  
aka People Oh People  
People Oh People  
There are mountains in our way  
We got brother against brother  
How will we stand on judgment day  
  
Oh People oh people  
We gotta find a better way  
If we keep fighting  
If we keep dividing  
Tell me where will the children play  
  
Chorus  
Cant you feel the change  
Cant you feel the change  
Cant you feel the change  
  
People oh people  
Hear every word I say  
We come in all different colors  
No ones above the other  
We are all the same  
  
People oh people  
Lets put hatred to an end  
In our hearts we have the answer  
In our souls we have the power  
Together we can make a change  
  
Chorus  
  
People  
Cant you see the walls tumbling down  
People cant you feel the chains breaking down  
A revolution is going down  
A revolution is going down
