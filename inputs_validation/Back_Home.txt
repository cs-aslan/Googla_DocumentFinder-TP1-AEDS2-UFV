Dont know  
What I was looking for  
When I went home  
I found me alone  
And sometimes  
I need someone to say youll be all right  
Whats on your mind  
But the waters shallow here  
And I am full of fear  
And empty handed after two long years  
  
Another sunny day in California  
Im sure back home theyd love to see it  
But what they dont know is what you love is ripped away  
Before you get a chance to feel it  
  
Back home  
I always thought I wanted so much more  
Now Im not too sure  
Cause sometimes  
I miss knowing someones there for me  
And feeling free  
Free to stand beside  
The ocean in moonlight  
And light myself a smoke beneath the  
Dark Atlantic sky  
  
Another sunny day in California  
Im sure back home theyd love to see it  
But what they dont know that what you love is ripped away  
Before you get a chance to feel it  
  
Everybody here is living life in fear  
Of falling out alive  
Tearing lives apart and breaking lots of hearts  
Just to pass the time  
And the eyes get red in the back of your head  
This place will make you blind  
Put it all behind me and  
Ill be just fine  
  
Another sunny day beneath this cloudless sky  
Sometimes I wish that it would rain here  
And wash the west coast dreaming from my eyes  
Theres nothing real for them to see here  
  
Another starry night in California  
Im sure back home theyd love to see it  
But they dont know that what you love is ripped away  
Before you get a chance to feel it
