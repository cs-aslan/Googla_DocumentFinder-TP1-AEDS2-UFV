Noone else I know can thrill me like you do  
I only ever want to GoGo dance with you  
Youre the dreamboy on my bedroom poster  
Now were on a rollercoaster ride  
  
Chorus  
Youre the greatest gift that I could ever wish for  
And theres not a single thing I wouldnt give for a little time with you  
My Kookachoo  
Cause Im so in love with you  
  
Noone else can take me to the highs like you  
You show me all the colours when Im feeling blue  
Youre the brightest shining lights on Broadway  
Pink in evening sunsets every day  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Even at night when Im sleeping  
You are all Im ever dreaming of
