  
Ive tried to ignore  
All the stench of your life  
Only holding back  
For my wife  
Even she has seen  
Your poisoned soul displayed  
Seen each move youve made  
Contaminate degrade  
  
Whos this juvenile  
Whos this infantile clown  
Hes not ever worth  
Knocking down  
Stamp your tiny foot  
My precious little lamb  
Bleat ad nauseam  
But i dont give a damn  
  
Where to go heart ever hounded  
Coward no  spirit confounded  
Always hoping belief will bring release  
God alone can give me peace  
Watching me scream and hate  
Only choosing when its too late  
  
May this imbecile  
Cause your heart to feel joy  
You did after all  
Choose the toy  
Do you now suppose  
Ill leave with no reply  
Basic laws apply  
An eye demands an eye  
  
Where to go heart ever hounded  
Coward no  spirit confounded  
Always hoping belief will bring release  
God alone can give peace  
Watching me scream and hate  
Only choosing when its too late
