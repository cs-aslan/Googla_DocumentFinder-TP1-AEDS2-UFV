Ill be your loaded dice  
Youre holding all the cards  
You set the tone whenever Im with you  
You make up all the rules  
In this game of fools  
I see your signals change  
They go from green to red  
Its always stop and go  
When the colors are changing  
Never let on never let on  
Look to the left look to the right  
Why cant you look me straight in the eye  
Chorus  
1098  
Im always counting down  
You feel the pressure when youre under the gun  
654  
Im always counting down  
Isnt it funny I never get to one  
Ill be your only chance  
I play the only role  
I go the distance whenever Im with you  
You make up all the rules  
In this game of fools  
You keep me in the dark  
Im walking on the wire  
Im on the edge  
Its always my time for falling  
Never let on never let on  
Look to the left look to the right  
Why cant you look me straight in the eye  
Chorus
