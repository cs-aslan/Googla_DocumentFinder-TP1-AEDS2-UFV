  
Theres a new world comin and its just around the bend  
Theres a new world comin this ones comin to an end  
Theres a new voice callin you can hear it if you try  
And its growin stronger with each day that passes by  
  
Theres a brand new mornin rising clear and sweet and free  
Theres a new day dawnin that belongs to you and me  
Yes a new worlds comin the one weve had visions of
