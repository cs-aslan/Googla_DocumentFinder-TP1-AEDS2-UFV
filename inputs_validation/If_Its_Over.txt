Wont you talk to me  
This is so out of hand  
Somethings gone wrong  
With the life that we planned  
  
Wont you look at me  
Youre avoiding my gaze  
And it seems like youve changed  
In so many ways  
  
Chorus  
It isnt fair  
It isnt right  
If its really gone  
Then tell me tonight  
If its over  
If its over  
Let me go  
  
Wont you speak to me  
Im just here holding on  
Cause baby I really dont need to wait around  
If the feeling is gone  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont need no apologies  
Im not looking for no sympathy  
All Im asking for  
Is for your honesty  
  
Wont you give it to me  
Give it to me now  
  
It isnt fair  
It just isnt right  
Cause if its really gone  
Youve got to say the word tonight  
  
If its over  
If its over  
Wont you let me know  
Baby if its over  
  
If its over  
Over  let me go
