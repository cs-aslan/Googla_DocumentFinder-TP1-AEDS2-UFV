When it comes to giving you the best of me  
I dont know why I dont know why  
I dont even have to try  
When it comes to holding true  
These words I say  
I look at you one look at you  
How can I turn my head away  
  
With the sound of your voice  
Like the whispering wind  
Dont you know Ill be there  
When you call anytime you call  
  
Chorus  
Maybe its the power of love  
Maybe ya can feel it when you get enough  
Maybe its the power of love  
I dont know  
  
When it comes to needing you  
I call your name  
And youll be there youll be right there  
Shining through the pouring rain  
When it comes to seeing through  
The fool in me the thing I found  
One thing Ive found  
Lover you never let me down  
  
When the sound of your voice  
Like the whispering wind  
Lets me know youll be there  
When I call anytime I call  
  
Chorus
