Crossing every ocean for the sake of locomotion  
Crossing every ocean for the sake of locomotion  
  
Across every ocean  
For the sake of locomotion  
But I wouldnt have a notion  
How to save my soul  
I walk down the sidewalk  
Run down the boardwalk  
Stop and make small talk  
But I cant say no to you  
  
I cant say no I cant say yes  
I cant even write down my own address  
I cant touch heaven its a little too far  
Its the only way to travel  
Got dreaming on a par  
Im staring through the window  
Wondering where you are  
Moving through the landscape at a million miles an hour  
  
Across every nation  
From the harbour to the station  
Its a form of inspiration  
Its a power to the state  
They run down the railways  
Sail across the seaways  
Fly through the airways  
But they cant say no  
To you  
  
I cant stand up I cant stand still  
I know you wouldnt like it if I told you how I feel  
I just want to say that its only common sense  
But the words always fail me at my own expense  
Im staring out the window  
Wonder where you are  
Moving through the landscape at a million miles an hour  
  
Across every ocean  
For the sake of locomotion  
But I wouldnt have a notion  
How to save my soul  
I walk down the sidewalk  
Run down the boardwalk  
Stop and make small talk  
But I cant say no to you
