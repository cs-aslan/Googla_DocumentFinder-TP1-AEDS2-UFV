Cant forget his face  
What a lonely place  
Has he really let us flow  
All the time thats lost  
Whats the final cost  
Will I really get away  
All my life it seems  
Just a crazy dream  
Reaching for somebodys star  
Cant believe it all  
Did he really fall  
What to do now I dont know  
  
Somethings calling me back  
Its a light in the black  
Am I ready to go  
Im coming home  
  
Breathed the air before  
Heard the thunder roar  
Never knew it was for me  
Always looking down  
Lost but never found  
Eyes to look but not to see  
All my life it seems  
Just a crazy dream  
Reaching for somebodys star  
Like an open door  
That youve passed before  
But you never had the key  
  
Somethings calling me back  
Theres a light in the black  
Am I ready to go  
Im coming home  
Im coming home  
Yeah  
Im going back to my home  
  
Im going home home home  
Going home home home  
Im coming back  
  
Cant forget his face  
What a lonely place  
Has he really let us flow  
All the time thats lost  
Whats the final cost  
Will I really get away  
All my life it seems just a crazy dream  
Reaching for somebodys star  
Cant believe it all  
Did he really fall  
What to do now I dont know  
  
Somethings calling me back  
Like a light in the black  
Yes Im ready to go  
Im coming home  
Home yeah  
Im on my way back home  
Look to the sky  
There in the sky  
I see a star
