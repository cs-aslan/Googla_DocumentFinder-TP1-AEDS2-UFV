Girl things aint been goin too good for me  
Girl Im living in the middle of a mystery  
Youre the one that can turn me on  
N now that youre gone  
I said Girl Im livin in the middle of your memory  
Girl youre still the figure in my favorite fantasy  
I know you know thats the way it goes  
And still my love grows  
  
I said all o the good all o the good ones are taken  
All o the good all o the good ones are taken  
  
Im hangin around with my head in the air  
Watchin the lovers go by  
I had a lover but she never cared  
All you could say was goodbye  
Maybe I was mistaken maybe I got it wrong  
But all of the good ones are taken from now on  
N girl Im livin in the middle of a broken dream  
I said girl all this fallin in love aint like it seems  
Out in the rain cant you feel my pain  
Again n again n again n again n again  
All of the good all o the good ones are taken  
Maybe I was mistaken maybe I got it wrong  
But all of the good ones are taken in my song
