Not too long ago when she was mine  
I thought we would be together til the end of time  
Thats the way it goes when youre in love  
Since shes gone theres no one else Im thinking of  
Chorus  
I need her to stay with me  
Lay me down and pray for me  
Now I know just where I stand  
Heaven help this lonely man  
  
There will never be anyone else  
Never be another one to take her place  
Might as well give up I cant go on  
Never find another one to fill this empty space  
  
Chorus  
  
When she came to me she opened my eyes  
Suddenly life was worth living  
Now its over for me I realize  
Nothings the same since shes gone  
And I cant go on  
  
Repeat
