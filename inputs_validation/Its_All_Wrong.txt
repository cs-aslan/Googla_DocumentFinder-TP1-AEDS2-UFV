Whats it gonna be today  
Keep chipping at my soul  
And why must it disobey  
The only thing I loathe  
  
How many times a day must I die  
Nothings gonna work today  
Im killing time  
Looking all around to find a way  
Its all wrong  
Knowing that my demon won  
Im done  
  
Have I been lead astray  
Blaming the righteous  
What do you think theyd say  
Attacking the altar  
  
How many times a day must I die  
Nothings gonna work today  
Im killing time  
Looking all around to find a way  
Its all wrong  
Knowing that my demon won  
Im done  
Im done  
  
Im done with faceless feelings  
Im done with anything  
Im done trying to support you  
and sacrificing everything  
  
Everything everything  
  
How many times a day must I die  
Nothings gonna work today  
Im killing time  
Looking all around to find a way  
Its all wrong  
Knowing that my demon won  
Im done
