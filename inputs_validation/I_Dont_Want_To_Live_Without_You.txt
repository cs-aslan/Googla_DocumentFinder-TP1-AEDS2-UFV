I find myself in a strange situation  
And I dont know how  
What seemed to be an infatuation  
Is so different now  
I cant get by if were not together  
Ooh cant you see  
Girl I want you now and forever  
Close to me  
Im longing for the time  
Im longing for the day  
Hoping that you will promise to be mine  
And never go away  
  
I dont want to live without you  
I dont want to live without you  
I could never live without you  
Live without your love  
  
I ask myself but theres no explanation  
For the way I feel  
I know Ive reached the right destination  
And I know its real  
  
Im longing for the time  
Im longing for the day  
When Ill be giving you this heart of mine  
Believe me when I say  
  
I dont want to live without you  
I dont want to live without you  
I could never live without you  
Live without your love  
  
No I dont want to live without you  
I dont want to live without you  
I could never live without you  
Live without your love  
  
Now I dont want to live without you  
I dont want to live without you  
I could never be without you  
Be without your love  
  
I dont want to live without you  
Live without your love  
Live without your love  
You see Im lost without your love  
  
Ooh oh  
Without your love
