Something isnt right  
I get the feeling Im not driving  
Something hasnt quite  
Taken over but its trying  
  
Check it check it  
  
The question now is time  
The hours pass so slowly  
I know were moving out of line  
But thats the risk youre taking with me  
  
I flicker like an old film  Black white  
Im losing track of whats real  I know  
My sense of timings not quite  OK  
Maybe Ill stay tonight  So so  
  
Fadeout as in lose  
My character is shrapnel  
Broken by the views  
Of men who claim to know all  
There is to know  
  
Something isnt right  
I get the feeling I am noone  
Something hasnt quite  
Stopped me from being someone  
  
Nothing in the mirror  Check it  
No photo by my bedside  Check it  
My self control is missing  Check it  
Ill leave with your permission  Check it
