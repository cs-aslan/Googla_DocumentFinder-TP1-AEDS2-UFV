What Ill give you  
Since youve asked  
Is all my time together  
Take the rugged sunny days  
The warm and rocky weather  
Take the roads that I have walked  
Looking for tomorrows time  
Peace of mind   
As your life spills into mine  
Changing with the seasons  
Filling up the world with time  
Change time to reasons  
I can show you all the songs  
That I never sang to someone before  
We have seen a million stars  
Lying by the water  
You have climbed the hills with me  
To the mountain shelter  
Taking off the days  
One by one  
Setting them to breath  
In the sun  
Take the lilies and the lace  
From the days of childhood  
All the willow winding paths  
Leading up and outward  
This is what I give  
This is what I ask you for  
Nothing more
