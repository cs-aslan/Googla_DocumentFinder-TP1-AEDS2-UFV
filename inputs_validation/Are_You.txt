I see it in your convoluted daydreams  
These never ending quests were always on  
I cant believe the things we give importance to  
These foolish goals we set ourselves upon  
  
Are you gonna make this easy  
Are you gonna make this rough  
This world gonna make you crazy  
If you never have enough  
Most of what we want is just illusion  
Most of what we buy wont change a thing  
Most of what were told is misdirection  
Offered up to ease our suffering  
  
Are you gonna see the wisdom  
Are you gonna call this bluff  
This worlds gonna run you over  
If you never have enough  
  
This is a whole new thing almost like a new religion  
  
The liights are always on the doors are never locked  
We ride in on the light the shelves are overstocked  
  
Everybodys got their own connection  
Everybodys hoping they can score  
Everybodys looking for perfection  
Everybody wants a little more  
  
Are you gonna be addicted  
Are you gonna give it up  
This worlds gonna drive you under  
If you never have enough
