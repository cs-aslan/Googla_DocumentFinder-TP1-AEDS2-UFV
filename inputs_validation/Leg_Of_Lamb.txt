Youre a head case with a smile  
Cant stop to make up your mind  
Education is so lame so lame  
When you bitch and you moan  
Youre a loose girl Im a guy hey  
Youre a truth freak with a lie  
The situation is so strange  
Its a TV show  
  
In a hotel on the phone  
Youre gonna leave me I shouldve known shouldve known  
And I was thinkin its so sad  
I didnt want you to go  
Dont want to follow the laws of man  
Bloody apron leg of lamb  
Its so hard to win  
When theres so much to lose  
  
Infiltrate the walls that are caving in  
It aint a bad thing  
This aint reality  
Infiltrate the walls that are caving in  
It aint a bad thing  
Because it is natural  
  
Second Avenue raising Cain  
Im a sinner ring my bell hey  
Ill tell you what I get up  
If I knew I fell
