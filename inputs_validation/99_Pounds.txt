I tell ya shes a heart breaker  
And you cant tell me she aint  
Theres a little devil in her  
Under all that powder and paint  
And she can hang you up every night  
And get you so uptight  
Shes ninety nine pounds I said ninety nine pounds  
Shes ninety nine pounds of some kind of dynamite  
  
I tell you half a ton of sugar aint half as sweet as her  
She can change and rearrange you  
Till you cant tell what you were  
And it dont even pay to fight  
Cause she dont know wrong from right  
Shes ninety nine pounds I said ninety nine pounds  
Shes ninety nine pounds of some kind of dynamite  
  
And she may look like an angel  
But shes made out of TNT  
Shes a little bitty thing and she   
Yeah but when she holds you tight  
Shes some kind of outta sight  
Shes ninety nine pounds I said ninety nine pounds  
I said ninety nine pounds of some kind of dynamite  
I said ninety nine pounds I said ninety nine pounds
