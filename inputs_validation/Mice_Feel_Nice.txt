I wont put that in my mouth no  
It is a fright with that neon light  
The hollywood magic men  
Back up in their caves  
Ooh at the raves  
And the Cake Cant say  
The weepers from the way  
Baby its all right  
The night is long and cold as ice  
But its all right baby its all right  
Theres a pink little area  
The regions of my disease  
And it is good  
It is good  
Mice feel nice  
Ooh mice feel nice  
You know mice feel nice ooh
