Tonight the moon is playing tricks again  
Feeling sea sick again  
An the world could just dissolve  
Into a glass of water  
Ive been good cause I know you dont want me to  
Do you really want me to be as blue as you  
Its her daylight that gets me through  
  
Weve been here before  
Last time you scratched at my door  
The moon was naked and cold  
I was like a two year old  
Who just wanted more  
If you wear that velvet dress  
If you wear that velvet dress  
  
Tonight the moon has drawn its curtains  
Its a private show no one else going to know  
Im waiting  
  
Sunlight  
Sunlight fills my room  
Its sharp and its clear  
But nothing at all like the moon  
  
Its okay  
The struggle for things not to say  
I never listened to you anyway  
And I got my own hands to pray  
  
If you wear that velvet dress  
If you wear that velvet dress  
  
Tonight the moon is a mirror ball  
Light flickers from across the hall  
Wholl catch the star when it falls  
  
If you wear that velvet dress  
If you wear that velvet dress
