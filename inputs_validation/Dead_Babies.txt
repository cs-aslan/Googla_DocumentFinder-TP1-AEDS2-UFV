Little Betty ate a pound of aspirin  
She got them from the shelf up on the wall  
Bettys mommy wasnt there to save her  
She didnt hear her little baby call  
Wah  
  
Dead babies  
Cant take care of themselves  
Dead babies  
Cant take things off the shelf  
Well we didnt want you anyway  
Lalalala lalalala la la la  
  
Daddy is an agrophile in Texas  
Mommys on the bar most every night  
Little Bettys sleeping in the graveyard  
Living there in burgundy and white  
  
Dead babies  
Cant take care of themselves  
Dead babies  
Cant take things off the shelf  
Well we didnt love you anyway  
Lalalala lalalala la la la  
  
Goodbye Little Betty  
Goodbye Little Betty  
So long Little Betty  
So long Little Betty  
Betty so long  
  
Dead babies  
Cant take care of themselves  
Dead babies  
Cant take things off the shelf  
Well we didnt need you anyway  
Lalalala lalalala la la la  
  
Goodbye Little Betty
