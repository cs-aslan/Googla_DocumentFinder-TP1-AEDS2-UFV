The other night they were playing our song  
Hadnt heard it for oh so long  
Took me back darlin to that time in my car  
When you cried all night cause wed gone too far  
  
Can I ever getcha back  
Getcha back baby  
Gonna getcha back getcha back  
Getcha back getcha back baby  
Gonna getcha back getcha back  
Can I ever getcha back  
  
Im getting tired laying around here at night  
Thinkin bout some other guy holding you tight  
He may have money and a brand new car  
May even treat you like a movie star  
And no matter what he ever do for you  
He can never love you like I can do  
So if I leave her and you leave him  
  
Can we ever get it back again  
Getcha back getcha back baby  
Gonna getcha back getcha back  
Getcha back getcha back baby  
Gonna getcha back getcha back  
Can I ever getcha back  
  
Bow bow bow oop  
  
Bow bow bow oop  
  
Getcha back Ill leave her  
Getcha back and you leave him  
Getcha back can we make it  
Getcha back get it back again  
  
Getcha back Ill leave her  
Getcha back and you leave him  
Getcha back can we make it  
Getcha back get it back again  
  
Getcha back Ill leave her  
Getcha back and you leave him
