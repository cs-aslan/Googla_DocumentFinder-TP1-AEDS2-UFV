Its a fairytale morning the ocean looks turquoise  
As if it was painted that way  
The waves how they rush from the shore or the island  
It carries my vision away  
The sun seems to blind that part of my mind  
Thats searching for yesterdays rhymes  
Its the first day of something  
And I wonder if it could be love  
She lays there and tosses her head on the pillow  
She peeks from the blanket to see  
She looks like a child but acts like a woman  
Whenever she reaches for me  
Her touch burns my skin and that makes me frightened  
She looks like a photograph there  
Its the first day of something  
And I wonder if it could be love  
Yes its hard to believe I spent all this time here alone  
Trying to forget the heartaches that broke up our home  
Now theyre gone  
Why shes seen it all from the start to the fall  
She knew Id need some place to hide  
My wife she had taking the baby and left me  
With all of this hatred inside  
Shes been my friend she helped me get over  
And now that Im better I see  
The first day of something  
And I wonder if it could be love
