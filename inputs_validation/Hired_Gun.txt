Morning light meet the day  
Nervous eyes look both ways  
And it just wont matter spring or fall  
Theres bread to win and shots to call  
And there aint nobody out there  
Just a wild uncertainty  
Its in your stride but it aint no fun  
Sometimes I feel just like a hired gun  
I feel just like a hired gun  
Always on the run  
And how it started well you cant recall  
Did someone push you did someone stall  
Whatever the reasons there was lots to learn  
To get home safely and not get burned  
And its all so cold and empty  
As you watch the setting sun  
Youve picked up every dirty trick  
Just to keep yourself always on the run  
And I feel just like a hired gun  
Always on the run  
I dream of comfort and friendship long  
But I cant trust you or anyone  
The scars still hurt me and I dont let them heal  
Each ones a lesson each ones a shield  
And I may even love you dearly  
And I loathe what I have to do  
You see Ive picked up every dirty trick  
In my fear of you  
cause you make me feel just like a hired gun  
Always on the run
