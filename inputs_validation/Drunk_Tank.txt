  
Last call has come and gone for us  
Down at our favorite bar  
We got more beer at home but  
We cant walk cause its too far  
Got a brand new set of wheel and  
Its parked right out in the back  
Its called the DRUNK TANK  
And its hell on tracks  
Were having trouble walking  
So I guess we better drive  
Dont even have to worry  
If well make it home alive  
With twentyseven tons  
Of fine carbon steel  
It doesnt matter if youre fucked up  
When you get behind the wheel  
Lock and load get on the road  
In the Drunk Tank  
Grinding gears and pounding beers  
In the Drunk Tank  
Inebriated Amout plated  
In the Drunk Tank  
Drive and swill and shoot to kill  
In the Drunk Tank  
Set off to the bar  
With happy hour in out sights  
Several hours later  
Well be blacked out in a fire fight  
Cut off by the bartender  
Well drive right through the door  
With a cannon pointed at his head  
I bet hell serve some more  
Flashing reds behind us  
But we wont pull to the side  
Swivel round the turret  
Johnnylaw had better hide  
Let loose with the machine gun  
Watch his car disintegrate  
Now hes writing tickets  
From the wrong side of hells gates  
Lock and load get on the road  
In the Drunk Tank  
Grinding gears and pounding beers  
In the Drunk Tank  
Inebriated Amout plated  
In the Drunk Tank  
Drive and swill and shoot to kill  
In the Drunk Tank  
Drunk tank  
Drunk tank  
Drunk tank  
Drunk tank  
Drunk tank  
Drunk tank  
Drunk tank  
Drunk tank
