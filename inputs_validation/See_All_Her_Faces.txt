Here she comes  
Here she comes  
Ribbons flying from her halfforgotten hair  
Look at her run  
See what the world and love have done  
See all her faces  
See all her faces  
  
Look in my eyes  
That she is me  
I cant disguise  
See all her faces  
Ah ha see all her faces  
  
Im looking for someone  
Of the gentle kind  
Knowing that looks can lie  
Looking for someone  
Is he there to find  
Or should I run on by ah ha  
  
Here she comes  
Here she comes  
Shadows sadly chasing  
Every step she takes  
Look at her now  
She needs love so much more somehow  
See all her faces  
See all her faces  
  
Look at my life  
The wasted years  
Each a knife  
See all her faces ahha  
See all her faces  
  
Waiting for someone  
Who will set me free  
Passing the time too fast  
Waiting for someone  
Is that where hell be  
Or should I run right past  hmm  
  
There she goes  
There she goes  
Somehow making me and all her faces sad oh oh  
Ba da ba da ba da ba da
