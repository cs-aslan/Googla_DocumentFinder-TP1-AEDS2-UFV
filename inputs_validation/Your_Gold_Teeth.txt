Got a feeling Ive been here before  
Watching as you cross the killing floor  
You know youll have to pay it all  
Youll pay today or pay tomorrow  
You fasten up your beaded gown  
Then you try to tie me down  
Do you work it out one by one  
Or played in combination  
You throw out your gold teeth  
Do you see how they roll  
I have seen your iron and your brass  
Cant you see it shine behind the glass  
Your fortune is your roving eye  
Your mouth and legs  
Your gift for the runaround  
Torture is the main attraction  
I dont need that kind of action  
You dont have to dance for me  
Ive seen your dance before  
Do you throw out your gold teeth  
Do you see how they roll  
  
Tobacco they grow in Peking  
In the Year of the Locust  
Youll see a sad thing  
Even Cathy Berberian knows  
Theres one roulade she cant sing  
Dumb luck my friend  
Wont suck me in this time  
  
Got a feeling Ive been here before  
Wont you let me help you find the door  
All you got to do is use  
Your silver shoes  
A gift for the runaround  
Use your knack darlin  
Take one step back darlin  
There aint nothing in Chicago  
For a monkey woman to do  
Do you throw out your gold teeth  
Do you see how they roll
