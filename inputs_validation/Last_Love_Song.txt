If you dont love me  
Please dont treat me this way  
Cause I cant stand it  
I see our love slipping away  
Did you think you could just put me down  
Like a worn out shoe  
Cause if you dont want me  
Maybe I dont want you  
  
If you dont need me  
Dont leave me out in the cold  
Eyes drifting by me  
Like somebody you dont know  
Did you think that you could just walk away  
Anytime you wanted to  
Cause if you dont love me  
Maybe I dont love you  
  
Did you think that you could just put me down  
For somebody new  
Cause nobody can love you girl like I do  
Every little bird in the sky  
Would sing a song of love  
  
If you would just take me back  
Come on open up your heart again  
Let me in baby baby  
  
If you dont love me  
Stop fooling yourself  
No more acting  
I know your show too well  
Did you think that you could just shake my hand  
With a how dydo  
Cause if you dont want me  
Maybe I dont want you  
  
Oh and as you go through life  
Its the little things that come back again  
If you came back again  
You know Id give my loving to you
