Wake up now this is the time youve waited for  
  
Far below where shadows fester as they grow  
An army thousands strong obsessed by right and wrong  
Sense their time is coming near  
So they turn towards the light from their region of the night  
Marching on and on  
They near the air it wont be long  
  
You know youre on the way out  
Its just a matter of time  
You thought youd rule the world forever  
Long live the king dont spare the loser  
  
After all youre not what you thought you were at all  
Youre just a natural fact another cul de sac  
On natures hard unfeeling trail  
And all those dreams of old will be stories left untold  
Cut off in your prime extinct until the end of time  
  
Now the host emerges a shadow starts to fall  
Not one knows what hit them none can see at all  
Even as the end approaches still theyre not aware  
How can you fight a foe so deadly  
When you dont even know its there  
And now that the job is almost done  
Maybe some escape no not even one
