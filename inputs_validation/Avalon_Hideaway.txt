Somebody breathin down my neck  
While Im tryin to roll the bones  
I dont care Ill just float a check  
Cause Im feelin my gamblin Jones  
Here come seven gimme eleven come again  
Love to hideout where I am my own best friend  
  
Theres crazy little Linda Lou  
With the long and lanky legs  
Nobody do it like Linda do  
At these backwoods lone star dregs  
Like I told you head out FM 92  
Roll in slowly youll be safer if you do  
  
If you dont know what Im talkin about  
Let me ease your worried mind  
Its the place to go without a doubt  
But its a little bit hard to find  
Back in the timber once youre there  
Youll want to stay  
Get loose and limber anytime night or day  
Just remember ask for the Avalon hideaway
