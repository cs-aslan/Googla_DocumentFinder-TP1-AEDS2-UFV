In good old Queen Victorias day  
Industrial revolution  
Bosses said Please we need more employees  
We needed a solution  
  
Who will climb our chimneys  
Who will power our grids  
Victorian families to desperately poor  
Theyll let us employ their kids for  
  
Work terible work  
From very young ages  
Up chimneys to clean  
Paid pitiful wages  
Work terrible work  
Pins make you work faster  
If we grow too big  
Get sacked by the master  
  
Now youre all in my employ  
Cleaning in the factory  
Were not very strong  
And the hours are long  
This work is unsatisfactory  
  
There not to get caught in spokes  
Or trap our hands in gages  
To stop machines and get you out  
Will cost you a weeks wages  
  
Work terrible work  
Theres no health and safety  
So if we get hurt  
They will just replace me  
Work terrible work  
  
Now that I am short of cash  
I have to pick pockets  
Wallets from gentlemen  
And ladys lockets  
  
Small enough to get away  
Hardly ever caught  
And if we are were kids you see  
To cry is what were taught  
  
Work terrible work  
Dangerous and demeaning  
No time to complain  
Get back to your cleaning  
Work terrible work  
Guess what we are dreaming  
School glorious school  
Wonderful school  
Marvellous school  
Wish we went to school
