She cant see the way your eyes  
Light up when you smile  
Shell never notice how you stop and stare  
Whenever she walks by  
And you cant see me wantin you the way you want her  
But you are everything to me  
  
Chorus  
And I just wanna show you  
She dont even know you  
Shes never gonna love you like I want to  
And you just see right through me but if you only knew me  
We could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable  
Instead of just invisible  
  
Theres a fire inside of you  
That cant help but shine through  
Shes never gonna see the light  
No matter what you do  
And all I think about is how to make you think of me  
And everything that we could be  
  
Chorus  
  
Like shadows in a faded light  
Oh were invisible  
I just wanna open your eyes  
And make you realize  
  
Chorus  
I just want to show you she dont even know you  
Baby let me love you let me want you  
  
She cant see the way your eyes  
Light up when you smile
