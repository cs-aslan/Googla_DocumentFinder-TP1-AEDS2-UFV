Too many times I find myself thinking  
Im the only one who knows  
What its like to need someone  
And how it feels to be alone  
Forgetting youre watching even if I look away  
Then you show me Im not really on my own  
  
Chorus  
I cant always see you  
But I know you are there  
In the quiet ways you talk to me  
I can tell youre near  
You love me even when Im not aware  
I cant always see you but I know you are there  
  
So many times I know youre speaking  
And although I may not hear  
All the things you have to say  
In my heart you make it clear  
That youll never leave me even though I turn away  
And you show me I dont have to be afraid  
  
Chorus  
  
And I remember how your love was so real  
And how you changed my life completely  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
I cant always see you but I know you are there
