Tired and frozen Im under your spell  
I thought I knew you but now I know you well  
I wake up beside you move across your killing floor  
I need my freedom and I see an open door  
The room is getting smaller and the walls are closin in  
No ones leavin and nobodys gettin in  
  
I try to run I try to hide I try to tell you what Im feelin inside  
Should I stay should I go  
You know I want to touch you but theres nothing left to hold  
  
Chorus  
Dont chain my heart dont chain my heart  
Dont chain my soul dont chain my soul  
Dont chain my heart dont chain my heart cause you got to let it go  
  
Looks like trouble the signs are everywhere  
I bend a little but you take more than your share  
Crimes of passion crimes of mortal men  
Its a deadly attraction and I wont be fooled again baby  
The storm is coming the winds begin to rise  
Please release me from this house of compromise  
  
All day all night your love is like an outlaw waiting till the time is right  
Nobodys wrong no ones to blame  
Maybe its just too hot because were standin in the flame  
  
Chorus  
  
Im a victim of your pain and jealousy  
I feel like a prisoner and you hold the lock and key  
We lost our vision we lost our paradise  
But theres still a part of me I refuse to sacrifice  
  
I try to run I try to hide I need to tell you what Im feelin inside baby  
Should I stay should I go  
You know I want to touch you but theres nothing left to hold  
  
Chorus x2
