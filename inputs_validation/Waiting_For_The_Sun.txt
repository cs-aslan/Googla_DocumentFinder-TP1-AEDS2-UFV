At first flash of Eden we race down to the sea  
Standing there on freedoms shore  
  
Chorus  
Waiting for the sun  
Waiting for the sun  
Waiting for the sun  
  
Can you feel it now that Spring has come  
That its time to live in the scattered sun  
  
Chorus  
  
Waiting for the sun  
  
Waiting waiting waiting waiting  
Waiting waiting waiting waiting  
Waiting for you to come along  
Waiting for you to hear my song  
Waiting for you to come along  
Waiting for you to tell me what went wrong  
  
This is the strangest life Ive ever known  
  
Cant you feel it now that Spring has come  
That its time to live in the scattered sun  
  
Chorus  
  
Waiting for the sun
