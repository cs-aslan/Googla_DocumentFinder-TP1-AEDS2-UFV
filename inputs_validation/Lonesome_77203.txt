Had our number changed today although I hated to  
But each time the phone would ring theyd want to speak to you  
And it hurts to tell them youre not here with me  
Maybe now oh telephone will let me be  
Its not in the book now so youd better write it down  
Just in case your love for me should ever come around  
You might want to call and break the news to me  
Just dial Lonesome 77203  
  
I keep the telephone beside me all the time  
Hoping you might want to call and say youve changed your mind  
If you do then darling you know where Ill be  
Im at Lonesome 77203  
Youre the only one Im givin our new number to  
So now if the telephone should ring Ill know its you  
If you ever long for love that used to be  
Just call Lonesome 77203
