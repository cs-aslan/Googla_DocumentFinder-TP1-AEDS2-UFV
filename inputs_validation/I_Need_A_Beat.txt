Beat programmer and lyrilyricist  
Ladies Love Cool James studio user  
A million or more screaming people abuser  
I predict this jam will hit  
The highest plateau in the world of music  
Paparazzi wealth and fame  
The total propulsion of my name  
  
I need a beat  
  
Computer wise and the engineers eyes  
Have to be very acute education level high  
The product is mine beat on the rhyme  
The control was part of the studio design  
Track after track culminating on wax  
The tape has slack rewind then back  
Expensive but useful the music is the fuel  
A perfect place for MCs to duel  
  
I need a beat Farmers Boulevard
