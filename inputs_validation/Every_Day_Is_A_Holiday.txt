Verse 1  
My fire through cold nights  
The brightest of all lights  
You are my home  
Wherever we go  
  
PreChorus  
We dont need a thing under the tree  
Youre giving me all I need  
  
Chorus  
Every day is a holiday  
When youre the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When youre the reason  
Every day is a holiday  
When youre the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When youre the reason you are the reason  
  
Verse 2  
My heart cant stop singing  
You cant fight this feeling  
Unspeakable joy  
Ringing through my soul  
  
PreChorus  
We dont need a thing under the tree  
Youre giving me all I need  
  
Chorus  
Every day is a holiday  
When youre the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When youre the reason  
Every day is a holiday  
When youre the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When youre the reason you are the reason  
  
Bridge  
We dont need a thing under the tree  
Cause you give me all I need  
  
Chorus  
Every day is a holiday  
When youre the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When youre the reason when youre the reason  
Every day is a holiday  
When youre the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When youre the reason
