Its been forty days and nights  
Since I heard you  
Girl I cannot bring myself  
To ask you why  
Its a fact that your not here  
I aint accusing you  
I only seek the simple answer from the sky  
  
See the circle spinnin round  
Changing colors without a sound  
Helter skelter doomsday plan  
Its just another tale of a man  
  
Lay me down lay me down  
In your heaven  
I can really see  
Everything quite clear  
I can almost reach your hand  
Enough to touch you  
Girl Ill have you safe and sound within a year  
  
See the circle spinnin round  
Changing colors without a sound  
Helter skelter doomsday plan  
Its just another tale of a man  
  
Its been forty days and nights  
Since I heard you  
Girl I cannot bring myself  
To ask you why  
Its a fact that your not here  
I aint accusing you  
I only seek the simple  
answer from the sky  
  
See the circle spinnin round  
Changing colors without a sound  
Helter skelter doomsday plan  
Its just another tale of a man
