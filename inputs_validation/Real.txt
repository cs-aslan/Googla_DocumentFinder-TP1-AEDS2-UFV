Mofucker when we bang bang squeezing pistols that make em bang  
Haters smoking that swisha swisha sweet boy switching damn lanes  
Pulling guns and put two in your stomach nigga who want it  
Gangstas if you with me gangstas  
Smoking that sticky you get pissy riding spinners  
Tires glimmer the prize in our eyes nigga ride with us  
Nom and ZRo like when Tino and DeNiro counting Kilos in casinos  
They gambinos for them seenotes man  
Hustlers serving customers  
Off of his back shit cause then we bust them guns  
  
Up jumps the boogie cause the track is so thoed  
Got me breaking down bubble gum Im fin to be so blowed  
Nothing but clouds in the sky but its still sunny  
Cause Im puffing on some good green pocket full of money  
Southside Im wrecking for where I lay my head at  
Disrespect me you the nigga Ima spray my lead at  
Im living for today dont give a fuck about tomorrow  
Im robbing you motherfuckers it aint no need to borrow  
Money from dad that nigga wouldnt lend me no cash  
Seventeen he threw me out like the trash  
Its all gravy baby Im connected with the street my mama Ridgevan  
And daddy East and West Cancel Creek the dopefiends love me  
I got a cousin named Mard  
Everytime I bring him outside suckers be running up in my yard  
Smartest thing I got is a 20 and you could get a whole sale  
If you want it soft let me run back to the motel  
  
Running to the ceiling what its fin to be  
Blowing cigarillos no more swisha sweet  
But regular weed a gangsta fa sho I am

Flipping in a four do trying to get some mo do  
Playa dont get mad if you see me flipping with your hoea
