I could be your lover you could be all mine  
Wed go on for ever til the end of time  
You could be my best friend stay up all night long  
You could be my railroad wed go on and on  
  
Lets get along theres nothing here to do  
Lets go find a rainbow  
I could be wrong  what am I to do  
Guess God thinks Im Abel  
  
You could be my enemy I guess theres still time  
I get round to loving you is that such a crime  
  
Lets get along theres nothing here to do  
Lets go find a rainbow  
I could be wrong but what am I to do  
Guess God thinks Im Abel  
  
Noone could break us  
Noone could take us  
If we tried  
  
Noone could break us  
Noone could take us  
If we tried  
  
Noone could break us  
Noone could take us  
If we tried  
  
Come on oh lets make it tonight
