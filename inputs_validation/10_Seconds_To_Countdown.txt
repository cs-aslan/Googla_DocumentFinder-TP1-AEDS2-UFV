You are the best for all of times  
You beat the rest youre in my mind  
Dont take away this dream in me  
Dont leave me here in misery  
You are the best from coast to coast  
From east to west love you the most  
Its hard to win you try your best  
And we are sure youll beat the rest  
  
Chorus   
Ten seconds to countdown  
Ten seconds to know  
Who will be the hero  
Everybody loves the show  
  
You are the champ a hurricane  
From heaven sent you win again  
Oh tell me where the heros gone  
But you are here we cant go wrong  
The price is high when dreams come true  
Oh we can fly its up to you  
Its hard to win you try your best  
And we are sure you beat the rest  
  
Chorus
