The last time that I saw her  
She was standing in the rain  
With her overcoat under her arm  
Leaning on a horse head cane  
She said Carl take all the money  
She called everybody  
Carl my spirits broke  
My minds a joke and getting ups real hard  
Dont you know her when you see her  
She grew up in your back yard  
Come back to us Barbara Lewis  
Hare Krishna Beauregard  
Selling bibles at the airports  
Buying Quaaludes on the phone  
Hey you talk about a paper route  
Shes a shut in without a home  
God save her please shes nailed her knees  
To some drugstore parking lot  
Hey Mr Brown turn the volume down  
I believe this evenings shot  
Dont you know her when you see her  
She grew up in your back yard  
Come back to us Barbara Lewis  
Hare Krishna Beauregard  
Cant you picture her next Thursday  
Can you picture her at all  
In the Hotel Boulderado  
At the dark end of the hall  
I gotta shake myself and wonder  
Why she even bothers me  
For if heartaches were commercials  
Wed all be on TV  
Dont you know her when you see her  
She grew up in your back yard  
Come back to us Barbara Lewis  
Hare Krishna Beauregard
