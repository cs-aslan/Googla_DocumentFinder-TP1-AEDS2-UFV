For You have set me free  
Youre all that I seek  
Your love completes my life  
Youre the air that I breathe  
And the Saviour of the world Hes the reason Im livin  
I will sing  
And I will lift my voice to the one who has saved me  
I will sing  
I will sing  
And Ill cry out for more saying Lord I need you  
I will reach out  
Im reaching for more of you in my heart  
And I will wait on You  
In the stillness Lord  
Listening for Your voice  
Pure as gold refined  
In Your presence Lord here where I belong
