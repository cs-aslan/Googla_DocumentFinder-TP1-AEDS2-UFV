Chorus  
You aint nothing but a hound dog  
Crying all the time  
You aint nothing but a hound dog  
Crying all the time  
Well you aint never caught a rabbit  
And you aint no friend of mine  
  
Well they said you was high classed  
Well that was just a lie  
Yeah they said you was high classed  
Well that was just a lie  
Yeah you aint never caught a rabbit  
And you aint no friend of mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat x2  
Well they said you was high classed  
Well that was just a lie  
Yeah they said you was high classed  
Well that was just a lie  
Well you aint never caught a rabbit  
And you aint no friend of mine
