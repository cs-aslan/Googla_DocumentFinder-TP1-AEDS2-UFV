You keep your jealousy and your snide remarks to yourself  
You know that Im not seeing anyone else  
You just keep your ear down to the ground  
Yell your head off if you hear a sound  
Heres a whistle a badge and a phone  
You can arrest me if Im not at home  
And if I dont keep my word I swear  
Ill keep away  
  
Heres some books and a puzzle by Escher  
Heres Shakespeares Measure For Measure  
Heres a balloon a rubber band and a bag  
Why dont you blow them up if you think youve been had  
Heres a castle a paper dragon and a moat  
An earring a toothbrush and a cloak  
And if I dont keep my word I swear  
Ill keep away  
  
I swear Ill keep away
