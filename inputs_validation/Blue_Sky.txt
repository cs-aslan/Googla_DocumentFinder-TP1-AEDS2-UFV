Im blind with eyes wide open  
My bodys tired and broken  
I want a taste of something that doesnt leave me dry  
This hope for answered questions  
As rare as true conviction  
I stare into the distance there is no truth in sight  
Who can tell me why  
Everybodys looking for a blue sky  
Searching for an answer on a satellite  
I know that theres got to be a blue sky out there to see  
A blue sky waiting for me  
Ive seen the main attraction  
Ive felt the moments passion  
I wont be no soap box teacher just taking your time  
Just taking your time  
Who can tell me why  
Everybodys looking for a blue sky  
Searching for an answer on a satellite  
I know that theres got to be a blue sky out there to see  
A blue sky  
Everywhere I go it feels like Im always searching for something  
Til I know for sure Ill be right here waiting for something  
More more for something more for something more  
Everybodys looking for a blue sky  
Searching for an answer on a satellite  
I know that theres got to be a blue sky out there to see  
Somewhere theres a blue sky waiting  
Everybodys looking for a blue sky  
Searching for an answer on a satellite  
I know that theres got to be a blue sky waiting for me  
A blue sky
