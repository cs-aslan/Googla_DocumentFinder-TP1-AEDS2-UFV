Oh I hand them this life  
To do what they will  
Theyve got to find their way from here  
Oh show us the way  
  
If they only knew  
Oh show us the light  
Show them what light  
  
It shines from within  
You make your own day  
You make your own night  
And sometimes you win  
  
Oh show us the way  
But you always get through  
Oh show us the light  
  
Oh why do they come and ask for more  
Theyve got stars they dont have wishes for  
Theyre just givin up their blame to me  
How do the fools survive  
  
Im wonderin why Im wonderin how  
Theyre gonna bail themselves out now  
Oh give us this day  
Im shakin my head  
Oh keep us through night  
  
Oh I hand them this life  
To do what they will  
Theyve got to find their way from here  
Oh show us the way  
If they only knew  
Oh show us the light  
  
Oh why do they come and ask for more  
Theyve got stars they dont have wishes for  
Theyre just givin up their blame to me  
How do the fools survive  
  
Its not like it was before  
When they call I wont come running  
It was so long ago  
I left them on their own  
Oh how do the fools survive
