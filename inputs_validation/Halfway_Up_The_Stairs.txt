Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit  
There isnt any other stair quite like it  
Im not at the bottom Im not at the top  
So this is the stair where I always stop  
  
Halfway up the stairs isnt up and isnt down  
It isnt in the nursery it isnt in the town  
And all sorts of funny thoughts run round my head  
It isnt really anywhere its somewhere else instead
