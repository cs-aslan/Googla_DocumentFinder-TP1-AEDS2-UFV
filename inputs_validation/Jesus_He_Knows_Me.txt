Do you see the face on the TV screen  
Coming at you every Sunday  
See that face on the billboard  
That man is me  
  
On the cover of the magazine  
Theres no question why Im smiling  
You buy a piece of paradise  
You buy a piece of me  
  
Ill get you everything you wanted  
Ill get you everything you need  
You dont need to believe in hereafter  
Just believe in me  
  
Cause Jesus he knows me  
And he knows Im right  
Ive been talking to Jesus all my life  
Oh yes he knows me  
And he knows Im right  
And hes been telling me  
Everything is alright  
  
I believe in the family  
With my ever loving wife beside me  
But she dont know about my girlfriend  
Or the man I met last night  
  
Do you believe in God  
Cause thats what Im selling  
And if you wanna go to heaven  
Ill see you right  
  
You wont even have to leave your house  
Or get out of your chair  
You dont even have to touch that dial  
Cause Im everywhere  
  
Cause Jesus he knows me  
And he knows Im right  
Ive been talking to Jesus all my life  
Oh yes he knows me  
And he knows Im right  
And hes been telling me  
Everything gonna be alright  
  
Wont find me practicing what Im preaching  
Wont find me making no sacrifice  
But I can get you a pocketful of miracles  
If you promise to be good try to be nice  
God will take good care of you  
Just do as I say dont do as I do  
  
Im counting my blessings  
Ive found true happiness  
Cause Im getting richer day by day  
You can find me in the phone book  
Just call my toll free number  
You can do it anyway you want  
Just do it right away  
  
Therell be no doubt in your mind  
Youll believe everything Im saying  
If wanna get closer to him  
Get on your knees and start paying  
  
Cause Jesus he knows me  
And he knows Im right  
Ive been talking to Jesus all my life  
Oh yes he knows me  
And he knows Im right  
And hes been telling me  
Everything is alright
