I wont  
See your smile  
And I wont hear you laugh anymore  
Every night  
I wont see you walk through that door  
  
Cause time wasnt on your side  
It isnt right  
I cant say I love you  
Its too late to tell you  
But I really need you to know  
  
No Ill never forget you  
Ill never let you out of my heart  
You will always be here with me  
Ill hold on to the memories baby  
  
Baby can you hear me  
Wherever you may be tonight  
Are you near me  
I need you to be by my side  
  
Cause I never said goodbye  
It isnt right  
I should have said I love you  
Why didnt I just tell you  
God knows I need you to know  
  
No Ill never forget you  
Ill never let you out of my heart  
You will always be here with me  
Ill hold on to the memories baby  
  
Somewhere  
I know youll be with me  
Someday  
In another time  
But right now youre gone  
Youve just vanished away  
But Ill never leave yo behind  
  
No Ill never forget you  
Ill never let you out of my heart  
You will always be here with me  
Ill hold on to the memories baby
