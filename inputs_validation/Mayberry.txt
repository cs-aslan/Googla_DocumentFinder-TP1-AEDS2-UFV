Sometimes it feels like this world is spinning faster  
Than it did in the old days  
So naturally we have more natural disasters  
From the strain of a fast pace  
Sunday was a day of rest  
Now its one more day for progress  
And we cant slow down cause more is best  
Its all an endless process  
  
Chorus  
Well I miss Mayberry  
Sitting on the porch drinking icecold cherry Coke  
Where everything is black and white  
Picking on a six string  
Where people pass by and you call them by their first name  
Watching the clouds roll by  
Bye bye  
  
Sometimes I can hear this old earth shouting  
Through the trees as the wind blows  
Thats when I climb up here on this mountain  
To look through Gods window  
Now I cant fly  
But I got two feet that get me high up here  
Above the noise and city streets  
My worries disappear  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes I dream Im driving down an old dirt road  
Not even listed on a map  
I pass a dad and son carrying a fishing pole  
But I always wake up every time I try to turn back  
  
Chorus  
  
Bye bye  
I miss Mayberry I miss Mayberry
