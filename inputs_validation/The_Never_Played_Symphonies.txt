Reflecting from my deathbed  
Im balancing lifes richesagainst the ditches  
And the flat gray years in between  
All I can see are the never laid  
Thats the never played symphonies  
  
I cant see those who tried to love me  
Or those who felt they understood me  
And I cant see those who  
Very patientlyput up with me  
  
All I can see are the never laid  
Or the never played symphonies  
  
You were one  
You were meant to be one  
And you jumped into my face  
And laughed and kissed me on the cheek  
And then were gone forevernot quite  
  
Black sky in the daytime  
And I dont much mind dying  
When there is nothing left to care foranymore  
Just the never laid  
The never played symphonies  
  
You were one  
You knew you were one  
And you slipped right through my fingers  
No not literally  
But metaphorically  
And now youre all I seeas the light fades
