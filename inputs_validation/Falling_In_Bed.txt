I met her at an aftershow party  
I said have we met before  
She said hardly  
She had a curry stain  
That was down her cardie  
But her teeth were clean  
So I said smartly  
  
Im falling in love again  
Im so in lust with you  
Pillow over head again  
Ill suffocate with you  
If you ask me to  
  
She was educated at this school called rada  
She was made to go by her mother  
And financed by her father  
She said Room 211 and I said laugh rather  
I got her name wrong once or twice  
I said Ill call ya Carol yeah  
She said that would be nice  
  
Im falling in love again  
Im so in lust with you  
My Pillow over head again  
Ill suffocate with you  
If you ask me to  
  
So I strolls of to the reception  
And I ask for me room key  
The Maitred  Hello  
He seemed pleased to meet me  
I went to the lift and pressed button two  
But very discreetly  
The doors close and she went for my briefs  
  
See me  
Falling in bed again  
Im so in lust with you  
Pillow over head again  
Ill suffocate in you  
If you ask me to  
Ohhhhh to  
  
But in the throws of passion  
It hit me right between the head  
I looked down at her  
She had a bit of cabbage stuck between her teeth  
And I said  
I think Im in love with ya  
I want ya kids an getting married to ya  
And she said  
Chill out  
Rome wasnt built in a day  
And I said I wasnt on that job
