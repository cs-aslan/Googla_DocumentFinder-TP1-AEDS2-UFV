I love the way  
You say goodnight  
I kinda like the way  
You mumble  
While you fumble for the key  
More time for kissing me  
I love the way  
You say goodnight  
I kinda like the way you  
Linger with your finger  
On the bell  
More kisses  
And theyre swell  
When you say  
Gotta get home by twelve  
I always say lets go  
Cuz you can take longer  
To say good night  
Than any three others I know  
Both  
I love the way  
You say goodnight  
I kinda like the way  
You snuggle  
While you juggle  
With your comb  
Mmmmmm  
Im never  
Never never going home  
  
I love the way  
I kinda like the way  
You say  
The way you always say  
Goodnight  
The way you always  
Whisper honey nighty night  
The way  
You let our kisses mingle  
Til I tingle to my toes  
Giggle  
Were blushing like a rose  
I love the way  
I kinda like the way  
The extraordinary way  
You say good night  
The way you always say  
Dont go just hold me tight  
I kinda like the way you giggle  
While you jiggle with your bag  
Sign  
Our hearts are playing tag  
When you say  
We just got to be home by twelve  
But dont I always say lets go  
Cause you take longer  
To say good night  
Than any three others I know  
I love the way  
I kinda like the way you say  
The super duper special way  
Goodnight  
The way you have me flying  
Higher than a kite  
I kinda like the way you snuggle  
While you juggle with your comb  
It looks as though  
Youre never going  
No Im never never never  
Never never never gonna go home
