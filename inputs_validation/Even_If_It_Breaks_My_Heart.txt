It was three oclock in the afternoon we were in a cafe  
You ordered what you usually do  
I looked in your eyes you looked down in that moment  
What you couldnt say baby I already knew  
  
Its either you or me and I dont wanna be  
The one who makes believe for too long  
  
I dont wanna be the one this time  
I dont wanna watch us fall apart  
Gonna have to leave it all behind  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
No I dont wanna watch us fade  
But how can we remain the way we are  
Guess Ill have to turn and walk away  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
I gave all I had everything I had needed you to give it back  
Tell me was that too much to ask  
Felt it on your lips empty kisses have a story all their own  
How I wish it wasnt so  
  
True love often dies and someone always tries  
To keep it alive for too long  
  
I dont wanna be the one this time  
I dont wanna watch us fall apart  
Gonna have to leave it all behind  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
No I dont wanna watch us fade  
But how can we remain the way we are  
Guess Ill have to turn and walk away  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
Lord knows Ive tried so hard standing in front of you  
Knowing that this is goodbye  
  
I dont wanna be the one this time  
I dont wanna watch us fall apart  
Gonna have to leave it all behind  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
I dont wanna let you go  
How can we remain the way we are  
Guess Ill have to turn and walk away  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
I dont wanna be the one this time  
I dont wanna watch us fall apart  
Gonna have to leave it all behind  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
No I dont wanna watch us fade  
But how can we remain the way we are  
Guess Ill have to turn and walk away  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
Even if it breaks my heart oh no  
Even if it breaks my heart  
I gotta walk away  
Yeah yeah its gonna break my heart
