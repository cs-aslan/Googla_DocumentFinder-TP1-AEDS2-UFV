At the devils party  
Nothings a sin  
At the devils party  
We know where youve been  
If were all right  
Then tell me whos wrong  
  
Love and war  
Where do we belong  
I might believe its love  
Where do we belong  
And you might believe its war  
  
At the devils party  
Theres no light from the sun  
At the devils party now  
Lifes a loaded gun  
More or less yeah  
Less is more  
Go on and be my guest  
Where do we belong  
I might believe its love  
Where do we belong  
You might give a little more  
  
Dreams of yours  
Dreams of mine  
Dreams of all  
That shines on the other side  
On the other side  
  
Hey  
Come on in baby everybody gots a dream  
  
At the devils party  
Watch them standing in line  
At the devils party now  
See no friends of mine  
Oh lonely days  
On the road to excess  
When youre on fire  
You burn like the rest  
  
I might believe its love  
Where do we belong  
And you might believe its war  
Where do we belong  
Why dont we take a little less  
Where do we belong  
Then we could give a little more  
  
Dreams of yours  
Dreams of mine  
Dreams of all  
Thats green on the other side  
On the other side
