Well I cant believe Im sittin here today  
Picking on my banjo with a big smile on my face  
Writin new words to an old school melody  
Hey there aint no doubt that Gods been good to me  
  
Oh the sun is shinin on down in Tennessee  
And right now where Im right where I want to be  
Ive never felt so loved so peaceful and so free  
Hey there aint no doubt that Gods been good to me  
  
Chorus  
Cause he put me smack dab in the middle of Paradise  
In the heart of the city where my dreams have come alive  
And everything I have and everything I see  
Is just another reminder that Gods been good to me  
  
This golden roads been long  
And sometimes Ive lost my way  
Ive been down some darkened detours  
Leanin heavy on my faith  
But where the devil had me chained  
Lord your love done set me free  
Hallelujah Gods been good to me  
  
Chorus x2
