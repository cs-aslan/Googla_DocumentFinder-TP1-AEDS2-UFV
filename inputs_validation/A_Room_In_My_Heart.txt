My heart was once just like a home  
With many rooms and open doors  
And I always let love in  
It would change the rooms around and then  
Leave them empty  
  
Til one by one I locked each door  
And soon forgot what love was for  
But I never gave up hopin  
So I left just one door open  
In case you found me  
  
So theres a room in my heart for you  
If your trust has been stolen too  
If you walk softly on this worn out wooden floor  
And leave behind you the hurt youve had before  
Theres a room in my heart for you  
  
Well paint the walls from blue to white  
And set the mood by candlelight  
Together well keep out the cold  
And Ill still be there when were old  
If youll let me  
  
So theres a room in my heart for you  
If your trust has been stolen too  
If you walk softly on this worn out wooden floor  
And leave behind you the hurt youve had before  
Theres a room in my heart for you
