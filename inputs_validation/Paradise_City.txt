Chorus  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home oh wont you please take me home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home oh wont you please take me home  
  
Just a urchin livin under the street  
Im a hard case thats tough to beat  
Im your charity case so buy me something to eat  
Ill pay you at another time  
Take it to the end of the line  
  
Rags to riches or so they say  
Ya gotta keep pushin for the fortune and fame  
You know its all a gamble when its just a game  
Ya treat it like a capital crime  
Everybodys doin the time  
  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh wont you please take me home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home yeah yeah  
  
Strapped in the chair of the citys gas chamber  
Why Im here I cant quite remember  
The surgeon general says its hazardous to breathe  
Id have another cigarette but I cant see  
Tell me who youre gonna believe  
  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home yeah yeah  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh wont you please take me home  
  
So far away  
So far away  
So far away  
So far away  
  
Captain Americas been torn apart  
Now hes a court jester with a broken heart  
He said turn me around and take me back to the start  
I must be losing my mind are you blind  
Ive seen it all a million times  
  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home yeah yeah  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh wont you please take me home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home yeah yeah  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh wont you please take me home

Oh wont you please take me home  
I wanna see how good it can be  
Oh wont you please take me home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh wont you please take me home  
Take me down lead me round  
Oh wont you please take me home

I want to take you home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh wont you please take me home  
I wanna go I wanna know  
Oh wont you please take me home
