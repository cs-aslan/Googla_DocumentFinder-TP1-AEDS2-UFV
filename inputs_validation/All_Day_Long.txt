This is a song about an innocent  
Who died at the hands of a desperate man  
He trusted those who he thought he knew  
He trusted those who he looked up to  
Ill never forget the joy in his face  
Hed laugh and hed cry and hed ruin my place  
Hed drive me crazy and hed drive me wild  
I used to scream and shout all day long  
  
Now I hope you know this song  
Is about a child who now has gone  
And other children like him too  
Abused and used by what adults do  
So dont tell me about politics  
Or all the problems of our economics  
When you cant look after what you cant own  
You scream and shout all day long
