Excuse me  
I couldnt help but notice  
You noticing me  
And I was definitely noticing you  
My name is  
You know my name  
But listen  
I have a question  
  
No it aint like me to drop too hard no baby  
Or go out of my way to know who you are  
Say youre not one for chasing  
But Ill admit  
Something in you  
Has got my attention girl  
So if I can  
Be a gentleman  
Can I ask your permission girl

Said if its alright with you baby  
Can I know your name oh can I know your name  
And maybe call you sometime yeah baby  
Can I know your name wanna know your name  
Can I know your name  
  
Looking at you girl I see so much  
So much potential for something better than that  
Like maybe me and you becoming us  
Im not trying to scare you  
But in your eyes  
I can see why  
People write love songs  
And if God allowed  
I could see how  
I could love you for so long  
First things first  
  
If its alright with you  
Can I know your name can I know your name  
And maybe call you sometime baby baby  
Can I know your name I wanna know know know
