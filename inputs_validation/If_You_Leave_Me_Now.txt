Dont go please dont go  
If you leave me now youll take away the biggest part of me  
Oh oh oh oh no baby please dont go  
And if you leave me now youll take away the very heart of me  
Oh oh oh oh no baby please dont go  
A love like ours is love thats hard to find  
How could we let it slip away  
  
Weve come to far to leave it all behind  
How could we end it all this way  
When tomorrow comes and well both regret things we said today  
  
A love like ours is love thats hard to find  
How could we let it slip away  
  
Weve come to far to leave it all behind  
How could we end it all this way  
When tomorrow comes and well both regret things we said today  
  
If you leave me now youll take away the biggest part of me  
Oh oh oh oh no baby please dont go
