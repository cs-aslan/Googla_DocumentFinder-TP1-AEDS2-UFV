They say not to have too much fun  
They say not to get too much sun  
Democrat or Republican  
Guess Im screwed Im neither one  
  
Dont say hell say what the heck  
Do what politically correct  
Dont pray in school but have safe sex  
Isnt that what they expect  
  
Chorus  
Who are they yeah you know what they say  
Who are they someone I gotta pay  
Who are they theyre probably livin in LA  
And I dont care anyway who are they  
  
They probably own the Village Voice  
The Nashville Scene the Peoples Choice  
To me its just a bunch of noise  
Decided on by funny boys  
  
They say who does and dont belong  
They say our hairs too short or long  
They say whos right and whos wrong  
As if well all just come along  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I wonder if theyve got a life  
A broken car and two exwives  
Do they drink beer on Friday night  
I wonder if they like to fight  
  
And I wonder if theyve got a soul  
Or if they like their rocknroll  
Where do they live I gotta know  
So I can tell em where to go  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I dont care anyway  
Theyre probably livin out in LA  
Who are they  
Aw you know what they say  
  
Who are they who are they who are they  
Who are they
