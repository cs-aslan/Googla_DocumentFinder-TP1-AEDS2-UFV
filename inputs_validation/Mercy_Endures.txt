I come to You my God  
The joy of my salvation  
In You I put my trust  
And though I walk through valleys low  
I will fear no evil  
Your love endures forever reaches to the heavens  
And though my flesh may fail me  
Youre the strength of my heart You will always be  
I know Your loving kindness the power of forgiveness  
All that I hold dear is Yours my Jesus its You I long for  
I love Your Name oh Lord  
Ill sing Your praises eternally  
My life is in Your hands  
And when darkness tries to cover me  
I will ever give You praise  
I will ever glorify  
Your love endures forever reaches to the heavens  
And though my flesh may fail me  
Youre the strength of my heart You will always be  
I know Your loving kindness the power of forgiveness  
All that I hold dear is Yours my Jesus its You I long for  
More than anything  
And though I walk through valleys low  
I will fear no evil  
Your love endures forever reaches to the heavens  
And though my flesh may fail me  
Youre the strength of my heart You will always be  
I know Your loving kindness the power of forgiveness  
All that I hold dear is Yours my Jesus its You I long for  
Oh its You  
Incomprehensible
