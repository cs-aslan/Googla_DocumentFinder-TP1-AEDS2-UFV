Found on Heard  
  
Oh I wish that I could find the reason why  
Living isnt really giving  
Oh I wish that I could find the reason why  
Living isnt really giving  
  
But I dont care how long it takes  
For the days to get nice  
Cause me and my friends you know were ready  
And willing to pay the price  
  
Oh la la la   
  
Way deep down inside  
I know Im on a free ride  
But when the green light turns to red  
Who is living who is dead  
  
Theyve taken out the river  
And theyve put in a cement road  
Its made the going a whole lot lighter  
But made a much heavier load  
  
I dont know how long I can go on like this  
Dont know how long I can go on like this  
Dont know how long I can go on like this  
  
I see the light switch on the wall  
With no legs Im still tall  
We might not make it at all  
I can see the river and the little place where I would swim  
Where did it all begin  
I wish I knew  
  
Oh I wish that I could find the reason why  
Living isnt really giving  
Isnt really giving  
Isnt really giving
