Whether Im right or wrong  
Theres no phrase that hits  
Like an ocean needs the sand  
Or a dirty old shoe that fits  
And if all the world was perfect  
I would only ever want to see your scars  
You know they can have their universe  
Well be in the dirt designing stars  
And darlin you know  
You make me feel so beautiful  
Nowhere else in the world I wanna be  
You make me feel so beautiful  
Whether Im up or down  
Theres no crowd to please  
Im like a faith without a clause to believe in it  
And if all the world was smiling  
I would only ever want to see your frown  
You know they can sail away in sunsets  
Well be right here stranded on the ground  
Just happy to be found  
You make me feel so beautiful  
Nowhere else in the world I wanna be  
You make me feel so beautiful  
I have lost my illusions  
I have drowned in your words  
I have left my confusion to a cynical world  
I am throwing myself at things I dont understand  
Discover enlightenment holding your hand  
You are  
So beautiful  
Yeah darlin you know  
That you make me feel so beautiful
