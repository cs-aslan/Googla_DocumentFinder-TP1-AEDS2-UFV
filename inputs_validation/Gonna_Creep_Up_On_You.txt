The writing on the wall showed the scandal  
Pointed out the victim of the vandal  
The lady was upset by the angle  
Scratch your back and hot to handle  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre sly youre slick youre sleek youre outstanding  
My legs are week my heart it beats its pounding  
Soon youre gonna weep in your sleepless surrounding  
Cause Im the one taking you down for grounding  
  
Chorus  
  
Little lady let me take a little bit of your love
