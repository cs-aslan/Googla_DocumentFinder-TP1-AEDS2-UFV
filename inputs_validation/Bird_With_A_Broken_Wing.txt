So I walk alone down the darkest roads  
Cause Ive always known how the story goes  
When the curtain falls Ill be wearing thin  
Clawing at the walls as theyre closing in  
In this twisted plot I was destined for  
Im an astronaut on the ocean floor  
So misunderstood till the bloody end  
How I wish I could do it all again  
  
It feels like Im a lone survivor  
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world  
And on my own I walk alone  
To see the sun again Id give anything  
But life demands a final chapter  
A story that we all must leave behind  
Its do or die and this is mine  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
  
Its another night of the living dead  
Like a viper bite in a spiderweb  
Its so deathly dark in the alleyway  
And a bleeding heart makes you easy prey  
I would run and hide for the afternoon  
With the butterfly in the panic room  
Though I wont be missed I would say its time  
For a different twist in the story line  
  
It feels like Im a lone survivor  
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world  
And on my own I walk alone  
To see the sun again Id give anything  
But life demands a final chapter  
A story that we all must leave behind  
Its do or die and this is mine  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
  
It feels like Im a lone survivor  
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world  
And on my own I walk alone  
To see the sun again Id give anything  
But life demands a final chapter  
A story that we all must leave behind  
Its do or die and this is mine  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
  
Tell the world I know that my mind is made  
Its a horror show but Im not afraid  
Though I wont be missed I would say its time  
For a different twist in the story line
