My eyes are closed and Ive nothing more to say  
But I was so willing to give it all away  
  
And what a show  
Ive loved you all I could  
  
When will I see you  
Is nothing understood  
  
You thought I was stupid  
But now I stop stop at nothing I stop at nothing  
I thought you were better  
But loves gonna take a man  
Yeah loves gonna take a man  
  
Dont say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Heaven only knows  
At your every turn a scandal  
But hows it suit you  
When its all too much to cope with  
  
You thought I was nothing  
Before you stepped stepped into my life stepped into my life  
I thought you were clever  
But loves gonna take a man  
And you havent got it in you  
  
Dont say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Dont say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Dont say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Dont say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Dont say your love is killing me Dont say your love  
You know how much it means to me Is killing me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Dont say your love is killing me Dont say your your love is  
You know how much it means to me Your love is killing me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride
