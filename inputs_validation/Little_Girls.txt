I I I love little girls  
They make me feel so good  
I love little girls  
They make me feel so bad  
  
When theyre around  
They make me feel  
Like Im the only guy in town  
  
I love little girls  
They make me feel so good  
  
They dont care if Im a oneway mirror  
Theyre not frightened by my cold exterior  
  
They dont ask me questions  
They dont want to scold me  
They dont look for answers  
They just want to hold me  
  
Isnt this fun  
Isnt this what lifes all about  
Isnt this a dream come true  
Isnt this a nightmare too  
  
Oh oh oh I love little girls  
They make me feel so good

They make me feel so bad  
  
When theyre around  
They make me feel  
Like Im the only guy in town  
  
I love little girls  
They make me feel so good  
  
They dont care about my inclinations  
Theyre not frightened by my revelations

Uh oh uh oh its a mistake its a mistake  
Uh oh uh oh Im in trouble Im in trouble  
Uh oh uh oh the little girl was just too little  
Too little too little too little too little  
  
Isnt this what lifes all about  
Isnt this a dream come true  
Isnt this a nightmare too  
  
And I dont care what people say  
And I dont care what people think  
And I dont care how we look  
Walking down the street
