I got a guy  
He dont dress me in sable  
He looks nothing like Gable  
But hes mine  
And I think hes too divine  
  
I got a guy  
When he starts into pet me  
Hes the sauce on spaghetti  
Hes the kind  
That you cant keep off your mind  
  
I got a guy  
And hes tough  
Hes just a gem in the rough  
But when I polish him up I swear  
Hell be a Tiffany solitaire  
  
Im riding high  
Cause Im happy and carefree  
There is nothing that can scare me  
Cause I got a guy  
  
I got a guy  
And hes tough  
Hes just a gem in the rough  
But when I polish him up I swear  
Hell be a Tiffany solitaire  
  
Im riding high  
Cause Im happy and carefree  
There is nothing that can scare me  
Cause I got a guy
