Open wide Oh so good Ill eat you  
Take me for a ride  
In your sweet delicious  
Perfect little mouth  
Thereupon I linger  
You will have no doubt  
Ill do my best for you I do  
Love  
Lets stop to get it going  
Lost myself just thinking  
About the two of us  
From each other drinking  
Begin with the lips  
Fingertips and kissing  
Turn me inside out  
I do my best for you  
Up and down we go  
From the top you push me  
This is such a thrill  
Lost in love and dancing  
Shake your tambourine  
You blow my head open  
Of this theres no doubt  
I do my best for you I do  
For you I would crawl  
Through the darkest dungeon  
Climb the castle wall  
If you are my Rapunzel  
You let your hair down  
Right in through your window  
Good they locked the door  
I do my best for you  
I think the world of you  
All of my heart I do  
Blood through my veins for you  
You alone have all of me  
I give my world to you  
To you I will be true  
Too good to be real  
Smell of something cooking  
My soul youre to steal  
Food of love were filling  
What youve given me  
For it there is no measure  
Of one thing I know  
Ill give my best for you  
I think the world of you  
All of my heart I do  
Blood through my veins for you  
You alone have all of me  
From you my strength is full  
To carry your burdens too  
I give my world to you  
Hip lock up so tight  
You drive me crazy  
Crazy is all right  
With you looking at me  
You make me feel high  
Every single thing you do to me  
Is like Im drunk  
I do my best for you I do
