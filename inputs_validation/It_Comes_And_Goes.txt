It comes and goes  
The feeling Ive been feeling  
When she comes it grows  
I know its just a feeling  
But when shes around  
I get the feeling  
That Im in some other world  
Like some other girl  
And when she calls her name  
I dont know what it is  
But its just not the same  
I dont know whats been missing  
But I know its gone  
I feel it from  
My head way down to my toes  
It comes and goes  
  
She still really cares  
And Im not being smart  
I might of been imagining all the time  
Whos to say the feeling  
I feel in my heart  
Wont turn out to be all in my mind  
It hurts me  
  
It comes and goes  
It comes and goes  
  
Oh baby  
She still really cares  
And Im not being smart  
I might of been imagining all the time  
Whos to say the feeling  
I feel in my heart  
Wont turn out to be all in my mind  
  
And yet when were alone  
She makes me feel like some old toy  
Thats been outgrown  
As tho I were just some old boy  
She hardly known  
I cant help feeling  
How the feeling comes and goes  
She comes and goes with someone new
