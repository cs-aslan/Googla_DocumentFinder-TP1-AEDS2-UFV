I cant eat  
I cant sleep  
I cant live  
I cant cry  
I cant die  
I cant walk  
I cant talk  
I can booze  
I can booze and steal your shoes So I can move  
Tumble in the rough  
  
Im looking for a new meditation  
Still looking for a new way to fly  
Dont want any plastic validation  
Not looking for a new way to die  
  
I made excuses for a million lies  
But all I got was humble kidney pie  
So what  
  
I cant eat  
I cant sleep  
I cant live  
I cant cry  
I cant die  
I cant walk  
I cant talk  
I can booze  
I can booze and steal your shoes So I can move  
Tumble in the rough  
  
Im lookin for a new stimulation  
Quite bored of those inflatable ties  
Im looking for a new rock sensation  
Dead fish dont swim around in jealous tides  
  
I made excuses for a million lies  
But all I got was humble kidney pie  
So what  
  
Cant live cant buy new shoes Tumble in the rough  
Lived on a summer with new shoes Tumble in the rough  
Cant live cant die  new shoes Tumble in the rough  
Lived on a summer with new shoes Tumble in the rough  
  
I cant eat  
I cant sleep  
I cant live  
I cant cry  
I cant die  
I cant walk  
I cant talk  
I can booze  
I can booze and steal your shoes So I can move  
Tumble in the rough  
  
I made excuses for a million lies  
But all I got was humble kidney pie  
I made excuses for a million lies  
But all I got was humble kidney pie  
So what
