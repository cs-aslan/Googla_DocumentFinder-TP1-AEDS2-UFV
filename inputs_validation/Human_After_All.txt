Live baby life is loud  
Well make it through the filth and the glory  
Give more of what youve got  
Funk it up and tell your story  
  
For every dream that got away  
We found our ordinary day  
For every blue sky turning gray  
We found imaginary ways  
I look at you and where we are  
Were human after all  
  
Time theres no remedy  
Just hold our broken hearts together  
Your touch all that chemistry  
Now Im lost unlikely defender  
  
For every dream that got away  
We found our ordinary day  
For every blue sky turning gray  
We found imaginary ways  
I look at you and where we are  
Were human after all  
  
Its alright when the day is done  
Its alright theres something better  
Its alright when the morning comes  
Its alright theres nothing better  
  
For every dream that got away  
We found our ordinary day  
For every blue sky turning gray  
We found imaginary ways  
I look at you and where we are  
Were human after all
