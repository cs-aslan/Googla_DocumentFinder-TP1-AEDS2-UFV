Life  
By Marshal Mathers  
What is life  
Life is like a big obstacle  
In front of your optical to slow you down  
  
And every time you think you gotten past it  
Its gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground  
What are friends  
Friends are people that you think are your friends  
But they really your enemies with secret identities  
And disguises to hide they true colors  
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers  
They want to come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin  
  
What is money  
Money is what makes a man act funny  
Money is the root of all evil  
Moneyll make them same friends come back around  
Swearing that they was always down  
  
What is life  
Im tired of life  
Im tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins  
Im tired of committing so many sins  
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins  
Tired of never having any ends  
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and many things  
Im tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins  
Tired of not having a deal  
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel  
Tired of drowning in my sorrow  
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo  
Im tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off  
Im tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour  
Then this boss wonders why Im smartin off  
Tired of being fired every time I fart and cough  
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk  
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk  
Im tired of using plastic silverware  
Tired of working in Building Square  
Tired of not being a millionaire  
But if I had a million dollars  
Id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics  
  
If I had a magic wand  
Id make the world suck my dick  
Without a condom on  
While Im on the john  
If I had a million bucks  
It wouldnt be enough  
Because Id still be out  
Robbing armored trucks  
If I had one wish  
I would ask for a big enough ass  
For the whole world to kiss  
  
Im tired of being white trash broke and always poor  
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store  
Im tired of not having a phone  
Tired of not having a home  
To have one in if I did have it on  
Tired of not driving a BM  
Tired of not working at GM tired of wanting to be him  
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM  
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum  
Tired of not being on tour  
Tired of fucking the same blond whore  
After work in the back of a Contour  
Im tired of faking knots with a stack of ones  
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns  
  
Tired of being stared at  
Im tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat  
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz  
Tired of people saying theyre tired of hearing me rap about drugs  
Tired of other rappers who aint bringin half the skill as me  
Saying they wasnt feeling me when nobodys as ill as me  
Im tired of radio stations telling fibs  
Tired of JLbe saying Where HipHop Lives  
  
But if I had a million dollars  
Id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics  
If I had a magic wand Id make the world suck my dick  
Without a condom on while Im on the john  
  
If I had a million bucks  
It wouldnt be enough because Id still be out  
Robbing armored trucks  
If I had one wish  
I would ask for a big enough ass  
For the whole world to kiss  
You know what Im saying  
Im tired of all of this bullshit  
Telling me to be positive  
Howm I sposed to be positive when I dont see shit positive  
Know what Im sayin  
I rap about shit around me shit I see  
Know what Im sayin  
Right now Im tired of everything  
Tired of all this player hating thats going on in my own city  
Cant get no airplay you know what Im sayin  
But ey its cool though you know what Im sayin  
Just fed up  
Thats my word
