Back in the days I made up my mind  
That I would be a king you know genuine  
Reign supreme at the top of the heap  
And like working all day no time to sleep  
Destined to rise in front of your eyes  
So we surmise its time for the prize  
The time has come we gotta be number one  
The world is full of power and we got to get some  
No more beggin and useless teardrops  
So Im trading these teardrops for props  
Goin all the way and with my powerful team  
Conquering the world and Ima rise like cream  
All out putting heads to bed  
Cause Im a grown man and I hate to get spoonfed  
Wisdom son I rose in the east  
Till we reach the top wont be no peace cause its  
  
Chorus  
Strictly business strictly business  
Aint no way Im gonna stop  
Strictly business aint no time to get more  
Gotta make it to the top  
  
Everything we do gotta be brand new  
The moves we make gotta make the earth shake  
Sitting at my desk cause I manifest to my team  
Big plans thatll make us the best  
Cause we can rule this game we all play  
Pop champagne and make everyday a holiday  
Smooth as a rose but hard like steel  
From now on Ima make my dreams real  
On a mission gotta get there  
If you want to rule you gotta be in there  
Our masterplan is the best  
And aint a man alive thatll beat us to a conquest  
Cause this is the reason we was born  
To rock on and on and on and on  
Look at my eyes its hypnotizing  
Word is bond we gotta keep on rising  
  
Chorus  
  
Ima be a legend in all the books and mags  
Stuffin the cash inside garbage bags  
Aint no time to waste we gotta motivate  
Pass anybody that stops to get gas  
Forever and a day my destinys set  
No sweat I make it rougher than rougher gets  
Hold on tight if not get blown away  
Pick up the pieces cause were known to say  
Radical things to get a champions ring  
Give it up punk dont make me swing  
We planned ahead to get the butter and the bread  
Dressed in black and Im stayin out the red  
So when it comes to like taking charge  
Get props for where they do and stop frontin on tar  
Gotta go for what you know to be the cream of the crop  
With the power of God Ima rise to the top its  
  
Chorus  
  
Uncle L uhh repeat 16X
