Old toy trains little toy tracks  
Little boy toys coming from a sack  
Carried by a man dressed in white and red  
Little boy dont you think its time you were in bed  
  
Close your eyes  
Listen to the skies  
All is calm all is well  
Soon youll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells  
  
Bringin old toy trains little toy tracks  
Little boy toys coming from a sack  
Carried by a man dressed in white and red  
Little boy dont you think its time you were in bed  
  
Close your eyes  
Listen to the skies  
All is calm all is well  
Soon youll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells  
  
Bringin old toy trains little toy tracks  
Little boy toys coming from a sack  
Carried by a man dressed in white and red  
Little boy dont you think its time you were in bed
