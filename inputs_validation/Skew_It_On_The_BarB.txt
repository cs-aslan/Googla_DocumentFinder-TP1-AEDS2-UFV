Old school players to new school fools

Say I be got dammit they done changed the rules

The common denominator the nigga numerator  
Never know who the hater niggas cater to your ego  
Im sorry like Atari whose the cousin to Coleco Vision  
Caught a Rico back on the street like Chico DeBarge  
He large and got a Llac in the garage  
Few parts here and there I declare hard my lawd  
One at Clark one at Spelman  
Both know each other and its cool you can tell when  
He step off in the party women jump for joy  
But all the wild niggas schemin they gon jump the boy  
For spittin all that bourgeoise my watch my car  
Im a star Id rather be a comet by far

Deliver this through your audio ghetto mafioso  
Grow hydro then bag it up slow  
Price that longevity suggest make moves slow  
Take time grow eight react nine blow  
Hydro slide raw like fuck Ronaldo  
Fly ride though shit lookin wild dope  
Then glide yo flippin the page I go  
Watch fiveoh jump on my meat ride slow  
Watch those undercovers cop those rock those  
Glocks blows leave em baggy and collect spot grows  
Keep a watch froze lean on the yacht and wash clothes  
Let the chop blow bag a half a block plot grows what

Boi I bust raps like Dboys bust gats shit  
We the type of people that dont bury the axe  
Or the hatchet everytime we see your link we snatch it  
Ridin round our hood talkin that dumb shit your cabbage  
Is cracked like plumbers ass and summers grass  
I been in the game for a minute seen some suckas like yall passin  
Thinkin youre light skinned aight then lil boy why you frightened  
The Dungeon Family gon be here nigga so keep writing  
I gotta hit The Source I need my other half a mic  
Because that Southerplayalisticadillacmuzik was a classic right  
College Park East Point and Decatur they got my back so  
We gon keep on jammin and stabbin off in the track ahh  
Think its time to bungee but buddy we will be back  
And Im fin to put some Ds on the Llac know dat
