Dont know why I never told you  
There was something in your eyes that took my breath away  
And every word I meant to say  
Now I know Id give my soul to you  
Take you back in time and hold you  
Just for one more day so I wouldnt have to hurt this way  
So I beg and plead Im on my knees  
Gonna show you how long I can wait  
I cant keep holding on if youre telling my heart its too late  
  
Chorus  
Next lifetime our love will be deeper  
And Ill hold you sweeter  
I wont waste so much time  
Next lifetime Ill find you sooner  
And Ill kiss you better  
I wont lose you next time  
Oh I will lay my heart on the line next lifetime  
  
I dont know what I was thinking  
But giving you a part of me wasnt good enough  
Never gave you all my love  
I cant believe I was such a fool  
All I needed was to prove to you I could feel like this  
Could have said it all in our last kiss  
Oh I beg and plead Im on my knees  
I could never unmake my mistake  
I can keep holding on but if somebodys taking my place  
  
Chorus  
  
Never knew how long the nights could be  
Till you slipped right through my hands  
How do I make you believe that I deserve a second chance  
Take me back to the place where your heart was mine  
If I could take you back in time  
I will lay my heart on the line Repeat x2
