Theres a small cafe on the outskirts of town  
Ill be there when the sun goes down  
Where the roadside bends  
And it twists and turns  
Every new generation  
And Ill be praying to my higher self  
Dont let me down keep my feet on the ground  
  
Theres a roadside jam playin on the edge of town  
In a town called Paradise near the ancient highway  
When the train whistle blows  
All the sadness that Hank Williams knows  
And the river flows  
Call them pagan streams and it spins and turns  
In a factory in a street called Bread in East Belfast  
Where Georgie knows best  
What its like to be Daniel in the lions den  
Got so many friends only most of the time  
  
When the grass is high and the rabbit runs  
Though its talkin to you and I  
And every new generation comes to pay  
The dues of the organ grinder jam  
And the grinders switch of the sacrifice  
Everybody made to be rational with understanding  
And Ill be praying to my higher self  
Oh dont let me down keep my feet on the ground  
  
What about all the people living in the nightmare hurt  
That wont go away no matter how hard they try  
Theyve got to pay time and time again time and time again  
Ill be praying to my higher self  
And Ill be standin there where the boats go by  
When the sun is sinking way over the hill  
On a Friday evening when the sun goes down  
On the outskirts of town I want to slip away  
I want to slip away got to get away  
And Ill be praying to my higher self  
Dont let me down keep my feet on the ground dont let me down  
  
Youll be cryin again youll be cryin again youll be cryin again  
By the same wipe the teardrops from your eyes  
Have to slip away in the evening when the sun goes down  
Over the hill with a sense of wonder  
Everything gonna be right on a Friday evening  
All the cars go by all along down  
The ancient highway  
And Ill be praying Ill be praying to my higher self  
Dont let me down keep my feet keep my feet on the ground  
Keep my feet on the ground  
  
Traveling like a stranger in the night all along the ancient highway  
Got you in my sights got you on my mind  
Ill be praying in the evening when the sun goes down  
Over the mountain got to get you right in my sight  
As the beams on the cars from the overpass  
On the ancient highway shine like diamonds in the night  
Like diamonds in the night  
Ill be praying to my higher self to my higher self  
Dont let me down dont let me down  
  
And youll be standing there while the boats go by  
While the boats go by on a Friday evening  
Shining your light shining your light on a Friday evening  
Got to slip away got to slip away down that ancient highway  
In a town called Paradise in a town in a town  
All along all along that road all along that road  
All along that road with the trance like vision  
  
Ill be praying to my higher self dont let me down dont let me down  
Keep my feet on the ground keep my feet on the ground  
Keep my feet on the ground  
Friday evening got to slip away  
Watching the view from a car from the overpass  
And were driving down that ancient road  
Shining like diamonds in the night oh diamonds in the night  
All along the ancient highway  
Got you in my sight got you in my mind  
Got you in my arms and Im praying and Im gonna pray  
Im gonna pray to my higher self ah dont let me down  
Dont let me down give me the fire ah give me the fire
