Six oclock Im wasted  
She is in my bones  
This citys all gone dead on me again  
May as well find my way home  
  
No one really knows me  
No one ever said  
Surely isnt free  
Surelydoesnt end honey  
  
Like a playing song in my head  
Drifting on here I am  
  
Heading for the blue light  
Shivered back again  
Almost in the blue light  
When you shivered back again old friend  
  
Its coming on in my head  
Playing on and on  
Something too hard will be ok  
The things you do  
Its coming with you  
  
Here comes the blue light  
Here comes the blue light  
Still playing on  
  
Six oclock Im wasted  
She is in my bones again  
Citys all gone right dead  
May as well find my way
