They say the best things in life are free  
But you can give them to the birds and bees  
I need money thats what I want  
Thats what I want yeah thats what I want  
  
Money dont get everything its true  
Though what it wont buy I cant use  
I need money thats what I want  
Thats what I want thats what I want  
  
Your love gives me such a thrill  
But your lovin dont pay my bills  
I need money thats what I want  
Thats what I want yeah thats what I want  
  
Well gimme money I want some money  
Whole lotta money I want some money  
Thats what I want yeah thats what I want

Whole lotta money

Whole lotta money thats what I want
