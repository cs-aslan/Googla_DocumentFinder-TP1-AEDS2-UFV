Its always half and half  
Im happy and Im sad  
Everything thats beautiful  
Always kills me too  
The highest I get up  
Is the deepest I get down  
Youre up there with your life  
Thats why I gotta shout shout  
 And then gotta shout shout  
  
Blues for Meister  
You sweet little thing  
Blues for Meister  
Im so sad I gotta sing  
A cozy little kitty up  
Sittin on the couch  
Oh kitty cat oh baby  
I really miss you now  
Well have some respect  
For my cat  
He got squashed by the wheel  
Of a Cadillac  
Well me and my pussy  
We lost our flow  
Well goodbye my little calico  
  
Your foods still in the cupboard  
Hangin in its can  
You used to love to eat it  
Down  
Ill always love you Meister  
You were so good to me  
Theres nothing like you nowhere  
As far as I can see  
  
Blues for Meister  
You sweet little thing  
Blues for Meister  
Im so sad I gotta sing  
A cozy little kitty up  
Sittin on the couch  
Oh kitty cat oh baby  
I really miss you now  
Well have some respect  
For my cat  
He got squashed by the wheel  
Of a Cadillac  
Well me and my pussy  
We lost our flow  
Well goodbye my little calico
