A little boy alone he relies on fairytales  
And the moon is his castle late tonight  
Smiling down upon our war  
Its funny when  
youre far away  
But Mr Moon why you laughing at me  
  
You cannot blame us for lying to you  
You cannot blame us for crying to you  
Why you laughing at me Mr Moon  
  
The wiser man roams the world  
Looks back upon his days  
The moon is a wonder late tonight  
Smiling from above our world  
Its easy when youre far away  
But Mr Moon why you laughing at me  
  
You cannot blame us for lying to you  
You cannot blame us for crying to you  
Why you laughing at me Mr Moon  
  
You dont need me  
You dont want me  
Leave me be while I sleep  
  
You cannot blame us for lying to you  
And you run away you run away  
Daytime  
But the night just brings us back together  
You cannot blame us for crying to you no no  
Its time we laughed at you Mr Moon
