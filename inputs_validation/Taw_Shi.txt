The desert wind  
From the East  
Binding us together  
Ohohohoh  
Dance for me Taw Shi  
The day has come to prove  
To prove your love  
Forever  
Ohohohoh  
Dance for me Taw Shi  
Among the two  
I prefer you  
I want to see you  
Set fire to the night  
Among the two  
You must come through  
Oh let me see you  
Set fire to the night  
Ohohohoh  
Dance for me this dance  
Ohohohoh  
Chant with me this chant  
So follow me  
Across the sand  
To where the musics playing  
Ohohohoh  
Dance for me Taw Shi  
The sands will blow  
A thousand years  
The rythm still remains  
Ohohohoh  
Dance for me Taw Shi  
Among the two  
I prefer you  
I want to see you  
Set fire to the night  
Among the two  
You must come through  
Oh let me see you  
Set fire to the night  
Ohohohoh  
Dance for me this dance  
Ohohohoh  
Chant with me this chant  
Oh oh YAH YAH  
TAW SHI WA NADAR  
Oh oh YAH YAH  
TAW SHI  YA YA YA  
TAW SHI  YA YA YA  
I want to see you  
Set fire to the night  
TAW SHI  YA YA YA  
TAW SHI  YA YA YA  
Oh let me see you  
Set fire to the night  
TAW SHI  YA YA YA  
TAW SHI  YA YA YA  
I want to see you  
Set fire to the night  
Oh oh YA YA YA
