Its time the tale were told  
Of how you took a child  
And you made him old  
  
Its time the tale were told  
Of how you took a child  
And you made him old  
You made him old  
  
Reel around the fountain  
Slap me on the patio  
Ill take it now  
Oh  
  
Fifteen minutes with you  
Well I wouldnt say no  
Oh people said that you were virtually dead  
And they were so wrong  
  
Fifteen minutes with you  
Oh well I wouldnt say no  
Oh people said that you were easily led  
And they were halfright  
Oh theyoh they were halfright oh  
  
Its time the tale were told  
Of how you took a child  
And you made him old  
Its time that the tale were told  
Of how you took a child  
And you made him old  
You made him old  
  
Oh reel around the fountain  
Slap me on the patio  
Ill take it now  
Ahoh  
  
Fifteen minutes with you  
Oh I wouldnt say no  
Oh people see no worth in you  
Oh but I do  
Fifteen minutes with you  
Oh I wouldnt say no  
Oh people see no worth in you  
I do  
Oh Ioh I do  
Oh  
  
I dreamt about you last night  
And I fell out of bed twice  
You can pin and mount me like a butterfly  
But take me to the haven of your bed  
Was something that you never said  
Two lumps please  
Youre the bees knees  
But so am I  
  
Oh meet me at the fountain  
Shove me on the patio  
Ill take it slowly  
Oh  
  
Fifteen minutes with you  
Oh I wouldnt say no  
Oh people see no worth in you  
Oh but I do  
Fifteen minutes with you  
Oh no I wouldnt say no  
Oh people see no worth in you  
I do  
Oh II do  
Oh I do  
Oh I do  
Oh I do
