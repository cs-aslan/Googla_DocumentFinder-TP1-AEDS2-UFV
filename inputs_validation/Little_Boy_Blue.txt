Little boy blue  
Come blow your horn  
The dish ran away with the spoon  
Home again home again  
Saturday morn  
Never gets up before noon  
  
She used to render  
You legal and tender  
When you used to  
Send her your promises boy  
A dill or a dollar  
Unbutton your collar  
Come out and holler  
Out all of your noise  
  
Little boy blue  
Come blow your top  
Cut it right down to the quick  
Dont sit home and cry  
On the fourth of July  
Around now youre hittin bricks  
  
So abracadabra  
Now she disappeared  
Now every things Canada dry  
So watch your behavior  
And rattle your cane  
With a bottle of bourbon  
Goodbye  
  
Little boy blow  
Lost little bo peep  
She fell through a hole in the nest  
Now aint it peculiar  
That shes finally cooled your  
Big wheels just like all of the rest  
  
Whenever it rains  
The umbrella complain  
Theyre always gettin played for a chump  
So mark and strike it  
Shes history now  
And youre hangin out at the pump  
  
Little boy blue  
She used to render
