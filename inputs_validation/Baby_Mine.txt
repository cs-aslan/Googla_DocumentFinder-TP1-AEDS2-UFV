Baby mine dont you cry  
Baby mine dry your eyes  
Rest your head close to my heart  
Never to part baby of mine  
  
Little one when you play  
Dont you mind what they say  
Let those eyes sparkle and shine  
Never a tear baby of mine  
  
If they knew sweet little you  
Theyd end up loving you too  
All those same people who scold you  
What theyd give just for  
The right to hold you  
  
From your head to your toes  
Youre not much goodness knows  
But youre so precious to me  
Cute as can be baby of mine
