Everyday is like a set up race  
And the world is still a lonely place  
To be or not to be is this the final quiz  
A flash in the pan goodbye  
Still shooting for the open sky  
Between the devil and the deep blue sea  
I cannot find a compromise  
Its all just treason  
They bring me down with their lies  
Dont know the reason  
My life is fire and ice  
Theres a voice that whispers I can fail  
I believe its just a trick of the tail  
Between the devil and the deep blue sea  
There is no way no compromise  
Its all just treason  
They bring me down with their lies  
Dont know the reason  
My life is fire and ice
