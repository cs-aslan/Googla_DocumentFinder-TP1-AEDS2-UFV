Comb your hair and paint and powder you act proud and Ill act prouder  
You sing loud and Ill sing louder tonight were settin the woods on fire  
Youre my gal and Im your feller dress up in your frock of yeller  
Ill look swell but youll look sweller settin the woods on fire  
Well take in all the honky tonks tonight were having fun  
Well show the folks a brand new dance that never has been done  
I dont care who thinks were silly you be daffy and Ill be dilly  
Well order up two bowls of chili settin the woods on fire

Youll be broke but Ill be broker tonight were settin the woods on fire  
Well sit close to one another up one street and down the other  
Well have a time oh brother settin the woods on fire  
Well put aside a little time to fix a flat or two  
My tires and tubes are doin fine but the air is showin through  
You clap hands and Ill start bowin well do all the laws allowin  
Tomorrow Ill be right back plowin settin the woods on fire
