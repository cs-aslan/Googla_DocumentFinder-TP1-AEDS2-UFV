He said Lets get out of this town  
Drive out of the city away from the crowds  
I thought heaven cant help me now  
Nothing lasts forever but this is gonna take me down  
  
Hes so tall and handsome as hell  
Hes so bad but he does it so well  
I can see the end as it begins  
My one condition is  
  
Say youll remember me standing in a nice dress  
Staring at the sunset babe  
Red lips and rosy cheeks  
Say youll see me again  
Even if its just in your wildest dreams oh wildest dreams oh ah  
  
I said No one has to know what we do  
His hands are in my hair his clothes are in my room  
And his voice is a familiar sound  
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now  
  
Hes so tall and handsome as hell  
Hes so bad but he does it so well  
And when weve had our very last kiss  
My last request is  
  
Say youll remember me standing in a nice dress  
Staring at the sunset babe  
Red lips and rosy cheeks  
Say youll see me again  
Even if its just in your wildest dreams oh wildest dreams oh ah  
  
You see me in hindsight  
Tangled up with you all night  
Burning it down  
Someday when you leave me  
I bet these memories  
Follow you around  
  
Youll see me in hindsight  
Tangled up with you all night  
Burning it down  
Someday when you leave me  
I bet these memories  
Follow you around  
  
Say youll remember me standing in a nice dress  
Staring at the sunset babe  
Red lips and rosy cheeks  
Say youll see me again  
Even if its just pretend  
  
Say youll remember me standing in a nice dress  
Staring at the sunset babe  
Red lips and rosy cheeks  
Say youll see me again  
Even if its just in your just pretend just pretend wildest dreams oh ah
in your wildest dreams oh ah  
Even if its just in your wildest dreams oh ah in your wildest dreams ah
ah
