Shake it like a ladder to the sun  
Makes me feel like a madman on the run  
Find me never never far gone  
So get your leather leather  
Leather on on on on  
  
Chorus  
Your zero  
Whats your name  
No ones gonna ask you  
Better find out where they want you to go  
Try and hit the spot  
Get to know it in the dark  
Get to know it whether youre  
Crying crying crying oh oh  
Can you climb climb climb higher  
  
Shake it like a ladder to the sun  
Makes me feel like a madman on the run  
Now youre never never far gone  
So get your leather leather  
Leather on on on on  
  
Chorus  
  
Was it the cure Shellshock  
Was it the cure Hope not  
Was it the cure Shellshock  
Was it the cure  
Whats your name  
  
Chorus  
  
Was it the cure Shellshock  
Was it the cure Hope not  
Was it the cure Shellshock  
Was it the cure Hope not  
  
Whats your name
