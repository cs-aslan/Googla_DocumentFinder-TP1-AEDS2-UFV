I believe your new girl turned you down  
And they say shes pushin you around  
How does it feel I guess it hurts your pride  
Tell me my friend how many nights youve cried  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The king has lost his crown  
Suddenly  
Hes clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown  
  
Was it hard to step down from your throne  
And to know tonight youre all alone  
Oh what a shame you really want that girl  
She doesnt care still you just dream of her  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The king has lost his crown  
Suddenly  
Hes clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The word is all around  
Suddenly  
Hes clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown
