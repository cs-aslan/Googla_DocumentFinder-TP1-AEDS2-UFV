Who wants to come with me and melt in the sun  
Superstition taking all of us for a ride  
Bombs overtaken by the signs of the light  
The bombs are falling overhead with no sight  
While you talking all detached so tell us  
  
Where you going  
To the bottom  
Do you hear us  
We are rotting  
  
Were going down  
In a spiral to the ground  
No one No ones gonna save us now  
  
Ceremonies have killed religions for they provide  
The masked comforts to delusional  
Theyre all in fright  
The true believers head was bathed in sunlight  
While you are walking all detached so tell us  
  
Where you going  
To the bottom  
Do you hear us  
We are rotting  
  
Were going down  
In a spiral to the ground  
No one No ones gonna save us now  
  
Not even God  
No one saved us  
No ones gonna save us  
  
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall  
  
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall  
  
Where do you expect them to go when the bombs fall  
  
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall  
  
Superstition taking all of us for a ride  
Mimes overtaken by the signs of the Right  
The bombs are falling overhead with no sight  
While you are talking all detached detached detached detached detached  
  
Were going down  
In a spiral to the ground  
No one No ones gonna save us now  
  
Not even God  
No one saved us  
No one saved us  
No one saved us  
No ones gonna save us now  
  
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall
