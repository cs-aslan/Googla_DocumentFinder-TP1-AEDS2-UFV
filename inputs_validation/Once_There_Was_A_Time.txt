Once there was a time Id rob my mama  
For a good meal and a smoke  
Once there was a time Id sell my brother  
For a dollar when I was broke  
  
But Id never sell my guitar  
And my strings were always sharp  
Cause if I dont have a guitar  
Ill be strumming on some angels harp  
  
And if I dont get to heaven  
And I go down there below  
Better be a guitar when I get there  
Or I will refuse to go  
  
Once there was a time I was hungry  
And Id find my food in some bin  
But Id never never sell my guitar  
Cause that would darling that would be a sin
