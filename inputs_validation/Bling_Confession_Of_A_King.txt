When I offer you survival  
You say its hard enough to live  
Its not so bad its not so bad  
How do you know that youre right  
  
I awoke on the roadside  
In the land of the free ride  
And I cant pull it any longer  
The sun is beating down my neck  
  
So I ran with the devil  
Left a trail of excuses  
Like a stone on the water  
The elements decide my fate  
Watch it go  
Bling  
  
When I offer you survival  
You say its hard enough to live  
Dont tell me that its over  
Stand up for a Tiber more than this  
  
How do you know that youre right  
If youre not nervous anymore  
Its not so bad its not so bad  
  
I feel my vision slipping in and out of focus  
But Im pushing on for that horizon  
Im pushing on  
Now Ive got that blowing wind against my face  
  
So you sling rocks at the rip tide  
Am I wrong or am I right  
I hit the bottom with a huh  
Quite strange  
I get my glory in the desert rain  
Watch it go  
I offer you survival  
  
When I offer you survival  
You say its hard enough to live  
And Ill tell you when its over  
Shut up for a Tiber more than this  
  
How do you know that youre right  
If youre not nervous anymore  
Its not so bad its not so bad  
  
Higher and higher  
Were gonna take it  
Down to the wire  
Were gonna make it  
Out of the fire  
Higher and higher  
  
Higher and higher  
Were gonna take it  
Down to the wire  
Were gonna make it  
Out of the fire  
Higher and higher  
  
Higher and higher  
Were gonna take it  
Down to the wire  
Were gonna make it out  
Whoa oh oh higher and higher  
  
It aint hard to hold  
When it shines like gold  
Youll remember me
