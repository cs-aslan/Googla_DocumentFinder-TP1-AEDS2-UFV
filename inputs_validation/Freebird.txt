If I leave here tomorrow  
Would you still remember me  
For I must be travelin on now  
Theres too many places I got to see  
  
If I stay here with you girl  
Things just couldnt be the same  
Cause Im as free as a bird now  
And this bird you cannot change  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
And the bird you cannot change  
And this bird you cannot change  
Lord knows I cant change  
  
Bye and bye baby its been sweet love yeah yeah  
Though this feelin I cant change  
Please dont take it so badly  
Cause Lord knows Im to blame  
  
And if I stay here with you girl  
Things just couldnt even be the same  
Cause Im as free as a bird now  
And this bird you cannot change  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
And the bird you cannot change  
And this bird you cannot change  
  
Lord knows I cant change  
Lord help me I cant change  
Lord I cant change  
Wont you fly high free bird yeah
