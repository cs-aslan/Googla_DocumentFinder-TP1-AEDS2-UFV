Dont know how to take it dont know where to go  
My resistance running low  
And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so  
You know that Im nobodys fool  
Im nobodys fool and yet its clear to me  
I dont have a strategy  
Its just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be  
  
Under attack Im being taken  
About to crack defenses breaking  
Wont somebody please have a heart  
Come and rescue now cause Im falling apart  
Under attack Im taking cover  
Hes on my track my chasing lover  
Thinking nothing can stop him now  
But I want to know should I want to Im not sure  
  
This is getting crazy I should tell him so  
Really let my anger show  
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no  
Im kind of certain thats the truth  
Guess Im kind of flattered but Im scared as well  
Something like a magic spell  
I hardly dare to think of what could happen where Id be if I fell

Should I want to Im not sure I would know how
