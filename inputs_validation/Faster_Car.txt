Any time that you want what you need  
Close your eyes say my name call on me  
And Ill be there for you no matter what they say  
Rain hail or shine  
I got my eye spy to the sky waitin on your sign  
  
Roll the dice take a chance a chance on me  
Cause you never can tell where a little bit of faith might lead  
I got a you shaped hole inside  
I swear it gets deeper by the day  
Flickin cigarettes out the window goin no where in this lonely rain  
  
Chorus  
I need a faster car now  
A rocket ship straight to the moon  
I need a faster way to  
Show you how much I need you baby  
  
Its a crime its a sin its a damn shame  
But youre the cause and youre the cure of all my pain  
Theres never been a bigger fool for you  
I cant believe my pride  
You got me talkin to an empty pillow in the middle of the night  
I aint slept in quite a while  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I need a faster car now  
Im a rocket man in love with you  
I need a faster way to  
Show you how much you drive me crazy  
Show you how much I need you baby
