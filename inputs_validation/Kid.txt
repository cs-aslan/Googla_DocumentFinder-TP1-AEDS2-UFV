Kid what changed your mood  
Youve gone all sad so I feel sad too  
I think I know some things we never outgrow  
You think its wrong  
I can tell you do  
How can I explain  
When you dont want me to  
  
Kid my only kid  
You look so small youve gone so quiet  
I know you know what Im about  
I wont deny it  
But you forgive though you dont understand  
Youve turned your head  
Youve dropped by hand  
  
All my sorrow all my blues  
All my sorrow  
  
Shut the light go away  
Full of grace you cover your face  
  
Kid gracious kid  
Your eyes are blue but you wont cry  
I know angry tears are too dear  
You wont let them go
