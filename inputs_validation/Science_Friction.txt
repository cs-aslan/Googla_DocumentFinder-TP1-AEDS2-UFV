I look out of my window at night  
I see the stars and Im filled with fright  
I got a feeling someones looking  
It aint the aliens at the foot of my bed  
Its more the ale inside my head  
I got a feeling somethings cooking  
Science friction burns my fingers  
Electricity still lingers  
Hey put away that ray how do you martians say  
I love you  
I read my comics from front to back  
Ill be ready for any attack  
I got a feeling someones looking
