Let down but Im ready for another round  
Bear all the times that I miss and hit the ground  
Time is the key and its holding  
I wont get burned cause regret is scolding  
So I find that this is just a waste of my mind  
To think of the days gone by and all the things I want to try  
And everyone says get your head out of the clouds  
And all I want to do is play loud  
Break it break it down  
Theres funk in the sound  
  
Im gonna live my life fly and keep my feet off the ground  
And Im not the only one when I see  
You got your feet bound to the ground when you should be living free  
So you get the feeling that I waste another day  
Now I got the feeling that Im not the only one  
If you think about it its a waste of mind cause  
Try to live without and it and youll stop  
  
I think about the time when everyone will hear me  
Hear my rhymes loud and understand clearly  
That I can spend each and every day  
Doing things my way and Ill be okay  
But I find that this is just a waste of my mind  
To think of the days gone by and all the things I want to try  
And everyone says get your head of the clouds  
All I want to do is play loud
