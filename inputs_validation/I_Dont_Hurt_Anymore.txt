It dont hurt anymore  
All my teardrops are dried  
No more walkin the floor  
With that burnin inside  
Just to think it could be  
Time has opened the door  
And at last I am free  
I dont hurt anymore  
  
Chorus  
No use to deny I wanted to die  
The day you said we were through  
But now that I find youre out of my mind  
I cant believe that its true  
Ive forgotten somehow  
That I cared so before  
And its wonderful now  
I dont hurt anymore  
  
Chorus
