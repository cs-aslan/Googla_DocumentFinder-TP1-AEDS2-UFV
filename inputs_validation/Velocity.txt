Tell me something that I dont already know  
Tell me how you plan to change the world  
Im tired of people trying to tell me what is right  
Im tired of people trying to pull me down  
  
I know that you might never understand the way I feel  
I made a promise to myself that I would never let it show  
  
Never look down  
Never look down  
Just keep my focus straight ahead  
And try to walk this line  
  
Tell me all about your favorite human being  
Tell me everything about yourself  
God the story is so terribly interesting  
I wonder whats so good about myself  
  
I know that you might never understand the way I feel  
I made a promise to myself that I would never let it show  
  
Never look down  
Never look down  
Just keep my focus straight ahead  
And try to walk this line  
  
So let me take a good look at your perfect life  
So I know just exactly how I dont want mine  
  
Everyday I see these  
Same four walls that keep me here  
And I want to change the things that hurt  
I want to end this constant fear
