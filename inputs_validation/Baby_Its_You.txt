Its not the way you smile  
That touches my heart  
Its not the way you kiss  
That tears me apart  
Many many nights go by  
I sit alone  
At home I cry  
Over you  
What can I do  
Cant help myself  
Cause baby its you  
  
You should hear what they say about you  
They say youve never  
Never never been true  
Oh Oh Oh  
Doesnt matter what they say  
Im gonna love you any old way  
What can I do  
When its true  
Dont want nobody  
Cause baby its you  
  
Many many many nights go by  
I sit alone  
At home I cry  
Over you  
What can I do  
Cant help myself  
Cause baby its you
