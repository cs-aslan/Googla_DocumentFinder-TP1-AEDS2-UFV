Fast approaching monsters marching in a row  
Grab what slips your mind and what your memory wont hold  
Run darling run  
Ill stall them if I can  
Youll escape and Ill be left rotting on the vine  
  
Run darling run  
Ill stall if I can  
Youll escape and Ill be left rotting on the vine  
Avert the childrens eyes  
Forgets left untold  
Dont look back to see  
The blood river in the road  
  
Get sweet revenge with my blood river in the road
