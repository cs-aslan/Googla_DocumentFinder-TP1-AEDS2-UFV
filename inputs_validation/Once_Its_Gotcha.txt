One taste  
That aint so much  
You think youll be safe from her touch  
  
She calls  
You cant hide  
Your backs to the wall the walls on fire  
  
Oh when her music starts to play  
Oh you could dance your life away  
  
Once its gotcha never set you back down  
Once its gotcha youll lose your head in the clouds  
  
Sweet dreams  
Of her kiss  
No heaven could be quite like this  
  
Your love  
Runs so strong  
You cant get enough right or wrong  
  
Oh when her music starts to play  
Oh you could dance your life away
