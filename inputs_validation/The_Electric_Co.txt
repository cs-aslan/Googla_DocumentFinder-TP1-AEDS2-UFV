Boy stupid boy  
Dont sit at the table  
Until youre able to  
  
Toy broken toy  
Shout shout  
Youre inside out  
  
If you dont knowElectric co  
If you dont knowElectric co  
  
Red running red  
Play for real  
The toy could feel  
A hole in your head  
You go in shock  
Youre spoonfed  
  
If you dont knowElectric co  
If you dont knowElectric co  
  
One two three four  
vague words  
  
If you dont knowElectric co  
Repeat 6 times  
  
more vague words  
Just to hear me  
more vague words  
Ive found me way home
