Woman thank you thank you  
God thank you woman  
  
What we have is something special  
Something quite unique  
What we have should last forever  
Heaven at my feet  
  
I would give the world to you  
Or anything you need  
There is nothing I wont do  
Just promise that youll never leave  
  
God thank you woman  
Thank you thank you  
For the joy that you give to me  
God thank you woman  
Thank you thank you  
For the joy that you give to me  
  
In this world you are my pleasure  
No one can compete  
Happiness is hard to measure  
Woman youre so sweet  
  
I would give my heart to you  
Youre the air I breathe  
There is nothing I wont do  
Just promise that youll never leave  
  
God thank you woman  
Thank you thank you  
For the joy that you give to me  
God thank you woman  
Thank you thank you  
For the joy that you give to me  
  
When Im alone at night I think of love  
Well baby thats alright but it aint enough  
  
Wont you call me if you need me  
I have loved  
  
I would give the world to you  
Or anything you need  
Oh God thank you woman  
Thank you thank you  
For the joy that you give to me
