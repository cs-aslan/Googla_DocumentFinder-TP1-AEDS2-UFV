Twenty dollars out of mommas purse bought  
us a tank of gas  
And some Redman tobacco  
when we were just teenage kids  
Me and my old buddy Leroy  
wed go driving around  
If there was trouble to be found  
then man we dang sure did  
Cutting doughnuts in the fields  
Till old man Smith would call the cops  
Hed come runnin out with a shotgun cause we were runnin down his crops  
And I reckon hes still wonderin who that was  
But that was us  
  
Now some of these old local boys moved on  
but we never changed a bit  
Never had a lick of sense least thats what  
some folks said  
Then finally we turned old enough to buy our  
own beer  
Dont remember much about that year  
just lucky we aint dead  
  
Cause somebody said they saw some boys  
With a truck looked just like mine  
Tryin to pull down that old water tank  
That sits out on the country line  
And people wonder why it leans the way it does  
That was us  
  
Seems like small towns never change  
But things get tough when times get hard  
And they said when he got sick  
Old man Smith wouldve lost the farm  
Cause he was getting way behind on all his bills  
Till somebody brought his crops in from the fields  
Yeah and folks round here still wonder who  
that was  
  
That was us
