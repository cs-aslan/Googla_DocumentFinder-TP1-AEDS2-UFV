Cold hard labor its a labor of love  
Convicted of crimes the crimes of passion  
Caught in a chain gang the chain of fools  
Solitary confinement confined by the rules  
  
Im just a Prisioner  
An inmate of love  
Oh Im a Prisioner  
Captured by love  
With no escape  
No where to go  
No place to hide  
Hey Im a Prisioner  
Im just a Prisioner  
  
Mending the wounds the wounds of lament  
The knife cut deep deep into my heart  
The romance is over my passions remain  
Still bound to love by this ball and chain  
  
Im just a Prisioner  
An inmate of love  
Oh Im a Prisioner  
Captured by love  
With no escape  
No where to go  
No place to hide  
Hey Im a Prisioner  
Im just a Prisioner  
  
Oh Im a Prisioner  
Hey Im a Prisioner  
  
Find an escape a key to the door  
I gotta get out cant take anymore  
Make a clean break to bury the past  
Ill shed these chains and be free at last  
  
Im just a Prisioner  
A Prisioner Of Love  
Im just a Prisioner  
A Prisioner Of Love  
Hey Im a Prisioner  
Im just a Prisioner
