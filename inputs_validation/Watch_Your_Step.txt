You better take it easy baby  
Before you go away  
You did me dirty  
Youll get yours one day  
  
Chorus  
You better  
Watch your step  
Talkin about you  
Watch your step  
You better  
Watch your step  
  
Keep your eyes open wide  
Cause youll be hurtin down inside  
  
You better leave me all your money  
Before you go away  
Dont think Im funny honey  
All Ive got to say  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause when you took your love  
from me  
You left me full of misery  
Im gonna be all right  
  
Chorus  
  
When you need me by your side  
Im gonna say go somewhere and hide  
Watch your step  
You better watch out baby  
everything you do  
Im gonna keep my eyes focused  
right on you  
You better walk right baby  
Theres just one thing I know  
You better watch your step  
When you need me by your side  
Im gonna say go somewhere and hide
