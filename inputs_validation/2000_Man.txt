Well my name is a number  
A piece of plastic film  
And Im growin funny flowers  
In my little window sill  
  
dont you know Im a two thousand man  
And my kids they just dont understand me at all  
  
Well my wife still respects me  
I really misused her  
I am having an affair  
With the random computer  
  
Dont you know Im a two thousand man  
And my kids they just dont understand me at all  
  
Oh daddy proud of your planet  
Oh mummy proud of your sun  
Oh daddy proud of your planet  
Oh mummy proud of your sun  
Oh daddy your brains still flashin  
Like it did when you were young  
Or do you come down crashin  
Seeing all the things youd done  
All was a big put on  
  
Oh daddy proud of your planet  
Oh mummy proud of your son  
Oh daddy proud of your planet  
Oh mummy proud of your sun  
  
Oh daddy proud of your planet  
Oh mummy proud of your sun  
Oh daddy proud of your planet  
Oh mummy proud of your sun  
  
And you know whos the two thousand man  
And your kids they just wont understand you at all
