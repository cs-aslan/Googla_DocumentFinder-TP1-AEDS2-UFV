Bells ring in in my ear  
Voices I hear  
Whispering daily to me  
Love in your fire  
High on a wire  
When I know youre near me  
God Im glad to see you  
I thought youd left me far away  
I wouldnt give much to be you  
But I want you to know I feel this way  
All over the world  
Flags are being unfurled  
Waving before the dawning  
Im watching the show  
The last one to know  
Which way that things are going  
God Im glad to know you  
I thought youd left me far away  
I wouldnt give much to be you  
But I want you to know I feel this way  
Cars fighting their way  
Out of LA  
On a Sunday morning  
Im watching the show  
The last one to know  
Which way that things are going  
God Im glad to see you  
I thought youd left me far away  
I wouldnt give much to be you  
But I want you to know I feel this way  
God Im glad to know you
