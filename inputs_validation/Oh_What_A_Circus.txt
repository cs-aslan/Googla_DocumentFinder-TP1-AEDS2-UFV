Oh what a circus oh what a show  
Argentina has gone to town  
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron  
Weve all gone crazy  
Mourning all day and mourning all night  
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right  
  
Oh what an exit thats how to go  
When theyre ringing your curtain down  
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron  
Its quite a sunset  
And good for the country in a roundabout way  
Weve made the front page of all the worlds papers today  
  
But who is this Santa Evita  
Why all this howling hysterical sorrow  
What kind of goddess has lived among us  
How will we ever get by without her  
  
She had her moments she had some style  
The best show in town was the crowd  
Outside the Casa Rosada crying Eva Peron  
But thats all gone now  
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears  
Were all gonna see and how she did nothing for years  
  
Crowd  
Salve regina mater misericordiae  
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra  
Salve salve regina  
Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva  
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes  
O clemens o pia  
  
Che  
You let down your people Evita  
You were supposed to have been immortal  
Thats all they wanted not much to ask for  
But in the end you could not deliver  
  
Sing you fools but you got it wrong  
Enjoy your prayers because you havent got long  
Your queen is dead your king is through  
And shes not coming back to you  
  
Show business kept us all alive  
Since seventeen October 1945  
But the star has gone the glamours worn thin  
Thats a pretty bad state for a state to be in  
  
Instead of government we had a stage  
Instead of ideas a prima donnas rage  
Instead of help we were given a crowd  
She didnt say much but she said it loud  
  
Sing you fools but you got it wrong  
Enjoy your prayers because you havent got long  
Your queen is dead your king is through  
Shes not coming back to you  
  
Crowd  
Salve regina mater misericordiae  
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra  
Salve salve regina Peron  
Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva  
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes  
O clemens o pia  
  
Eva  
Dont cry for me Argentina  
For I am ordinary unimportant  
And undeserving of such attention  
Unless we all are I think we all are  
So share my glory so share my coffin  
So share my glory so share my coffin  
  
Che  
Its our funeral too
