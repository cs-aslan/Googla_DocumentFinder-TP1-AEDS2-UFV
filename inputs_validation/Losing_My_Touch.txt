Aint it funny how things happen  
Just as we think weve got it all straight  
Everything seems to be moving forward  
But instead we just sit around and wait  
  
Seems things are in a lock down  
Nervous looks all around  
Everyone is speaking in whispers  
No one wants to make a sound  
  
Im losing my touch yeah  
Losing my touch  
Losing my touch baby way too much  
Baby get me out of here  
It should be clear  
  
Keep an eye on on your front door baby  
Ill be slipping in round the back  
I just need a little a little cab fare  
And then Ill let you hit the sack  
  
Cause Im losing my touch  
Losing my touch  
Yes Im losing my touch way too much  
Baby get me out of here  
It should be clear yes  
  
I aint going to keep it long baby  
But just long long enough  
Ive got to pick up my passports  
And Ive got to get my stuff  
  
Cause Im losing my touch  
Just losing my touch baby baby baby  
Im losing my touch way way too much  
Baby get me out of here  
Well it must be clear  
  
Losing my touch  
Yes Im losing my touch  
Yes Im losing my touch way too much  
Baby get me out of here
