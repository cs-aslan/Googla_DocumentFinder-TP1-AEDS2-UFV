Daydreamer  
Sitting on the sea  
Soaking up the sun  
He is a real lover  
And making up the past  
Feeling up his girl  
Like hes never felt a figure before  
  
A jaw dropper  
Looks good when he walks  
Is the subject of their talk  
He would be hard to chase  
But good to catch  
And he could change the world  
With his hands behind his back oh  
  
You can find him sittin on your doorstep  
Waiting for a surprise  
And he will feel like hes been there for hours  
And you can tell that hell be there for life  
  
Daydreamer  
With eyes that make you melt  
He lends his coat for shelter  
Plus hes there for you  
When he shouldnt be  
But he stays all the same  
Waits for you  
Then sees you through  
  
Theres no way I  
Could describe him  
What Ill say is  
Just what Im hoping for  
  
But I will find him sittin on my doorstep  
Waiting for a surprise  
And he will feel like hes been there for hours  
And I can tell that hell be there for life  
And I can tell that hell be there for life
