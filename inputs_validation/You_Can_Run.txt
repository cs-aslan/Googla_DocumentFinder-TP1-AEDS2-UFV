Featuring Deep E  
Written by Alan Parsons and David Pack  
  
I know youre out there  
cause I can feel ya  
Yeah I can feel ya trying to pull me down  
I know your kind  
You kinda like it  
When people tell ya not to come around  
Heres looking at ya  
Been nice to know ya  
I see the lines written on your face  
I wish you well  
But I gotta tell ya  
Aint nothing human bout the human race  
  
You can run  
But you cant look behind you  
You can hide  
But the truths gonna find you  
  
Some people fight it like some disease  
They carry secrets to an early grave  
They try to fake it  
While on their knees  
Never knowing what they really crave  
They got no values  
They got no soul  
No sense of purpose  
Nothing to believe  
Call me your friend  
Then steal me blind  
To me youre nothing but a common thief  
  
You can run  
But you cant look behind  
You you can hide  
But the truths gonna find you  
Holding us within this maze
