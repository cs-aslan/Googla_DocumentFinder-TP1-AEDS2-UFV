When its cold outside and you want to sleep in  
go for a pallet thats so nice and thin  
Zip it on around while its on the ground  
spread it out and lay it on down  
Slip inside my sleeping bag

Youre afraid of the dark baby no need to be shy  
Well talk about some lovin while we look at the sky  
Dont be hesitating itll be alright  
well tuck it in until its clean out of sight  
Slip inside my sleeping bag  
slip inside my sleeping bag  
  
Lets go out to Egypt cause its in the plan  
sleep beside the pharoahs in the shifting sand  
Well look at some pyramids and check out some heads  
Oh well whip out our mattress cause there aint no beds  
Slip inside my sleeping bag
