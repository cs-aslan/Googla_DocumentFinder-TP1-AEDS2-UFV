Though I should say goodbye to you I cant control my heart  
It wont obey my heart must stay with you  
You brought me a tear with each kiss you brought to me  
You taught me how painful love can be  
  
It makes no difference what you do I cant control my heart  
And though you stray my heart must stay with you  
For you alone its beating I love you its repeating  
With all my soul I cant control my heart  
  
You brought me a tear with each kiss you brought to me  
You taught me how painful love can be  
It makes no difference what you do I cant control my heart  
And though you stray my heart must stay with you  
  
For you alone its beating I love you its repeating  
With all my soul I cant control my heart
