Weve live a long long time and all the radios are playing our song tonight  
We walk a crooked line cause there is a counter life in your jailed eyes  
Youre never a victim of your generation and you shine on me like a holy light  
All of the miracles and conversations rain on me tonight  
  
Weve got a one track mind true as a railroad always on time  
I see it in your eyes you dont have to talk to me I know what youre
thinking  
I need my solitude as much as you do darling to live this life we came here
for  
Never for one single solitary moment did I need you more  
  
We live a lucky life  
I see it all tonight  
We sit and close our eyes  
Travelling to paradise or to anywhere we like  
We live a lucky life  
  
My home is on the road the pavement caters to to my gypsy soul  
We walk the tightest rope we live in a circus circus of hope  
All of the melodies and inspirations shine on me like a holy light  
Right in the middle of our conversations you wink at me saying its alright  
  
We live a lucky life  
I see it in your eyes  
We sit and close our eyes  
Travelling to paradise or to anywhere we like  
We live a lucky life
