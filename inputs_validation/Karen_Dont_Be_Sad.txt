Verse 1  
Oh Karen  
You take it all too hard  
You been talking to those fools again  
And theyll tear your world apart  
Oh Karen  
You gotta try to understand  
Gotta hold on to your soul  
Cause theyll crush it if they can  
  
Chorus  
So Karen dont be sad  
Theyre just a bunch of fools  
And you can make them powerless  
Dont let them make the rules  
So Karen dont be sad  
You know the truth is true  
The world can still be beautiful  
That parts up to you  
So Karen dont be sad  
  
Verse 2  
Oh Karen  
You know youre only letting em win  
By letting all their lies and hate  
Destroy you from withinin  
Oh Karen  
Theyve taken away your smile  
But you can give it back to us  
Just fake it for a while  
  
Chorus  
So Karen dont be sad  
Theyre just a bunch of fools  
And you can make them powerless  
Dont let them make the rules  
So Karen dont be sad  
You know the truth is true  
The world can still be beautiful  
That parts up to you  
So Karen dont be sad  
  
Outro  
So Karen dont be sad  
Dont let em win  
Oh dont let em win  
Dont let them win  
Dont let them win  
Oh dont let them win  
Oh dont let them win  
Dont let them win
