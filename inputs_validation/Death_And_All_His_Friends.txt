All winter we got carried away  
Over on the rooftops lets get married  
All summer we just hurried  
So come over just be patient and dont worry  
So come over just be patient and dont worry  
  
So come over just be patient and dont worry  
And dont worry  
  
Try  
Try  
Try  
Try  
  
No I dont want to battle from beginning to end  
I dont want a cycle of recycled revenge  
I dont want to follow Death and all of his friends  
  
No I dont want to battle from beginning to end  
I dont want a cycle of recycled revenge  
I dont want to follow Death and all of his friends  
  
And in the end we lie awake and we dream of making our escape  
And in the end we lie awake and we dream of making our escape
