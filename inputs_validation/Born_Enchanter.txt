Well Im a born enchanter  
Thats what the ladies see  
Yes Im a born enchanter  
Down in the city of dreams  
Lord do right by me and let me go  
Down in my city of dreams where I need to go  
Well Im a born enchanter well  
Well Im a born enchanter  
Followin the sabbath cross

Looking for the faith I lost  
Lord do right by me and let me go  
Down in my city of dreams where I need to go
