I can bring you back anytime I want to  
I remember an angel in your veil of white so fine  
You were always very near well I think that youre still here  
Its so reads in the diary of my mind  
  
On the first page there we are down by the river  
With the flowers bloomin in the warm sunshine  
Speaking love words soft and sweet and as our lips slowly meet  
Were together in the diary of my mind  
  
Yes I can bring you back anytime I want to  
Even though youve been gone a long long time  
Oh I just close my eyes and then I realize  
Youre right there in the diary of my mind  
  
On the next page I can smell the yellow roses  
You brought to this world our baby girl so fine  
A princess for the queen I was such a happy king  
Youre both still here in the diary of my mind  
  
Yes seasons come and mistakes I dont like to remember  
But history shows that kindoms fall with time  
Mistrust and deceit and the bottle it brought defeat  
Thats the last thing thats in the diary of my mind  
  
But I can bring you back anytime I want to  
Even though youve been gone a long long time  
I just close my eyes and then I realize  
Youre right there in the diary of my mind  
  
Youre still here in the diary of my mind
