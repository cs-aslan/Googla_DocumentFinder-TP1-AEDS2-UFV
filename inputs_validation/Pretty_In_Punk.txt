Walking off that stage tonight  
I know what youre thinking  
And he stands alone because hes high on himself  
But if you only knew  
I was terrified and would you mind if I sat next to you  
And watched you smile  
So many kids but I only see you  
And I dont think you notice me  
Well Ive seen your boyfriend and I dont think he treats you right  
But thats none of my business is it  
Im not the way you think I am  
The only girl who ever gave me the time  
Was the one who only wanted five minutes of mine  
Knocking boots in the back how degrading is that  
I decline
