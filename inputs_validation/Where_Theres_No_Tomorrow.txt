Didnt want to face a long hot summer  
Didnt want to spend another lonely night  
Didnt want to stay until I met you  
  
You could tell that we were made for each other  
Something in the air and the time was right  
Came into my life oh I cant forget you  
  
I dont want to leave tomorrow  
Yes I said it all inside of a letter  
That I put in your hand when we walked in the sand  
Dont you understand  
  
I dont want to go where theres no tomorrow  
You go your way Ill go mine  
Each one missing what they left behind  
  
I dont wanna go where theres no tomorrow  
Help me try to make a dream come true  
I dont wanna leave if I cant be with you  
  
Wouldnt ever change a thing for a minute  
Seems the waters always deeper when youre in it  
Thats the way it goes not the way I planned it  
  
I dont want to leave without you  
I dont want to go if you wont follow  
Told you once tell you once again  
I dont want this summer to ever end  
Gonna be there when I can
