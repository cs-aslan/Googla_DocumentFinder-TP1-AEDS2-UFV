Now I know none of this was planned it all just kinda happened  
I got more than I wanted but how is still a mystery  
Obsessed with this feeling I trusted it so I followed it  
Im tripping and stumbling across the land full of miracles  
Into a world so far from home miles and miles from nowhere  
Rooms without doors open for me oh no  
Taking me miles and miles from nowhere  
Oh miles and miles oh yeah  
Lost in this pleasure dome lost in my own pleasure dome  
Oh man I aint got a clue how you get out or how to find this place  
I want my control back but Im afraid Ill lose that feeling  
Lost in a world so far from home Im miles and miles from nowhere  
Falling inside my own pleasure dome Im miles and miles from nowhere  
Oh miles and miles oh yeah  
Lost in this pleasure dome lost inside my pleasure dome  
  
Lost in a world cant find my way home miles and miles from nowhere  
Falling inside my own pleasure dome miles and miles from nowhere  
Millions of miles oh no miles and miles and miles from nowhere  
Miles and miles and miles and miles oh  
Lost in this pleasure dome lost inside my pleasure dome yeah  
Lost lost
