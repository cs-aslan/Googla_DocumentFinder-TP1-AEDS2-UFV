If youre looking for someone that you can keep  
then baby pass me by  
And if you wanted something thats twenty years deep  
Baby dont even try  
And if you wanted someone to take your soul  
Ill lift you up little bit higher  
  
Ive got the fire  
Ive got the fire  
  
So you think Im skinny dont you sell me cheap  
Im as wide as a countrymile  
Some like it wide I like it deep  
Guess which one is my style  
So you think you can beat me by my own game  
Maybe I call you a liar  
  
Ive got the fire  
Ive got the fire
