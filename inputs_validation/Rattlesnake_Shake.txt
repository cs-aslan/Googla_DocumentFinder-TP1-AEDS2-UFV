Baby if you got to rock  
I got to be your rockin horse  
Baby think youd like to roll  
Maybe your diggin it more  
Theyre shakin the world  
When its time to crash  
But when I get home tonight  
I guess I got to shake myself  
  
You need some love  
You must have the blues  
Aint but the one thing  
A good man can do  
He do the shake  
The rattlesnake shake  
Man do the shake  
Yes and jerk away the blues  
Now jerk it  
  
Now I know this guy  
His name is mick  
Now he dont care when he aint got no chick  
He do the shake  
The rattlesnake shake  
Yes he do the shake  
And jerks away the blues  
Now jerk it
