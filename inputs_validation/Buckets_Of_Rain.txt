Buckets of rain  
Buckets of tears  
Got all them buckets comin out of my ears  
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand  
I got all the love honey baby  
You can stand  
  
I been meek  
And hard like an oak  
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke  
Friends will arrive friends will disappear  
If you want me honey baby  
Ill be here  
  
Like your smile  
And your fingertips  
Like the way that you move your lips  
I like the cool way you look at me  
Everything about you is bringing me  
Misery  
  
Little red wagon  
Little red bike  
I aint no monkey but I know what I like  
I like the way you love me strong and slow  
Im takin you with me honey baby  
When I go  
  
Life is sad  
Life is a bust  
All ya can do is do what you must  
You do what you must do and ya do it well  
Ill do it for you honey baby  
Cant you tell
