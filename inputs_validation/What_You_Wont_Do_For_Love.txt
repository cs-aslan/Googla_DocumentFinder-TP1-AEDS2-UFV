I guess you wonder where Ive been  
I searched to find the love within  
I came back to ley you know  
Got a thing for you  
And I cant let go  
  
My friends wonder what is wrong with me  
Well Im in a daze from your love you see  
I came back to let you know  
Got a thing for you  
And I cant let go  
  
Some people go around the world for love  
And they may never find what they dream of  
What you wont do do for love  
You tried everthing  
But you dont give up  
In my world only you  
Make me do for love  
What I would not do  
  
My friends wonder what is wrong with me  
Well Im in a daze from your love you see  
I came back to let you know  
Got a thing for you  
And I cant let go  
  
And though I only want the best its true  
I cant believe the things I do for you  
  
What you wont do do for love  
Youve tried everything  
But you wont give up  
In my world only you  
Make me do for love  
What I would not do
