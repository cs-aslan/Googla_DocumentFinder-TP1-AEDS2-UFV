The breath of the morning  
I keep forgetting  
The smell of the warm summer air  
  
I live in a town  
Where you cant smell a thing  
You watch your feet  
For cracks in the pavement  
  
Up above  
Aliens hover  
Making home movies  
For the folks back home  
  
Of all these weird creatures  
Who lock up their spirits  
Drill holes in themselves  
And live for their secrets  
  
Theyre all uptight uptight  
Uptight uptight  
Uptight uptight  
  
I wish that theyd swoop down in a country lane  
Late at night when Im driving  
Take me on board their beautiful ship  
Show me the world as Id love to see it  
  
Id tell all my friends but theyd never believe me  
Theyd think that Id finally lost it completely  
Id show them the stars and the meaning of life  
Theyd shut me away  
But Id be alright alright  
Im be alright  
Im alright  
  
Im just uptight uptight  
Uptight uptight  
Uptight uptight  
Uptight uptight  
Uptight
