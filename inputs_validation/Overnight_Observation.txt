Looks like Im the only one here  
Even the nurse is gone  
But I guess I should wait cause when she left she said  
The doctor wont be long  
So make yourself at home  
His office is down the hall  
Why do I feel uneasy  
I know he must be good  
Got credentials all over the wall  
I hear a voice behind me say  
What seems to be the trouble my dear  
Wont you be kind enough to step over here  
It might be fever it might be flu  
To isolate it Ill have to hold you  
Overnight  
Observation  
Overnight  
Observation  
In my opinion  
All we can do to isolate it  
Ill hold you overnight

Please dont think me ungrateful  
But holding me overnight  
Seems a little extreme  
Do you always serve martinis  
And turn the lights down low  
Doctor do your colleagues know  
Although you say its good for me  
I really dont feel like dancing now  
Somebodys waiting and Im doubleparked anyhow  
It might be fever it might be flu  
To isolate it Ill have to hold you  
Overnight

Now I may look stupid  
But Ill tell you what  
Ive been around a long time  
And I thought I had heard everything  
I tell you they keep coming up with them  
I just couldnt believe my ears when he said  
Kick off your shoes relax my dear  
Slip into something comfortable  
Two seconds flat Im out the door and down the hall  
It might be fever it might be flu  
To isolate it Ill have to hold you  
Overnight
