Lets go away for a while  
You and I  
To a strange and distant land  
Where they speak no word of truth  
But we dont understand anyway  
  
Chorus  
Holiday  
Far away to stay  
On a Holiday far away  
Lets go today  
In a heartbeat  
Heartbeat heartbeat  
  
Dont bother to pack your bags  
Or your map  
We wont need them where were goin  
Were goin where the wind is blowin  
Not knowin where were gonna stay  
  
Chorus  
  
We will write a postcard  
To our friends and family  
In free verse  
On the road with Kerouac  
Sheltered in Bivouac  
On this road well never die  
  
Lets go away for a while  
You and I  
To a strange and distant land  
Where they speak no word of truth  
But we dont understand anyway  
  
Chorus
