It is this that brings us together  
Its all right darling  
We can do this together  
Its all right darling  
I can think of nothing better  
I dont know you  
And you dont know me  
It is this that brings us together  
It is this that brings us together  
I dont know what you are  
Looking for in me  
I dont know what I want  
But my heart is needing  
Am I yours Are you mine  
Well find all were meant to find  
In your life in my life  
There are secrets too dark  
To let out to let go of  
To get over  
But thats all right baby  
Thats all right by me  
Its all right now  
Just let me say  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please be kind  
Be kind to my mistakes  
Be kind  
Be kind  
To me
