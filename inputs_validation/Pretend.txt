I can feel the rhythm of her body change  
She listens to the seventies and likes to disco dance whoa  
Watch and see the way she pops a ritalin  
I take a minute as I wait for it to settle in uh oh  
  
Chorus  
But this is the end  
Of all we have  
Of all well take  
The visions of you will start to fade  
And all well have will be these memories  
When all thats left is self control  
Your lies get lost it starts to show  
Pretend she doesnt care  
Pretend she doesnt care  
When all you have are dirty rules  
Your mind jumps back to self abuse  
Pretend she doesnt care  
Pretend she doesnt care  
  
Wait for me to start a fire  
Youre fucking right Ill start this fire more than Lancelot  
Watch and see the the way I move my hairy legs  
You know I like to make them stare and make them sweat a bit  
  
Chorus  
  
Taste the metal irony  
Of this slowly fading symphony  
Appreciate my honesty  
When I need you to believe that  
I can try to forget you  
  
When all thats left is self control  
Your lies get lost it starts to show  
Pretend she doesnt care  
Pretend she doesnt care  
When all thats left is self control  
Pretend she doesnt care  
Pretend she doesnt care  
Care care  
When all thats left is self control  
Your lies get lost it starts to show  
Pretend she doesnt care  
Pretend she doesnt care  
  
When all thats left is rock and roll  
And music could not save my soul  
Pretend that I dont care  
Pretend that I dont care  
  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa  
Whoa whoa  
Yeah Yeah Yeah
