The day we meet again  
Ill be waiting there Ill be waiting there for you  
cause the years have been so lonely like a dog without a home  
Its dangerous when you find out  
Youve been drinking on your own  
The day we meet again  
We will walk in peace through the garden down the road  
Where the mist of time is lifting  
See it rise in the air like the shadow I was chasing  
When I looked it wasnt there oh no  
Just in case youre wondering  
What was really on my mind  
It wasnt what you took my love  
Its what you left behind  
Just in case youre wondering  
Will it really be the same  
Will it really be the same  
You know were only living for the day we meet again  
So hold on and dont let go  
Time it heals you know I know  
The day we meet again  
Ill be waiting there Ill be waiting there for you  
cause the years have been so lonely like a dog without a home  
Its dangerous when you find out  
Youve been drinking on your own  
The day we meet again  
We will walk in peace through the garden down the road  
Where the mist of time is lifting  
See it rise in the air like the shadow I was chasing  
When I looked oh no it wasnt there oh no  
Oh no  
It wasnt there it wasnt there it wasnt there  
Oh no oh no oh no
