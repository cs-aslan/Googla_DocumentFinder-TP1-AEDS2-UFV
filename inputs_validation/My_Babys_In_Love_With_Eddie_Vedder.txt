Oh my baby my baby she dont want me no more  
Ever since she saw his poster in that record store  
She says the way he grinds his molars is really sexy  
She thinks hes so darn dysfunctional and Generation Xwhy  
She likes his brooding angst and his wildeyed stare  
Yeah hes her very favorite slacker multimillionaire  
  
Well my babys in love with Eddie Vedder  
Shes all crazy bout that Eddie Vedder  
Once she was mine but now I better just forget her  
Cause my babys in love with Eddie Vedder  
  
Now every time I see him well he looks so grim  
I guess it really must suck to be a rock star like him  
What a pain in the butt to have so much success  
Spending all his time moping and avoiding the press  
But my girl cant get enough of his sullen demeanor  
Like hes some bit tortured genius  
And Im some kinda wiener  
  
Well my babys in love with Eddie Vedder  
Shes got a thing for that Eddie Vedder  
Tell me what can he do that I cant do better  
Now my babys in love with  
I said I said I said my babys in love with Eddie Vedder  
Head over heels for that Eddie Vedder  
  
I knew we were headin for disaster  
When she caught me hangin out at the Ticketmaster  
Now shes got an unrequited adoration  
For the frustrated agitated designated alienated  
Spokesman for the disaffected grunge generation  
  
Well I dont wear Doc Martens and I dont wear flannel  
And I dont boycott the music video channel  
And I just cant compete with all that money and fame  
But I know two can paly at this kinda game  
Yeah well lets just see how jealous shell get  
When I start stalking Alanis Morissette  
  
Well my babys in love with Eddie Vedder  
Shes all crazy bout that Eddie Vedder  
Once she was mine but now I better just forget her  
Cause my babys in love with  
I said I said I said my babys in love with Eddie Vedder  
Whyd she have to fall for that Eddie Vedder  
If she wants to leave me I guess I better let her  
Cause my babys in love with Eddie Vedder
