Im going under Im suffocating  
Drowning but Im holding on  
What keeps me breathing  
Dont have an answer  
Drowning but I wont let go  
  
Away now No way out  
  
Ive been walkin a lonesome highway  
I felt as though I had no home  
My beds been taken by another  
I made the bed now lie alone  
  
Give it away now Motherfucker now keep it away  
  
Away now No way out  
  
Give it away now  
  
Away now No way out  
  
Im going under Im suffocating  
Drowning but Im holding on  
What keeps me breathing  
Dont have an answer  
Drowning but I wont let go  
  
Give it away now
