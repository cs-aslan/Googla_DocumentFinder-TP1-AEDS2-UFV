I heard the voice and saw the face  
And I know he was there  
The robe it floated around my bed  
And I felt no pain  
  
You can talk about the help you need  
Hes a friend indeed  
Just open your heart and live again  
And hell set you free  
  
Well he took them away  
All the troubles and the pain  
Whoa you can call me a fool  
But I know he was there  
Yes I know he was there  
  
The night I had has long since gone  
But the memories stay  
And now Mr Trouble when you come my way  
Im not too proud to pray  
  
Yes he took them away  
All the troubles and the pain  
Whoa you can call me a fool  
But I know he was there  
Yes I know he was there  
  
Well he took them away  
All the troubles and the pain  
Whoa you can call me a fool  
But I know he was there  
Yes I know he was there  
  
The night I had has long since gone  
But the memories stay  
And now Mr Trouble when you come my way  
Im not too proud to pray
