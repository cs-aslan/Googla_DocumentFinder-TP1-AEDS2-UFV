Its dance time in Texas and were striking up the band  
Lets go honky tonkin honey take my hand  
  
Its dance time in Texas where the wine and music flows  
Well do that Texas two step and that old cotton eyed Joe  
Ill take you honky tonkin in my old pick up truck  
Its dance time in Texas and the music lifts you up  
Its dance time in Texas and were striking up the band  
Well go honky tonkin honey take my hand  
  
Its dance time in Texas where the wine and music flows  
Well do that Texas two step and that old cotton eyed Joe  
Now its time for a slow dance and were waltzing oh so close  
Its dance time in Texas and your the one I love the most  
Its dance time in Texas and were striking up the band  
Well go honky tonkin honey take my hand  
Its dance time in Texas where the wine and music flows
