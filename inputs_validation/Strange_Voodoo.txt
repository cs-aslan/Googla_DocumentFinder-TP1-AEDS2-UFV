How can I help you boy  
When I dont even help myself  
Im useless now as I have always been  
Just like some worthless love song dying on the radio  
We talk in circles til we dont know what we mean  
Aint No happy ever after  
No big dark man  
Aint no perfect situation  
Cant you understand  
  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
  
How can I love you boy  
When you dont even love yourself  
Im useless now as I have always been  
Your lying eyes  
Your thieving hands  
Youre such a rogue at times  
But you will always be a part of me  
No happy ever after  
No big dark man  
Aint no perfect situation  
Aint no master plan  
  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Aint no happy ever after  
No big dark man  
Aint no perfect situation  
Cant you understand  
  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Loving you I keep loving you yes I do
