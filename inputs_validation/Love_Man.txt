The birds and the honey bees

Feel for my heartbeat baby

Let me whisper in your ear  
How the good Lord in His wisdom  
Made you so and put you here  
  
He played a little game  
Called The Apple and the Snake  
When the lady took her first sweet bite  
The Snake made no mistake  
  
He was a love man yeah yeah yeah  
And I am a love man  
Im a hootchie cootchie man  
And Im doing all I can  
Cause a love man needs his loving everyday  
Yeah yeah yeah I am a love man
