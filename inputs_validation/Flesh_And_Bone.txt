Ive gone through life whiteknuckled  
In the moments that left me behind  
Refusing to heed the yield  
I penetrate the force fields in the blind  
They say Ill adjust  
God knows I must  
But Im not sure how  
This natural selection picked me out to be  
A dark horse running in a fantasy  
  
Flesh and bone  
And Im running out of time  
Flesh and bone  
  
Somewhere outside that finish line  
I square up and break through the chains  
And I hit like a raging bull  
Anointed by the blood I take the reins  
Cut from the cloth of a flag that  
Bears the name of Battle Born  
Theyll call me the contender  
Theyll listen for the bell  
With my face flashing crimson from the fires of hell  
  
What are you afraid of  
And what are you made of  
Flesh and bone  
And Im running out of time  
Flesh and bone  
And what are you made of  
Flesh and bone  
Man Im turning on a dime  
Flesh and bone  
  
This could decay  
This could decay  
Like the valley below  
Defenses are down  
The stakes are high scouting the crowd for a face of compassion  
The fairytale end to face off the journey that fathers no more  
The staggering blow youll find the truth in the roots of desire  
You lead with your chinthinkin with your corners just a compass and the
sun  
This could be realthinkin with your corners just a  
Simple  
  
And what are you made of  
Flesh and bone  
And Im running out of time  
Flesh and bone  
What are you made of  
  
He faces forward  
Trading in his blindness for the world of love  
And time is raging may it rage in vain  
And you always had it but you never knew  
So boots and saddles get on your feet  
Theres no surrender cause theres no retreat  
The bells are sounding bring this match to an end  
We are the descendants of giant men
