Its hidden far away  
But someday I may tell  
The tale of metal tangle  
When into your world I fell  
Without you now I wander soaking  
Secretly afraid  
Cause in your grasp the fears dont last  
And some of them have stayed  
  
I wheeled around because I  
Didnt hear what you had said  
And saw you dancing with Elihu  
Up on Leemors bed  
And I was foggy rather groggy you helped me to my car  
The binding belt enclosing me a Sample in a Jar  
  
And on the market stands unfolding  
With all their willies and their wares  
I shuffle by alert but numb  
To all the glances and the glares  
And I think of you unheeding  
All the times I raise my cup  
Its now I know that you knew that  
Id soon end up end up  
  
I wheeled around because I  
Didnt hear what you had said  
And saw you dancing with Elihu  
Up on Leemors bed  
And I was foggy rather groggy you helped me to my car  
The binding belt enclosing me a Sample in a Jar  
  
You tricked me like the others  
And now I dont belong  
The simple smiles and good times seem all wrong
