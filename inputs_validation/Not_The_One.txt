Im not the one who made the world what it is today  
Im not the one who caused the problems started long ago  
But now I deal with all the consequence that troubles our times  
I carry on and never once have even questioned why  
  
Im innocent  
But the weight of the world is on my shoulders  
Im innocent  
But the battles started are far from over  
  
We re not the ones who leave the homeless in the streets at night  
Were not the ones whove kept minorities and women down  
Still we grow and then the problems they become our own  
We carry on without even realizing why  
  
Were innocent  
But the weight of the world is on our shoulders  
Were innocent  
But the battles left us are far from over  
  
Were not the ones whose pollution blackened our skies  
And ruined our streams  
Were not the ones who made the nuclear bombs  
That threaten our lives  
  
Were not the ones who let the children starve in faraway lands  
Were not the ones who made the streets unsafe to walk at night  
And even if we try and not become so overwhelmed  
And if we make some contribution to the plight we see  
  
Still our descendants will inherit our mistakes of today  
Theyll suffer just the same as we and never wonder why
