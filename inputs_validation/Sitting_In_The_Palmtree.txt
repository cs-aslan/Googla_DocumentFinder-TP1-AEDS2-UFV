See me sitting in the palm tree  
Looking down at people passing by  
Sitting here noone can harm me  
They just stare at me and wonder why  
No need to bother Im gonna stay up here  
Whatever happens I wont let noone near  
Until you tell me Jeanie Jeanie on my mind wont you please  
You really love me Jeanie Jeanie youre so fine yes you are now  
And in the evening when the sun goes down  
Ill be the bluest of men in this town  
Cause I love you Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Waiting for those little words from you  
People laugh and point their fingers  
Like I was a monkey at the zoo  
But I will stay here among my coconuts  
So you will know dear youre everything Ive got  
Now wont you tell me Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
Winds blow stars glow I see a light in a window  
Dark trees soft breeze carry my message to her please  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Feeling angry at the silly crowd  
Noone else but you can calm me  
You should know by now Im far too proud  
I need to show you Ive got my feelings too  
You shouldnt treat me like you always do  
So wont you tell me Jeanie Jeanie on my mind wont you please  
You really love me Jeanie Jeanie youre so fine yes you are now  
And in the evening when the sun goes down  
Ill be the bluest of men in this town  
Cause I love you Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
Jeanie Jeanie youre so fine  
Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
Jeanie Jeanie youre so fine  
Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
Jeanie Jeanie youre so fine
