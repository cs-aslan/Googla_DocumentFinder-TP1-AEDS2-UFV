Try to remember the echoes and embers  
Are heavy on my mind  
The pictures are broken the front door is open  
The scars are left behind  
Tables turn you once they burning  
Leaving me undone  
A vision shaking till I break I  
Swear to God more words could you just hear me  
Just really hear me  
  
Ive been drowning in the sea  
Of tryna please you  
Its all Ill ever be its all I ever knew  
I try to be me but Im turning into you  
  
Music is hurting the drugs arent working  
Walls come crushing down  
Another rejection my insurrection  
Its crawling back somehow  
Tables turn these words they burn I  
Never should have come  
A vision shaking till I break I  
Swear to God more words could you just hear me  
No really hear me  
  
Ive been drowning in the sea  
Of tryna please you  
Its all Ill ever be its all I ever knew  
I try to be me but Im turning into you  
Turning into you  
  
Im not how I used to be  
Im changing cause of you  
Im screaming just to breathe  
Its all I can do  
I try to be me but Im turning into you  
Turning into you  
  
Anymore find a way hey hey  
Anymore find a way to bear  
Its all that I can see its all that I can do  
I try to be me but Im turning into you  
  
Ive been drowning in a sea  
Of tryna please you  
Its all Ill ever be its all I ever knew  
I try to be me but Im turning into you  
Turning into you  
  
Im not how I used to be  
Im changing cause of you  
Im screaming just to breathe  
Its all I can do  
I try to be me but Im turning into you  
Turning into you
