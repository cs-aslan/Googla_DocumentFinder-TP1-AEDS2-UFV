The village girl aint it just the way  
Grows her hair long and paints her face  
Nobody calls her anyway  
Its a shame  
  
Here we go  
She knows it all  
Writes it all down to tell us all  
Nobody hears her at all  
Anymore  
  
Shes been writing  
Shes been writing  
Shes been ah shes been writing  
  
At the fighting bar  
She knows the law  
Shed just get up and sock you on the jaw  
After all shes been in love before  
Nevermore  
  
Shes been writing  
Shes been writing  
Shes been ah shes been writing  
  
Between the stages and the sad refrains you know she sings  
Im just a dreamer scheming for the show  
Between the pages I can hardly stand the pain  
The changes bought to you before you had to go  
  
Sandy Girl aint it just the way  
Grows her hair long and makes mistakes  
Nobody calls her anyway  
Nevermore  
  
Shes been writing  
Shes been writing  
Shes been ah shes been writing
