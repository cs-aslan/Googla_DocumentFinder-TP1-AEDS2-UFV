Oh Oh some deep shit  
Uh uh  
  
Verse 1  
Mama please stop cryin  
I cant stand the sound  
Your pain is painful and its tearing me down  
I hear glasses breakin  
As I sit up in my bed  
I told God you didnt mean those nasty things you said  
You fight about money  
Bout me and my brother  
And this I come home to  
This is my shelter  
  
PreChorus  
It aint easy growin up in world war III  
Never knowin what love could be  
Youll see I dont want love to destroy me like it has done my family  
  
Chorus  
Can we work it out  
Can we be a family  
I promise Ill be better  
Mommy Ill do anything  
Can we work it out  
Can we be a family  
I promise Ill be better  
Daddy please dont leave  
  
Verse 2  
Daddy please stop yelling stop  
I cant stand the sound cant stand the sound  
Make mama stop cryin  
Cause I need you around yeah yeah yeah  
My mama she loves you I know it  
No matter what she says is true  
I know that she hurts you  
But remember I love you too  
I ran away today ran from the noise  
Ran away ran away  
Dont wanna go back to that place  
But dont have no choice no way  
  
PreChorus  
It aint easy growin up in world war III  
Never knowin what love could be  
Youll see I dont want love to destroy me like it has done my family
