Will you have whiskey with your water  
Or sugar with your tea  
What are these crazy questions  
That theyre asking of me  
This is the wildest party that there ever could be  
Oh dont turn on the light cause I dont want to see  
  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama said That aint no way to have fun  
  
Open up the window let some air into this room  
I think Im almost choking on the smell of stale perfume  
And that cigarette youre smoking bout to scare me half to death  
Open up the window let me catch my breath  
  
The radio is blasting someones beating on the door  
Our hostess is not lasting  shes out on the floor  
I seen so many things here I aint never seen before  
I dont know what it is  but I dont wanna see no more  
  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama said That aint no way to have fun
