There are murders that we must account for  
Bloody deeds have been done in my name  
Criminal acts we must pay for  
And our children will shoulder the blame  
  
Chorus x2  
Im a British subject not proud of it  
While I carry the burden of shame  
  
As a nation were following blindly  
Noone stops to question why  
Our moneys supporting an army  
And a boy in Soweto dies  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat x2  
Im a British subject not proud of it  
While I carry the burden of shame  
  
Must we go on ignoring forever  
The cries of an African son  
Theres a soldiers hand on the trigger  
But its we who are pointing the gun  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat x2  
Im a British subject not proud of it  
While I carry the burden of shame
