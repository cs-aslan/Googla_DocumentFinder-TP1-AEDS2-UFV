In a hot dusty bar room in town  
That old jukebox plays the honky tonk sound  
You might think that Im crying Lord I am  
But Im trying to get over whats over and through  
Ive got a picture of us on my mind  
Sweet sweet scenes of once upon a time  
I cant picture myself with anyone else  
Ive got a picture of us on my mind  
From the pockets of his ragged old jeans  
He paid the preacher after we said I do  
I think of good times weve known  
That were as good as hes gone  
This glass of red wine feels good going down  
Ive got a picture of us on my mind  
Sweet sweet scenes of once upon a time  
I cant picture myself with anyone else  
Ive got a picture of us on my mind  
Ive got a picture of us on my mind  
Sweet sweet scenes of once upon a time  
I cant picture myself with anyone else  
Ive got a picture of us on my mind
