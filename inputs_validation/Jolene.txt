Cocaine flame in my bloodstream  
Sold my coat when I hit Spokane  
Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes in the early  
Morning rain  
Lately my hands they dont feel like mine  
My eyes been stung with dust and blind  
Held you in my arms one time  
Lost you just the same  
  
Chorus  
Jolene  
I aint about to go straight  
Its too late  
I found myself face down in a ditch  
Booze in my hair  
Blood in my lips  
A picture of you holding a picture of me  
In the pocket of my blue jeans  
Still dont know what love means  
Still dont know what love means  
Jolene  
  
Been so long since I seen your face  
Or felt a part of this human race  
Ive been living out of this here suitcase for way too long  
A man needs something he can hold onto  
A nine pound hammer or a woman like you  
Either one of them things will do  
  
Chorus
