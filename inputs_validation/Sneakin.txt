Verse 1 Drake  
This is all Gods doing man you cant plan it  
But if the devils in the details then Im satanic  
Bout to take over your city and you cant stand it  
My accountant say you sinking like the Titanic  
David Blaine last summer man you had to vanish  
I get the hits like somebody pitching underhanded  
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish  
Really when she get to talking I dont understand it  
You aint own it right away you had to wait on niggas  
Man Im only 29 have some patience with us  
Plus I never met nobody from my label nigga  
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga  
Shit aint been the same like before  
I still love it but I used to love it more  
Face time with my shawty on tour  
And she texting purple hearts cause she know that we at war yeah

Verse 2 21 Savage  
Baby Im a savage I aint romantic  
When I come around these rappers niggas start to panic  
And they pockets going under like the Titanic  
Got some head last night and it was outstanding  
They was hatin on me then and they hatin now  
She was playing with me then but she waitin now  
Used to sleep inside a den I got acres now  
I was fighting niggas then but Im spraying now blasting  
I dont pay no mind to no sneak diss  
I wont spend a dime on a freak bitch  
Niggas takin cheap shots on some cheap shit  
They the type to stand in line for some free shit  
Babygirl gon suck it till her jaws locked

Verse 3 Drake  
I dont need love Im the GOAT  
I just hit the beat and float  
And Im selling out arenas but you putting on a show  
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know  
Cause if I dont share the wealth  
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow  
Moms stressed theres a lot of things we need  
Chain smoking in the house its hard to breathe  
I used to have to hit my Ts with Febreeze  
Jordan pull up in the TL now Im cheese  
Imma turn this TSX to a Benz soon  
Imma see a lot of blessings for my friends soon

And she texting purple hearts cause she know that we at war
