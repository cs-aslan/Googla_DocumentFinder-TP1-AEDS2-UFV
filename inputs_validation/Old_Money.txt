Blue hydrangea cold cash divine  
Cashmere cologne and white sunshine  
Red racing cars sunset and vine  
The kids were young and pretty  
Where have you been Where did you go  
Those summer nights seem long ago  
And so is the girl you use to call  
The queen of New York City  
  
But if you send for me you know Ill come  
And if you call for me you know Ill run  
Ill run to you Ill run to you  
Ill run run run  
Ill come to you Ill come to you  
Ill come come come  
  
The power of youth is on my mind  
Sunsets small town Im out of time  
Will you still love me when I shine  
From words but not from beauty  
My fathers love was always strong  
My mothers glamour lives on and on  
Yet still inside I felt alone  
For reasons unknown to me  
  
But if you send for me you know Ill come  
And if you call for me you know Ill run  
Ill run to you Ill run to you  
Ill run run run  
Ill come to you Ill come to you  
Ill come come come  
  
And if you call Ill run run run  
If you change your mind Ill come come come  
  
Blue hydrangea cold cash divine  
Cashmere cologne and hot sunshine  
Red racing cars sunset and vine  
And we were young and pretty
