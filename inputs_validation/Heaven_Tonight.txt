Lost in a dream in the arms of the night  
Two lonely prisoners of our own device  
Dont let me go Hold on together  
You want to know if love can be real  
I want to take everything I can steal  
Love on the line its now or never  
Why cant the night last forever  
  
This could be Paradise  
Holding you here by my side  
If we just close our eyes  
Well be in Heaven tonight  
  
Run through the night down streets of desire  
Burning my soul my hearts on fire  
Give up the fight its sweet surrender  
With trembling hands we reach for it all  
Two desperate hearts waiting to fall  
I need you now now more than ever  
  
Why cant the night last forever  
  
This could be Paradise  
Holding you here by my side  
If we just close our eyes  
Well be in Heaven tonight  
  
This feels like Paradise  
I see the world in our eyes  
If we just hold on tight  
Well be in Heaven tonight
