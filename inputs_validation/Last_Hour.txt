As stories go  
This ones been told  
Another heart broken  
Left out in the cold  
With one variation  
The difference this time  
This one is mine  
Since youve been gone  
Youve stolen my heart  
As for the rest of me  
Ive fallen apart  
In my desperation  
My only prayer  
Handle with care  
cause I dont know  
What to do  
Wasting my time  
Wandering through  
Wondering why  
Whats it all worth  
My last hour on earth  
My last hour  
So in the end  
You were the one  
Something so right  
Could never be wrong  
Without hesitation  
Ill tell you the truth  
Im still waiting for you  
cause I dont know  
What to do  
Wasting my time  
Wandering through  
Wondering why  
Whats it all worth  
My last hour on earth  
My last hour  
cause I dont know  
What to do  
Wasting my time  
Wandering through  
Wondering why  
Whats it all worth  
Its worth everything  
Yeah my everything is you  
Its worth everything  
Yeah my everything is you  
Its worth everything  
Yeah my everything
