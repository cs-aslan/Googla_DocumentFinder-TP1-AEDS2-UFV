Drink down that gin and kerosene  
And come spit on bridges with me just to keep us warm  
Then light a match to leave me be  
Light a match to leave me be  
  
I keep my jealousy close cause its all mine  
And if you say this makes you happy then Im not the only one lying  
  
Chorus  
Keep quiet  
Nothing comes as easy as you  
Can I lay in your bed all day  
Ill be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake  
The hand behind this pen relieves a failure everyday  
Keep quiet  
Nothing comes as easy as you  
Can I lay in your bed all day  
Ill be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake  
The hand behind this pen relieves a failure everyday  
  
And I keep my jealousy close cause its all mine  
And if you say this makes you happy then Im not the only one lying  
  
Drink down your gin and kerosene  
And come spit on bridges with me just to keep us warm  
Then light a match to leave me be  
Light a match to leave me  
  
Chorus  
  
So wear me like a locket around your throat  
Ill weigh you down  
Ill watch you sulk  
You look so good in blue  
  
You look so good in blue  
So wear me like a locket around your throat  
Ill weigh you down  
Ill watch you choke  
  
You look so good in blue  
You look so good in blue  
So wear me like a locket around your throat  
Ill weigh you down  
  
Ill watch you choke  
You look so good in blue  
You look so good in blue  
  
Chorus 2x
