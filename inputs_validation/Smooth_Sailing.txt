Its all in motion  
No stoppin now  
Ive got nothin to lose  
And only one way up  
  
Im burning bridges  
I destroy the mirage  
Oh visions of collisions  
Fuckin bon voyage  
  
Its all smooth sailing  
From here on out  
  
I got bruises and hickies  
Stitches and scars  
Got my own theme music  
It plays wherever I are  
  
Fear is the hand  
That pulls your strings  
A useless toy  
Pitiful plaything  
  
Im inflagranti  
In every way  
  
Its all smooth sailing  
From here on out  
Im gon do the damage  
That needs gettin done  
  
God only knows  
Where love vacations  
If reason is priceless  
Theres no reason to pay for it  
  
Its so easy to see  
And so hard to find  
Make a mountain of a mole hill  
If the mole hill is mine  
  
I hypnotize you  
And no one can find you  
I blow my load  
Over the status quo  
Here we go  
  
Im a little bit nonchalant  
But I dance  
Im risking it always  
No second chance  
  
Its gonna be smooth sailing  
From here on out  
Im gon do the damage  
Til the damage is done yeah  
  
God only knows  
So mind your behavior  
Follow prescriptions  
Of your lord and savior  
  
Every temple is gold  
Every hook is designed  
Hell is but the temple  
Of the closed mind  
Closed mind  
Closed mind  
Closed mind  
  
Its all smooth sailing  
From here on out  
  
Shut up  
  
Pow
