Sundown and sorrow have found me  
Memories are makin me blue  
Here with the shadows around me  
I cant forget lovin you  
  
Nothing but daydreams to haunt me  
Dreams that will never come true  
Its hard to know you dont want me  
I just cant help lovin you  
  
Forever so long Ive been yearnin  
Wondering what I could do  
Deep in my heart theres a burnin  
I just cant help lovin you
