Pity the fool  
Its hard but he broke a rule  
And that isnt done  
Somehow someday brother will use a gun  
Just walking the town  
Just painting it sad  
Its bringing me down  
Its driving me mad  
Woman is away from me  
  
Chorus  
We will be strong we will be strong  
I know we have the strength to carry on  
We have the strength  
I know my rights from wrong  
I know youve lost Ive won  
We will be stronger  
We will be strong  
And getting stronger every day  
Believe me when I say it  
There is no other way to convey it  
  
No other way you clown  
Your thoughtfulness has brought us down  
And that isnt right  
That we should walk alone on the streets at night  
Just checking the time  
Walking that very fine line  
The humor is black  
The plan is attack  
Now woman is away from me  
But we will be strong  
  
Chorus  
  
Down on your luck  
The shock it has struck  
The weak ones will die  
The questions are Why Why  
Does anybody hear  
Does anybody understand  
Let me make it clear  
Nows the time to take a stand  
Now woman is away from me  
But we will make it strong  
  
Chorus  
  
We will be strong  
We will  
We will be strong  
We will be  
We will be strong  
We will  
We will be strong  
We  
We will  
We  
We will be  
We  
We will  
We will be strong  
We will be strong
