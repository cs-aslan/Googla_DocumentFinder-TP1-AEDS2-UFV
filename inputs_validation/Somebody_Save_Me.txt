When I was a young boy  
They said youre only gettin older  
But how was I to know then  
That theyd be cryin on my shoulder  
  
Put your money in a big house  
Get yourself a pretty wife  
Shell collect your life insurance  
When she connects you with a knife  
  
Somebody get the doctor  
Im feelin pretty poor  
Somebody get the stretcher  
Before I hit the floor  
  
Somebody save me  
I lost my job they kicked me out of my tree  
Somebody save me  
Save me  
  
Everybodys got opinions  
But nobodys got the answers  
And that shit you ate for breakfast  
Well itll only give you cancer  
  
Were runnin in a circle  
Runnin to the morning light  
And if ya aint quite workable  
Its been one hell of a night  
  
Somebody get the doctor  
I think im gonna crash  
Never paid the bill  
Because i aint got the cash  
  
Somebody save me  
I lost my job they kicked me out of my tree  
Somebody save me  
Save me  
Look out  
  
Save me  
I lost my job they kicked me out of my tree  
Somebody save me oh  
Save me  
  
Somebody save me  
Im goin down for the last time look out  
Save me  
Saaaaaaave me  
Save me
