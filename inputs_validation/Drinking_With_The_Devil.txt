I never left like this before  
I think Im gonna explode  
Had so much I couldnt take no more  
Im heading for an overload  
Oh no here I go  
I can see the end  
Looked around and I heard the sound  
Of have one more my friend  
Drinking with the devil  
Gonna raise some hell  
Im just a rock and roll rebel  
Got my soul to sell  
  
Out all night till the sun comes up  
You know Im never gonna learn  
Raise my glass and fill my cup  
Im playing with fire  
And Im gonna get burned  
Like before he walked through the door  
A glass was in his hand  
Sat me down and poured me one more  
And I was drinking with the devil  
Gonna raise some hell  
Im just a rock and roll rebel  
Got my soul to sell  
  
Out all night till the sun comes up  
You know Im never gonna learn  
Raise my glass and fill my cup  
Im playing with fire  
And Im gonna get burned  
Like before he walked through the door  
A glass was in his hand  
Sat me down and poured me one more  
And said Im at your command yes I am  
Drinking with the devil  
Gonna raise some hell  
Im just a rock and roll rebel  
Got my soul to sell  
  
Drinking with the devil  
You know I had my fill  
Drinking with the devil  
And he sticks me with the bill
