Day in day out  
That same old voodoo follows me about  
That same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you  
And baby I think of you  
Day in and day out  
  
Day out day in  
I neednt tell you how my days begin  
When I awake I get up with a tingle  
One possibility in view  
That possibility of maybe seeing you  
  
Come rain come shine  
I meet you and to me the day is fine  
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes  
An oceans roar a thousand drums  
Cant you see its love can there be any doubt  
When there it is day in day out
