If you got a Cadillac boy and a 40 room shack boy  
A bucket full of money and a tree full of honey  
But if youre gettin no huggin  
No smoochin or a muggin  
If you aint lovin  
Then you aint livin  
  
If youre ridin on a gravy train  
Instead of walkin down lovers lane  
You cant make hey boy  
Cause youre goin the wrong way boy  
You gotta get a a little honey  
Its better than money  
If you aint lovin  
Then you aint livin  
  
If they call you a big man  
Cause you got a lot of bottled land  
If youre kin to the President  
And ya help from the Government  
But if youre gettin no attention  
Youre better off on the pension  
If you aint lovin  
Then you aint livin  
  
If you got a string of long cards  
And youre smokin them 4 bid cigars  
You aint so well to do  
Unless you get a little coochycoo  
It takes a little bit a smackin  
Or your lifes lackin  
If you aint lovin  
Then you aint livin
