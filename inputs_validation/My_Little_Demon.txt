My little demon cominon down  
My little demons turnin me around  
All of my friends keep on tellinme  
That I just aint the man I used to be  
  
I really dont like itaint nothing I can do  
I really dont like itIm leaving it to you  
My little demon making me choose  
Making me an offer I cant refuse  
  
Hard as a rockdry as a bone  
Big or littleknow that I will take you home  
I really dont like itaint nothinI can do  
I really dont like itIm leaving it to you  
  
Why try to hide it  
Fight itfight it  
I really dont like itaint nothinI can do  
I really dont like itIm leaving it to you  
  
My little demon is coming after me  
My little demon  
Its all that I can do to keep that little demon  
To keep that little demon  
  
Just to keep that little demon away from you
