Hey its me  
I just got off the train  
A frightening place  
Their faces are concrete grey  
And Im wondering should I turn around  
Buy another ticket  
Panic is coming on strong  
So cold from the inside out  
No great job no message coming in  
And youre so small  
Glassy eyed light of day  
Glassy eyed light of day  
  
The path trails off  
And heads down a mountain  
Through the dry bush I dont know where it leads  
I dont really care  
And the path trails off  
And heads down a mountain  
Through the dry bush I dont know where it leads  
I dont really care  
  
I feel this love turn cold  
I feel this love turn cold
