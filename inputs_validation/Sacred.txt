Sacred  
Holy  
To put it in words  
To write it down  
That is walking on hallowed ground  
But its my duty  
Im a missionary  
So here is my confession  
Its an obsession  
Im a firm believer  
And a warm receiver  
And Ive made my decision  
This is religion  
Theres no doubt  
Im one of the devout  
Trying to sell the story  
Of loves eternal glory  
Sacred  
Holy  
To put it in words  
To write it down  
That is walking on hallowed ground  
But its my duty  
Im a missionary  
Spreading the news around the world  
Taking the word to boys and girls  
Im a firm believer  
And a warm receiver  
And I will go down on my knees  
When I see beauty  
Theres no doubt  
Im one of the devout  
Trying to sell the story  
Of loves eternal glory  
Sacred  
Holy  
To put it in words  
To write it down  
That is walking on hallowed ground  
But its my duty  
Im a missionary  
Sacred  
Holy  
To put it in words  
To write it down  
That is walking on hallowed ground
