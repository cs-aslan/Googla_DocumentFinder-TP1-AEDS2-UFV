Youre insecure  
Dont know what for  
Youre turning youre head when you walk through the dooor  
Dont need make up  
To cover up  
Being the way that you are is enooough  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it  
Everyone else but you  
  
Babyyou light up my world like nobody else  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed  
But when you smile at the ground it aint hard to tell yo dont know  
OhOh  
You dont know youre beautiful  
But thats what makes you beautiful  
  
So cccome on you got it wrong  
To prove Im right I put it in a sooong  
I dont know why youre being shy  
And turn away when I look into youre eyeyeyes  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it  
Everyone else but youyeah  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed  
But when you smile at the ground it aint hard to tell  
You dont know  
OhOh  
You dont know youre beautiful  
If only you saw what I can see  
Youll understand why I want you so desperately  
Right now Im looking at you and I cant believe  
You dont know  
OhOh  
You dont know youre beautiful  
But thats what makes you beautiful
