Dont talk back to me dont talk back to me  
Dont talk back to me dont talk  
  
Going round in circles hearing too many points of view  
Just words to tire me out small talk I could do without  
I would be amazed if you returned to see things my way  
Now that youve been disrespectful to my sense of pride  
  
Isnt it a shame that you were lying when you said to me small talk  
I was the only one you and I were meant to be  
I expect youll never really feel the way that I do  
All of this is with regret Im sure you will agree  
  
Say something to me anything at all  
I want you to mean what you say  
Ive seen all I want to see and you mean the world to me  
Ive lived for each moment to be with you with you with you  
  
Small talk small talk small talk small talk  
  
You say I dont talk enough that applies to both of us  
Dont try to sound me out something I could do without  
So much goes on inside your head I often wonder  
Have you heard enough to know theres nothing left to say  
  
Say something to me anything at all  
I want you to mean what you say  
Ive seen all I want to see and you mean the world to me  
Ive lived for each moment to be with you with you with you  
  
Small talk  
Small talk  
Ooh small talk  
Thats all I ever hear  
Small talk  
  
Ill be alright  
It may take sometime  
But Ill be alright dont talk back to me  
Ill be alright dont talk back to me  
dont want to be alone nothing worth to carry on  
  
Ill be alright dont talk back to me  
try hard to understand you wont seem to lend a hand  
Ill be alright dont talk back to me  
without youll fail to see you never spare a thought for me  
  
Ill be alright dont talk back to me  
so many things you said going round in circles  
Ill be alright dont talk back to me  
Ill rise above it all enough to see another day  
  
Ill be alright  
Ill be alright  
Dont talk back to me
