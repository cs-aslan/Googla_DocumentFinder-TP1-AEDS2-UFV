Baby break it down  
Baby break it down  
Weve got a long way to go  
Baby break it down  
Baby break it down  
Weve got a long way to go  
  
Youre standing on your side  
Im standing on mine  
It only needs one step  
And you could be crossing the line  
Theres nothing between us  
Or maybe too much  
Whatever it is its too fragile to touch  
  
Baby break it down  
Baby break it down  
We got a long way to go  
Baby break it down  
Wrap your love around  
Babe youve got a long way to go  
  
And who jumps the fences  
And who builds the walls  
Whoever takes chances must surely fall  
  
Baby break it down  
Baby break it down  
Babe youve got a long way to go  
Baby break it down  
Youll be safe and sound  
Youve got a long way to go  
Babe too far to go  
Too far to go  
  
Theres no river running  
That we cant cross  
Does one or the other of us  
Have to be the boss  
  
Baby break it down  
Baby break it down  
Babe youve got a long way to go  
Baby break it down  
Wrap your love around  
A long way to go  
  
Baby break it down  
Wrap your love around  
Babe youve got a long way to go  
Baby break it down  
Baby break it down  
Long way to go  
Long way to go  
Youve got a long way to go
