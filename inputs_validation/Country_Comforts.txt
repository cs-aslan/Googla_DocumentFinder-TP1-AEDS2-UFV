Soon the pines will be falling everywhere  
Village children always fighting for fair share  
And the sixonine goes roarin down the creek  
As Parson Lee prepares his service for next week  
  
I saw grandma yesterday down at the store  
Well shes really lookin fine for eightyfour  
And she asked me if some time Id fix the barn  
Poor old girl she needs a man down on the farm  
  
Chorus  
And its good old country comforts in my bones  
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known  
Just an old fashioned feeling in my bones  
Country comforts and the road thats going home  
  
Down at the mill theyve got a new machine  
Foreman says it cuts manpower by fifteen  
Oh but that aint natural old man Grayson says  
Cause hes a horsedrawn man until his dying days  
  
Chorus
