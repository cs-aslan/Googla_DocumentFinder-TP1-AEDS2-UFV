My life is in a serious mess  
My baby is gone theres heavy mental stress  
I never knew love but I know it now  
I want to give her my heart but how how  
  
I never knew love but I know it now  
I want to give her my heart but how how  
How How  
  
Maybe I should buy her a beautiful dress  
Maybe gold and diamonds and no more stress  
I decide to call her it drives me insane  
Then shes on the line and tells me Dont be vain  
  
I decide to call her it drives me insane  
But then shes on the line and tells me I take the blame  
You  little fool and you know what I miss  
No diamonds no gold just a kiss  
Just a kiss  
  
I got nothing to lose so I know it doesnt matter  
I do it the old way and write her a letter  
I know how much I love you and I need you now  
Youre the one and only and you tell me how  
  
Now Im out of trouble and a serious mess  
My baby is back no more stress  
You know how much I love you and I need you now  
Ill give you my heart just tell me how how  
How how
