Use to be Use to be  
Love was mean to me  
Every love I tried my heart cried that wont do  
Now you see Now you see  
Loves been good to me I guess my love was waiting just for you  
You and me You and me You and me  
Go so well as we  
Fit right to a T  
Cant you see we do  
  
Repeat x4  
Gotta say Gotta say Gotta say  
Your loves got a way  
Of making me glad  
I waited just for you  
I should have known  
That my heart could not be wrong
