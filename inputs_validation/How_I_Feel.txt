Looks like I made a mess again  
Heartbreak everywhere I step  
This fire is getting hot again  
But I touch the flame cause Im a curious cat  
Creeping where I dont belong  
Finding out what I knew all along  
Crying all alone  
And its all my fault all my fault  
  
Yeah I did it again again  
  
Oh Im getting tired of believing  
Even sicker of pretending  
That its not so bad just wait it out  
Oh I think youre feeding me lies again  
The only good man left wasnt him  
And thats how I feel right now so just let me be  
Let me be  
  
It seems every time I find a good man  
Hes got a good little wife  
Im not jealous but I wont lie  
I dont want to hear about your wonderful life  
And babies everywhere I look  
Trophy wives with their little black books  
At this rate Im gonna end up alone  
Its probably all my fault all my fault  
  
Oh another dead end again  
  
Oh Im getting tired of believing  
Even sicker of pretending  
That its not so bad just wait it out  
Oh I think youre feeding me lies again  
The only good man left wasnt him  
And thats how I feel right now  
  
Bitter pill that Ive swallowed  
Just how low can my heart sink  
Fairy tales from so long ago  
Save them for someone thats not smart enough to know  
  
Cause I Im getting tired of believing  
Im through pretending  
Yeah Im broken and sad so Ill sit this one out  
Oh I think youre feeding me lies again  
The only good man left wasnt him  
And thats how I feel right now  
  
How I feel right now  
How I feel right now  
How I feel right now  
Let me be  
  
How I feel right now  
How I feel right now  
How I feel right now  
Let me be
