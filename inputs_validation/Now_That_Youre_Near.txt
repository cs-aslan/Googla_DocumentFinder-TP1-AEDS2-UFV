Hold me in Your arms  
Never let me go  
I wanna spend eternity with You  
  
I stand before You Lord  
And give You all my praise  
Your love is all I need  
Jesus Youre all I need  
  
My life belongs to You  
You gave Your life for me  
Your grace is all I need  
Jesus Youre all I need  
  
Hold me in Your arms  
Never let me go  
I wanna spend eternity with You  
  
And now that Youre near  
Everything is different  
Everythings so different Lord  
And I know Im not the same  
My life Youve changed  
And I wanna be with You  
I wanna be with You  
  
And I will sing for You always  
Cause in Your presence God is where I wanna stay
