Oh hello  
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe  
Hung by his pretty white neck  
Some eighteen months ago  
I travelled to a mystical time zone  
And I missed my bed  
And I soon came home  
  
They said   
Theres too much caffeine  
In your bloodstream  
And a lack of real spice  
In your life  
  
I said   
Leave me alone  
Because Im alright dad  
Surprised to still  
Be on my own  
  
Oh but dont mention love  
Id hate the strain of the pain again  
A rush and a push and the land that  
We stand on is ours  
It has been before  
So it shall be again  
And people who are uglier than you and I  
They take what they need and just leave  
  
Oh but dont mention love  
Id hate the pain of the strain all over again  
A rush and a push and the land that  
We stand on is ours  
It has been before  
So why cant it be now  
And people who are weaker than you or I  
They take what they want from life  
  
Oh but dont mention love  
No  no dont mention love  
A rush and a push and the land that  
We stand on is ours  
Your youth may be gone  
But youre still a young man  
So phone me phone me phone me  
So phone me phone me phone me  
  
Oh I think Im in love  
Oh I think Im in love  
Oh I think Im in love think Im in love  
Urrgh I think Im in lerv  
Oh
