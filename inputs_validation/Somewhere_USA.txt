Out on the road like a lowdown Joe  
And the bar where we are is so cool Id like to stay  
Misunderstood like I knew I would be  
The one I care for dont mind shes built that way  
I would gladly offer you my love  
In this hotel in Somewhere USA  
  
This rental car never went so far  
But with each passing mile on more dream has turned to clay  
Now that weve met and your eyes are all wet  
Let me fetch my guitar theres a song Id like to play  
I would gladly offer you my song  
In this hotel in Somewhere USA  
  
One never knows where the good times  
If you got some to spendwell do anything you say  
Id never lie well you know Ive tried  
Though you think its the drink that has made me behave this way  
I would gladly offer you my love  
In this hotel in Somewhere USA
