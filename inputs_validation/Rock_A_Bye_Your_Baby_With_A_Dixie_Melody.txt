Rockabye your baby with a Dixie melody  
When you croon croon a tune from the heart of Dixie  
Just place my cradle mammy mine  
Right on the Mason Dixon line  
And swing it from Virginia  
To Tennessee with all the love thats in ya  
  
Weep no more my lady  
Sing that song again for me  
Soft and low just as though  
You had me on your knee  
  
A million baby kisses Id deliver  
If you would only sing that Swanee River  
Rockabye your rockabye baby with a Dixie melody
