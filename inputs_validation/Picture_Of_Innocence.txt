I hear theyre trying to make us all the same  
Its mind control by any other name  
Whos gonna pay the price  
For this foolish paradise  
Oh Momma dont take that train  
  
I hear it said were headed too far south  
Chinese whispers go by word of mouth  
Rules for every size and shape  
The nag has gone shut the gate  
Once youre in youre never getting out  
  
Im so misunderstood  
There goes my manhood  
Shes in my face again  
With that picture of innocence  
  
No drinks no smokes  
No dicking around  
No dirty jokes  
Straight lace straight face  
The old straight jacket  
We got no hope  
  
I hear theyre gonna try out something new  
I can feel it sticking to my shoe  
So this is what tomorrow holds  
Hopes and dreams are bought and sold  
But still the world is misty green and blue  
  
I so misunderstood  
There goes my mannish boyhood  
Shes in my face again  
With that picture of innocence  
  
No deals no strokes  
No forbidden fruit  
No holy smoke  
What next no sex  
Thats the end of the road  
Thats the end of the road  
We got no hope  
  
No drinks no smokes  
No dicking around  
No dirty jokes  
Straight lace straight face  
The old straight jacket  
We got no hope  
  
No deals no strokes  
No forbidden fruit  
No holy smoke  
What next no sex  
Thats the end of the road  
We got no hope
