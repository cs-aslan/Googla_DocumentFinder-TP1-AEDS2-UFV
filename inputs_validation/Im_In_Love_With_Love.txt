Is it the rain or is it the weather  
Am I insane to wanna keep it together  
Is it the moon thats affecting my brain  
Is it my friends theyd never made it to heaven  
  
Im in love with love  
Anyone can see  
Angels up above are watching over me  
  
Is it the sunlight that changes the seasons  
Monday through Sunday I am looking for reasons  
Is there an angel watching over my shoulder  
Trickin my senses or giving me shelter  
  
Im in love with love  
Anyone can see  
Angels up above are watching over me  
  
Im in love with love  
Is it the rain is it the weather  
Angels up above  
Is it my friends keepin us together  
  
Is it the rain or is it the weather  
Am I insane to wanna keep it together  
Is it the moon thats affecting my brain  
Is it my friends theyd never made it to heaven  
  
Im in love with love  
Anyone can see  
Angels up above are watching over me  
  
Im in love with love  
Anyone can see  
Angels up above are watching over me  
  
Affection is perfection  
When its done with ease  
Im in love with love  
  
Im in love with love  
Is it the rain or is it the weather  
Angels up above  
Is it my friends keepin us together
