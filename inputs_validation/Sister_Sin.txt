Verse 1  
Yeah the lady and me both agree some days we just dont get along  
But the whiskey and me both agree maybe we both just better off  
Well the preacher believes that Ill meet all of these demons hanging on  
But we both know if they dont Ill get lonely need a few to tag along  
  
PreChorus  
Hanging here by a thread  
Hear a voice inside my head  
  
Chorus  
Lie me beside you every night  
And dread the day you might be gone  
She said In case you hadnt noticed that  
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long no  
And Im not about to anymore  
  
Verse 2  
Now the wagon Im ins paper thin  
I think one wheels coming off  
Hey sister sin with that grin where you been  
So kind of you to help me out  
  
PreChorus  
Hanging here by a thread  
Hear a voice inside my head  
  
Chorus  
Lie me beside you every night  
And dread the day you might be gone  
She said In case you hadnt noticed that  
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long no  
And Im not about to anymore  
  
Bridge x2  
Fall from grace kingdom come  
Lying face down in the mud  
Please dont hate look dont judge  
For I know not just what Ive done  
  
Refrain  
Lying face down in the mud  
For I know not just what Ive done  
For I know not just what Ive done  
  
Chorus x2  
Lie me beside you every night  
And dread the day you might be gone  
She said In case you hadnt noticed that  
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long no  
And Im not about to anymore
