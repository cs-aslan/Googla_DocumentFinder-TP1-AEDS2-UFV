All my friends are married  
Every Tom and Dick and Harry  
You must be strong  
To go it alone  
Heres to the bachelors  
And the bowery bums  
And those who feel that theyre the ones  
Who are better off without a wife  
I like to sleep until the crack of noon  
Midnight howlin at the moon  
Goin out when I wanto comin home when I please  
I dont have to ask permission  
If I want to go out fishing  
And I never have to ask for the keys  
Never been no Valentino  
Had a girl who lived in Reno  
Left me for a trumpet player  
Didnt get me down  
He was wanted for assault  
Though he said it werent his fault  
Well the coppers rode him right  
Out of town  
chorus selfish about my privacy  
As long as I can be with me  
We get along so well I cant believe  
I love to chew the fat with folks  
And listen to all your dirty jokes  
Im so thankful for these friends  
I do receive  
chorus
