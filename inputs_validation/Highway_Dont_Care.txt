B et your windows rolled down and your hairs pulled back  
And I bet you got no idea youre going way too fast  
Youre trying not to think about what went wrong  
Trying not to stop til you get where you goin  
Youre trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio  
And the song goes  
  
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby  
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby hm baby  
  
The highway wont hold you tonight  
The highway dont know youre alive  
The highway dont care if youre all alone  
But I do I do  
The highway wont dry your tears  
The highway dont need you here  
The highway dont care if youre coming home  
But I do I do  
  
I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat  
Yeah I bet youre bending Gods ear talking bout me  
Youre trying not to let the first tear fall out  
Trying not to think about turning around  
Youre trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on  
So you sing along  
  
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby  
I cant live without I cant live without you baby oh baby  
  
The highway wont hold you tonight  
The highway dont know youre alive  
The highway dont care if youre all alone  
But I do I do  
The highway wont dry your tears  
The highway dont need you here  
The highway dont care if youre coming home  
But I do I do  
  
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby  
I cant live without I cant live without you baby oh baby  
  
The highway dont care  
The highway dont care  
The highway dont care  
But I do I do  
  
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby The highway dont
care  
I cant live without I cant live without you baby oh baby But I do I do  
I cant live without you The highway dont care  
The highway dont care the highway dont care  
The highway dont care I cant live without you I cant live without you
baby  
But I do I do  
The highway dont care the highway dont care The highway dont care the
highway dont care  
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby oh baby But I do I
do  
  
I cant live without you I cant live without you baby
