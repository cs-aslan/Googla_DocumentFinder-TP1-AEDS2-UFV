Hes a giver hell give her  
The kind of attention that shes never known  
Hes a helper hell help her  
To open the doors that she cant on her own  
Hes a lover hell love her  
In ways that she never has been loved before  
And hes a getter hell get her  
By gettin her into the world shes been hungerin for  
cause hes a taker hell take her  
To places and make her fly higher than shes ever dared to  
Hell take his time before takin advantage  
Takin her easy and slow  
And after hes taken the body and soul  
That she gives him hell take her for granted  
Then hell take off and leave her  
Takin all of her pride as he goes  
Yes hes a taker hell take her   
Hes a charmer and hell charm her  
With money and manners that I never learned  
Hes a leader and hell lead her  
Across pretty bridges hes planning to burn  
Hes a talker hell talk her  
Right off of her feet but he wont talk for long  
Cause hes a doer and hell do her  
The way that I never  
And damned if he wont do her wrong  
cause hes a taker hell take her  
To places and make her fly higher than shes ever dared to  
Hell take his time before takin advantage  
Takin her easy and slow  
And after hes taken the body and soul  
That she gives him hell take her for granted  
Then hell take off and leave her  
Takin all of her pride as he goes  
Yes hes a taker hell take her
