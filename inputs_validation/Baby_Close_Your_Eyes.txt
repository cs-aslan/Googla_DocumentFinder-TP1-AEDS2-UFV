sun is creeping down  
behind the hill  
everything is calm  
everything is still  
so baby close your eyes  
and rest your weary mind  
let me hold you close  
Ill sing you this lullaby  
let your worries go  
you fall asleep  
think of nothing more  
memories will keep  
your dreams will turn to gold  
and you will wake and find  
that you hold a smile all day  
from this lullaby  
maybe somewhere in the silence  
you may wake and youre all alone  
just call and Ill be there  
even when Im gone  
each day will end  
so Ill say good night  
till we meet again  
now baby close your eyes  
and rest your weary mind  
IIll let you know the joy you bring  
every time you hear me sing  
you this lullaby
