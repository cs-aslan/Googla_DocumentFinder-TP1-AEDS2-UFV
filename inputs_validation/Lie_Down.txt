You got the smile of a Monalisa  
Know it all an giving nothing away  
You make the sins of a vestal virgin  
Look nothing more that a roll in the hay  
  
So lie down I think I love you  
Lie down I think I care  
Lie down I think I love you  
Lie down I think I care  
  
You give an air of the Dolce Vita  
Societys made a queen out of you  
Casanova couldnt take all your virtue  
But rock n roll is gonna steal it from you  
  
So lie down I think I love you  
Lie down I think I care  
Lie down I think I love you  
Lie down I think I care  
  
Come on girl itll be alright  
Easy does it nice and slow  
Woah you know mama that tonights the night  
Come on and let your feelings show  
  
Take a look in the mirror  
Tell me what you see  
If it aint sweet surrender  
You can blame it on somebody not the devil in me  
  
So lie down I think I love you  
Lie down I think I care  
Lie down I think I love you  
Lie down I think I care  
  
Solo  
  
Take a look in the mirror  
Tell me what you see  
If it aint sweet surrender  
You can blame it on somebody not the devil in me  
  
Lie down I think I love you  
Lie down I think I care  
Lie down I think I love you  
Lie down I think I care
