Turn to me  when your heart breaks away  
Turn to me  dont turn me away  
When everythings sad and down  
When youre looking for somewhere to run  
  
Why dont you turn to me  
Turn to me  
Why dont you turn to me  
Turn to me  
Turn to me  when the moon gets to go  
Turn to me  when the storys been told  
When everythings dim and grey  
And youre hitting a rainbow way  
  
Why dont you turn to me  
Turn to me  
Why dont you turn to me  
Turn to me  
  
Now that Christmas is here  
A shadow of fears  
And if you want to seek   
Turn to me and read these lonely lonely eyes  
  
Why dont you  
Why dont you turn to me  
Turn to me
