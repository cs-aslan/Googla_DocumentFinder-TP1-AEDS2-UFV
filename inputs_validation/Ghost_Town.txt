Well the streets are all crowded  
Lots of people around  
And theres music playing  
But I cant hear a sound  
  
Just the sound of the rain  
Falling silently down  
Livin aint been livin  
Since you put down  
  
Yeah life goes on around me every day  
But it might as well be half a million miles away  
Its like a ghost town without your love  
Like a ghost town without your love  
  
Like a ghost town baby cant you see  
Its a ghost town until you come back to me  
oh oh till you come back to me  
  
Well I wish I still had you  
Had you here next to me  
Baby where did you go  
Baby why did you leave  
  
Though the world it keeps turnin  
But it dont turn for me  
Without you in my life  
My life aint no place to be  
  
Theres only lonely days and empty nights  
Aint the same without you baby nothin feelin right  
Darlin I want to leave this town  
Dont want to be around  
  
Im gonna leave this town
