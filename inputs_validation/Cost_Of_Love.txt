Youre in deeper than you seem  
What you need what you want  
Are not the same thing  
I think youre getting sick on the dream  
  
I dont want to see you  
Till you know the cost of love  
Please dont make me need you  
Till you know the cost of love  
  
You told me that we could make it right  
Underneath the fear that you would hold me tight  
Do you think forevers only last all night  
  
I dont want to see you  
Till you know the cost of love  
Please dont make me need you  
Till you know the cost of love  
  
First its promises then its lies  
Watch those stares turn to turnedaway eyes  
  
You told me that we could make it right  
Underneath the fear that you would hold me tight  
Do you think forevers only last all night  
I dont want to see you  
Till you know the cost of love  
Please dont make me need you  
Till you know the cost of love  
  
Till you know the cost  
Of love
