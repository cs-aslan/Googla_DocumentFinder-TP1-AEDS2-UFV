I can hear the wheels of the automobiles so far away  
Just moving along through the drifting snow  
Its times like these when the temperatures freeze  
I sit alone just looking at the world through a storm window  
  
Down on the beach the sandman sleeps  
Time dont fly it bounds and leaps  
And a country band that plays for keeps  
They play it so slow  
  
Dont let your baby down  
Dont let your baby down  
Dont let your baby down  
  
Well the spirits were high til the well went dry  
For so long the raven at my window was only a crow  
I bought the rights to the inside fights and watched a man  
Just beating his hand against a storm window  
  
While miles away oer hill and stream  
A candle burns a witchs dreams  
Silence is golden til it screams  
Right through your bones  
  
Dont let your baby down  
Dont let your baby down  
Dont let your baby down  
  
Storm windows gee but Im getting old  
Storm window keep away the cold  
  
Dont let your baby down  
Dont let your baby down  
Dont let your baby down oh no
