She dances  
He watches  
She sighs  
Remember  
Love needs no disguise  
In motion  
That cannot deny  
Shes saying  
Love needs no disguise  
And if the park gates are closed  
Remember we toured the skys  
And if the friends all go home  
You know love needs no disguise  
He dances  
And we realised  
Remember  
Love needs no disguise  
In simple embraces  
They lie  
In darkness  
Love needs no disguise  
And we can lock all the doors  
Forget the reasons and fame  
Theres no deceiving inside  
You know well all be the same
