I know I said I would roll with you  
Put my lifestyle on hold for you  
All them sweet things that I told you  
This conversation is overdue  
Freeze  
  
Getting too wild to respect the vow  
I just aint ready to settle down  
My name too big in the ghetto now  
Freeze  
  
Feels like Im ready when Im holding you  
But its so many honeys what Im supposed to do  
Keep sending them apology notes to you  
Freeze  
  
All I need is for you to freeze  
This is hard on me  
I dont wanna leave  
But in the mean time take back the keys and  
Freeze  
  
Dont change  
Dont go  
Dont leave  
Just freeze  
I know girl its a lot to ask  
Tell me what other choice I have  
When you love someone reach back  
Just freeze  
Dont change  
Dont go  
Dont leave  
Just freeze  
Girl I hope you understand  
Promise Ill be back for you  
When I become a better man

What would you think if I told you that I  
Knew that I was breaking your heart  
Want to explain but where should I start  
What would you think if I told you that I  
Wake up every morning with a different girl  
Cause I dont wanna settle down before I see the world  
What would you think if I told you that I  
Know exactly what you need indeed  
Hate to follow but Im scared to lead  
Too scared love will get the best of me  
I know deep down by the zest of me  
Hopefully some day I can give you that ring  
But until then just do this one thing  
Freeze
