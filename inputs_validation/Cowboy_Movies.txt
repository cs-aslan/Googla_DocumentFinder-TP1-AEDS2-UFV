My dad talks a lot about cowboys  
Like John Wayne and people I dont even know  
I like the cartoons on Saturday morning  
Cause Im only four years old  
  
But my dad just loves cowboy movies  
He even bought me a big cowboy hat  
And when I put it on with my boots and my Levis  
I can tell that he really likes that  
  
I love to watch Nickelodeon  
You might say I grew up on Sesame street  
My favorites are Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch  
And I think the muppets are neat  
  
But my dad just loves cowboy movies  
Hes never heard of Ernie and Burt  
Im just not a cowboy I guess Im a cowboy  
And I sure hope his feelings arent hurt
