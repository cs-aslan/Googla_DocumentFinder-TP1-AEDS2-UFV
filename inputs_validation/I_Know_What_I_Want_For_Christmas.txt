Tis the season for generosity  
A time to give and to receive  
My Christmas list consists of just one sweet dream  
  
I know what I want for Christmas this year  
I hope my note got to Santa on time  
Im a little bit nervous  
Its kind of a big thing Im asking for  
I dont know if I deserve it but boy if I get it  
Ill never ask for anything more  
It shines its new  
And its the one wish that I wish would come true  
This year for Christmas I just wanna be with you  
  
We can build a little fire  
We can sit and talk for hours  
Well just have fun  
You can tell me what you did  
Christmas morning as a kid  
And well talk about all our Christmases to come  
  
And if I hang a little mistletoe in every single doorway  
Im sure to get a kiss  
And is it too much to ask for a snowman kind of snow  
To complete this singular wish  
It shines its new  
I know what I want and nothin else will do  
This year for Christmas I just want to be with you  
  
This year for Christmas I just want to be with you
