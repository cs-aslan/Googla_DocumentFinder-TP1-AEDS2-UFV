I heard you say  
Life cant go on this way  
And you need to change your view  
So you packed up and moved out of my life  
To find a world of your own  
Even now that youve up and gone  
For you theres still a place in my heart  
Only real love in my life  
That even time cant erase  
So darlin  
Keep this heart in mind  
Whenever the lights of love dont shine  
Darlin keep this heart in mind  
Everytime  
I knew you cared  
Cause in your letters you would write and say  
That you missed my lovin every day  
Well if thats true  
All Id ever why  
Arent you next to me  
And you call me on the telephone  
Afraid because youre all alone  
Well Baby just remember  
Oh love will abide  
So darlin  
Keep this heart in mind  
Whenever the lights of love dont shine  
Darlin keep this heart in mind  
Everytime
