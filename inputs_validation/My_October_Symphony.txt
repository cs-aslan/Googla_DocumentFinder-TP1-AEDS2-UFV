So much confusion  
When autumn comes around  
What to do about October  
How to smile behind a frown  
Its hard to settle down  
  
Its so bemusing  
Will they cancel the parade  
We marched each October  
Now they say we were never even saved  
We must be very brave  
  
Shall I rewrite or revise  
My October symphony  
Or as an indication  
Change the dedication  
From revolution to revelation  
  
So were all drinking  
As leaves fall to the ground  
Because weve been thinking  
How Octobers let us down  
Then and now  
  
Shall we remember  
December instead  
Or worry about February  
Mourn our wartorn dead  
Never seeing red  
  
Shall I rewrite or revise  
My October symphony  
Or as an indication  
Change the dedication  
From revolution to revelation
