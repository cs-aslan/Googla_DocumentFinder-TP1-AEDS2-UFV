Each time the wind blows  
I hear your voice so  
I call your name  
Whispers at morning  
Our love is dawning  
Heavens glad you came  
  
You know how I feel  
This thing cant go wrong  
Im so proud to say I love you  
Your loves got me high  
I long to get by  
This time is forever  
Love is the answer  
  
I hear your voice now  
You are my choice now  
The love you bring  
Heavens in my heart  
At your call  
I hear harps  
And angels sing  
  
You know how I feel  
This thing cant go wrong  
I cant live my life without you  
  
I just cant hold on  
  
I feel we belong  
My life aint worth living  
If I cant be with you  
  
I just cant stop loving you  
I just cant stop loving you  
And if I stop  
Then tell me just what will I do  
  
Cause I just cant stop loving you  
  
At night when the stars shine  
I pray in you Ill find  
A love so true  
  
When morning awakes me  
Will you come and take me  
Ill wait for you  
  
You know how I feel  
I wont stop until  
I hear your voice saying  
I do  
  
I do  
This thing cant go wrong  
  
This feelings so strong  
  
Well my life aint worth living  
  
If I cant be with you  
I just cant stop loving you  
I just cant stop loving you  
And if I stop  
Then tell me just what will I do  
  
I just cant stop loving you  
  
We can change all the world tomorrow  
We can sing songs of yesterday  
I can say hey farewell to sorrow  
This is my life and I  
Want to see you for always  
  
I just cant stop loving you  
I just cant stop loving you  
If I cant stop  
And if I stop  
Then tell me just what will I do  
  
I just cant stop loving you  
I just cant stop loving you  
You know I do  
Then tell me just what will I do
