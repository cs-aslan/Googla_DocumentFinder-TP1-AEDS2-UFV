Ive been staring at the floor  
And Ive been holding back the tears  
And Id been talking to the walls  
If the walls had ears  
  
And now it seems that every time  
I look into your eyes  
There is only so far I can see  
  
Chorus  
So take me back there  
Where only we can go  
When you touch me the memories unfold  
And I remember love  
I remember love  
Do you remember love  
  
Ive been looking to the future  
And Ive been dreaming of our past  
But now Im counting on this moment  
Cause it may be the last  
  
And days go by and still I try  
To reach into your soul  
There is only so far I can go  
  
Chorus  
  
Remember the times when our world was alive  
And all of the answers were clear  
Remember the times when our souls would ignite  
And passion explodes into fears  
  
And I remember love  
I remember love  
Do you remember love
