The boy could play before he learned to grow  
Worked in a band who had no name at all  
Every mornin at the break of dawn  
You could see him draggin home his drums  
I was vaccinated with a victrolla needle  
And Im hooked on rock and roll  
  
They called the family doctor to see what he could do  
Doc said No you cant cure his soul  
Once hes infected with the blues  
So I travelled round from town to town singin out the news  
  
I was vaccinated with a little needle  
And Im hooked on rock and roll  
  
When you find you got no mind  
To work from nine to five  
Find the back beat set your heart free  
And feel that music runnin through your feet  
  
Mama told me long ago  
Aint no future in that rock n roll  
And I said Hey mama its burnin hot inside my soul  
  
Its like a fever that wont cool down  
Ive been addicted since I heard that sound  
  
I was vaccinated with a little needle  
And Im hooked on rock and roll  
  
When you find you got no mind bop shoo bop bop bop shoo bop  
To work from nine to five  
Find the back beat set your heart free  
Bop shoo bop bop bop shoo bop  
And feel the music runnin through your feet  
  
Mama told me long ago  
Aint no future in that rock n roll  
And I said Hey mama its burnin hot inside me soul  
  
Its like a fever that wont cool down  
Ive been addicted since I heard that sound  
  
I was vaccinated with a little needle  
And Im hooked on rock and roll yeah
