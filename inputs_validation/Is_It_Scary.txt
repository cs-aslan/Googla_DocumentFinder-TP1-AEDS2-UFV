Theres a ghost out in the hall  
Theres a goul beneath the bed  
Now its coming through the walls  
Now its coming down the stairs  
  
Then theres screaming in the dark  
Hear the beating of his heart  
Can you feel it in the air  
Ghosts be hiding everywhere  
  
Im gonna be  
Exactly what you want to see  
Its you whos haunting me  
Youre warning me  
To be the stranger  
In your life  
  
Am I amusing you  
Or just confusing you  
Am I the beast  
You visualized  
And if you want to see  
Eccentrialities  
Ill be grotesque  
Before your eyes  
  
Let them all materialize  
Is that scary for you baby  
Am I scary for you oh  
Is it scary for you baby  
Is it scary for you  
You know the stranger is you  
Is it scary for you baby  
  
Theres a creak beneath the floor  
Theres a creak behind the door  
Theres a rocking in the chair  
But nobody sitting there  
Theres a ghostly smell around  
But nobody to be found  
And a coughin and a yawnin  
Where restless souls spoke  
  
Im gonna be  
Exactly what you gonna see  
So did you come to me  
To see your fantasies  
Performed before your very eyes  
  
A haunting ghostly treat  
The foolish trickery  
And spirits dancing  
In the light  
  
But if you came to see  
The truth the purity  
Its here inside  
A lonely heart  
  
So let the performance start  
Is that scary for you baby  
Am I scary for you oh  
Am I scary for you baby  
Am I scary for you  
So tell me is it scary for you baby  
So tell me is it crazy for you baby  
Am I scary for you  
You know the stranger is you  
Am I scary for ya  
  
Masquerade the heart  
Is the height of haunting souls  
Just not what you seek of me  
Can the heart reveal the proof  
Like a mirror reveals the truth  
See the evil one is you  
  
Is that scary for you baby  
Am I scary for you oh  
Am I scary for you baby  
Is it scary for you  
So tell me am I scary for you baby
