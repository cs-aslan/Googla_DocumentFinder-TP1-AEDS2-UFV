I get in shape and do my physical fitness  
Your heads numb so your brains a miss this  
Pick em up eat em up pick em up beat em up  
Pick em up pimple head pick em up picky  
I roll wit globs and I come real sticky  
Ripping the mic I plug it up in your ears  
Crazed and brewer Im coming out like beers  
Like Rheingold Miller Coors and Buds  
Im a eat em wit popcorn and treat em like suds you duds  
Coming out the wick wack wicky wick able wack  
Black jack thats a fact writing exact behind your back  
The funk rhyme to master blaster  
Kicking up in a brainstorm rainstorm  
Rap storm rap form rap time rap rhyme  
Rap class Im here to fail and to pass  
To continue from the more hype tip  
I roll and rock rock and roll  
Jazz and pop rhythm and Blues  
Dance and fusion pain confusion  
Look at the lights what a night on the town  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Now Im back to funk freak the funk  
Hype the funk swipe the funk and all that junk  
I get busy on em communicate wit the world  
Man woman a baby boy and a girl  
Poppa large looking out the pawn shop  
Taking stroud while your face and arms drop  
Stop look learn to read learn to write learn to talk learn to walk  
And watch your step though Im hype and ripe though  
Kleptomaniac my rhyme is psycho  
A Ricky Ricardo a Guy Lombardo  
Sporting a rag top an El Dorado  
Step into Hollywood Im screening the boulevards  
The rhymes is gain type Im ready to pull its card  
Jack or Ace King or Queen call me the deuce  
Im pouring LA juice hitting the top feeling the rim  
Getting a trim I never rhyme like them  
On and on on and on on and on until the break of dawn  
I go overtime rock the mic in nighttime  
Daytime switching off to Prime time  
Specifically strolling back in the west time  
Rock the funk wit the mic in the east rhyme  
Hype and dope hype the frame the mic is smoking  
Yo I aint joking  
Rhyme to kill rhyme to murder rhyme to stomp  
Rhyme to ill rhyme to romp  
Rhyme to smack rhyme to shock rhyme to roll  
Rhyme to destroy anything toy boy  
On the microphone  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Youre dripping sweaty coming hard on your neck  
As I flow and grow from head to toe  
Seeking a style like John McEnroe  
Dissing em all serving them wit the mic stand  
Like Prince and Michael coming out wit a big band  
The crowd is loud you can pay as the manager  
Run wit the money I pull the trigger and damage ya  
Boom taking life more serious  
I may sound lyrical and very mysterious  
Rhymes are grip tight no grams to kill more  
A son of Sam how could I begin more  
Grabbing the mic you see the dark and shadows  
Youre in living hell the funk pound to pound  
The funk ignited hands are writing brains dividing  
Im coming out in sighting  
Like Im Blackula a better man that Dracula  
Spectacular and not irregular in fact you are speaking impopular  
Rhymes are moved and you cant be stop wit the  
Beat as it goes to the rhyme that flows  
Like a coke in a straw burning up in your nose  
Thats a bad habit stepping out on stage one  
Drop the mic come and turn to page one  
Look at the master my range is higher  
My lyrical burns your brains on fire  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast  
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast
