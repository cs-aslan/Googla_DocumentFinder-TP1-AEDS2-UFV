He said Fuck this and Fuck that  
And this guys the diplomat  
Stares into the blur of the tuner lights  
It cant be Nashville every night  
  
He said We are what we lack  
And this guys the autodidact  
Stares into the glare of the TV lights  
It cant be Nashville every night  
  
With its la la oh oh ohs  
Whoaohs and  
Yeahs  
  
He sang Ill die before I quit  
And this guys the limit  
Stares into the queer of the firefight  
It cant be Nashville every night  
  
With its la la oh oh ohs  
Whoaohs and yeahs  
La las  
Whoaohs and  
Yeahs
