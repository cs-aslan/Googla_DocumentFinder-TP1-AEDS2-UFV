I remember long ago  
How I wondered where Id go  
While the blizzards cold wind and snow  
Pounded outside my window  
  
California sunset  
Going down in the West  
All the colors in the sky  
Kiss another day goodbye  
  
Land of beauty space and light  
Land of promise land of might  
Youre my home now and its true  
California heres to you  
  
California sunset  
Going down in the West  
All the colors in the sky  
Kiss another day goodbye  
  
California sunset  
Going down in the West  
All the colors in the sky  
Kiss another day goodbye  
  
The golden state
