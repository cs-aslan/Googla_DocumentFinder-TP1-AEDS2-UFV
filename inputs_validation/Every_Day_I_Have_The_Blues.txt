Every day every day I have the blues  
Every day every day I have the blues  
When you see me worried baby because its you I hate to lose  
  
Nobody loves me nobody seems to care  
Nobody loves me nobody seems to care  
Speaking of bad luck and trouble will you know Ive had my share  
  
Im gonna pack my suitcase move on down the line  
Im gonna pack my suitcase moving down the line  
Well there aint nobody worryin and there aint nobody cryin  
Seems to me every day every day I have the blues  
Every day every day I have the blues
