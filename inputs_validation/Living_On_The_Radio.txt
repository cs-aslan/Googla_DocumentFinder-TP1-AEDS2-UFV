Ive got no friends  
Im my own queen  
But Im living on living on the the radio  
Thats my dream  
  
Stone river eyes  
And a lonely heart  
If Im living on the radio  
They wont tear me apart  
  
10 steps and roses on the tree  
10 steps and lonely nights  
But youve still got me  
On the road  
Road paved in gold  
  
Baby you must believe  
Baby you must be free  
Keep living on living on the radio  
Thats my dream  
  
Baby youve gotta friend  
And so many little monsters yeah  
Keep living on living on the radio  
  
And when theres nowhere to go  
And all your friends are gone  
And you only got your daddy to call  
It will be all right honey  
Cause your songs are on the radio  
  
Cause the showbiz all the caviar  
The champagne and the sold out shows  
But it will be all right honey  
Cause your songs are on the radio
