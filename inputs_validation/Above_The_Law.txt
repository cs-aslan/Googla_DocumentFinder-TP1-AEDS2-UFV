Intro  
The poor stay poor the rich get richer its just so disproportionate  
  
Chorus  
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate thats why I dont give a shit  
The poor stay poor the rich get richer its just so disproportionate  
You dont know just what Ive gone through thats why I would rather show  
You  
Just how far that I can take it every rule Im breaking it  
  
Eminem  
  
Terrible but not rippable invincible I hung invisible  
Fucking mistletoe over the world that stuck my ass up under it now pucker  
Up them lips and kiss it hoes  
Here we go  
Bad and Evil so you know how thisll go the competitions miserable we  
Stomp them bitches this is no joke  
Going overboard like someone threw us off the boat  
Choke apart from all the smoke  
Im trying to stay on fire so you know if I hate fucking water sprinklers I  
Dont want a hoes  
Someone left a cat out the bag now its time to stuff his face  
Bag in that bitch thought of that little motherfucker till it suffocates  
Who  
You handeling the Tryna be so sick when the Bad and Evil was reunited  
Hey  
Came back to annihilate the games and dive straight this into this highway  
Word of Satan theres a drop full of Ouija board and I pray  
Now I lay me down to sleep I do this shit in my sleep  
So now imagine if I awake  
Im champ bitch Ive never tasted Cannibus can never be no damn a wuss so  
Pussy never mushy so you cant squish  
No where near twisted in fact if I jump out a Taxi  
Only time youll hear me say I ambush  
Outlandish these words are weapons that I brandish  
Stand off wish the hoes get your hands off this cant tie bitch  
So why the fuck would I sugar coat it for  
No fuck protocol Id holla at this whore but now my throat is sore  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate thats why I dont give a shit  
The poor stay poor the rich get richer its just so disproportionate
