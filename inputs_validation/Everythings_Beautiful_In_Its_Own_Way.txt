When I look out over a green field of clover  
Or watch the sunset at the end of the day  
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty  
An everythings beautiful in its own way  
  
I see a fountain flow from a mountain  
Or see April showers bring flowers to May  
I cant help but ponder life is such a wonder  
An everythings beautiful in its own way  
  
Words cant describe what I feel inside  
When I see the beauty in each coming day  
What my eyes behold cant be bought or sold  
An everythings beautiful in its own way  
  
When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm  
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away  
In the midst of such anger destruction and danger  
The storms even beautiful in its own way  
  
When I see the leaves drop from off of the treetops  
Or see the snow fall on a cold winters day  
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder  
God made all things beautiful in their own way  
  
Words cant describe what I feel inside  
When I see the beauty in each coming day  
What my eyes behold cant be bought or sold  
An everythings beautiful in its own way  
  
In its own way  
In its own way
