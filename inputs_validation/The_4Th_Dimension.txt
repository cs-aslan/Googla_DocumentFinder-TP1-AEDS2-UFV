I tried and tried finally I realized  
Why she left this 3D world behind  
Go  
She got tired of the same old story  
She had a mind that would not quit  
Shed insist a plot must exist  
With an ending that she could not guess  
She tried hard to convince me  
Then she took off like a bright idea  
She believed there just had to be  
A movie that shed never seen  
I watched as her fingers drew  
A perfect line in space  
I watched as she looked on through  
Into another place  
She found out what shed been missing  
She decided she could change her luck  
She was right lifes not black and white  
Its something more than meets the eye  
I watched as her fingers drew  
A perfect line in space  
I watched as she walked straight through  
Into another place  
She parted with convention  
Now shes living in the 4th dimension  
Without me  
I watched as her fingers drew  
A perfect line in space  
I watched as she walked straight through  
Into another place  
I tried and tried and still I dont know why  
She left me no address or a way to guess  
I tried and tried finally I realized  
Why she left this 3D world behind  
Now shes somewhere in the 4th dimension  
Shes living in 4D  
She found herself a new direction there  
Shes living without me  
Shes living in 4D  
Shes living without me  
Somewhere in the 4th dimension  
Shes living in 4D  
She found herself a new direction there  
Shes living without me  
Shes living in 4D  
Shes living without me
