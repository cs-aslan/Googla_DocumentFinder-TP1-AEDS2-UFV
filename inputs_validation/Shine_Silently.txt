Just another room  
Just another town  
Same old crazy people hanging around  
Still you shine silently  
  
Staring into space  
Comin down alone  
Feel like packin all my bags  
And running home  
Shine silently  
  
Shine shine silently  
I dont need no light in the darkness  
Shine silently  
No I wont get lost while your loves shines  
Shines on me shines on me  
  
People at the door  
People on the phone  
Same old story  
No time on my own  
Still shine silently  
  
Nothing left to say  
Nothing left to prove  
When its said and done  
Theres nothing left but you babe  
Shine silently  
  
Chorus  
Shine shine silently  
I dont need no light in the darkness  
Shine silently  
No I wont get lost while your loves shines  
  
Chorus
