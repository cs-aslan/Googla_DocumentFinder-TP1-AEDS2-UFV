I bought a ticket to Austrailia for my holidays  
Got my boarding pass found out at last  
That I was seated in the middle of the row  
The buisness man beside me smelled like Old Spice and Gin  
The lady to my left was talkin bout her grandchildren  
Two kids behind me were screamin for their mum  
She was screamin back  
Wonder how come  
  
I got the worst seat on the plane  
By the time I land Ill be insane  
My legs are startin to go numb and  
I just wanna kill someone  
I got the worst seat on the plane  
Bladders full my backs a pain  
Next time I have somewhere to go  
Think Ill ride my bicycle  
  
I cant go to sleep cause the pillows too damn awkward  
So I try to watch the movie but it starred Kevin Costner  
Earphones hurt my head and the reading lamp was dead  
Then the pilot said Turbulence is on the way  
My food try was now on my lap  
The old lady beside me had a heart attack  
Children screamed so loud I thought my skull would crack  
Buisness man turned blue blew up on my back  
  
I got the worst seat on the plane  
Time I land Ill be insane  
My legs are startin to go numb and  
I just wanna kill someone  
I got the worst seat on the plane  
Bladders full my backs a pain  
Next time I have somewhere to go  
Think Ill just rent the video  
  
After seven hours I can take no more  
So I try to open the Emergency door  
But the flight attendant tackled me to the floor  
She said Go back to your seat dear  
I said Id rather get off here  
  
I got the worst seat on the plane  
I think I am now insane  
My legs are both completely numb and  
I want to kill everyone  
I got the worst seat on the plane  
Bladders full my backs a pain  
The next time I get Wonderlust  
I think that Ill just take the bus  
  
I got the worst seat on the plane  
Got the worst seat on the plane

Got the worst seat on the plane Yeah
