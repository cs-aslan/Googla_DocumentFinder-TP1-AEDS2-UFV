Hey fairweather friend  
You know you can bend me  
I dont wanna break  
Hey lend me a hand  
Something I can lean on  
Til Im strong enough to  
Make it  
  
Cause Im lost but Ill be lookin  
Ive been hurt but I keep on hopin  
Cause Im down but I keep fallin  
Fall in love with you  
Fall in love with you  
  
Take all you can find  
Any way you want to  
Easy as you can  
Leave something behind  
Love enough to live on  
Til Im strong enough to stand it  
On my own  
  
But Ill be lookin  
All alonebut I keep on hopin  
Cause Im down but I keep fallin  
Fall in love with you  
Fall in love with you
