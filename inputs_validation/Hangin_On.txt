Its true you have me twisted round your finger and it seems thats where I
belong  
You know how to hold me to thrill me and control me  
Just enough to keep me hangin on  
For now tomorrow and forever I guess Im tied to you right or wrong  
My love keeps a growing cause your love keeps a showing  
  
Just enough to keep me hangin on  
A love thats strong as mine will make me do most anything  
Like hiding tears and heartaches and dreaming silly dreams  
Youve got me where you want me you keep stringing me along  
Just enough to keep me hangin on just enough to keep me hangin on
