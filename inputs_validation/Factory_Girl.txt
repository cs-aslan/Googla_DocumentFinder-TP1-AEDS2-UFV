So the factory girl she listens  
For the sound of her daddys engine  
Till the work bell sounds and she leans down  
oh the summers here are hot  
All she seems to do is work and sleep  
And wish that she was still with you  
now you dont know where she is  
Lyin in her mothers bed  
Or who shes sleeping with  
all the kids would laugh at her  
cause she seemed so sweet and pure  
I took this shift because of her  
and though Ive never said a word  
I once smiled and looked at her  
Till the shift boss said get back to work  
now I dont know where she is  
Or whose bed shes sleeping in  
Or what man shes sleeping with
