The snow is falling Its Christmas Eve  
Presents are wrapped Under the tree  
Is there one for me  
  
I only want you for Christmas baby  
I dont need nothing else  
I only want you for Christmas baby  
Tie a ribbon round yourself  
Oh tie a ribbon round yourself  
  
I aint gonna write no letter Send north to the pole  
Cause what Im wanting this year Saint Nick dont need to know  
  
I only want you for Christmas baby  
I dont need nothing else  
I only want you for Christmas baby  
Tie a ribbon round yourself  
Oh tie a ribbon round yourself  
  
So put on your Christmas stockings Ill find that mistle toe  
Lets get into the the holiday spirits  
And honey ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho  
  
I only want you for Christmas baby  
I dont need nothing else  
I only want you for Christmas baby  
Tie a ribbon round yourself  
I only want you for Christmas baby  
I dont need nothing else  
I only want you for Christmas baby  
Tie a ribbon round yourself  
  
Oh tie a ribbon round yourself  
Wooo oooo train sound  
Oh I had a bicycle
