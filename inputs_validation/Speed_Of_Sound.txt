I gotta stay in the race  
The die has been cast  
Thats the way Im going  
I tried to jump from the river  
That flows so fast  
But it just keeps flowing  
  
Its a hell of a journey  
A just cant wait  
Theres no way I can hide it  
But its a killer of a storm  
And it looks like rain  
I guess Im got to ride it  
  
Sometimes I cant keep my feet on the ground  
I cant let go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I cant let go its all that I know  
  
Aint no question if you win or lose  
Whether its cold or rainy  
Gotta find my place whatever I choose  
Never say if or maybe  
And theres so many turns that I can see  
In a world that Im no stranger  
Survive in the face of danger  
  
Sometimes I cant keep my feet on the ground  
I cant let go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I cant let go its all that I know  
  
Sometimes I cant keep my feet on the ground  
I cant let go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I cant let go its all that I know
