Busta Rhymes  
Yeah yeah yeah now what the fuck now  
Flipmode WuTang shit what the fuck now  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Historical and monumental shit  
What the fuck now Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Straight smack a nigga right in the face like this was handball  
Or make a mural out his face up on a damn wall  
Niggas play hard and shit if you know whats best for you  
Why yall niggas better safeguard your shit  
Even though we rep brass knuckle rap  
Fuck with street geniuses and bowlegged chicks who walk with a gap  
Street niggas now the corporate boss  
Still go to why yall restaurant for steamed fish and Irish moss  
And whyyo the way we do it and you see how my shit bomb  
Your whole show wack and Ima cancel your sitcom  
Fuck a nigga broad til she tired and real calm  
You aint knowing my name tattooed on your bitch arm  
The way we blow shit is a shame  
Casually bust my gun and celebrate busting a cork on the champagne  
Wrote you with a whole new approach that lead a whole team of niggas  
Whyall should know I only ball like a coach now  
  
Raekwon the Chef  
Check out the light fixture freak lines like white bitches  
Let the mic lines  hang that slang is ridiculous  
Emperor of warlords big gun only fuck with sawedoffs  
Thats my specialty more to bust  
Shot out my bed parrot keep it gangster Lord  
I analyze your work those that got merked were not established  
Texture look classy arm baby 2000 raspberry  
S5 blowin through Asbury  
Soon to own steakhouses glowin like makeover thousand  
Them them niggas robbing from Pinkhouses  
Show and prove knocking off cab drivers  
God sodomize money ring two hundred thousand  
See the color of the carved out Wu emblem  
Baby its all designers tailormade Wu gooses  
Limousine automatic new Uzis in em yo  
Relax cousin just cruise through jewels with him  
  
GZA  
Move up the block giant box blast my song  
Nonstop strictly hiphop march on  
Doorag hang long metal tape is highbias  
Graphics captured with the colorful iris  
I zoom in while the listeners tune in  
Some assuming they paid dues and joined the union  
Lost nigga couldnt rumble in this wild jungle  
Quick to crumble type to be on the stand and fumble  
Divine Master threw on the track that made em bleed  
He produce at unattainable rains of top speed  
This powerful magnet that left em stagnant  
Was unlikely in cameras in larger fragments  
Unfilled rifle scout sniper shots precise  
Starlight scope with the night vision device  
Splendid marksman thatll shoot the one off the dice  
Split a grain of rice in one shot we kill em twice
