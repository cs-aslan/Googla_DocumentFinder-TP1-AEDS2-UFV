Theres a place up ahead and Im goin  
Just as fast as my feet can fly  
Come away come away if youre goin  
Leave the sinkin ship behind  
  
Chorus  
Come on the risin wind  
Were goin up around the bend  
  
Ooh  
  
Bring a song and a smile for the banjo  
Better get while the gettins good  
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway  
Where the neons turn to wood  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh  
  
You can ponder perpetual motion  
Fix your mind on a crystal day  
Always time for a good conversation  
Theres an ear for what you say  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah  
  
Ooh  
  
Catch a ride to the end of the highway  
And well meet by the big red tree  
Theres a place up ahead and Im goin  
Come along come along with me  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah
