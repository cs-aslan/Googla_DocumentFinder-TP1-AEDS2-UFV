I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain  
I was only trying to get by with some of lifes amenities  
Well nothings free I got more than I bargained for  
Now its plain to see I cant depend on love to defend me  
It took most of my time to do what never was done  
I was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone  
Come right or wrong it was laid to rest that way  
I hate to be unkind pretending is for strangers who dont know you  
I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain  
I was in some onehorse town just waiting for a plane  
To take me back now wheres that at I paid the price  
Well aint that nice knowing Im so free  
I cant depend on love to defend me  
I got more than I bargained for  
Now its plain to see I cant depend on love to defend me
