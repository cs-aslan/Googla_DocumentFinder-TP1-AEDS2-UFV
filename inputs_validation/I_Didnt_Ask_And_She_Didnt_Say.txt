Fogged in in Dallas on my way to LA  
Staring up at the screen  all flights were delayed  
When a voice behind me asked  
Stranger how have you been  
I was caught off guard when I saw her face  
Stumbled my way through an awkward embrace  
Yet somehow I managed to say good to see you again  
We caught up on old friends  
Caught up on old times  
But all through the small talk it kept burning through my mind  
  
Does she think about the nights we spent on crystal lake  
Wrapped up in a blanket til the break of day  
So many times I wondered does she think of me that way  
I didnt ask and she didnt say  
  
Trading stories and pictures of kids  
Things were gonna do and things never did  
Til we were stranded in that moment not sure what to say  
Then she broke the silence with her little shy smile  
And she brought up the weather but all the while  
  
I wondered if she thinks about Jackson hole  
Nights beside the fire and angels in the snow  
So many times Ive wondered does she think of me that way  
  
I didnt ask and she didnt say  
We said our goodbyes swore wed stay in touch  
Then we went our separate ways knowing knowing no one ever does  
  
But I couldnt help but wonder as I walked  
If thinks had turned out different where would we be today  
So many times Ive wondered does she think of me that way  
I didnt ask and she didnt say  
No I didnt ask and she didnt say
