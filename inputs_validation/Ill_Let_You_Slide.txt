Back to back and side to side  
Theres only music on my mind  
Nothing to worry about but the beat  
I wanted you to come and dance with me  
But you wanted to stay home and watch TV  
Ahhh but when I got there to my surprise  
There was another guy looking in your eyes  
  
I dont want dont want us to fuss and fight  
From right now til tomorrow night  
So if you promise to love only me and be by my side  
Ill let you slide  
  
Without a doubt tonight is the night  
That we gon really roll when the time is right  
And were gonna carry it into the dawn  
Oh but where are you where can you be  
Ive been waiting it seems an eternity  
I took our favorite song from the record stack  
It was Hey Jimmy Mack  
When are you coming back  
  
Well Im so disappointed youre gone tonight  
Cause your love is the spice of my life  
But if you hurry back in the mornin  
Then alright Ill let you slide tonight  
Up and down pacing around walking in my sleep  
Cause youve got a promise to keep  
Youve got to come back  
And love love love love me right  
And huh Ill let you slide tonight  
  
I cant wait till tomorrow baby  
Cant you come over tonight  
I cant get to sleep my baby  
Come and rock my cradle left to right  
I tossed and turned and called you up  
But there wasnt anybody home  
It makes me sad I need you bad  
But I guess Im just gonna have to wait until tomorrow comes  
Slide I knew it I knew it  
How could you do it  
Slide its alright Ill let you slide tonight  
Ill let you slide  
Oh how could you do it how could you do it  
Slide its alright Ill let you slide tonight  
  
I hired me a private eye  
To check up on your cool little alibis  
And what he discovered was woeful to me  
Baby if you intend to stay with me  
Then you cant see the guys I know you see  
Come on lets make up and promise to start anew  
Lets take the morning off Ive got some plans for you  
  
Making love by the moon can be mighty fine  
But when the sun rises so do I  
So if you rock it to me in the morning  
Then alright Ill let you slide tonight  
Really missed you today I was on the run  
So wake me up when the morning comes  
I think Ill dance to some music and groove on the party lights  
And let you slide tonight  
  
Get up oooh lets love baby  
Be my sugar and spice in the mornin  
And alright Ill let you slide tonight  
  
Get up oooh lets love baby  
Its really nice in the mornin  
And alright Ill let you slide tonight
