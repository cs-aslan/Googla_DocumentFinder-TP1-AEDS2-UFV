I barely get to the graveyard shift on time  
After pulling another grueling 9 to 5  
I live from credit card to check  
The paper moneys whirling by  
And I hardly just  
Just barely only just survive  
  
Im living on the edge  
Reality is teetering  
My mind is on the brink  
  
How will I face the day tomorrow  
If I cant make it through today  
Ive got nothing left to lose but my sanity  
And the right to go insane  
  
Ive got nothing left to lose but my mind  
Ive got nothing left to choose  
So I think Ill go insane  
  
My stomach aches  
Insufficient funds  
My cheeks are gaunt  
And my guts are overdrawn  
My head pounds  
Starvations giving me the shakes  
Too much squalor  
Too much pressure  
Now Im getting pissed  
  
Im living on the edge  
Reality is teetering  
My mind is on the brink  
  
How will I face the day tomorrow  
If I cant make it through today  
Ive got nothing left to lose but my sanity  
And the right to go insane  
  
Ive got nothing left to lose but my mind  
Ive got nothing left to choose  
So I think Ill go insane
