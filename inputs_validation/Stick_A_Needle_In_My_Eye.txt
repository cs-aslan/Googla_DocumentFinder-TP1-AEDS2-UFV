Im awfully tired of the same old business  
Kiss the babies make em cry  
Im only lookin for one good woman  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
Stick a needle in my eye eye eye  
Got a load of mashed potatoes  
Holdin gravy like a fishin hole  
I know something that might sound funny  
I got no money and my buddys broke  
I got no money and my buddys broke  
Counterculture mother vulture  
Post Toasties and a quart of beer  
Im only looking for a place to go to  
Somebody ask me what Im doin here  
Somebody ask me what Im doin here  
A boneless breast and a crispy thigh  
Sittin at the bar n giving me the eye  
Black crows on a garbage can  
What kind of fella do you think I am  
Stick a needle in my eye eye eye  
Im fallin in with bad companions  
My mind is weak and my throat is dry  
Thanksgiving in the Grand Canyon  
Cant keep my fingers off that country pie  
Im awfully tired of the same old business  
Kiss the babies make em cry  
Im only lookin for one good woman  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
Stick a needle in my eye eye eye  
Stick a needle in my eye eye eye
