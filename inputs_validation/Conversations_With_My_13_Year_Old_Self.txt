Conversations with my thirteen year old self  
Conversations with my thirteen year old self  
  
Youre angry  
I know this  
The world couldnt care less  
Youre lonely  
I feel this  
And you wish you were the best  
No teachers  
Or guidance  
And you always walk alone  
Youre crying  
At night when  
Nobody else is home  
  
Come over here and let me hold your hand and hug you darling  
I promise you that it wont always feel this bad  
There are so many things I want to say to you  
Youre the girl I used to be  
You little heartbroken thirteen year old me  
  
Youre laughing  
But youre hiding  
God I know that trick too well  
You forget  
That Ive been you  
And now Im just the shell  
I promise  
I love you and  
Everything will work out fine  
Dont try to  
Grow up yet  
Oh just give it some time  
  
The pain you feel is real youre not asleep but its a nightmare  
But you can wake up anytime  
Oh dont lose your passion or the fighter thats inside of you  
Youre the girl I used to be  
The pissed off complicated thirteen year old me  
  
Conversations with my thirteen year old self  
Conversations with my thirteen year old self  
  
Until we meet again  
Oh I wish you well oh  
I wish you well  
Little girl  
Until we meet again  
Oh  
I wish you well  
Little girl  
I wish you well  
Until we meet again  
My little thirteen year old me
