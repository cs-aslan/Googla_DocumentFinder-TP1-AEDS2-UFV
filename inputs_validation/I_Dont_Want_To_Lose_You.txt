graham russell  
I called on you today  
I know its late to say Im sorry  
Theres so much on my mind  
I feel as though the time is upon me  
Do you know you take my heart through the door  
Are there words to tell you what I live for  
chorus  
I dont want to lose you  
I dont want to lose you  
I dont want to lose you  
  
Let me dry your eyes  
Is this the last time I can hold you  
Theres hope in this soul  
And words that will tread where you go to  
  
Is it true you are leaving what you believe  
Part of you will always be with me  
  
chorus  
You have the hand that I need to get by  
Understand what it is thats turning me down  
  
chorus  
Is it true you are leaving what you believe  
Part of you will always be with me  
  
chorus
