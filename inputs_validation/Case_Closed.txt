Hits when Im asleep right through  
Im cold when I wake cause I wont feel you  
When I cant breathe I know its you  
Got a lump in my throat just thinking of you  
  
Makes no difference youve been tried  
Makes no difference youve been tried  
Still sick inside oh oh  
Its meant to be over now  
But I think were going down were going down  
  
Got your fingerprints as evidence all on my body  
Put your right hand on the book and you were found guilty  
I cant wait forever but thats how its gonna be  
For me theyll never be  
  
Case closed  
No matter what the verdict say  
Case closed  
Too many questions in my head  
Case closed  
And Im still waiting for a while  
Why there can never be  
Case closed  
  
Behind these walls so tall  
I dont wanna climb Im afraid to fall  
So we both do time and never have closure cause I still wanna hold ya  
  
Makes no difference youve been tried  
Makes no difference youve been tried  
Still sick inside oh oh  
Its meant to be over now  
But I think were going down were going down  
  
Got your fingerprints as evidence all on my body  
Put your right hand on the book and you were found guilty  
I cant wait forever but thats how its gonna be  
For me theyll never be  
  
Case closed  
No matter what the verdict say  
Case closed  
Too many questions in my head  
Case closed  
And Im still waiting for a while  
Why there can never be  
  
They can never never be a  
Never be a  
Never never be a  
Case closed  
  
They can never never be a  
Never be a  
Never never be a  
Case closed  
  
Got your fingerprints as evidence all on my body  
Put your right hand on the book and you were found guilty  
I cant wait forever but thats how its gonna be  
For me theyll never be  
  
Case closed  
No matter what the verdict say  
Case closed  
Too many questions in my head  
Case closed  
And Im still waiting for a while  
Why there can never be  
  
Case closed
