Love is a burning inside  
I never had this feeling before no  
All I know is that it wont let me be myself  
Hey is this really love  
Oh maybe thats the reason  
I feel so good when youre around  
Feel so good when youre around  
Why cant I remember  
The day I melted before your charms  
Oh was it way back in September  
When you held me in your arms  
Now that I see that youre the one for me  
Its no more a mystery  
Love has fallen down on me  
Ooh Im in love with you  
Love has fallen on me  
Now I really see  
Love has fallen on me  
Oh what tender love you bring  
No its not a game  
Oh what tender love you bring  
No its not a game  
Hey what tender love you bring  
I fell in love with you  
Fell in love with you  
One day in September love came falling down on me  
One day in September love came tumbling down on me  
Ooh what tender love you bring  
Oh now Lord I cant no no  
And I cant believe my eyes  
No no one day in September  
It came on down  
Oh fallin down love came falling all around  
I fell in love with you  
Fell in love with you
