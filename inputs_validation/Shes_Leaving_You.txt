You were planning to stay in you had it carefully planned  
Your coat was hanging in the hall your hat was in your hand  
You walked over to your woman your pale distracted love  
Who was trying to put the wrong hand into the wrong glove  
  
Are you leaving dear Are you leaving dear  
Are you leaving dear Are you leaving dear  
  
So you start reading all her books all her magazines  
Just to get a better understanding  
Your brain feels like its dead  
Your eyes are hanging out your head  
You were hoping for something less demanding  
Well what you see staring out at you from a photo book  
A man with an eyepatch and a bent bloody hook  
You wished to God that you never went and took a look  
Cause its in that moment that you know that  
  
Shes leaving you  
Yeah shes leaving you  
  
Well now shes taking you to bed  
Her legs wrapped round your head  
Youre losing her to some crazy kind of motion  
You keep coming up for air  
You look around and stare  
Find youre swimming into completely different oceans  
Youre wondering if shes thinking about some other man  
She says Cmon baby you know you are my loverman  
Youre going nuts you dont know exactly what to say  
She says Dont worry baby this is just my little way  
  
Of leaving you  
Oh man shes leaving you  
  
Guitar solo  
  
She keeps saying Hey dont hate me  
She keeps saying Hate is just some kind of failure of the imagination  
She keeps saying things like this  
Now shes giving you a kiss  
Now shes got you dragging her to the station  
The sun just slipped out of the sky this is a black letter day  
Her train is moving down the platform and is drawn away  
Youre crying buckets she gives her glove a wave  
She says Oh cmon baby thats no way to behave  
  
When Im leaving you  
Oh yeah shes leaving you  
Oh yeah shes leaving you  
Yeah shes leaving you  
Shes leaving you  
Yeah shes leaving you  
Yeah shes leaving you  
Yeah shes leaving you
