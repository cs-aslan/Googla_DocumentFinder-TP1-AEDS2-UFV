Chorus  
Js at my door I got money on the floor repeat 3x  
Im a million dollar nigga on the muthafuckin low  
I got money on the floor repeat 8x  
Future in the club poppin bands on them hoes  
Go ahead Gucci Mane toss some grands on the floor  
Im gettin a table dance by a fine ass ho  
Got me coming back now Im trying to find this ho  
I got money on the table choppa on the dresser  
Financially stable very successful  
Money on the marblefloor  
Redder than a cardinal  
Bluer Dodger  
Blacker than a ninja  
Itineraries calenders baby and agendas  
Boo Ill fuck ya hit ya when I hit ya  
Text message fax email me send a picture  
Gucci Mane fuck ya girl go get the pistol  
Gucci Mane fucked the world and its sister  
Main bitch left me I didnt even miss her  
Fucked her best friend she sucked then you kissed her  
Fucked her best friend she sucked me then you kissed her  
Money on the floor theres more  to count  
Got a lot of crack heads trying to get in my house  
This ho say she hungry put my dick in her mouth  
If she help me hit a lick then Im icing her out  
Down south gold mouth ya them birds fly south  
Made a half a million dollars in my trap house  
Im a million dollar man on the low worth cake  
Every girl I meet fuck on first date  
He on 26s baby Im on 8s  
Bart Simpson color diamonds with the red roller skates  
Brazilian chameleon reptilian Air forces  
 so the rest of them Jordans  
If bitches and money was my choices  
Then I choose money and move with bosses  
If bitches and money was my choices  
Then I choose money and move with bosses  
Mojo told me step my game up  
So if I throw up man shrimp might come up  
Cameleon paint same color the vomit  
 all in my stomach  
Im on the look out for a big fine woman  
Who wanna suck dick and can keep me company  
I thug this love this never been love sick  
But been frost bit back back young bitch  
Orange Catalina same color as a Sunkist  
Six 12s beat every time the fuckin drum kick  
Born on the track so you know its gon go  
I got half a million dollars on this goddamn floor
