Respirators ventilators  
High and holy legislators  
Give me agony pure agony  
Aah vegetation indignation  
Endless oneway conversation  
Aint living to me yeah  
And when I lose all my selfreliance  
Dont keep me hooked up to no appliance  
Ooh dont keep me if you love me  
Dont keep me alive by science  
Alive by science  
And I hear an angel banging on my door  
Big daddy on the top floor  
Shoutin free you gotta be free  
This is my life cest mon affiare  
Fat ladys singin I dont stand a prayer  
Now be a love and pull the plug on me  
Now babe if you be true to our alliance  
Please dont pump my lungs without my compliance  
Yeah dont keep me  
Oh dont keep me  
Alive by science  
Alive by science  
Ooh and when I lose all my selfreliance  
And dont keep me hooked up to no appliance  
Aah yeah dont keep me

Family members mortgage lenders give me agony  
Alive by science  
Im stuck in bed seeing red blood flows but my brain is dead  
Alive by science  
To be or not to be  
Alive by science

Dont dare and keep me
