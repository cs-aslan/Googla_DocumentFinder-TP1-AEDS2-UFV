Believe me pretty mama  
Better not treat me right  
Just have to forget you  
After tomorrow night  
  
Believe me pretty mama  
Better take your picture too  
Dont want to remember  
What a good looking girl can do  
Dont send me no letter  
Dont write me no postcard  
Thinking about you baby  
Makes it twice as hard  
Believe me pretty mama  
Better not treat me right  
Just have to forget you  
After tomorrow night  
Well Im sitting here  
On the sudden   
Watching the trees go by  
My baby at the end of the depot   
Lay me down and cry  
Believe me pretty mama  
Better not treat me right  
Just have to forget you  
After tomorrow night
