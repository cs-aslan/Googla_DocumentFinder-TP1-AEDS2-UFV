Arriving in boats black hooded coats  
Tormentors climbed into my room  
I crawled under my bed covered my head  
But theyre flushin me out with a broom  
The leader shes small pinned my ass to the wall  
For my seeds or shed be losin her past  
Time after time shed be readin my mind  
But she never got the feelin to last  
Celebrate celebrate celebraid it  
This is the critical mass  
So far so good I heard the other say  
So good so far theyre takin me away  
I drink to you your mind her ass  
Well take a drink and break the glass  
Celebrate celebrate celebreak it  
This is the critical mass  
Now the tallest of two with a brush full of blue  
Paints surrealist scenes on the wall  
So I tell her for fun that its really well done  
But she just aint listenin at all  
She points to my heart tellin me if Im smart  
Ill practice and phase  
Out and admit when the shoe doesnt fit  
And I went screaming out down the hall  
Need it  
Need your love  
Just then I heard a poundin on the door  
Were all here sang the voice of twenty more  
I drink to you alas well take a drink and break the glass  
Celebrate celebrate celebreak it  
We are the critical mass  
Time and space is takin me away  
Time erase dont know the time of day
