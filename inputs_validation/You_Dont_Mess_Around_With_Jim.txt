Uptown got its hustlers  
The bowery got its bums  
42nd street got big jim walker  
Hes a poolshootin son of a gun  
Yeah he big and dumb as a man can come  
But he stronger than a country hoss  
And when the bad folks all get together at night  
You know they all call big jim boss just because  
And they say  
  
You dont tug on supermans cape  
You dont spit into the wind  
You dont pull the mask off that old lone ranger  
And you dont mess around with Jim  
  
Well outta south Alabama came a country boy  
He say Im lookin for a man named Jim  
I am a poolshootin boy  
My name Willie McCoy  
But down home they call me slim  
Yeah Im lookin for the king of 42nd street  
He drivin a drop top cadillac  
Last week he took all my money  
And it may sound funny  
But I come to get my money back  
And everybody say jack dont you know  
  
And you dont tug on supermans cape  
You dont spit into the wind  
You dont pull the mask off that old lone ranger  
And you dont mess around with jim  
  
Well a hush fell over the pool room  
Jimmy come boppin in off the street  
And when the cuttin were done  
The only part that wasnt bloody  
Was the soles of the big mans feet  
Yeah he were cut in in bout a hundred places  
And he were shot in a couple more  
And you better believe  
They sung a different kind of story  
When big Jim hit the floor now they say  
  
You dont tug on supermans cape  
You dont spit into the wind  
You dont pull the mask off that old lone ranger  
And you dont mess around with slim  
  
Yeah big Jim got his hat  
Find out where its at  
And its not hustlin people strange to you  
Even if you do got a twopiece custommade pool cue  
  
Yeah you dont tug on supermans cape  
You dont spit into the wind  
You dont pull the mask off the old lone ranger  
And you dont mess around with slim
