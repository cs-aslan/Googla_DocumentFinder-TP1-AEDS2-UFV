30 blocks to Fordham Road  
Thats a bad neighborhood  
Gray house on the corner  
I know I shouldnt do what it is I could  
The stone Mary in the garden  
She let me know she watching  
She said I better get walking  
I better walk away  
I dont know why it is that I wanna stay  
I dont know what it is that makes me feel this way  
But Im not gonna do what I hear me say  
Im just gonna walk  
Im gonna walk away  
I catch a dollar in the wind and I buy a cup of coffee  
Theres a place on Valentine that still charge ninety cent  
I keep on walking in the daytime and in my eyes its always night time  
And I like it when its me at night  
Cause thats when all the stars come out  
I dont know why it is that I wanna stay  
I dont know what it is that makes me feel this way  
But Im not gonna do what I hear me say  
Im just gonna walk  
Im gonna walk away  
Its the greatest  
Its the greatest day  
Its the greatest  
Its the greatest day  
Im not gonna do what I hear me say  
Im just gonna walk  
Im gonna walk away
