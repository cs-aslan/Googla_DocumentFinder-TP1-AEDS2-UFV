When all else fails  
And you long to be  
Something better

So use it  
Thats what its for

For your  
Finest inspiration  
Your dreams  
Will open the door  
Open up the door  
  
It makes no difference  
If youre black or white  
If youre a boy or a girl  
If the musics pumping it  
Will give you new life  
Youre a superstar
