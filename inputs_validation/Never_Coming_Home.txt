Well its five in the morning and the lights already broken  
And the rainy streets are empty for nobody else has woken  
Yet you turn towards the window as he sleeps beneath the covers  
And you wonder what hes dreaming in his slumbers  
  
Theres a clock upon the table and its burning up the hour  
And you feel your life is shrinking like the petals of a flower  
As you creep towards the closet youre so careful not to wake him  
And you choose the cotton dress you bought last summer  
  
Theres a time of indecision between the bedroom and the door  
But the part of you that knows that you cant take it any more  
Theres the promise of the future in the creaking of the floor  
And youre torn if you should leave him with a number  
  
And in your imagination youre a thousand miles away  
Because too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So you write it in a letter all the things you couldnt say  
And you tell him that youre never coming home  
  
She starts running for the railway station praying that her calculations
right  
And theres a train just waiting there to get her to the city before night  
A place to sleep a place to stay will get her through another day  
Shell take a job shell find a friend shell make a life thats better  
  
The passengers ignore her just a girl with an umbrella  
And theres nothing they can do for her theres nothing they can tell her  
Theres nothing they could ever say would change the way she feels today  
Shed live the life shed always dreamed if he had only let her  
  
Now in her imagination shes a million miles away  
When too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So she wrote it in a letter all the things she couldnt say  
And she told him she was never coming home  
She told him she was never coming home  
  
I wake up in an empty bed a road drill hammers in my head  
I call her name theres no reply its not like her to let me lie  
Its time for work its time to go but somethings different I dont know  
I need a cup of coffee Ill feel better  
  
I stumble to the bathroom door her make up bag is on the floor  
It really is a mess this place it takes some time to shave my face  
Im not really thinking straight she never lets me sleep this late  
Im almost done and then I see the letter  
  
In his imagination shes a universe away  
Too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So she wrote it in a letter all things she couldnt say  
And she told him she was never coming home  
She told him she was never coming home  
She told him she was never coming home  
  
Im gonna live my life  
And she told him she was never coming home  
Im gonna live my life in my own way
