Through the wind and the rain  
I hear my mothers cry  
She says I know my babys out there  
Just couldnt bear to ask her why  
From my womb into the world  
Lord I wish the child would call  
You know Im needing some company  
She makes my life so full  
Take my advice  
Go ahead and live your own life  
But everybodys waiting  
For someone to come home  
  
Like the fire waits for the sand  
This world is burning  
With the tension of human hands  
Waiting to be cleansed  
Waiting for their ace of spades  
They say I sure hope hes coming  
cause I feel like Ive just been saved  
Take my advice  
Go ahead and live while youre alive  
Everybodys waiting  
For someone to come home  
  
Come to me and cleanse my soul  
Im free Im free  
Only with you am I whole  
Cant you see that I am me  
Ill be waiting by the window  
Ill be heading for the door  
  
I was driving down highway 85 yeah  
Had to pull off the road  
Just to hear my radio coming in clearer  
Lord this lifes so full I said  
Why do we ask for more  
While were waiting for the man to come  
We forgot what hes coming for  
Wont take my advice  
Go ahead and live while youre alive  
Everybodys waiting  
For someone to come home  
Ill be waiting by the window  
Everybodys waiting  
For someone to come home  
Ill be waiting by the window  
Everybodys waiting  
For someone to come home  
Come home
