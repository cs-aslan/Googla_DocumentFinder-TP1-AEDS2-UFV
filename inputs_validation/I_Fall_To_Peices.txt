I fall to peices  
Each time I see you again  
I fall to peices  
How can I be just your friend  
  
You want me to act like weve never kissed  
You want me to forget  
Pretend weve never met  
And Ive tried and Ive tried but I havent yet  
You walk by and I fall to peices  
  
I fall to peices  
Each time someone speaks your name  
I fall to peices  
Time only acts to the flame  
  
You tell me to find someone else to love  
Someone wholll love me to  
The way you used to do  
But each time I go out with someone new  
You walk by and I fall to peices  
  
You walk by and I fall to peices
