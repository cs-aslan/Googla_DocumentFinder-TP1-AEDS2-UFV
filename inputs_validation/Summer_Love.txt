Ridin in the droptop with the top down  
Saw you switchin lanes girl  
Pull up to the red light lookin right  
Come on let me get your name girl  
  
Tell me where your from what you do what you like  
Let me get your brain girl  
And tell me how they that got that pretty little face  
On that pretty little frame girl  
  
But let me show you round  
Let me take you out  
Betcha we can have some fun girl  
Cause we can it do fast fast slow  
  
Which ever way you wanna run girl  
But let me buy you drinks better yet rings  
Do it how you want it done girl  
And who would of thought that you could be the one cause I  
  
Chorus  
I cant wait to fall in love with you  
You cant wait to fall in love with me  
This just cant be summer love youll see

Come on and let me show you round  
Let me take you out  
Betcha we can have some fun girl  
Cause you could dress it up we could dress it down  
  
Any way you want it done girl  
Or we can stay home talkin on the phone  
Rappin till we see the sun girl

But who would of thought that you could be the one cause I

And I knew the day I met you youd be the one  
  
Chorus x2
