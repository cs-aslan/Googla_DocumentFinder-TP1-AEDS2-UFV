Feelin kinda sad and lonely  
I lost my sweet one and only  
Gonna find my baby I dont mean no maybe  
Gonna find her  
Gonna find my baby gonna her home to me  
She said that she would never leave me  
Now shes gone away and it grieves me  
I was fast asleepin when she come amidnight creepin  
Gonna find her  
Gonna find my baby gonna bring her home with me  
My bags are packed for to travel  
Gonna cover many miles of gravel  
Gonna find my baby cause shes the finest lady  
Gonna find her  
Gonna find my baby gonna bring her home with me  
Going down Texas going to Georgia  
Oklahoma Mississippi border  
Going to Alabammy going to Louisiana Tennessee  
Im agonna find my baby gonna bring her home with me  
Gonna find my baby gonna bring home with me  
she heard the sky was fallin  
Im agonna find my baby gonna bring her with me
