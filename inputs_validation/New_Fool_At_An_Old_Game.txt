You sure know what youre doing holding me this way  
And Ill go where you lead me  
Anywhere you say  
Youve got me where you want me  
So darling please be kind  
Before you take it all and I  
make that final fall  
  
Youve got to keep in mind Im  
a new fool at an old game  
A kid out of school trying to find my way  
But I dont know the rules teach me how to play  
Im just a new fool at an old game  
  
Maybe Im a dreamer or maybe Im naive  
But when you say you love me I start to believe  
That coal can turn to diamonds  
And this night will never end  
But if it isnt so and I cry when you go  
  
Youve got to understand that  
Im a new fool at an old game  
A kid out of school trying to find my way  
But I dont know the rules teach me how to play  
Im just a new fool at an old game
