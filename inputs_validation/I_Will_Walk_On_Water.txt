Something is coming out of the rain magic  
Its happening again like the last time  
I dont know how it happens but I know what to do  
Coming up from the ground I think its you  
I will walk on the water  
  
You sent me the red sun and the purple sky  
Cirrus clouds and grins  
Atoms of roses  
The power to do anything  
In the chaos of colours  
And the fluttering of wings  
You carry me up  
And Im free again  
  
Dont let anyone tell you  
This is impossible  
What we have here is bigger than fear  
  
I will walk on water  
Dont let anyone tell you  
This is impossible  
Hold on to me  
Believe what you see  
  
I will walk on water
