How sad are we  
And how sad have we been  
Well let you know  
Well let you know  
Oh but only if youre really interested  
  
You wonder how  
Weve stayed alive till now  
Well let you know  
Well let you know  
But only if youre really interested  
  
Were all smiles  
Then honest I swear its the turnstiles  
That make us hostile  
Oh  
  
We will descend  
On anyone unable to defend  
Themselves  
Oh  
  
And the songs we sing  
Theyre not supposed to mean a thing  
La la la la  
  
Oh  
Youre lonely  
Oh youre lonely  
Oh  
Get off the roof  
Oh  
  
Your arsenal  
  
We may seem cold or  
We may even be  
The most depressing people youve ever known  
At heart whats left we sadly know  
That we are the last truly British people youll ever know  
We are the last truly British people you will ever know  
Youll never never want to know
