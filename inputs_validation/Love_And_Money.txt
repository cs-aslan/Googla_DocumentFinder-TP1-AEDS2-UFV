Is it a crisis   
Is it a crime   
Or is it a fantasy   
Does it take time   
Will it cost money   
Will it mean love   
Sure isnt easy  
To get in the mood  
  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha  
  
See you at the parties  
Youre never the same  
Do you make money   
What is your name   
Where can I find you   
Out in the night  
Who are your friends   
Are they dark or light   
  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha  
  
Tell me the dreams you never told anyone  
Gimme a break  
Are you really a virgin whos never loved anyone else   
Or just a fake   
Me I dont know what to think anymore  
Dont know where to start  
To sit here with you and talk about nothing  
Is breaking my heart  
  
Ask me a question   
Gimme a smoke  
What are you drinking   
Is it a joke  
Well aint it worth it   
Or am I depraved   
You hold your head high  
With one foot in the grave  
  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha
