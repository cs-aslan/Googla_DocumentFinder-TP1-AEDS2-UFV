One day Ill always remember  
Was when you walked into my life  
It was a very special night  
When we danced so close so tender  
It gave my heart the second chance  
That Id been waiting for  
  
But our love is falling  
All kinds of pressure has temptation calling  
It gives me fever  
But no matter what I aint gonna leave you  
Im gonna stay till the last day  
Worry no more what is love for  
I hear love knocking honey  
Come on lets open the door  
  
You know youve got me to love  
I can tell you that  
If you should ever need some love  
You just call me back  
Ive been loving you from the start  
Let me tell you that  
And Ill keep loving you from my heart  
Sure can tell you that  
Youve got so much to love  
  
Every time that we kiss  
Im reminded its you I miss  
I just love when we love like this  
I can tell you that  
Please forgive me if I pout  
But my world would turn inside out  
If on leaving me you insist  
Let me tell you that  
  
I start to hold you but you pull back  
not much just a little  
I cant control you  
When you get so caught up in the middle  
First you say yes then you say no  
Said youre gonna stay now youre gonna go  
You know Ill tell you honey  
But I think you already know  
  
I can tell you this  
Anytime you go I really miss you  
Nothing to do tired of my friends  
Wont you come back and love me again  
So I can tell you that  
Youve got me forever girl to love
