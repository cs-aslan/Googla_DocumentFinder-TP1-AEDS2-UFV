Never seen her glowing  
All that bright shes throwing  
Like some aurora  
From her head its growing  
Reaching to the ground and all around  
Like a Navajo blanket  
  
Never heard her singing  
Now shes gently ringing  
Like copper wind chimes  
What on earth is bringing up this stream  
The cat who got the cream is licking her lips  
And smiling like her Cheshire cousin  
She claims shes found a way to make her own light  
All you do is smile you banish the night  
  
She says shes burning with optimisms flames away away  
She says shes burning up all her guilts and shames away away  
She says shes burning with optimisms flames away away  
She says shes burning up  
  
Now you see Im smiling  
Back to juvenileing  
I learnt her lesson  
In like flint and styling  
All the world is neatly curled around my littlest finger  
  
I cant stop this grinning  
So assume Im winning  
Threw pessimism  
In the air its spinning  
Crashing to the floor and nevermore  
Will it lure me away with sweets  
And shiny things just like a magpie  
  
Now every bird and bee just fuel the fire for me  
Now every closing door just fans the flames some more  
  
Now Im thinking okay  
Im turning night into day
