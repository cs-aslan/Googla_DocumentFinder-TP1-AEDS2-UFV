You dont want no problems put yourself in a tight spot  
So you can look but dont touch  
I stay on my toes like the White Sox  
  
Chorus  
It cost me a lot my chain and my watch

If we ever go broke girl then time is all we got  
And you cant make that back no you cant make that back  
So lets ball while we here lets ball while we here  
Like aint no tomorrow like aint no next year  
Drink away all our problems make it rain with no care  
Like I make that back fuck it I make that back  
Nice watch nice watch nice watch

But Im back on track add to the fact that I never really drive sober

Chorus

No more Mr Nice Guy hello Mr Nice Watch  
Only but a matter of time fore I hit yall niggas with a nice shot  
Yall niggas betta not call the law get no blood on my Audemar  
Meaning yall better not waste my time  
When yall ready I take you all to war  
Meanwhile Im just chopping off doors  
Put the front on the back cause Im back and forth  
Put the front on the back of the bach like a boss  
So Im fronting on niggas when Im backing off
