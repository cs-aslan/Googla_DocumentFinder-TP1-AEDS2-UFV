CHORUS  
Boys go and shine up your shoes  
Girls run and powder your nose  
Cause tonight youll be shakin  
From your head down to your toes  
Well feeling youre cool is as good as lookin it  
Thinkin yourre cool is as good as knowin it  
Playin it cool is as good as blowin it  
You know you cant spend a dollar  
If you aint got a dime  
You cant hook a fish if you aint got a line  
You wont catch the bus if youre not there on time  
So go read up your books and sharpen your hooks  
Then all you need is money and a mouth full of honey  
And if you play your cards right after dancin all night  
You wont have to walk home alone  
You wont have to walk home alone  
Boys you can hang loose and slip up real cool  
But if that lady has a love noose  
She might never let you go  
And if you think that maybe youre too young  
And you just can not cope  
The grab a razor sharp pair of cutting shears  
And cut a hole right in the rope  
Snip a hole right in the rope  
Chorus  
Well feeling youre cool is as good as lookin it  
Thinkin yourre cool is as good as knowin it  
Playin it cool is as good as blowin it  
You know you cant spend a dollar  
If you aint got a dime  
You cant hook a fish if you aint got a line  
You wont catch the bus if youre not there on time  
Well if you wake up tomorrow morning  
You cant remember what you did  
Just ring up some of your friends  
And theyll tell you just how low you slid  
Oh dont be ashamed of anything you hear  
After all you cant be blame  
When youre drinking so much beer  
Hey dont you worry  
That what you did just wasnt right  
Just remember brothers and sisters  
After every days another night  
Just remember brothers and sisters  
After every days another night
