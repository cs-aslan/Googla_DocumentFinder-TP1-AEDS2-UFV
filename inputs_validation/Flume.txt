I am my mothers only one  
Its enough  
  
I wear my garment so it shows  
Now you know  
  
Only love is all maroon  
Gluey feathers on a flume  
Sky is womb and shes the moon  
  
I am my mother on the wall with us all  
I move in water shore to shore  
Nothings more  
  
Only love is all maroon  
Lapping lakes like leary loons  
Leaving rope burns  
Reddish ruse  
  
Only love is all maroon  
Gluey feathers on a flume  
Sky is womb and shes the moon
