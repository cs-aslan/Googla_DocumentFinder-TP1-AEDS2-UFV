Shout praises to the holy One  
God makes us strong well see His will be done  
From the highest place He came to save us  
We stand in the power of His name  
Salvations work in our lives proclaim  
Living from the kingdom of hope within us  
Shine Your light be that city of light  
Were gonna shout out loud its time to let it out  
Its your life in me for all to see  
Cause our God reigns always till the end of days  
Were gonna stand strong stand tall  
Cause Jesus Christ is Lord of all  
God colors flowing through my life  
Im not the same now my heart desires  
To see the whole world come to know You  
Ill shine my light be that city of light  
Were gonna shout out loud its time to let it out  
Its your life in me for all to see  
Cause our God reigns always till the end of days  
Were gonna stand strong stand tall  
Cause Jesus Christ is Lord of all  
Shout shout were gonna let it out  
Shout shout were gonna let it out  
Shout shout were gonna shout Jesus is Lord
