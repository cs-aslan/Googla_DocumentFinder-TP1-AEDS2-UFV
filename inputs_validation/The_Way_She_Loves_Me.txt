Ill have this feeling till the day that I die  
When I hear my baby calling  
A simple motion a look in her eyes  
And Im helplessly falling  
Id give all of somebody else  
For any piece of her heart thats left  
She knows me better than I know myself  
  
Chorus  
Let me tell you bout the way she loves me  
Ooh I want the world to know  
Im crazy bout the way she loves me  
Ooh Im proud to let it show yeah yeah yeah  
  
Came close to letting this train pass me by  
Just like a fool second guessing  
I couldve spent my life wondering why  
I didnt cherish the blessing  
If Id have known shed come my way  
The lonely nights would have been okay  
I have her promise that shes gonna stay  
  
Chorus  
  
Nobody else could do me right  
A breath of heaven in my darkest night  
Im gonna hold on with all of my might  
  
Chorus
