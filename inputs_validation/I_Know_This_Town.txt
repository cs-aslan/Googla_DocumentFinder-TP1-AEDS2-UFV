I know these streets and these backyards  
This barn thats falling down  
We come to where theyre building now  
And ride our bikes around  
  
And you think Im just a little kid  
Some troubles on the way  
Well I knew this place before you did  
Is all Ive got to say  
  
Im only walking  
Through these streets and all around  
Im only walking  
I know this town  
  
We come home through these fields at night  
About a million times  
Id walk the road with my eyes closed  
And all the paths besides  
  
And I know the boy who broke this fence  
And I know his brother too  
And theyd never give me half a chance  
If I let on to you  
  
Im only walking  
Through these streets and all around  
Im only walking  
I know this town  
I know this town  
  
We dam the streams we raid the shacks  
And hide in boxcars on the tracks  
We know these quarries in our sleep  
And where theyre cold and where theyre deep  
  
Ill go down to the bowling alley  
And buy smokes and Dentyne  
I find some loose change every day  
Under that Coke machine  
  
You check me out as you drive by  
Like there was some big deal  
Well I know so much youll never find  
From there behind the wheel  
  
Im only walking  
Through these streets and all around  
Im only walking  
I know this town  
I know this town  
I know this town  
I know this town
