Oh no  
Take what you need cause I cant hold my breath  
Say what you feel cause I got nothing left oh  
I made a promise to myself last night  
Im gonna keep it if its wrong or right  
  
Chorus  
And if I lose it all  
Therell be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall  
Cause knowing you are out there breathing  
Its so wonderful its a chance I take even if I break it  
I lose it all if I lose it all  
  
Wouldnt matter anyway  
  
Dont change a thing  
Perfect as you are  
Time has a way  
Time is all Ive got  
If my heart should shatter watching you  
Thatd be one less thing Id have to prove  
  
Chorus  
  
And we will be waiting when I fall into your open arms  
I believe youll find me there  
Youll find me there  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Wouldnt matter anyway
