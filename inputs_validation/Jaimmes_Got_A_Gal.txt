Jaimmes got a girl  
Dont think things are gonna be the same  
He aint coming out and drinking tonight  
Think hes gonna change his name  
We cant work it out  
He aint punching walls anymore  
Im aint gonna wake up now  
Find you on my floor  
A games a game you dont want it being the same  
But you sure aint like you were yesterday  
But go on and try it  
And if its true it just aint my place to say  
But you sure aint like you were yesterday  
Go on and try it  
Phone sure sounds dead  
My pocket sure feel tight  
The things I promised not to do with you today  
I sure need to tonight  
But its all working out  
Just like they said it would be  
You aint gonna fall on my floor  
From now on its just we three
