Whenever the day is bringing you down  
And nothings going your way  
Just turn it around  
Dont let the world upset you  
Get depressed and what doesnt get you  
Youve got a chance to make it  
Reach right out and take it  
Leave your worries behind  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
  
If nothing in life is turning you on  
And everyone of your friends  
All seem to be gone  
Just start yourself a hummin  
Remember that the good times are coming  
Life is a celebration  
Dont waste your invitation  
Hang those tears on the line  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
  
When youre feeling down  
You gotta aim high  
Dont stare at the ground  
Reach for the sky Reach for the sky  
  
Just keep yourself up  
Dont ever complain  
Before you walk in the sun  
You gotta laugh in the rain  
  
Just get your act together  
Be readdy for who and whatever  
Life is a smile so find it  
Put your face behind it  
Get it straigh in your mind  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
  
Just get your act together  
Be readdy for who and whatever  
Life is a smile so find it  
Put your face behind it  
Get it straigh in your mind  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
You gotta make your own sunshine
