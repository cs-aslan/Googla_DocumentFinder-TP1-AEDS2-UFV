A country dance was being held in a garden  
I felt a bump and heard an  
Oh beg your pardon  
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams  
All around a pugnosed dream  
  
The music started and was I the perplexed one  
I held my breath and said  
May I have the next one  
In my frightrnrd arms polka dots and moonbeams  
Sparkled on a pugnosed dream  
  
There were questions in the eyes of other dancers  
As we floated over the floor  
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers  
And perhaps a few things more  
  
Now in a cottage made of lilacs and laughter  
I know the meaning of the words ever after  
And Ill always see polka dots and moonbeams  
When I kiss my pugnosed dream
