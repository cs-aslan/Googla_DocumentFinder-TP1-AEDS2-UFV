Every day Id wake and ask myself  
Was I strong enough for you  
Foolish doubts and fears took me away  
Im sorry now you never knew  
For so long Ive wondered where you are  
Underneath a tapestry of stars  
In my heart I knew youd come again  
I just didnt know where or when  
  
Chorus  
Heaven waits for us  
Through loves open door  
And its brought you back to me once more  
Heart dont fail me now  
Now that you are near  
Love was never far away from here  
I have tried to make some sense of this  
Guess I needed time away  
Once I realized how foolish Ive been  
I couldnt waste another day  
I forgive you with my heart and soul  
And now its time for us to lose control  
Take me in your arms like you did before  
Darling dont talk anymore  
  
Chorus  
Somewhere deep inside I always knew  
That I was meant to spend my life with you  
Youre the only answer to my prayers  
I knew that love would lead us back somewhere  
Through loves open door  
And its brought you back to me once more  
Heart dont fail me now  
Now that you are near  
Love was never far away from here
