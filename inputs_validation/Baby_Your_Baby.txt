All you know it all lovers better heed some advice  
If youre bad to your baby youd better think twice  
Love dont come easy love aint blind  
Youve got to show her you love her morning and night  
Be there for her just to make things right  
Make her believe till there aint a doubt in her mind  
  
Chorus  
Better baby your baby with a love thats strong  
Hold her and tell her youll never do wrong  
Better baby your baby cause if you dont  
One day your babyll be gone  
  
Dont let her get lonely dont make her cry  
Dont take her for granted dont tell her a lie  
Bring her red roses when shes blue  
Give her the best of what youve got to give  
Youll be together as long as you live  
Better baby your baby shell baby you  
  
Chorus
