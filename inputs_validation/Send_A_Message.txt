In a line of fire I stand and wait for you I cant hold out for too long  
Searchin every part of me for a sign Im in the middle of a storm  
I keep hopin keep on dreamin somehow youll get through to me  
  
So I reach across the silence in the air I keep hopin for a sound  
Just a word or two is all I need how can I bring you back around  
Can you hear me can I touch you show me the way to your heart  
  
Send a message send me a message tonight  
Send a message in my dreams you are never out of sight  
Send a message let me stand in your light just send me a message  
  
In my dark and lonely night I look for you wont you save me from myself  
When my senses melt away you will be here and I wont need nobody else  
I cant hold back I wont fight it roll back this stone from my heart  
  
Send a message send me a message tonight  
Send a message in my dreams you are never out of sight  
Send a message let me stand in your light just send me a message  
  
Everything you are Everything you are  
Means everything to me Means everything to me  
I will wait for you I will wait  
Time is all we need Is all  
  
I keep hopin keep on dreamin somehow youll get through to me  
  
Send a message send me a message tonight  
Send a message in my dreams you are never out of sight  
Send a message let me stand in your light just send me a message
