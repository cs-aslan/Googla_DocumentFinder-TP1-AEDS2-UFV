Stay awake dont rest your head  
Dont lie down upon your bed  
While the moon drifts in the skies  
Stay awake dont close your eyes  
Though the world is fast asleep  
Though your pillow soft and deep  
Youre not sleepy as you seem  
Stay awake dont nod and dream  
Stay awake dont nod and dream  
Though the world is fast asleep  
Though your pillows soft and deep  
Youre not sleepy as you seem  
Stay awake dont nod and dream  
Stay awake dont nod and dream
