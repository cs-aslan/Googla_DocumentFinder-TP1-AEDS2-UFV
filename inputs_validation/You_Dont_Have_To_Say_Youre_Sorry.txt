You dont have to say youre sorry  
We all make mistakes Ive made my share Oh  
You dont have to say youre sorry  
I dont need those words to know you care  
  
Explanations arent required even though you think you should  
I dont need to know the reasons No not even if theyre good  
You dont have to say youre sorry But I sure do wish you would  
  
You dont have to say youre sorry  
and thats a silly game that children play oh  
You dont have to say youre sorry no  
No you shouldnt have to live that way  
  
You dont have to say youre sorry  
Cause were both too old its true  
Well they say when you love someone forgiveness is the rule  
You dont have to say youre sorry But I sure do wish you would  
  
Explanations arent required even though you think you should  
I dont need to know the reasons  
No not even if theyre good  
You dont have to say youre sorry  
But I sure do wish you would I wish you would
