It ticks just like a Timex  
It never lets up on you  
Who said life was easy  
The job is never through  
  
Itll run us till were ragged  
Itll harden our hearts  
And love could use a day of rest  
Before we both start falling apart  
  
Chorus  
Pray that its raining on Sunday  
Storming like crazy  
Well hide under the covers all afternoon  
Baby whatever comes Monday  
Can take care of itself  
Cause weve got better things  
That we can do  
When its raining on Sunday  
  
Your love is like religion  
A cross in Mexico  
And your kiss is like the innocence  
Of a prayer nailed to a door  
  
Oh surrender is much sweeter  
When we both let it go  
Let the water wash our bodies clean  
And love wash our souls  
  
And pray that its raining on Sunday  
Storming like crazy  
And well hide under the covers all afternoon  
And baby whatever comes Monday  
Can take care of itself  
Cause weve got better things  
That we can do  
When its raining on Sunday  
  
Pray that its raining on Sunday  
Storming like crazy  
Well hide under the covers all afternoon  
Baby whatever comes Monday  
Can take care of itself  
Cause we got better things  
That we can do  
When its raining on Sunday  
When its raining on Sunday  
When its raining on Sunday  
Let it rain
