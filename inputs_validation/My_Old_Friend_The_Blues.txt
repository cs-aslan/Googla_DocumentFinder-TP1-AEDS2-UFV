Just when every ray of hope was gone  
I should have known that you would come along  
I cant believe I ever doubted you  
My old friend the blues  
  
Another lonely night a nameless town  
If sleep dont take me first youll come around  
Cause I know I can always count on you  
My old friend the blues  
  
Lovers leave and friends will let you down  
But youre the only sure thing that Ive found  
No matter what I do Ill never lose  
My old friend the blues  
  
Just let me hide my weary heart in you  
My old friend the blues
