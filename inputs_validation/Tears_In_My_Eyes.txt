I thought no one could keep us from sharing the rest of our lives  
Like a fool I believed you were true and had no disguise  
Theres a clear blue sky outside and the summer is fine  
But with tears in my eyes Im no longer pretending youre mine  
  
Its the same ugly story of a woman abusing a man  
So I have to forget you though Im not even sure if I can  
Theres a clear blue sky outside and the summer is fine  
But with tears in my eyes Im no longer pretending youre mine
