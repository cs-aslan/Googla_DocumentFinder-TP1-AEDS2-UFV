Ive sung some songs that were lame  
Ive slept with girls on the game  
Ive got my Catholic shame  
Lord Im in purgatory  
Basically its all comeon talk for me  
  
I wasnt me when we met  
You havent lost my respect  
Im here to serve and protect  
What shape of insanity  
Keeps leading you back to me  
  
So put your hands across the water  
Mushroom  
Monsoon  
Come soon  
  
Dont want to piss on your parade  
Im here to make money and get laid  
Yeah Im a star but Ill fade  
If you aint sticking your knives in me  
You will be eventually  
  
To all you Sharons and Michelles  
With all your tales to sell  
Save your meat money well  
Im glad that spending a night with me  
Guaranteed you celebrity  
  
And I cant talk in a crowd  
When Im alone Im too loud  
Youre done your daddys proud  
Thank you for keeping me company  
Youve all been so nice to me  
  
So put your hands across the water  
Mushroom  
Monsoon  
Come soon  
  
Oh Lord  
I feel  
Nothing  
I know much smarter men  
Never got this far  
  
I got too many regrets  
Ive smoked too many cigarettes  
Ive had more blondes than brunettes  
Im not expecting your sympathy  
But its all been too much for me  
  
So put your hands across the water  
Mushroom  
Monsoon  
Come soon
