Ill forget your tender kiss  
Ill be brave after this kiss  
Ill say Hello my darling  
It we should meet again  
  
Youll forbid the tears to slip  
Youll behave bite your lip  
And say Hello my darling  
If we should meet again  
  
If we do meet again  
Our moments cant be sweet again  
Oh my love go my love  
Though its a bitter pill I know my love  
  
Please remember not to sigh  
Over this last goodbye  
Just say Hello my darling  
If we should meet again
