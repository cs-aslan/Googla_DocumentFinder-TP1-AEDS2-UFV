Today I passed you on the street  
And my heart was at your feet  
I cant help it if Im still in love with you  
  
Somebody else stood by your side  
And he looked so satisfied  
I cant help it if Im still in love with you  
  
A memory from the past came slowly stealing  
As I braced your arm and walked so close to you yeah  
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you  
  
I cant help it if Im still in love with you  
I cant help it if Im still in love with you
