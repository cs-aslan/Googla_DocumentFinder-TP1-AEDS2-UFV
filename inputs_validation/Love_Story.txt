We were both young when I first saw you  
I close my eyes and the flashback starts  
Im standing there on a balcony in summer air  
  
See the lights see the party the ball gowns  
See you make your way through the crowd  
And say hello  
  
Little did I know  
That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles  
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet  
And I was crying on the staircase  
Begging you please dont go  
  
And I said  
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone  
Ill be waiting all thats left to do is run  
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess  
Its a love story baby just say yes  
  
So I sneak out to the garden to see you  
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew  
So close your eyes escape this town for a little while  
Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter  
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet  
But you were everything to me I was begging you please dont go  
  
And I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone  
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run  
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess  
Its a love story baby just say yes  
  
Romeo save me theyre trying to tell me how to feel  
This love is difficult but its real  
Dont be afraid well make it out of this mess  
Its a love story baby just say Yes  
  
Oh oh  
  
I got tired of waiting  
Wondering if you were ever coming around  
My faith in you was fading  
When I met you on the outskirts of town  
  
And I said  
Romeo save me Ive been feeling so alone  
I keep waiting for you but you never come  
Is this in my head I dont know what to think  
  
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said  
Marry me Juliet youll never have to be alone  
I love you and thats all I really know  
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress  
Its a love story baby just say yes  
  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
  
Cause we were both young when I first saw you
