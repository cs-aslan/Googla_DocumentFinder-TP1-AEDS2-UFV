What do you do when youre down and out  
Do you sit and sigh and wonder why  
If the answer just comes right to you  
Its letting you know just what to do  
  
Oh your ladys tired of you running around  
And if you dont stop shell put you down  
Says shes got some good to give  
All of her love and affection here  
All you got to do is stop running around  
  
Tell me are you tired  
Tell me are you tired runnin around  
Tell me are you tired running around  
  
Tell me are you tired  
Tell me are you tired playin round town  
Tell me are you tired

Stay at home stay at home  
Stay at home stay at home  
  
Lady says she needs your love  
It just cant come from up above  
She doesnt want to be by herself  
Says she wants you and no one else  
  
Knows you bring home the bread  
Thats half the plan stay and hold her hand  
You being home is surely missed  
All she wants is you to hug and kiss  
  
All you got to do is start stay at home  
  
Tell me are you tired  
Tell me are you tired runnin around

Tell me are you tired runnin around town
