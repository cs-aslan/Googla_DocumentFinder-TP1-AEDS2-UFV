Morning morning give me something  
Open my eyes to a new way  
Wailing sailing wind of wonder  
Carry me cross your dividing line  
Ships in the sky Ive seen em pass by  
Shining bright in the night  
Dont look behind you  
Do I imagine these footsteps behind me  
Cant see with this smog in my face  
Tracy trace your hands they are shaking  
Tell me what you have seen  
Ships in the sky Ive seen em pass by  
Shining bright in the night  
Dont look behind you
