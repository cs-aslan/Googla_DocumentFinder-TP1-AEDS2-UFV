Well its so sad to see all our good qualities  
Gradually slipping away and fading  
And we better act quick because Im getting sick  
Of how much its becoming degrading  
In this age when everythings falling apart  
Disengage dont think Im crazy  
For not wanting to take part  
When morality is defeated  
Compassion is deleted  
All in the name of our desire  
And weve got to be blind  
Or just losing our minds  
If we cant see this worlds on fire  
Weve got to disengage  
Cant you see this age  
Dragging us down  
Down to the ground  
Weve got to disengage  
And I think its sad that our societys gone mad  
Possessed by taking more than we need  
And our motivations a sad situation  
Because its fueled by anger envy and greed
