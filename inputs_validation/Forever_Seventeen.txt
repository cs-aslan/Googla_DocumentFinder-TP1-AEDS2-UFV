Lets be honest youre not flawless  
But youre as close as anything Ive seen  
Youre not the woman that you envisioned  
But your life is not a broken time machine  
No its not that bad  
No its really not that bad  
  
A little midnight chardonnay  
Smooth the edges off the day  
A little taste of Mary Jane  
Makes you feel young again  
All those years around your eyes  
Always take you by surprise  
Youve been living in a dream  
Forever 17  
  
A reckless lover a father figure  
You search for both in every man you meet  
Youre not a mother but sometimes you wonder  
If a son or daughter just might make you feel complete  
But no you dont need someone else  
No its hard enough to learn to love yourself  
  
A little midnight chardonnay  
Smooth the edges off the day  
A little taste of Mary Jane  
Makes you feel young again  
All those years around your eyes  
Always take you by surprise  
Youve been living in a dream  
Forever 17

Forever forever 17
