I bought a brandnew airmobile  
It custommade twas a Flight De Ville  
With a powful motor and some hideaway wings  
Push in on the button and you can hear her sing  
CHORUS  
Now you cant catch me baby you cant catch me  
Cause if you get too close you know Im gone like a cool breeze  
New Jersey Turnpike in the wee wee hours  
I was rollin slowly cause of drizzlin showers  
Here come a flattop he was movin up with me  
Then come wavin by me in a little old soupedup jitney  
I put my foot on my tank and I began to roll  
Moanin siren twas the state patrol  
So I let out my wings and then I blew my horn  
Bye bye New Jersey Ive become airborne  
chorus  
Flyin with my baby last Saturday night  
Not a gray cloud floatin in sight  
Big full moon shinin up above  
Cuddle up honey be my love  
Sweetest little thing Ive ever seen  
Im gonna name you Maybellene  
Flyin on the beam set on flight control  
Radio tuned to rock n roll  
Two three hours passed us by  
Five to two dropped to 505  
Fuel consumption way too fast  
Lets get on home before we run out of gas  
chorus
