The song a robin sings  
Through years of endless springs  
The murmur of a brook at evening tide  
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide  
  
That great symphonic theme  
Thats Stella by starlight  
And not a dream  
My heart and I agree  
Shes everything on Earth to me  
  
The murmur of a brook at evening tide  
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide  
  
That great symphonic theme  
Thats Stella by starlight  
And not a dream  
My heart and I agree  
Shes everything on Earth to me
