So you wanna throw our love away  
So you think we oughta say goodbye  
And you tell me weve run outa time  
Cant make a heart stop on a dime  
You could always walk away  
Like you never saw my face  
If you wanted to  
You could tell yourself a lie  
Say this love aint worth a try  
But you know isnt true  
You heart is tellin you  
  
Chorus  
Whoa We gotta take a stand  
Give our love a fightin chance  
We can talk it over baby  
Woman to man  
Give our love a fightin chance  
A fightin chance  
  
So you think youll wish it all away  
Click your heels and leave it all behind  
But you dont know that in the real world  
You gotta fight to keep love alive  
Theres a battle to be won  
And if bother our hearts are strong  
We can make it through  
So dont turn your back and run  
Cause your hearts under the gun  
Its a case of do or die  
Break down the walls of pride  
  
Chorus
