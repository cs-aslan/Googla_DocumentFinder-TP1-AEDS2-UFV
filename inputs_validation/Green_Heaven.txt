About this planet there is something I know  
Theres a very big difference between above and below  
A friend foe or bro leave your body on the floor  
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow  
Here above land man has laid his plan  
And yes it does include the Ku Klux Klan  
We got a government so twisted and bent  
Bombs tanks and guns is how our money is spent  
We got VD heroin greed and prostitution  
Tension aggravation L Ron Hubbard solution  
Not to mention hardcore chemical pollution  
If you think youre just away youre in a mental institution  
And thats a heart felt shame  
cause everyones crazy everyones the same  
So why should only Larry Curly and Moe be to blame  
Time now to take you to a different place  
Where peace lovin whales flow through liquid outer space  
A groovin and a gliddin as graceful as lace  
A never losing touch with the oceans embrace  
Diviner than the dolphin that there is none  
Cause dolphins justa like to have a lot of fun  
No one tells em how their life is run  
And no one points at them with a gun  
They have a lot of love for every living creature  
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature  
They be movin in schools but everyones the teacher  
Someday mister dolphin I know Im gon to meet you  
Back to the land of the police man  
Where he does whatever he says he can  
Including hating you because youre a Jew  
Or beating black ass thats nothing new  
Trigger happy cops they just like to brawl  
They use guns clubs gas but thats not all  
They got puke ridden prisons and sex sick jails  
Fuck the poor if youre rich you pay the bail  
So support your police support your local wars  
Thats the way to open economic doors  
Why do we do it Cause the presidents a whore  
We assume the position to sell the ammunition  
What the fuck Its the american tradition  
Along with going fishin apple pies in the kitchen  
Isnt it bitchin seeing dead men in ditches
