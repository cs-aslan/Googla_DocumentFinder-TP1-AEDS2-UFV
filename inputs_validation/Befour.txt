Intro  
Ive done this before  
Not like this  
  
Verse 1  
I dont drink to get drunk  
I feel all the right funk  
If theres something I want  
Ill take all the right wrongs  
Now Im gonna stay in my zone  
Im tired of picking that bone  
And I cant be bothered to fight it no more no  
  
PreChorus  
Numb on a roof  
Set it on fire  
Just to give me proof  
Im living on a wire  
Numb on a roof  
Set it on fire  
Just to give me proof  
Im living on a wire  
  
Chorus  
So say what you wanna say what you wanna  
So say what you wanna say what you gotta say now  
So say what you wanna say what you want  
Shame is you wont say that to my face  
  
PostChorus  
Ive done this before  
Not like this not like this  
  
Verse 2  
Time for me to move up  
So many hours have gone  
Heart beats the pump of my blood  
No strings for you to pull on  
Youve got your tongue in your cheek  
So pardon if I dont speak  
Cant tune my chords into your songs no  
  
PreChorus  
Numb on a roof  
Set it on fire  
Just to give me proof  
Im living on a wire  
  
Chorus  
So say what you wanna say what you wanna  
So say what you wanna say what you gotta say now  
So say what you wanna say  
So say what you wanna say what you want  
Shame is you wont say that to my face  
  
PostChorus  
Ive done this before  
Not like this not like this  
  
Chorus  
Flashing lights  
So say what you wanna say what you wanna  
So say what you wanna say what you gotta say now  
So say what you wanna say what you want  
Shame is you wont say that to my face  
So say what you wanna say what you wanna  
So say what you wanna say what you gotta say now  
So say what you wanna say what you want  
Shame is you wont say that to my face  
  
PostChorus  
Ive done this before  
Not like this not like this  
Ive done this before  
Not like this not like this
