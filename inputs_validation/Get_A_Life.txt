Ive been wondering whats eating at your head  
The cheap way you handle things the slander that you spread  
Making misery is the way you spend your time  
I think its safe to say when it comes to truth youre blind  
  
Whatever happened is over now for you  
With you theres nothing that you wouldnt do  
Nothing you wouldnt do  
  
Now its time to get a life you gotta get a life  
Now its time to get a life you gotta get a life gotta get a life  
This is my life  
  
The faces that you show have everyone concerned  
But if they turn their backs to you trust in you  
Theyll learn  
  
Whatever happened is over now for you  
With you theres nothing that you wouldnt do  
Nothing you wouldnt do  
  
Now its time to get a life you gotta get a life  
Now its time to get a life you gotta get a life gotta get a life  
This is my life  
  
Whatever happened is over now for you  
With you theres nothing that you wouldnt do  
Nothing you wouldnt do  
  
Now its time to get a life you gotta get a life  
Now its time to get a life you gotta get a life gotta get a life  
This is my life
