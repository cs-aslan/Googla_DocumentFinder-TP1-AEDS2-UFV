When youre sitting there in your silk upholstered chair  
Talking to those rich folks that you know  
Well I hope you wont see me in my ragged company  
You know that I could never be alone  
Take me down little Susie take me down  
I know you think youre the queen of the underground  
And you can send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flower by the mail  
Send me dead flowers to my wedding  
And I wont forget to put roses on your grave  
Well when youre sitting back in your pink rose Cadillac  
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Days  
Ill be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon  
And another girl can take my pain away  
Take me down little Susie take me down  
I know you think youre the queen of the underground  
And you can send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flower by US mail  
Send me dead flowers to my wedding  
And I wont forget to put roses on your grave  
Take me down little Susie take me down  
I know you think youre the queen of the underground  
And you can send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flower by the US mail  
Send me dead flowers at my wedding  
And I wont forget to put roses on your grave  
No I wont forget to put roses on your grave
