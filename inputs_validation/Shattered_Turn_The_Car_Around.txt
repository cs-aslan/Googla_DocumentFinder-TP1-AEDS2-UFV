In a way I need a change  
From this burnout scene  
Another time another town  
Another everything  
But its always back to you  
  
Stumble out in the night  
From the pouring rain  
Made the block sat and thought  
Theres more I need  
Its always back to you  
  
But Im good without ya  
Yeah Im good without you  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
How many times can I break till I shatter  
Over the line cant define what Im after  
I always turn the car around  
Give me a break let me make my own pattern  
All that it takes is some time but Im shattered  
I always turn the car around  
  
I had no idea that the night  
Would take so damn long  
Took it out on the street  
While the rain still falls  
Push me back to you  
  
But Im good without ya  
Yeah Im good without you  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
How many times can I break till I shatter  
Over the line cant define what Im after  
I always turn the car around  
Give me a break let me make my own pattern  
All that it takes is some time but Im shattered  
I always turn the car around  
  
Give it up give it up baby  
Give it up give it up now  
Now  
  
How many times can I break till I shatter  
Over the line cant define what Im after  
I always turn the car around  
All that I feel is the realness Im faking  
Taking my time but its time that Im wasting  
Always turn the car around  
  
How many times can I break till I shatter  
Over the line cant define what Im after  
I always turn the car around  
  
Dont wanna turn that car around  
I gotta turn this thing around
