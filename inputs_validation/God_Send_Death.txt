God Send Death  
On your back look on to me  
Youll see genocide  
Face from death more than insane  
Profane pleading cries  
Watch you die inside watch you die  
  
God send death end misery  
Preach no love of ministry  
Pray for sin a shattered faith  
Down on your knees  
Your screaming out to die  
  
Death is over due  
Nothing can save you  
A morbid symphony  
Hearing you lie there screaming  
Taking life from you  
Is all I wanna do  
Desire so deranged  
This is what lives inside me  
  
Putrid blood flows through my veins  
To thrive on demise  
Voyeurs lust watching the pain  
Touching you inside  
Bleed you fucking dry  
Bleed on me  
  
Deaths design blood splattered wall  
Face melting one vicious whore  
Twisted figures flesh from bone  
Down on your knees  
Your screaming out  
To die  
  
Death is overdue  
Nothing can save you  
A morbid symphony  
Hearing you lie there screaming  
Taking life from you  
Is all I wanna do  
Desire so deranged  
This is what lives inside me  
  
Clawing at the eyes of god  
You taste your death in hand  
Your fingers bleed in vain  
Your screamin your grave  
Clawing at the eyes of god  
You pierce your throat and hands  
Youve gone insane with pain  
Your blind screaming for your god  
Pathetic god  
  
Deaths design blood splattered wall  
Face melting one vicious whore  
Twisted figures  
Drown your mind in pain
