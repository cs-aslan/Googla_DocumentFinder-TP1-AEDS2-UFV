Do you want me to read your mind  
Oh if I only could  
I wonder if Id find the same  
Hopes Ive been having  
Cause baby I came alive  
When you caught my eye  
Im falling in love you see  
And its the kind of love  
That makes me breathe  
  
I would share all my secrets  
I would tell you anything  
You know Id let you in darling  
We could be so good together  
I would give you the world  
If only you would take it from me  
  
Sometimes love comes quickly  
Sometimes love comes slow  
Lets not miss this momentcause  
Love will come and go  
  
I never thought I could feel  
Such emotion in me  
Im not the kinda girl who falls in love so easily  
Its all so clear to me now  
Aint no shadow of a doubt  
Now I understand what this mystery is all about  
  
I would be there for you baby  
In a special kind of way  
If I only had the say darling  
We could be so good together  
I would give you the world  
Baby will you take it from me  
  
Sometimes love comes quickly  
Sometimes love comes slow  
Lets not miss this momentcause  
Love will come and go  
  
Lets not miss this moment  
Lets not take too long  
I think we both know it  
Our love would be that strong be that strong be that strong  
  
I would be there for you baby  
In a special kind of way  
Cause I love you darling  
We could be so good together  
I would give you the world  
Baby will you take it from me
