Eyes  
Holdin back the tears  
That theyve held for years  
How can I tell you  
I dont want to make you cry  
Why should I even try  
Why should I even try  
Days  
Whered you go so fast  
Finlly lost at last  
How can I tell you  
I dont want to let you down  
Why should I even try  
Why should I even try  
How can I tell you  
I dont want to let you down  
Why should I even try  
Why should I even try
