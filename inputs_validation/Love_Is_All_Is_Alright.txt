chorus  
Love is all is alright  
But you left it a little to late  
Love is all is alright  
But youve got to find a little more hate  
  
Take the man in the white cloak  
A pointed mask to hide his face  
Murders in the name of religion  
If youre not the right colour or race  
Take the man in the black cloak  
Hes holding justice in his hands  
Lets the man in the white cloak go  
Calls it the law of the land  
  
chorus  
Love is all is alrightetc  
  
Take the man in the brown shirt  
A burning hatred in his eyes  
Fired by ignorant reaction  
Fanned by political lies  
Take the man in the blue cap  
His backs against the wall  
Links arms with the man in the brown shirt  
Hes trying to break his own fall  
  
chorus  
Love is all is alrightetc
