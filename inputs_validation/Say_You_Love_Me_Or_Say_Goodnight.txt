Here I come again  
I dont really care to turn back  
Trying to find you directions  
But I seem to be losin track  
  
I believe we ought to make a run for it  
Just to see how far we can go  
I aint just around for the fun of it  
But until you try it baby youll never know so  
  
Say you love me or say goodnight  
Say weve made up or on with the fight  
Cause theres no love lying in the eyes of the night so  
Say you love me or say goodnight  
  
Theres no use hangin on a memory  
No good livin a lie  
I got no use for mediocrity  
You know tonights the night  
We either do it or die
