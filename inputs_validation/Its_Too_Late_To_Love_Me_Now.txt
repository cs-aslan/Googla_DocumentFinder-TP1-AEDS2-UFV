Its too late to say you want me  
But its too late  
Once my love for you was so great  
Its too late to love me now  
Its too bad you say you need me  
Ah its too bad  
And I know the feeling and its so sad  
Its too late to love me now  
Its too late to love me now  
Dontcha you know how hard Ive tried  
Hold out just for you  
Loving you from memory day by day  
Someone came into my life  
And turned my dreams around  
Well hes taking all the love you turned away  
Its too late to say you want me  
But its too late  
Once my love for you was so great  
Its too late to love me now  
Dontcha you know how hard Ive tried  
Hold out just for you  
Loving you from memory day by day  
Someone came into my life  
And turned my dreams around  
Hes taking all the love you turned away  
Its too bad you say you need me  
And its too bad  
And I know the feeling and its so sad  
Its too late to love me now  
Its too late to love me now
