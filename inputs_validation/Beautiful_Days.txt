Refrain  
I see beautiful days with you  
I feel beautiful ways of loving you  
Youve touched my heart so deeply  
And I cant thank God enough  
For all the beautiful days with you  
I feel beautiful ways of loving you  
Everything is just so wonderful  
Every little thing is just so beautiful  
When I spend it with you  
You came along  
In an unexpected time  
It was so divine  
Knowing you are mine  
It feels so right  
When I look into your eyes  
I never knew that love  
Could make me feel this way  
I cant wait for the day  
When I can truly say  
Repeat Refrain  
You  
Woh oh woh  
You  
With you I felt fine  
So right  
Ive sang so many songs in stages  
With thousands of them watching me  
But youre here with me now  
And I sing this song to you  
To you baby  
Just for you  
Just for you  
Repeat Refrain  
You
