1970  
Why is he cussin and callin disgustin  
The city that is now his home  
He never smiles or keeps up with styles  
He is black and he is all alone  
And you ask why hes this way  
Well brother youre too blind to see  
Its cause ellis dee aint free like you and me  
Get out of the street dont get high on my beat  
Go on home the policeman warns  
Just cause youre poor why do you declare war  
I cant help the way that you were born  
Why are they holdin him down  
Hes spending his life on his knees  
cause ellis dee aint free like you and me  
Chorus  
Got to help ellis  
Got to help ellis  
You know we got to help ellis ellis dee  
Try and help ellis you and me  
Got to get to ellis hear his plea  
Try and help ellis get free  
Ellis got hooked he got booked and he shook  
In his cold little shivery cell  
While out on the street in that same funky beat  
Mister pusher was doing well  
And ellis junior cries tears his daddy cant see  
cause ellis dee aint free like you and me  
Chorus  
Got to help ellis  
Got to help ellis  
You know we got to help ellis ellis dee  
Try and help ellis you and me  
Got to get to ellis hear his plea  
Try and help ellis get free  
cause ellis dee aint fee like you and me  
No ellis dee aint free like you and me
