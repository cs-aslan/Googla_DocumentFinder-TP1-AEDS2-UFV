Ive got a long grey mare she wont let me ride  
I got a long grey mare she wont let me ride  
She makes me brush her in the morning  
And put her to bed every night  
  
Long grey mare why cant we be just like before  
Long grey mare why cant we be just like before  
We used to ride so hard  
Until we just couldnt ride no more  
  
Look at me grey mare dont I feed you everyday  
Look at me grey mare dont I feed you everyday  
But when I dig you with my spud  
You turn around the other way
