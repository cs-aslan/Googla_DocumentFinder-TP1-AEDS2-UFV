Oh paddy dear and did you hear  
The news thats going round  
The shamrock is forbid by law  
To grow on Irish ground  
  
Saint Patricks name no more youll hear  
His colors cant be seen  
Theyve gone and passed a law against  
The wearing of the green  
  
Sure I looked to neighbor Tandy  
And he took me by the hand  
And he said hows dear old Ireland  
And how does she stand  
  
Its a most distressful country  
That ever you have seen  
Theyre hanging men and woman  
For the wearing of the green  
  
Repeat first two verses  
Men and women  
For the wearing of the green
