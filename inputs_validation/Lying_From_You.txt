When I pretend  
Everything is what I want it to be  
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see  
When I pretend  
I can forget about the criminal I am  
Stealing second after second just cause I know I can but  
I cant pretend this is the way it will stay Im just  
Trying to bend the truth  
I cant pretend Im who you want me to be  
So Im  
Lying my way from you  
  
no no turning back now  
I want to be pushed aside  
So let me go  
no no turning back now  
Let me take back my life  
Id rather be all alone  
no turning back now  
Anywhere on my own  
Cause I can see  
no no turning back now  
The very worst part of you  
Is me  
  
I remember what they taught to me  
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be  
Remember listening to all of that and this again  
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in  
And now you think this person really is me and Im  
trying to bend the truth  
But the more I push  
The more Im pulling away  
cause Im  
  
Lying my way from you  
  
no no turning back now  
I want to be pushed aside  
So let me go  
no no turning back now  
Let me take back my life  
Id rather be all alone  
no turning back now  
Anywhere on my own  
Cause I can see  
no no turning back now  
The very worst part of you  
The very worst part of you  
Is me  
  
This isnt what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
  
This isnt what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
  
This isnt what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said

Like this  
  
This isnt what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
  
You  
no turning back now  
I want to be pushed aside  
So let me go  
no no turning back now  
Let me take back my life  
Id rather be all alone  
no turning back now  
Anywhere on my own  
Cause I can see  
no no turning back now  
The very worst part of you  
The very worst part of you  
Is me
