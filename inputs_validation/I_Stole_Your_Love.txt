Alright  
I remember the day that we met  
I needed someone you needed someone too yeah  
Spent time taking all you could get  
Even yourself was one thing you never could do oh yeah  
You played with my heart  
You played with my head  
Ive got to laugh when I think  
All the things you said  
Cause I stole your love  
Stole your love  
Aint never gonna let you go  
I stole your love  
Stole your love  
I stole your love  
You never stop running around  
You pick me up and say you want some of me down  
You were the girl that nobody could own  
You stay for a while and then you would leave me alone  
But Im something different  
Aint like the rest  
How does it feel  
To find out your failing your test  
Cause I stole your love  
Stole your love  
Aint never gonna let you go  
I stole your love  
Stole your love  
I stole your love  
Listen I stole your love  
Stole your love  
Aint never gonna let you go  
I stole your love  
Stole your love  
I stole your love  
I stole your love  
Stole your love  
I stole your love  
I stole your love  
Stole your love  
I stole your love come on  
I stole your love
