Well its a rainy night in Paris  
And Im sitting by the Seine  
Its a pleasure to be soaking in the European rain  
Now my bellys full of fancy food and wine  
Oh but in the morning therell be hell to pay  
Somewhere along the line  
In the morning therell be hell hell to pay  
Somewhere along the line  
  
Sweet Virginia cigarette burin in my hand  
Well you used to be a friend of mine but now I understand  
Youve been eating up inside me for some time  
Oh and I know youre gonna get me  
Somewhere along the line  
Well I know youre gonna get me  
Somewhere along the line  
Somewhere along the line  
Well I know its just a matter of time  
Well the fun falls through and the rent comes due  
Somewhere along the line  
  
Well you know I love my woman  
And I would not let her down  
And I did my share of lovin when I used to get around  
Now Im satisfied  
And she is lookin fine  
Oh but you pay for your satisfaction  
Somewhere along the line  
But you pay for your satisfaction  
Somewhere along the line  
  
Hey its good to be a young man  
And to live the way you please  
Yes a young man is the king of evry kingdom that he sees  
But theres an old and feeble man not far behind  
Oh that surely will catch up to him  
Somewhere along the line  
That surely will catch up to him  
Somewhere along the line
