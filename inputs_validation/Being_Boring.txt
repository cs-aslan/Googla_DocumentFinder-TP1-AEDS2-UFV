I came across a cache of old photos  
And invitations to teenage parties  
Dress in white one said with quotations  
From someones wife a famous writer  
In the nineteentwenties  
When youre young you find inspiration  
In anyone whos ever gone  
And opened up a closing door  
She said We were never feeling bored  
  
Cause we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring  
We dressed up and fought then thought Make amends  
And we were never holding back or worried that  
Time would come to an end  
  
When I went I left from the station  
With a haversack and some trepidation  
Someone said If youre not careful  
Youll have nothing left and nothing to care for  
In the nineteenseventies  
But I sat back and looking forward  
My shoes were high and I had scored  
Id bolted through a closing door  
I would never find myself feeling bored  
  
Cause we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring  
We dressed up and fought then thought Make amends  
And we were never holding back or worried that  
Time would come to an end  
We were always hoping that looking back  
You could always rely on a friend  
  
Now I sit with different faces  
In rented rooms and foreign places  
All the people I was kissing  
Some are here and some are missing  
In the nineteennineties  
I never dreamt that I would get to be  
The creature that I always meant to be  
But I thought in spite of dreams  
Youd be sitting somewhere here with me  
  
Cause we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring  
We dressed up and fought then thought Make amends  
And we were never holding back or worried that  
Time would come to an end  
We were always hoping that looking back  
You could always rely on a friend  
  
And we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring  
We dressed up and fought then thought Make amends  
And we were never being boring  
We were never being bored  
Cause we were never being boring  
We were never being bored
