I keep leaning on your love  
 steel   
Its funny how someone depends so heavily on someone elses love to survive  
Ah but thats the way I feel deep down inside of me  
And youre the only reason Im alive  
Baby Im leaning on your love the secret of happiness I found  
And Ill keep leaning on your love oh on your love that makes my world go
round  
The flowers couldnt grow without a falling rain  
Without the sun the world could not go on  
And without your precious love it would all be in vain  
For nothing else would matter with you gone  
Baby Im leaning
