Said Im fallin all over the world  
Said Im fallin  
This love affair  
It isnt all there but its everywhere  
Said Im fallin all over fallin over and over  
But the blue shy oh blue soul  
And love with the tole its taken  
A true crime is the perfect role  
I love every more that I take in  
So much that Id do it again Id do it again  
Said Im fallin all over the world  
Its a breath of air so rare  
Thick as thunder  
Said Im fallin all over  
Every wonder so full of wonder so beautiful  
Theres magic up above  
Every cliche I learn to love  
But as long as these birds have wings  
Then Ill have songs and Ill have words to sing  
Sing of fallin over Im fallin over the whole damn thing  
Said Im fallin all over the world  
Said Im fallin
