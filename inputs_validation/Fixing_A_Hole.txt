Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in  
And stops my mind from wandering  
Where it will go  
  
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door  
And kept my mind from wandering  
Where it will go  
  
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong Im right  
Where I belong Im right  
Where I belong  
  
See the people standing there who disagree and never win  
And wonder why they dont get in my door  
Im painting my room in the colourful way  
  
And when my mind is wandering  
There I will go  
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong Im right  
Where I belong Im right  
Where I belong  
  
Silly people run around they worry me  
And never ask me why they dont get past my door  
Im taking the time for a number of things  
That werent important yesterday  
And I still go  
  
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in  
And stops my mind from wandering  
Where it will go
