Somewhere deep inside somethings got a hold on you  
And its pushing me aside see it stretch on forever  
And I know Im right for the first time in my life  
Thats why I tell you youd better be home soon  
  
Stripping back the coats of lies and deception  
Back to nothingness like a week in the desert  
And I know Im right for the first time in my life  
Thats why I tell you youd better be home soon  
  
So dont say no dont say nothings wrong  
Cause when you get back home maybe Ill be gone oh  
  
It would cause me pain if we were to end it  
But I could start again you can depend on it  
And I know Im right for the first time in my life  
Thats why I tell you youd better be home soon  
Oh thats why I tell you youd better be home soon
