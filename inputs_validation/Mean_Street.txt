At night I walk this stinkin street past the crazies on my block  
And I see the same old faces and I hear that same old talk  
And Im searching for the latest thing a break in this routine  
Im talkin some new kicks ones like you aint never seen  
This is home this is Mean Street  
This is Yesah home the only one I know  
  
An we dont worry bout tomorrow cause were sick of these four walls  
Now what you think is nothin might be somethin after all  
Now you know this aint no through street the end is dead ahead  
The poor folks play for keeps down here theyre the living dead  
  
Come on down Huh Ow down This is to Mean Street  
Theyre dancin now look Out on Mean Street  
Dance baby  
  
Guitar Solo  
  
Its always here and now my friend it aint once upon a time  
Its all over but the shouting I come to take whats mine  
Were searchin for the latest thing a break in this routine  
Talkin some new kicks ones like you aint never seen  
  
This is home Ooh this is Mean Street  
This is Yesah home only one I know  
  
This is home See a gun is real easy  
This is Mean Street in this desperate part of town  
This is home Turns you from hunted into hunter Yeah  
This is Mean Street You go an hunt somebody down  
Wait a minute ah This is home Somebody said Fair warning Lord  
This is Mean Street Lord strike that poor boy down
