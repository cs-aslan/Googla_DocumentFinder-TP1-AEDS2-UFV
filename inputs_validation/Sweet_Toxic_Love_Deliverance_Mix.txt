Oh Lord gimme strength  
Sweet Lord gimme love  
Oh Lord gimme strength  
Sweet Lord gimme love  
  
Im not your lover I wanna be your friend  
But I need something do you comprehend  
It took a long time for this heart to mend  
Theres something wrong with the love you send  
  
Oh give me strength oh Lord above  
I need some of that sweet toxic love  
Sweet toxic love pouring through my veins  
To lift me up to make me insane  
  
Im not your punch bag Im not your floor  
You cant walk on me until you get bored  
Before you break it you must be sure  
That you cant use this love no more  
  
Oh give me strength oh Lord above  
I need some of that sweet toxic love  
Sweet toxic love pouring through my veins  
To lift me up to make me insane  
  
God would have loved you but he never had the chance  
Love it means nothing till its slipping through your hands  
And all the people with their problems and their plans  
Though its nothing new for me and you I still know who I am  
  
Oh give me strength oh Lord above  
I need some of that sweet toxic love  
Sweet toxic love pouring through my veins  
To lift me up to make me insane  
  
Oh Lord gimme stregth  
Sweet Lord gimme love  
Oh Lord gimme strength  
Sweet Lord gimme love
