Oh come all you children  
Dont grab that scabby hand  
It belongs to Mr Sniff and Tell  
It belongs to the candyman  
Dont whore your little bodies  
To the worms of paradise  
Like Everest its fatal  
Its peaks are cold as ice  
Theyre riding on the subways  
Theyre riding on the streets  
Theyll ride you down to the gutters  
Theyll ride you off your feet  
Gonna hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Yeah piss on the icon monsters  
Whose guitars bequeath you pain  
Theyll face you down to their level  
With their addictions and their fast lanes  
Corrupt with shaky visions  
And crack and Coke and alcohol  
Theyre just a bunch of assholes  
With buttholes for their brains  
You cant keep on riding  
The pain you know so well  
Theyll ride you down to the gutter  
And theyll ride you down to Hell  
Gonna hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
And you the master dealer  
May death be on your brow  
May razors slash your mainline  
Im calling you out right now  
May all your vilest nightmares  
Consume your shrunken head  
May the hohohounds of paranoia  
Dance upon your stinking bed  
Dont look at me you fuckhead  
This nations turning blue  
Its stink it fouls the highways  
Its filth it sticks like glue  
Gonna hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Theyll bury you in velvet  
And place you underground  
The hatred of yourself  
And the sufferings that conspire  
To take your little body  
And throw it to the fools  
Only your mind can take you out of this  
Only your mind or death  
Im riding on the subway  
The subway down to Hell  
Ive finished with this journey  
Now I seem to know it well  
Gonna hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City
