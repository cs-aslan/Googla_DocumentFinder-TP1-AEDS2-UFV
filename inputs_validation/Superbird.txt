When I was young no worries in my head  
I used to flap my arms and fly around the bed  
Just like a super bird zoom zoom zoom  
Up and down the chandelier all around the room  
  
When I told the people that I could really fly  
They said that little boys aint supposed to lie  
Poor little super bird sitting on the ground  
No zoom zoom zoom when anyones around  
  
Fly fly fly super bird super bird  
While youre young super bird super bird  
Theres time enough to wreck your dreams  
Have your fun super bird  
  
They said I couldnt so what did I do then  
I cried myself to sleep and never tried again  
Poor little super bird they woke you up too soon  
No Santa Claus or green cheese on the moon  
  
It skipped my mind for years at least until tonight  
When I tucked the kids in bed and I turned out the light  
There at the doorway youll never guess what I heard  
Zoom zoom zoom super bird  
  
Fly fly fly super bird super bird  
While youre young super bird super bird  
Theres time enough to wreck your dreams  
Have your fun super bird
