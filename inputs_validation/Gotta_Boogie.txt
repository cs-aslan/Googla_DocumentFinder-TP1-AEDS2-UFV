Well I went out to a party just the other night  
I was jammin to the music I was feelin alright  
I was burning up the floor like a disco maniac  
When my woman said Baby whys your hand behind you back  
  
Gotta boogie gotta boogie  
I said boogie gotta boogie  
I gotta boogie gotta boogie  
Gotta boogie on my finger and I cant shake it off  
  
I cant pick it off uh uh

So I guess Im gonna have to learn to live with it
