Cause youre a sky  
Cause youre a sky full of stars  
Im going to give you my heart  
Cause youre a sky  
Cause youre a sky full of stars  
And cause you light up the path  
  
I dont care  
Go on and tear me apart  
I dont care if you do  
Cause in a sky  
Cause in a sky full of stars  
I think I saw you  
  
Cause youre a sky  
Cause youre a sky full of stars  
I want to die in your arms  
Cause you get lighter  
The more it gets dark  
Im going to give you my heart  
  
And I dont care  
Go on and tear me apart  
I dont care if you do  
Cause in a sky  
Cause in a sky full of stars  
I think I see you  
I think I see you  
  
Because youre a sky  
Youre a sky full of stars  
  
Such a heavenly view  
Youre such a heavenly view
