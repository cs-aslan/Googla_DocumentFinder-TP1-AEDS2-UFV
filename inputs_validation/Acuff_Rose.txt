Early in the morning sometimes late at night  
Sometimes I get the feeling that everythings alright  
Early in the evening sometimes in the day  
Sometimes I get the feeling everythings okay  
Because everything cuts against the tide  
When youre by my side  
Name me a song that everybody knows  
And Ill bet you it belongs to AcuffRose  
Children in the playground the folks in the home  
Anybody anywhere whos ever been alone  
Because everything cuts against the tide  
When I hear that sound
