Im like a freight train feelin no pain  
I never turn back one track  
Better step aside  
  
Like a shotgun  
Im really someone  
Youll feel my heatwave  
Wont save anyone near to me  
  
Im steel  
So come and try to bend me if you can hah  
I dont feel  
Before you know it its over  
Get out of my way  
Im street walking street walking  
Night stalking Im street walking  
  
No reputation  
You better quick run  
Cause I got no time Ill climb all over you  
  
You need a strong hand  
To be a mean man  
Youve got to think fast  
Ill last longer than you could know  
  
Im steel  
So wont you come and try to bend me if you can  
I dont feel  
Before you know it its over  
Out of my way  
Im street walking  
  
Hey Im a wild cat  
Dont need to prove that  
Im always howlin prowlin  
Stalkin my prey  
  
It could be your night  
To feel the dog bite  
And hear the slashing crashin  
Tearin inside of you  
  
Im steel  
So come and try to break me if you can no way  
Like a wheel  
About to roll you over  
Get out of my way  
Im street walkin street walkin  
No talkin street walking  
Night stalking street walking  
No talkin Im street walkin yeah  
Street walkin street walkin  
Night stalking street walking
