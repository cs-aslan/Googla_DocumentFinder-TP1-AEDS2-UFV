They may talk about you cold when you were  
Headed for the skies  
But you were young and bold and baby didnt that  
Change with a wink of your eye  
Now no ones talkin bout those  
Crazy days gone by  
No one talks about the  
Times you cried  
Oooh Little dreamer  
Oooh Uh little dreamer  
And then they voted you  
Least likely to succeed  
I hadda tell them baby you were armed with  
All youd need  
Seems no ones talkin bout those  
Crazy days gone past  
Werent they amazed when you were  
Really last  
Oooh You are the little dreamer  
Oooh You were the little dreamer yeah yeah  
Yeah they talk about you cold when you were  
Headed for the skies  
But you were young and bold and baby didnt that  
Change with a wink of your eye  
Seems no ones talkin bout the  
Crazy days gone past  
Erent they amazed when you were  
Really last  
Oooh You are the little dreamer  
  
Oooh Little dreamer oh yeah oh  
Oooh Little dreamer  
Oooh Little dreamer
