Catch a train to my place  
Call me when you get into town  
Im gonna meet you at the station oh yeah  
You can tell me why youre feeling down  
  
Is it you mother though she tends to shout a bit  
But shes got her problems too  
And I dont doubt it  
Baby your father  
I know hes always drinking  
Most of the time  
He dont even know what hes doing  
  
Now baby  
Catch a train to my place  
Call me when you get into town  
Gonna meet you at the station  
You can tell me why youre feeling down  
  
I cant imagine  
Why youre feeling so alone  
Its just a week since I saw ya  
Baby why are you crying so  
  
All you got to do is  
Catch a train to my place  
Call me when you get into town  
Im gonna meet you at the station  
You can tell me why youre feeling  
Catch a train to my place  
Call me when you get into town  
Im gonna meet you at the station  
You can tell me why youre feeling  
  
Ah baby why youre feeling down  
Down down down down  
Why dont you come around  
Why dont you catch a train  
The midnight trains all right
