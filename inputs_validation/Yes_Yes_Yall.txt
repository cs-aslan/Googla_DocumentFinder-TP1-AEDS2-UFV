Lot of macoronis here

Lights camera action  
The hiphop attraction  
Fresh Priggy  
John Bliggy  
Player haters been hatin all my playin for years  
Now they seein they worst fears as I bathe in cheers  
Parades and accolades  
All shades and ages  
Its me the outrageous  
My zeal contageous  
The smile inspirator  
Aspen to Grenada  
One of the only mcs to say cheese with Scharwtzenegger  
Everywhere I go they know me  
Planet Hollywood in Paris accidently spilt a drink upon they   
Truth of the matter Ive been loungin  
Livin it up givin it up  
In monopulate surrondings

Verse two  
bout to slay you worst than the first verse  
Packin my purse but yo without one curse  
I survive in rarified air where only few can live  
Thoughts in my brain like that train in the fugitive  
I pledge allegiance to the soul of the game  
Stepped away as Fresh Prince came back with my real name  
A rose by any other still beautifies the room  
So dont get consumed when a brothers known to gloom  
Its amantics but yo its really good to be back  
Never racing the rap just lacing the track  
Not sarendipadee with me it was a plan b  
bout to have an oscar standin next to my grammiesss  
Plural mucho no need to talk though  
Im a just do so  
Im comin at ya with the smoothest slickness  
Behold the style lick of this kickin  
  
Yes yes yall  
And ya dont stop  
Mic check yall  
And ya dont quit  
  
A GQ cover twice  
This brothers nice  
Vanity fair you saw me there  
I discovered life  
Outside of rap got the cream and all that  
But kinda left a void in me  
You cant keep runnin in and out of my life  
Said my mic  
Aight  
Pump your radio you could record  
As they place my welcome mat at the music awards  
Coming throgh America tinted in high beams  
Rose petals at my feet like Im Prince Akeem  
So to all you player haters while yall sayin yall rhyme  
Please stop sayin Jada cause that names mine  
I rocked the Philly fade with the divin waves  
Yes yallin till Im bald like Issac Hayes  
Bad eyes or greys back pain or bad legs  
Im a get better with age trust  
  
Yes yes yall  
And ya dont stop  
Mic check yall  
And ya dont quit
