Up above my head I hear music in the air  
Up above my head theres a melody so bright  
And fair  
I can hear when Im all alone  
Even in those times when I feel all hope is gone  
Up above my head I hear joybells ringing  
Up above my head I hear angels singing  
There must be a God somewhere  
There must be a God somewhere  
  
I hear music in the air  
I hear music everywhere  
There must be a God somewhere  
  
There must be a God somewhere  
There must be a God somewhere  
There must be a God somewhere
