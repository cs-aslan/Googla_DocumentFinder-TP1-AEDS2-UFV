Wild leaves are falling  
Falling to the ground  
Every leaf a moment  
A light upon the crown  
That well all be wearing  
In a time unbound  
And wild leaves are falling  
Falling to the ground  
Every word thats spoken  
Every word decreed  
Every spell thats broken  
Every golden deed  
All the parts were playing  
Binding as the reed  
And wild leaves are falling  
Wild wild leaves  
As the campfires burning  
As the fire ignites  
All the moments turning  
In the stormy bright  
Well enough the churning  
When enough believe  
The coming and the going  
Wild wild leaves  
Wild wild leaves  
Wild wild leaves
