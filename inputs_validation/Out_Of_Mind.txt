Little girl sits in the corner locked in a stare  
Arms waving madly at something that sadly isnt there  
Dressed in the days best by a nurse whos nowhere to be found  
  
What does she see  
Maybe shes looking at me  
  
Old man is strapped to the seat of his chair wearing a gown  
Shouting and cursing at someone who clearly isnt around  
Father Time has twisted his mind  
The staff says Hes not well  
  
To whom does he speak  
Maybe hes speaking to me  
  
So we keep these people inside these walls from society  
Their forgotten lives safe from the crowd they cant leave  
Youve left them there with me  
  
So we keep these people behind these walls from society  
Their forgotten lives safe from the crowd they cant leave  
Through the doors come people like me goodbye to them  
They see a picture few of us see  
They cant leave  
Youve left them there with me
