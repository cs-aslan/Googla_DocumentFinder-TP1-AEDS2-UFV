Desert loving in your eyes all the way  
If I listen to your lies  
Would you say Im a man without conviction  
Im a man who doesnt know  
How to sell a contradiction  
You come and go you come and go  
  
Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon  
You come and go you come and go  
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dreams  
Red gold and green red gold and green  
  
Didnt you hear your wicked words every day  
And you used to be so sweet  
I heard you say that my love was an addiction  
When we cling our love is strong  
When you go youre gone forever  
You string along you string along  
  
Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon  
You come and go you come and go  
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dreams  
Red gold and green red gold and green  
  
Evry day is like survival  
Youre my lover not my rival
