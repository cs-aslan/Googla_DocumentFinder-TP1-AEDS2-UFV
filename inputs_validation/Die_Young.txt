Yell with the wind though the wind wont help you fly at all  
Your backs to the wall  
Then chain the sun and it tears away and it breaks you as you run  
You run you run  
  
Behind the smile theres danger and a promise to be told  
Youll never get old  
Lifes fantasy to be locked away and still to think youre free  
Youre free were free  
  
So live for today  
Tomorrow never comes  
Die young  
  
Die young die young  
Cant you see the writing on the wall  
Die young gonna die young  
Someone stopped the pain  
  
Goto the wind though the wind wont help you fly at all  
Your backs to the wall  
Then chase the sun and it tears away and it breaks you as you run  
You run you run  
  
So live for today  
Tomorrow never comes  
  
Die young young  
Die young die young  
Die young die young young  
Die young die young die young die young die young
