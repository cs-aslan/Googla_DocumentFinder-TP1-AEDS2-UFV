Disengaged were forsaken now communication does suffer  
The moral stare of Big Brother  
Not a chance no compromise  
Battling the barrier of belief  
Not to try anymore  
  
Dont want to murder the only memory or hide  
Try to accept that its all worth whilewhen youve been disengaged  
Severed from any world thats mine  
  
You can hang the blame on the wall  
Itll be a frame around us all deluged by stickers and billboards  
The conversation turns to war  
Never thought it would come down to this it seems every person for themself  
  
Dont want to murder the only memory or hide  
Try to accept that its all worth while when youve been disengaged  
Severed and forsaken  
When youve been disengaged  
Severed from any world thats mine  
  
More and more makes a hunger for less  
You get hurt when you touch the bright lights burningwhen youre high  
You can fall down easy  
  
Too many years spent triggerhappy  
At times I feel betrayed  
I feel that Ive been wronged  
Suspended in all disbelief  
Until it seems it just cant go on
