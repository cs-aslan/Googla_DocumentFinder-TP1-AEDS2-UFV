I got my feelers out  
Pleasure I can give you pain  
Im the demon of misfortune  
Let me tell you that bad luck is my game  
Fires burning make you cold  
You can touch but you cant hold  
Its an even split  
Between zip and the number on your ticket  
Nothing to brag about dragging in the dirt  
Im a nasty piece of work  
  
Down get down on your knees  
Running gonna bring you down  
Im the demon of disorder  
You know Im gonna drive you into the ground  
As youre stepping through the door  
My shadow crawls across your floor  
Your dream of love  
Its not enough its gonna come to nothing  
You aint seen nothing its gonna get worse  
Im nasty nasty  
  
Its an even split  
Between zip and the number on your ticket  
Your dream of love  
Its not enough its gonna come to nothing  
Nothing to brag about dragging in the dirt  
You aint seen nothing its gonna get worse  
Im a nasty piece of work
