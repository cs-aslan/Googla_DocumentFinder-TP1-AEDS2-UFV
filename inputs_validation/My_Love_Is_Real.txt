Dont ya think it was a good thing baby  
Dont ya think we nearly got it right  
We could work to a rhythm baby  
If we come together overnight  
  
My eyes are open and my my heart is  
Ill never ever faulter  
You know my love is real  
Its just my situation  
Cant help the way I feel  
No time for contemplation  
You know my love is real
