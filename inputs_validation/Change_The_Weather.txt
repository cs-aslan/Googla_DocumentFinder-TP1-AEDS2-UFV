Look at these eyes admit that youre killing me but you can never see  
The damage that you do look at this fool in tears on his stupid knees  
You treat me like disease how can I please you Id change the weather  
Id change the weather for you now Id change the weather Id get down  
On my knees and pray for you Id change the weather Id change the  
Weather for you now Id change the weather Id get down on my knees  
Forever and if I could Id kiss you and run away now shut your mouth  
And pray its something that Ill do but Im a fool a magnet to your  
Vicious words to you I look absurd but Im in love with you
