Ive traveled through lots of places  
Seen lots of folks and lots of faces  
Even settled down a time or two  
Ive worked the farms Ive been to town  
Guess you could say Ive been around  
But I aint never seen no one like you  
  
I can tell by your smile you dont believe a word I say  
Youre thinkin Ill just stay awhile then be on my way  
But girl I think its far to warn ya  
Ive done been to California  
I aint never seen no one like you  
  
I knew a girl in Mississippi  
Had twenty different ways to kiss me  
Never found a thing she couldnt do  
Hey I even knew some twins in Denver  
Stayed with them one cold December  
I aint never seen no one like you  
  
I can tell by your smile you dont believe a word I say  
Youre thinkin Ill just stay awhile then be on my way  
But girl I think its far to warn ya  
Ive done been to California  
I aint never seen no one like you  
  
East to west north to south  
Youre the very best girl there aint no doubt  
Im tellin you youre really somethin  
The way you got my heart a jumpin  
I aint never seen no one like you  
  
I can tell by your smile you dont believe a word I say  
Youre thinkin Ill just stay awhile then be on my way  
But girl I think its far to warn ya  
Ive done been to California  
I aint never seen no one like you  
  
Hey girl I think its far to warn ya  
Ive done been to California  
But I aint never seen no one like you  
Ah yeah
