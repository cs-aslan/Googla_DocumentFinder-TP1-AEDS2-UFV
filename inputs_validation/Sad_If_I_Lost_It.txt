Strikes me as an animal  
And now gone kissing  
But soon be missing home  
And waving at waterfalls  
Too strong not to mention  
With tempting extensions unknown  
  
Oh this time I really mean that  
A cracking coat where I dig that  
Oh this time I want to keep it alone  
Oh this time I really trust you  
But it cant belong to anyone  
And Id be so sad if I lost it  
  
And the courage seekers  
Of the aborted logos  
Of declaration nogo are gone  
But Ill keep a light for em  
Hold down the fort for em  
And wear my maroon blazer all the time
