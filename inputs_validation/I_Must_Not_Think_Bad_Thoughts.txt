The facts we hate  
Well never meet walking down the road  
Everybody yelling hurry up hurry up  
But Im waiting for you I must go slow  
I must not think bad thoughts  
  
What is this world coming to  
Both sides are right but both sides are murdered  
I give up why cant they  
I must not think bad thoughts  
  
The civil wars and the uncivilized wars  
Conflagrations leap out of every poor furnace  
The food cooks poorly and everyone goes hungry  
From then on its  
Dog eat dog dog eat body and body eat dog  
I cant go down there I cant understand it  
Im a no good coward  
And an American too a north American that is  
Not a south or a central or a native American  
Oh I must not think bad thoughts  
  
Im guilty of murder of  
Innocent men innocent women innocent children  
Thousands of them  
My planes my guns my money my soul  
My blood on my hands  
Its all my fault  
I must not think bad thoughts  
  
The facts we hate  
Youll never hear us  
I hear the radio its finally gonna play new music  
You know the british invasion  
But what about the  
Minutemen flesheaters DOA big boys and the black flag  
Were the last American bands to get played on the radio  
Please bring the flag please bring the flag  
Glitter disco synthesizer night school  
All the noble savage drum drum drum  
Astronauts go back in time to hang out with the cave people  
Its about time its about space  
Its about some people in the strangest places  
Woody Guthrie sang about BEATS not BEATS  
I must not think bad thoughts  
I must not think bad thoughts  
The facts we hate
