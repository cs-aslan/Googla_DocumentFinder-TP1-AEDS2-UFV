My Body burns  
Like theres a desert deep in me  
A thirsty soul so unsatisfied  
But there you are like a river to the sea  
The one chance I have to change my life  
  
Darlin take my away from here  
Make it seem like were a million miles away  
Another time another place  
Make me a different man  
Move me farther than Ive ever been before  
Show me that theres something more  
  
Sometimes I feel like Im trapped inside myself  
Spinning wheels up and down round and round  
Going no where just like everybody else  
With no touch no sight no sound  
  
But you could take me away from here  
Make it seem like were a million miles away  
Another time another place  
Make me a different man  
Move me farther than Ive ever been before  
Show me that theres something more  
Give me hopes and dreams to fill my head  
Push my heart so I can fly again  
  
Take me away from here  
Make it seem like were a million miles away  
Another time another place  
Make me a different man  
Move me farther than Ive ever been before  
Show me that theres something more  
  
Take me away from here  
Take me away from here  
Take me away from here  
Take me away from here  
Take me away from here
