I thought I heard somebody cry  
I though I heard somebody cry  
I went to see what I could find  
Like flowers in the dead of night  
Like shadows in the moonlight  
I though I heard somebody cry  
A choir with a single voiceA picnic on a cliff  
Antenna like an insectTo pick up all your thoughts  
CHORUS  
It isnt true  
I am not the ghost  
Without a soul    Come  
Listen to my heart  
You feel the beat    Stop  
Listen to the sound  
Of moving feet    Walk  
Through the halls at night  
When Im asleep  
I dont believe   I dont believe  
The shoe is on the other footThe glove is on the fist  
The first is like a cannonballBut it feels like a kiss  
I got a bed thats real softIn a room thats always sad  
I thought I heard a window sigh  
I though I heard somebody cry  
CHORUS  
A choir with a single voicea picnic on a cliff  
Antenna like an insectTo pick up all your thoughts  
I sip the running waterLike rivers from your eyes  
I thought I heard somebody crySomebody might be lost  
I thought I heard somebody crySomebody might be lost  
I thought I heard somebody cryI thought Id go and see  
I thought I heard somebody crySomebody might be me
