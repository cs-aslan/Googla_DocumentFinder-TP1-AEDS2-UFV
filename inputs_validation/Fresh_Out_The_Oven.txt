Jennifer Lopez sings  
Break it off here  
Breakbreak it off there  
  
Now bounce your knees back  
Alternate back and forward  
And if you doing it right  
Your hips will be doing the same thing  
  
Jenifer Lopez  
Now dont tell me that you love me  
Get with this  
You say you stayed forever  
But it dont make sense  
Maybe Im

Cuz if not you aint gonna get none of this

Imma big girl and I know what it is  
Pick me up at 8 yeah dont you wish

Be real you can say who you are  
Everybody say that you doctor at the bar  
  
You gotta look close to find the real superstart  
You won a national  
Open up a jar  
  
Help yourself and take a look in the mirror  
Open up your mouth and stick your tongue down far  
Just a little more okay say ahh
