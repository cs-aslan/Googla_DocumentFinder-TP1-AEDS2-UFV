Mother dont you recognize your son  
Coming home cause I failed you mother  
Ill be there in the morning  
If youll have me back  
The rent up here is much too high  
For a room without a tap  
Ill be early in the morning  
And Ill find my way back home  
Back home bad n ruin  
With my tail between my legs  
Tail between my legs  
And Ill be so tired  
  
Ill be early tomorrow morning  
And Ill fall down off my plane  
Dont be embarrassed mother  
By your ugly wornout son  
Your ugly wornout son  
  
Mother you wont recognize me now  
Mother you wont recognize me now  
Mother you wont recognize me now  
  
And Ill be down on Cannon street  
Passport in my hand  
Should you not recognize me  
Ive heavily madeup my eyes  
Mama you wont recognize me now  
Brother you wont recognize me now  
Sister you wont recognize me now  
Mother you wont recognize me now  
  
So mother when youve seen me  
Dont forget Im your boy too  
I know my brother has done you proud  
Hes one foot in the grave  
Mother dont you recognize me now  
  
Im a burglar in the first degree  
But it dont seem to worry me  
Ill be so tired so tired  
Ill be so tired so tired  
  
So tired
