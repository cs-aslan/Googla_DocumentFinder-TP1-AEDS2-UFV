Verse1  
She wakes up in the morning jumps in the shower  
Then rubs on her lotion while shes wrapped in a towel  
And no music on but she dance till perfection  
I swear the bathrooms the club the ways shes showing love to her reflection  
  
PreChorus  
Every morning I watch her from behind but she dont know  
I pretend that Im asleep but I dont miss her show

My favorite of the day  
Is when she dance in mirror  
Dance in the mirror

Just watch her dance in the mirror

My favorite part of the day  
Is when she dance in the mirror  
Dance in the mirror
