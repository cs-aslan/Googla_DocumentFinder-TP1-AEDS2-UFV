Beatown  
I spoke to your boss this morning  
He asked why you werent home  
I said sir they left without warning  
You wont even get them on the telephone  
  
Theyre in Beatown its a capital city and all roads lead to  
Beatown beatown  
  
I spoke to your owner this lunchtime  
He asked why you werent home  
I said they thought it was hunchtime  
You wont even see them standing on their own  
  
Beatown its a capital city and all roads lead to  
Beatown beatown  
  
He says he wants his money back sir  
He says youre all communists sir  
I said they beat you fair and square sir  
They use the head and not the fist  
  
Beatown beatown
