A distant night bird mocks the sun  
I wake as I have always done  
To freshly scented sycamore  
And cold bare feet on hardwood floor  
My steaming coffee warms my face  
Im disappointed in the taste  
But theres a peace the early brings  
The morning world of growing things  
  
I feel the moments hurry on  
It was today its died away  
And now it is forever gone  
And I will drink my coffee slow  
And I will watch my shadow grow  
And disappear in firelight  
And sleep alone again tonight
