Your figure like your friendship  
Gradually grows and grows  
The clothes that you thought that youd shrunk  
Their size just froze  
  
When the body that you thought of as yours  
Just ups and goes  
Ill be happy with the weight  
Of the partner that I chose  
  
Your quickstep is slower  
But your spirits still out on the floor  
And you can still hack it  
Cause you know what your feet are free for  
And Ill love my dear  
Til you cant tuck it in anymore anymore  
  
Your second grey hair came a month  
After the first  
It didnt make you better  
But it didnt make you feel any worse  
  
Your third grey hair appeared  
With the fourth on your beard  
Your fifth sixth seventh sprouted out  
From your nose and your ears  
  
And Ill love you my partner  
Til you cant hide the grey anymore  
Your distinguished good looks  
Am the ones young girls cannot ignore  
And Ill love you my partner  
Til the grey hairs hairdressers floor hairdressers floor  
  
Your eighth and your ninth and your tenth  
You just looked to the sky  
Like the charge of the Light Brigade  
Was passing you by  
  
Your quickstep is slower  
But your spirits still out on the floor  
When it comes to raw beauty  
Youve a whole whorehouse waiting in store  
Your corset has grown  
Bid youre still always first to the drawer  
  
And Ill love you my partner And Ill love you my partner  
Til the grey hairs the hairdressers floor  
Hairdressers floor hairdressers floor
