Now when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks  
And the night is so black that the darkness cooks  
And you come creeping around making me do things I dont want to do  
Cant believe that she needs my love so bad  
Come sneaking around trying to drive me mad  
Busting in all my dreams making me see things I dont want to see  
  
Cause youre the Green Manalishi with the twopronged crown  
All night dragging us up or youre bringing us down  
Just taking my love and slip away  
Leaving me here trying to keep from following you
