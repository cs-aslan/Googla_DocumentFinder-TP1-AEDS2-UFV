Do You Wanna Hear My Story  
I Know It Wasnt Much Of Glory  
Now I Found Someone To Believe  Its You  
You Took My Life  Colored All My Lonely Days  
And Im So Proud To Hear You Say  
  
For Always And Ever  Take It From My Heart  
Take It From The Start  For Always And Ever  
We Are Strong  Together Now  
  
Love Is A Flowing Of Emotions  
Two Hearts Are Living Through The Motions  
You Will See Nothings Tearing Us Apart  
You Took My Life  Colored All My Lonely Days  
And Im So Proud  To Hear You Say  
  
Love Can Change Your Life Forever  
And You You Give Me Everything  
Everything That I Need
