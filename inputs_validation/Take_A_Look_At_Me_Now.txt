How can I just let you walk away  
Just let you leave without a trace  
When I stand here taking every breath  
With you ooohhh  
Youre the only one who really knew me  
At all  
  
How can you just walk away from me  
When all I can do is watch you leave  
Cause we shared the laughter and the pain  
And even shared the tears  
Youre the only one who really knew me at all  
  
So take a look at me now  
Cuz theres just an empty space  
And theres nothing left here to remind me  
Just the memory of your face  
Just take a look at me now  
Coz theres just an empty space  
And youre coming back to me is against the odds  
And thats a chance Ive got to take  
  
I wish I could just make you turn around  
Turn around and see me cry  
Theres so much I need to say to you  
So many reasons why  
Youre the only one who really knew me at all  
  
So take a look at me now  
Cuz theres just an empty space  
And theres nothing left here to remind me  
Just the memory of your face  
Just take a look at me now  
So theres just an empty space  
But to wait for you is all I can do  
And thats what Ive got to face  
  
Just take a good look at me now  
Cause Ill still be standing here  
Standing here  
And you coming back to me is against all odds  
And thats what Ive got to face  
  
Just Take a look at me now ooh  
Take a look at me now  
Take a look at me now
