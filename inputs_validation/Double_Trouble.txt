Eleven times I been busted eleven times I been to jail  
Some of the times I been there nobody could go my bail  
Well it seems to me lord that this ol boy just dont fit  
Well I can jump in a rosebush and come out smelling like sh  
  
Those misters dressed in blue never done so right by me  
Some of the times I was innocent but the judge said guilty  
Im not one to complain now son I tell you true  
When the black cat cross your trail lord  
It comes in misery times two  
  
Chorus  
Double troublethats what my friends all call me  
double trouble  
I said double trouble  
Trouble  
  
Well I was born down in the gutter  
With a temper as hot as fire  
Spent ninety days on a peat farm just doin the countys time  
Well now even mama said son youre bad news  
And it wont be too long before someone puts one through you
