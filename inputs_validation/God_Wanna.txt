I said God want to fill my heart the devil want to wear my skin  
Time to get the party started everybody jump in you got it  
God want to fill my heart the devil want to wear my skin  
Time to get the party started everybody jump in you got it  
Come on bounce rock skate  
Tune in drop out demotivate  
Renegotiate for the proper rate  
Somethin to push weight have to go up state  
And fuckin jailbait is statutory rape  
And dont you never get your ass caught on tape  
This aint New York there aint no escape  
And Supermans just another pimp in a cape  
And even if both your eyes come up snake  
Its time to get wise rise and cut the cake  
It dont take much for the Earth to quake  
So watch what you clutch when you on the tape  
Im tryna tell you  
God want to fill my heart the devil want to wear my skin  
Time to get the party started everybody jump in you got it  
God want to fill my heart the devil want to wear my skin  
Time to get the party started everybody jump in you got it  
I dont know where Im going I hardly know where Ive been  
The only thing I know for sure the partys bout to begin you got it  
Thousand angels dancing all on the head of a pin  
Some people live in righteousness and some people live in sin you got it  
God want to fill my heart the devil want to wear my skin  
Time to get the party started everybody jump in you got it  
God want to fill my heart the devil want to wear my skin  
Time to get the party started everybody jump in you got it  
Everybody jump in Lord everybody jump in  
Everybody jump in Lord everybody jump in you got it  
Yo Im a pimp Im a thief Im a killer Im a dealer  
Im a Holy man preacher Im a teacher Im a healer  
Im a mover Im a shaker Im a giver Im a taker  
Im a long time bonafide big money maker  
Im a winner Im a loser Im a begger Im a choser  
Im a thug Im a poser Im a chronic drug user  
Ive been rapping Ive been mixing Im fact and then Im fiction  
Im a walkin talkin livin breathin contradiction  
Im working for my God but Im playing with the devil  
Dont act like you can see me cause Im on another level  
Im a mic burner not a trick turner  
Ill act like Ike Turner then Ill treat you like Tina  
God want to fill my heart the devil want to wear my skin  
Time to get the party started everybody jump in you got it  
God want to fill my heart the devil want to take my soul  
Gotti got a broken heart partys gotten out of control you got it
