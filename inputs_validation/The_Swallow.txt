Time goes by  
Seems like the blink of an eye  
Its so crazy  
What can we do  
Its so strange  
Life in the really slow lane  
Take it easy  
Thats what well do  
Just me and you  
In the wide outside  
See the swallow as he glides  
Like a spiral up to freedom  
Were all right  
Maybe get lucky tonight  
Only lovers feel like we do  
We take our time  
Leave all our worries behind  
No more mind games  
Simple and true  
Thats what well do  
In the wide outside  
See the swallow as he glides  
Like a spiral up to freedom  
Time goes by  
Seems like the blink of an eye  
Its so crazy  
What can we do  
Its so strange  
Life in the really slow lane  
Take it easy  
Thats what well do  
Just me and you  
Thats what well do  
Just me and you  
Thats what well do
