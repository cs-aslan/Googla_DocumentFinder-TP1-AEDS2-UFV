If I had my life to live over  
I know just what Id like to be  
A pampered pet of a rich brunette  
Sitting on my mamas knee  
Someone to love me  
Someone to care  
Rubberduck dubble little fingers through my hair  
I need a dogs life  
What a life thats good enough for me  
Thats good enough for me  
  
If I had a bone to be picking  
A picking chicken or a steak  
Curled up there in an easy chair  
Man that wont be hard to take  
Ill always be faithful  
Thats what Id be  
Never bite a hand that feeds me no siree  
Just lead a dogs life  
What a life  
Thats good enough for me  
Thats good enough for me  
  
Id find me a pink little poodle  
And lose my noodle over her  
I chase her round all over town  
Just to ruffle up her fur  
Nuzzle her muzzle  
A hole in her paw  
Greatest case of puppy lovin you ever saw  
Its called a dogs life  
What a life  
Thats good enough for me  
You heard me say it now  
Thats good enough for me  
Thats good enough for me
