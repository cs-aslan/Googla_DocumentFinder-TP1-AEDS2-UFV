Deedle Dee three tots are we  
And were as clever as can be  
We live with Grandma Ida and our dear old Grandpa Ned  
And little Baby Mike the brat  
And dont forget the siamese cat  
And in the attic from Detroit is big fat Uncle Fred  
  
Oh Grandpa wishes he were rich  
And Grandma just complains the bitch  
And Uncle Fred gets drunk while Mike just cries all night and day  
The cat thinks that he owns the place  
He bites and scratches on the face  
Itd be so nice if they just went away away  
Ooh daddle daddle daddle daddle daddle daddle day  
  
Chorus  
The cat is dead the cat is dead  
I went to pat him on the head  
He didnt purr he didnt meow he didnt blink or snip  
He seemed to have a funny smile that made me laugh  
But all the while the tail that used o flip and flap  
Got awful cold and stiff  
We chopped him into tiny bits  
And seasoned him with apple bits  
And with some dust we made a crust and put him in a pie  
Into the oven he did sit until the crust was nice and crisp  
Ill love that little kitty till I die  
Dee die dee didedidedidedidedidedidedi  
  
The cat is dead the cat is dead  
And Mikey too and Uncle Fred  
Expiring oh so suddenly while sipping down some tea  
The tea was hot the tea was hot  
With stricknine and a little spice to  
Cover up the funny taste of our conspiracy  
When Grandpa saw what we had done  
He went straight for his hunting gun  
But we were quick we sole the clip  
The rest is history  
To make sure Grandma wouldnt flea  
We gave her a lobotomy  
And nows shes just as happy as can be  
Dee dee dee deedle deedle deedle deedle deedle deedle dee  
  
Chorus
