Your tasty lips are sweeter than a lollipop  
And every time I kiss you oh I hate to stop  
Keep talkin  
I wrack my brain to find the proper adjective  
A sentimental compliment to give you  
  
Good Good Good thats you thats you  
Nice nice nice thats you thats you  
Fine fine fine thats you thats you

I never went to Eaton University  
Therefore I have a limited vocabulary  
  
And so I use the language that I have on hand  
While making love to you on your veranda  
  
Good Good Good thats you thats you  
Nice nice nice thats you thats you  
Fine fine fine thats you thats you  
  
Good Good Good  
Serweet  
Fine fine fine  
Yum yum yum  
Good Good Good thats you thats you
