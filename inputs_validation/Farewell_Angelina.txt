Farewell Angelina  
The bells of the crown  
Are being stolen by bandits  
I must follow the sound  
The triangle tingles  
And the trumpet play slow  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is on fire  
And I must go  
  
Theres no need for anger  
Theres no need for blame  
Theres nothing to prove  
Evrythings still the same  
Just a table standing empty  
By the edge of the sea  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is trembling  
And I must leave  
  
The jacks and queens  
Have forsaked the courtyard  
Fiftytwo gypsies  
Now file past the guards  
In the space where the deuce  
And the ace once ran wild  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is folding  
Ill see you in a while  
  
See the crosseyed pirates sitting  
Perched in the sun  
Shooting tin cans  
With a sawedoff shotgun  
And the neighbors they clap  
And they cheer with each blast  
Farewell Angelina  
The skys changing color  
And I must leave fast  
  
King Kong little elves  
On the rooftoops they dance  
Valentinotype tangos  
While the makeup mans hands  
Shut the eyes of the dead  
Not to embarrass anyone  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is embarrassed  
And I must be gone  
  
The machine guns are roaring  
The puppets heave rocks  
The fiends nail time bombs  
To the hands of the clocks  
Call me any name you like  
I will never deny it  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is erupting  
I must go where its quiet
