Verse 1 Jesy  
You used to tell me that you loved me once  
What happened what happened  
Where is all of this coming from  
What happened what happened  
You say Im crazy and theres nothing wrong  
Youre lying and you know I know  
Baby what have we become  
What happened  
  
PreChorus Jesy  
We used to never go to bed angry  
But its all we ever do lately  
And youre turning away like you hate me  
Do you hate me do you hate me Oh  
  
Chorus Perrie  
You can take this heart  
Heal it or break it all apart  
No this isnt fair  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here

Do you remember when you loved me once  
What happened what happened  
And youd hold me here just because  
What happened  
  
PreChorus Jade  
We used to never go to bed angry  
But its all we ever do lately  
And youre turning away like you hate me  
Do you hate me do you hate me Oh  
  
Chorus Perrie  
You can take this heart  
Heal it or break it all apart  
No this isnt fair  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here  
  
Bridge Jade  
Love me baby please cause I could still be the only one you need  
The only one close enough to feel you breathe  
Yeah I could still be that place where you run  
Instead of the one that youre running from ooh  
  
Chorus LeighAnne  
You can take this heart  
Heal it or break it all apart

Love me or leave me here
