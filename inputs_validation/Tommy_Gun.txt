Tommy gun  
You aint happy less you got one  
Tommy gun  
Aint gonna shoot the place up  
Just for fun  
Maybe he wants to die for the money  
Maybe he wants to kill for his country  
Whatever he wants hes gonna get it  
  
Tommy gun  
You better strip it down for a customs run  
Tommy gun  
Waiting in the airport till kingdom come  
An we can watch you make it  
On the nine oclock news  
Standing there in palestine lighting the fuse  
Whatever you want youre gonna get it  
  
Tommy gun  
Youll be dead when your war is won  
Tommy gun  
But did you have to gun down everyone  
I can see its kill or be killed  
A nation of destiny has got to be fulfilled  
Whatever you want youre gonna get it  
  
Tommy gun  
You can be a hero in an age of none  
Tommy gun  
Im cutting out your picture from page one  
Im gonna get a jacket just like yours  
An give my false support to your cause  
Whatever you want youre gonna get it  
  
Boats an tanks and planes its your game  
Kings an queens an general learn your name  
I see all the innocents the human sacrifice  
And if death comes so cheap  
Then the same goes for life
