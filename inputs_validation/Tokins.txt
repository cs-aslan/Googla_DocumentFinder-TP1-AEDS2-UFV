Sittin gettin higher in the back of a limousine  
While people all around me  
They are finding it harder to dream  
Impossible people seen only in nightmares  
Are beginning to make it real  
And disorder keeps fadin  
The times they are changin  
Well I wish I was behind the wheel  
So I could live it just a little bit longer  
Do my best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know its gonna change  
Weve got to live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know its gonna change  
Well time and time and time again  
Ive been stuck out in the rain  
But life has been so doggone sweet  
Theres no reason to complain  
But the time has come for all to be one  
Yes we can talk about it now  
And from the middle of the mess  
Here comes one more guess  
And I know its gonna work somehow  
If we can live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know its gonna change  
Weve got to live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know its gonna change  
Cause weve gotta live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know its gonna change  
Weve got to live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know its gonna change  
Now who would ever believe it could happen  
Right here in my hometown  
Especially when its so far north  
Of the MasonDixon line  
But some of the people they just wont forget  
While others slip into regret  
And if things keep goin the way theyre goin  
I just might get killed yet  
But I wanna live it just a little bit longer  
Do my best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know its gonna change  
Weve got to live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know its gonna change  
And in a while I know its gonna change  
And in a while I know its gonna change
