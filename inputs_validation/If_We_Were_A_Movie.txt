Uh oh there you go again talking cinematic  
Yeah you Youre charming got everybody star struck  
I know how you always seem to go  
For the obvious instead of me but get a ticket and youll see  
  
If we were a movie youd be the right guy  
And Id be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end wed be laughing watching the sunset  
Fade to black show the names play the happy song yeah  
  
Yeah yeah when you call me I can hear it in your voice  
Oh sure Wanna see me and tell me all about her  
La la Ill be acting through my tears  
Guess youll never know that I should win an Oscar for the scene Im in  
  
If we were a movie youd be the right guy  
And Id be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end wed be laughing watching the sunset  
Fade to black show the names play the happy song  
  
Wish I could tell you theres a twist some kind of hero in disguise  
And were together its for real now playing  
Wish I could tell you theres a kiss like something more than in my mind  
I see it could be amazing  
Could be amazing  
  
If we were a movie youd be the right guy  
And Id be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end wed be laughing watching the sunset  
Fade to black show the names play the happy song  
  
If we were a movie youd be the right guy  
And Id be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end wed be laughing watching the sunset  
Fade to black show the names play the happy song  
  
If we were a movie youd be the right guy  
And Id be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end wed be laughing watching the sunset  
Fade to black show the names play the happy song
