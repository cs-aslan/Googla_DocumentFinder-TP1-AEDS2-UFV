I feel like I want to break out of the house  
My heart is apumping Ive got sand in my mouth  
I feel like Im heading up to a cardiac arrest  
I want to scream in the night I want a manifest  
  
Ive got that wide awake giveandtake five oclockinthemorning feeling  
Ive got the hots for the sluts in the well thumbed pages of a magazine  
I want to drive want to fly like I do in the dreams Ive never really been in  
I want to hump want to jump want to heat up cool down in a dream machine  
  
Im dreaming from the waist on down  
Im dreaming but I feel tired and bound  
Im dreaming of a day when a cold shower helps my health  
Im dreaming dreaming  of the day I can control myself  
Day I can control myself  
  
Sound like a priest and then Im shooting dice  
Im burning tires with some guy whose hair is turning white  
I know the girls that I pass they just aint impressed  
Im too old to give up but too young to rest  
  
Ive got that numbtoathumb overdubbed  
Feeling social when the world is sleeping  
The plot starts to thicken then I sicken and I feel Im cemented down  
Im so juiced that the whorey ladys sad sad story has me quietly weeping  
But here comes the morning  
Here comes the yawning demented clown  
  
Im dreamingbut I know its all hot air  
Im dreamingIll get back to that rocking chair  
Im dreamingof the day I can share the wealth  
Im dreamingdreaming  of the day I can control myself  
Day I can control myself  
Hey hey  
The day I can control myself
