When I think of home I think of a place  
Where theres love overflowing  
I wish I were home I wish I was back there  
With the things Ive been knowin  
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning  
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning  
Sprinkling the sea  
Makes it all clean  
  
Maybe theres a way for me to go back  
Now that I have some direction  
It would sure be nice to back home  
Where theres love and affection  
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up  
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up  
Time be my friend  
Let me start again  
  
Suddenly my worlds gone and changed its face  
But I still know where Im goin  
I have had my mind spun around in space  
And yet Ive watched it growin  
If youre listening God please dont make it hard to know  
If we should believe the things that we see  
Tell us should we run away should we try and stay  
Or is better just to let things be  
  
Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy  
But its taught me to love so its real to me  
And Ive learned that we must look inside our hearts to find  
A world full of love like yours and mine  
Like home
