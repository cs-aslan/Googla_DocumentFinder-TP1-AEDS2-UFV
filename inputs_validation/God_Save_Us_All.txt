We need a leader  
We cant seem to help ourselves  
Fighting and lying  
We cant seem to let it go  
We live each day  
On a small piece of borrowed time  
Why arent we trying  
To enjoy this crazy ride  
What are we gonna do about it   
  
God save us all  
God save us all  
God save us all  
If we really try  
Maybe we can make it  
  
We need a teacher  
We must learn to see the light  
Lets get together  
This world needs us to do right  
Theres too much poverty sickness  
Theres pain and strife  
Why arent we trying  
To improve this thing called life  
What are we gonna do about it   
  
God save us all  
God save us all  
God save us all  
If we really try  
Maybe we can make it
