A thousand kisses flying home to you  
A thousand kisses two thousand miles from view  
My root love  
  
A hotel room dont make it  
When Im thinkin about your face  
Cheap experience dont shake it  
Thinkin about my place  
Root love root love  
  
And that Harveys bangin walls again  
And the paint jobs wearin thin  
Got to feelin mean again  
Like momma drinkin gin  
Root love  
  
The bar looks so invitin  
Maybe one more Fanny Mae  
Maybe one more happy hour  
And another day away  
From root love  
  
Little boy blue lost again  
Tellin others sorry tales  
Just one more sinkin sunrise  
And two more crimson sails  
And root love  
  
Well a hotel just dont make it  
When Im thinkin about your face  
Cheap experience dont shake it  
And Im thinkin about my place  
Root love  
  
A thousand kisses root love
