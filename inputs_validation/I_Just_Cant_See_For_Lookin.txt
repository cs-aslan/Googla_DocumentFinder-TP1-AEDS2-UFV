Maybe I talk too much  
Maybe Ive lost m touch  
I guess I dont know whats cookin  
Cause I just cant see for lookin  
  
Other boys have their chicks  
Two three four five or six  
I dont seem to get a bookin  
Cause I just cant see for lookin  
  
Im kinda crazy  
Like a daisy  
Up that well known tree poor me  
Im sittin hopin  
  
Horoscopin  
Wont some sista take a chance with me  
Ive been around the town  
Everyone brings me down  
  
I give up hope Im just a dope  
There aint no gals for hookin  
I just cant see for lookin  
Ive been around the town
