You are naked  
Standing at the other end of this  
Poison arrow  
I am William tell  
And you are the girl with the golden apple  
And you are hungry to be swept off your feet  
You wanna do this out in the open  
But my aim is often weak  
And you fear my shoulders sloping  
Your split ends will end up falling anyway  
Before the weight of the apple world  
Gets to turn them all grey  
And your eyes they need  
Calming down  
  
Well you are wise  
And you are free  
To let the apple touch the ground  
Or keep it standing tall  
Cause this wont hurt at all  
  
You are half asleep  
Youre half of a girl  
And half of a child  
Maybe five feet deep  
Youre as tall as the world  
Up to your eyes  
And youve been hogging all the sheets  
Often balling them up  
Even drawing a line  
And spending half of your time  
Deciding to roll over  
When you do  
  
Ill be there with a smile  
Expanding far and wide  
And I pull you in much closer  
In my dreams you are queen of the ball  
And sometimes you off my head  
Well to me its a happy ending  
For you Id fall  
Cause that wouldnt hurt at all  
Not at all  
  
While this woman is sleeping here  
I tell her what I cant if I were to wake her  
Powerful but hardly will she ever hear the  
The secrets Ive saved up  
  
Well you are famous indeed  
For all your shyness  
Aint that sweet  
Aint this a fine mess  
Were in so deep  
I mustve got lost in the process  
Just let things be easy  
And an honest boy youve made me  
Because the solice that you gave me  
Was proven problems aint the main thing to fall apart  
The archers sloping shoulders  
Well any storys tale is tall  
Thus reminding love is allegorical  
I mean the goal here after all  
Is not to hurt at all
