I remember when we used to walk together  
Used to talk together go to the park together  
In all kinds of weather we would share  
This common pleasure with most of human kinds  
It was a kind of treasure One that I was surely glad to find  
But I got one right here and Im okay  
Im okay and youre okay and were okay  
Im alright Everything else is alright sometimes  
  
Just remember those bones they get broken  
And love is not a token of affection  
Its not even a real thing its a word  
So dont you try to but it out with a ring  
Cause its a verb to love someone  
Open up and let them in  
Just dont be afraid to set them free again  
  
This aint no heaven aint no hell  aint no in between  
Cause theres just too many faces and places in this world  
That I aint ever seen  
Im gonna keep on keeping on  
Im gonna reap on being strong  
I got my head on though misconnected  
Its alright cause I do it protected  
I got a day job I drive a cheap ride  
Sounds like Im gonna fine  
You only get one life to learn  
Theres only so many brain cells that you can burn  
And life can take a turn and take away that youve earned  
And leave you yearning for more so much more  
Life is gonna leave you yearning for more more more  
Your stomachs gonna be churning  
Wanting more youre wanting wanting some more  
Youre wanting some more more more  
Do you want some  
  
Well I got some right here and Im okay  
Im okay and youre okay  
Ha ha were okay  
Everything else will be fine sometimes  
Guess what Im doing okay
