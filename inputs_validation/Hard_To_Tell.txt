Ive had enough Im tired of waiting  
The time has come to pass  
Why do you do what you do to me  
Why cant you say what you want to say  
  
Is it not worth investigating  
I thought id been harassed  
Why do you go if you want to stay  
How will I know what you mean to say  
Undoubtedly Im all over you  
  
Chorus  
Its not that easy baby  
Its not that hard to tell  
Its not that easy baby  
Life is hell but Im doing fine  
Its hard to tell  
  
Im not good at contemplating  
The odds are it wont last  
Why do you do what you do to me  
When will I hear what I want to hear  
  
Been so long anticipating  
You put me to the test  
Why wont you say what you want to say  
How will I know if you mean to stay  
Undeniably Im all over you  
  
Chorus  
  
Well now preside to file  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Its hard to tell  
I do it well  
Its hard to tell  
Hard to tell
