Whipcrack stings the sky  
Dont mess with me Im danger  
The meanest one alive  
  
Earthquake breaks the Richter scale  
The more that you resist  
The more pain youll feel  
  
Im blazing on to glory  
Theres thunder in my veins  
And nothing stands before me  
Forever Ill remain  
  
Hard as iron  
Sharp as steel  
Stop for no man  
You better beg and kneel  
  
Untouched cold as ice  
Ill turn your blood to water  
Strangle in my vice  
  
Shock waves bones to dust  
Youre messin with a mine field  
So expect the worst  
  
Im blazing on to glory  
Theres thunder in my veins  
And nothing stands before me  
Forever Ill remain  
  
Hard as iron  
Sharp as steel  
Stop for no man  
You better beg and kneel  
  
As I destroy last thing youll hear me cry  
Is victory is victory  
  
Im blazing on to glory  
Theres thunder in my veins  
And nothing stands before me  
Forever Ill remain  
  
Hard as iron  
Sharp as steel  
Stop for no man  
You better beg and kneel
