Linda Lou honest true  
Im just wild about your lovely eyes of blue  
For your smile Id walk miles  
For my honey child Im glad to be with you  
  
As long as you are by my side I have no cause to pine  
I point you out with so much pride  
And tell the world youre mine  
Linda Lou honest true  
Im in love with you alone sweet Linda Lou  
  
Ive waited a long time for you darlin  
But never knew exactly what youd be  
Now that you have come to me my darlin  
Youre a wee bit of heaven to me  
  
Linda Lou honest true  
Youre the first in every thought I have today  
Youre so sweet and so neat  
That I thank the LORD for sending you my way  
  
Some day youll know the way I feel deep down within your heart  
To be with you when shadows steal and know well never part  
Linda Lou honest true  
Im in love with you alone sweet Linda Lou
