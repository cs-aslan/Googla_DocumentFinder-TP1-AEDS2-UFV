Hey heythe clouds are whey  
Theres straw for the donkeys  
And the innocents can all sleep safely  
All sleep safely  
  
My my sun is pie  
Theres fodder for the cannons  
And the guilty ones can all sleep safely  
All sleep safely  
  
And all the world is football shaped  
Its just for me to kick in space  
And I can see hear smell touch taste  
And Ive got one two three four five senses working overtime  
Trying to take this all in  
Ive got one two three four five senses working overtime  
Trying to taste the difference tween the lemons and limes  
The pain and the pleasure and  
The church bells softly chime  
  
Hey hey night fights day  
Theres food for the thinkers  
And the innocents can all live slowly  
All live slowly  
My my the sky will cry  
Jewels for the thirsty and the guilty ones can  
All die slowly all die slowly  
And all the world is biscuit shaped  
Its just for me to feed my face  
And I can seehear smell touch taste  
And Ive got one twothree four five sense working overtime  
Trying to take this all in  
Ive got one two three four five senses working overtime  
Trying to taste the difference tween the lemons and limes  
The pain and the pleasure and the church bells softly chime  
  
And birds might fall from black skies  
And bullies might give you black eyes  
And buses might skid on black ice  
But to me its very very beautiful Englands glory  
Beautiful a striking beauty  
And all the world is football  shaped  
Its just for me to kick in space  
And I can see hear smell touch taste   
And Ive got onetwothreefourfive senses working overtime  
Trying to take this all in  
Ive got onetwothree fourfive senses working overtime  
Try to tell the difference tween the goods and crimes  
Dirt or treasure and theres  
One two three fourfive senses working overtime  
Trying to take this all in  
Ive got one two three four five senses working overtime  
Trying to taste the difference tween the lemons and limes  
The pain and the pleasure and the church bells softly chime
