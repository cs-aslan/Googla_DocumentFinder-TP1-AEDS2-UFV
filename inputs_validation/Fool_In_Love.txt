Mama I found a man  
Who loves me and understands  
Papa hes quite a man  
He adores me hes my biggest fan  
And dont get me wrong  
I know hes not perfect in your eyes  
But somehow hes flawless in mine  
  
And you may tell me to run run now  
But I cant do that  
Were too far down the hole  
Hes got a hold on my soul  
  
So I guess Im a fool  
Im a fool in love  
But Im willing to stay here  
And bask in the glory of his heart  
I guess Im a fool in love  
But Im willing to look so stupid  
Till I had enough  
  
Mama dont judge me now  
Im not trying to hurt you  
I know this wont make you proud  
Papa did I let you down  
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out  
  
Youll see a monster  
I see a smile  
You say its danger  
And Im in denial  
But somehow I feel so safe right now  
  
So I guess Im a fool  
Im a fool in love  
But Im willing to stay here  
And bask in the glory of his heart  
I guess Im a fool in love  
But Im willing to look so stupid  
Till I had enough
