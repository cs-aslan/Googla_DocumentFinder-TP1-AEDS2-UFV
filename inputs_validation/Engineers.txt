All that we are  
Is all that we need to be  
All that we know  
Is you and machinery  
Were engineers  
  
We are your heartbeat  
We are your night life  
We are your lowline  
We keep you alive for now  
Were engineers  
  
We are your voice  
We are your blood flow  
We are your eyes  
Were all you need to know  
Were engineers  
  
All that we are  
Is all that youd love to be  
All that we know  
Is hate and machinery  
Were engineers
