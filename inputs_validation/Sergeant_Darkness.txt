Thank the morning for bringing you  
Hope you never turn your head and run  
And thank the sun for shining too  
Hope the darkness never comes again  
What it does to me  
Isnt good to see  
  
You say that fortune brought you  
Sailin cross the sea  
I dont believe you  
I dont see how its true  
I think my dreamin brought you here  
And if I wake tomorrow will you still be near  
  
Once a miser twice a son  
Threes a devil fours a lot of fun  
Fun for living one and all  
Start a battle whos the first to fall  
Hope it isnt me  
Have to wait and see  
  
You say that fortune brought you  
Sailin cross the sea  
I dont believe you  
I dont see how its true  
I think my dreamin brought you here  
If I wake tomorrow will you still be near  
Should I live with rain and then the sky will clear
