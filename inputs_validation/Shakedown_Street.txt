You tell me this town aint got no heart well well well you can never
tell  
The sunny side of the street is dark well well well you can never tell  
Maybe thats cause its midnight in the dark of the moon besides  
  
Maybe the dark is from your eyes maybe the dark is from your eyes Repeat
x3  
You know you got such dark eyes  
  
Nothin shakin on shakedown street used to be the heart of town  
Dont tell me this town aint got no heart you just gotta poke around  
  
You think youve seen this town clear through  
Well well well you can never tell  
Nothin here that could intrest you well well well you can never tell  
Its not because you missed out on the thing that we had to start  
  
Maybe you had too much too fast maybe you had too much too fast Repeat x3  
Or just over played your part  
  
Nothin shakin on shakedown street used to be the heart of town  
Dont tell me this town aint got no heart you just gotta poke around  
  
Since im passing your way today well well well you can never tell  
I just stopped in cause i want to say well well well you can never tell  
I recall your darkness when it crackled like a thundercloud  
  
Dont tell me this town aint got no heart Repeat x6  
When i can hear it beat out loud  
  
Nothin shakin on shakedown street used to be the heart of town  
Dont tell me this town aint got no heart you just gotta poke around
