It wasnt it more than a minute  
That first one was the test  
He was listening but I dont think he heard the rest  
It was easy to fall but not easy to take a stand  
With the sound of her voice or the touch of her hand  
  
Everyones heard the reasons why  
A kid would let the poison creep inside  
He said he wasnt scared but you know he lied  
The way some people die  
  
He doesnt think of tomorrow  
And he seldom looks back  
When he did he saw failure  
And a future so black  
So he sees himself through sad eyes  
That have never caught the look of love  
Hell never see what hes giving up  
  
Everyones heard the reasons why  
A kid would let the poison creep inside  
He said he wasnt scared but you know he lied  
The way some people die  
  
You might think hes a victim  
He just thinks its a guess  
Its not the question its who you ask  
And the boats fly on Friday  
And youre never gonna see him again  
It wasnt love that did him in  
  
Everyones heard the reasons why  
A kid would let the poison creep inside  
He said he wasnt scared but you know he lied  
The way some people die
