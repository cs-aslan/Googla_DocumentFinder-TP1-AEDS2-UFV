If you want to know how  
To fly high then go now  
To the place where all the concubines  
  
Meet and converse with them  
Marvel at their pale skin  
Wonder how they chew on their pointy  
  
Teeth and hair are beauty  
They know its their duty  
To be countess in their hearts and their  
  
Minds that have to whisper  
See in them a sister  
Look into their eyes and youll become  
  
Transylvanian Concubine  
You know what flows here like wine  
Stay here with us its just time  
Transylvanian Concubine  
  
Sorrow is their master  
Cackling with laughter  
Now hes having just one piece of  
  
Cakey is their makeup  
Catholics try to shake up  
All the things that form their lives but theyre  
  
Dead their sighs their songs  
They know what they do is wrong  
Stay here with us its just time  
Transylvanian Concubine  
  
Candelabras lighted  
Satan has been sighted  
Never has there been an evening like  
  
This is what they wanted  
Always to feel hunted  
You can never be too rich or too  
  
Thin The blood has run out  
Fangs ruin any cute pout  
Morning has come now theyve flown  
What have you learned from what has been shown
