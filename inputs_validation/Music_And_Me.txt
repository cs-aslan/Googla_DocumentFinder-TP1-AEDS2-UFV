Weve been together for such a long time now  
Music music and me  
Dont care wether all our songs rhyme  
Now music music and me  
  
Only know wherever I go  
Were as close as two friends can be  
There have been others  
But never two lovers  
Like music music and me  
  
Grab a song and come along  
You can sing your melody  
In your mind you will find  
A world of sweet harmony  
  
Birds of a feather will fly together  
Now music music and me  
Music and me
