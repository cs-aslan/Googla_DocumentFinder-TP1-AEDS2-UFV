Any day now youll call me up on the phone  
Say you love me more than you ever did before  
  
Its all that I can do right now  
To make it up to you somehow  
And meet you on the other side of home  
  
Take no prisoners here in this knockdown dragout war  
That were waging on each other forever more  
  
Its all that I can do right now  
To make it up to you somehow  
And meet you on the other side of home  
Say you love me now
