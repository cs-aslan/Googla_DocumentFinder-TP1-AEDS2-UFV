They look down  
At the ground  
Missing  
But I never go in now  
  
Im looking at the Big Sky  
Im looking at the Big Sky now  
Im looking at the Big Sky  
You never really understood me  
You never really tried  
  
That cloud that cloud  
Looks like Ireland  
Cmon and blow it a kiss now  
But quick  
  
Cause its changing in the Big Sky  
Its changing in the Big Sky now  
Were looking at the Big Sky  
You never understood me  
You never really tried  
  
This cloud this cloud  
Says Noah  
Cmon and build me an Ark  
And if youre coming jump  
Cause  
  
Were leaving with the Big Sky  
Were leaving with the Big Sky  
And we pause for the jets  
hup hupin the Big Sky  
  
You want my reply  
What was the question  
I was looking at the Big Sky  
  
Tell em sisters  
  
Rolling over like a great big cloud  
Rolling over with the Big Sky  
Rolling over like a great big cloud  
Rolling over with the Big Sky
