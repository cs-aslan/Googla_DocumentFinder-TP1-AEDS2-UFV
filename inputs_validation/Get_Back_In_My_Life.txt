You are relentless I am defenseless  
Why did you knock me down tonight  
You beat me senseless I just dont get this  
How many times do I have to try  
  
Your whisper so clear  
The world disappears  
As I fall into the darkness  
Its impossible to express  
How good it feels  
Im wrapped up Im sealed  
So tight Ill never be free  
Im not gonna fight the feeling  
  
Get back in my life  
Come knock on my door  
What Im looking for I think you should know  
You started a fire burned me to the floor  
Please dont resist anymore  
Ill never leave you alone  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
  
You reprimand me youre so demanding  
But Ive got time I dont mind at all  
Youre picture perfect completely worth it  
Youve got my back against the wall  
  
Your whisper so clear  
The world disappears  
As I fall into the darkness  
Impossible to express  
How good it feels  
Im wrapped up Im sealed  
So tight Ill never be free yea  
Im not gonna fight the feeling  
  
Get back in my life  
Come knock on my door  
What Im looking for I think you should know  
You started a fire burned me to the floor  
Please dont resist anymore  
Ill never leave you alone  
  
Can you feel me coming  
Im screaming searching calling  
Paranoid  
Cause Im always coming back to you  
Coming back to you  
And you know how much I missed it  
And you know I cant resist it  
See your lips and just come running  
Right on back to you right on back to you  
  
Get back in my life come knock on my door  
What Im looking for I think you should know  
You started a fire burned me to the floor  
I cant do this anymore  
Ill never leave you alone  
  
Get back in my life
