It doesnt take a mathematician  
To add a simple sum  
Either you are simply beautiful  
Or I am simply dumb  
  
Dumb dumb dumb  
  
It doesnt take Robert The Bruce  
To see the web youve spun  
Either you are simply beautiful  
Or I am simply dumb  
  
Dumb dumb dumb  
  
It doesnt take a Labrador  
To show a blind man sun  
Either you are simply beautiful  
Or I am simply dumb  
  
Dumb dumb dumb  
  
The sun the sky the moon the stars  
Jupiter Neptune and Mars  
All these things I clearly see  
It dont take a telescope for you to love me  
  
Dumb dumb dumb
