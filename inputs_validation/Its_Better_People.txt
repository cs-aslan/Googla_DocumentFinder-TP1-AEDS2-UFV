Its better people love one another  
Cause livin your life can be tough  
Its better people speak to each other  
Your shame is not enough  
  
If everybody came alive  
And stayed alive  
And lived their lives instead yeah  
So come outside  
And feel the light  
Its cold inside  
But its lonely in your bed in your bed  
  
And you though we might be  
But what you heard before  
Was only sleepin in your brain  
But if you came with me  
The daysd never end  
Would never be the same  
Theyd never be the same  
Theyd never be the same  
Never be the same

Theyd never be the same
