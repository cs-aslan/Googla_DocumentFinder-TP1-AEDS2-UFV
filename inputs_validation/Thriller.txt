Yeah what you critics said would never happen  
We dedicate this album to anybody people said couldnt make it  
To the fans that held us down till everybody came around  
Welcome  
Its here  
  
Last summer we took threes across the board  
But by fall we were a cover story now in stores  
Make us poster boys for your scene  
But we are not making an acceptance speech  
I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes  
Every dotcoms refreshing for a journal update  
  
So long live the carcrash hearts  
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life  
Fix me and fortify  
  
So long live the car crash hearts  
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life  
Fix me and fortify  
  
I can take your problems away with a nod and a wave  
Of my hand cause thats just the kind of boy that I am  
The only thing I havent done yet is die  
And its me and my plusone at the afterlife  
Crowds are won and lost and won again  
But our hearts beat for the diehards  
  
So long live the carcrash hearts  
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life  
Fix me in fortyfive  
  
So long live the carcrash hearts  
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life  
Fix me in fortyfive  
  
Long live the car crash hearts  
Long live the car crash hearts  
Long live the car crash hearts  
Long live the car crash hearts  
  
Long live the car crash hearts  
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life  
And fix me in fortyfive
