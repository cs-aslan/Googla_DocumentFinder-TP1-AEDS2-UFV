I dont want to understand this horror  
Theres a weight in your eyes I cant admit  
Everybody ends up here in bottles  
But the name tags are the last thing you wanted  
As the world explodes you fall out of it  
And you cant let go because this  
Will not go away  
Theres a house built out in space  
  
And cant see the thief that lives inside of your head  
But I can be some courage at the side of your bed  
And I dont know whats happening and I cant pretend  
But I can be all be all  
  
Someone help us understand who ordered  
This disgusting arrangement of time and the end  
I dont want to hear who walked on water  
Cause the hallways are empty clocks tick  
As the world implodes we fall in to it  
And we cant go home because this  
Will not go away  
Theres a house built out in space  
  
And I cant see the thief that lives inside your head  
But I can be some courage at the side of your bed  
And I dont know whats happening and I cant pretend  
Its a long long get away its a long long get away  
Make it home again make it home again  
Its a long long get away its a long long get away  
  
And I cant see the thief that lives inside your head  
But I can be some courage at the side of your bed  
And I dont know whats happening and I cant pretend  
But I can be all be all Im here  
But I can be all be all Im here  
Its a long long get away
