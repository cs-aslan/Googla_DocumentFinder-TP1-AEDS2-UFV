The building turned its back ignored my call  
The concrete looks too thin to break my fall  
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene  
I counted people as I neared the street below  
Whoaoaoa  
Below  
Whoaoaoa  
  
Avril  
I saw it all I saw it all go down  
The shadow grew as he approached the ground  
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene  
They turned away as he came near the street below  
Whoaoaoa  
Below  
Whoaoaoa  
Below

Lets forget this all move on

Lets forget this all move on

Lets forget this all move on  
  
Avril  
Lets forget this all move on  
  
Michelle  
Lets forget this all move on  
  
Avril  
Lets forget this all move on
