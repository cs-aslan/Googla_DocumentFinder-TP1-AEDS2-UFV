Ive been sleeping with the lights on  
Cause the darkness is surrounding you  
This is my world this is my choice  
And youre the drug that gets me through  
  
Ive been waiting for an answer  
Because I build this bed for two  
Im just waiting on your answer  
I built this bed for me and you  
  
Cause youll see that I am yours  
So will you be my life support  
Youre my life support  
Youre my life support  
  
Sick of waiting up in darkness  
When the sky is always painted blue  
Theres a method to my madness  
Its clear that you dont have a clue  
  
Ive been waiting for an answer  
Because I build this bed for two  
Im just waiting on your answer  
I built this bed for me and you  
  
Cause youll see that I am yours  
So will you be my life support  
Youre my life support  
Youre my life support  
  
Cant you see that I am yours  
So will you be my life support  
Ive been sleeping with the lights on  
Cause the darkness is surrounding you
