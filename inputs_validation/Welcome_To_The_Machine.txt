Welcome my son  
Welcome to the machine  
Where have you been  
Its alright we know where youve been  
  
Youve been in the pipeline  
Filling your time  
Provided with toys and Scouting for Boys  
You bought a guitar to punish your ma  
And you didnt like school  
You know youre nobodys fool  
  
So welcome to the machine  
  
Welcome my son  
Welcome to the machine  
What did you dream  
Its alright we told you what to dream  
  
You dreamed of a big star  
He played a mean guitar  
He always ate in the Steak Bar  
He loved to drive in his Jaguar  
  
So welcome to the machine
