I hid the keys to unlock loves heart  
To hold you in my sweetest pain and suffering  
Everythings unfair in our lust and war  
Redemption beyond right and wrong  
  
In our hearts love keeps sweettalking to despair  
And goes on sleepwalking past hope  
All is lost in this war  
And all we can do is to wail and weep to the saddest song  
Sleepwalking past hope  
  
I unlit the light to embrace the dark  
To be near but not to turn into you my darling  
Forever were lost in our souls storm  
Reflections of each others faults  
  
I gave up long ago  
Painting love with crimson flow  
Ran out of blood and hope  
So I paint you no more  
  
My hell begins from the 10th and descends to the circle  
Six hundred threescore and six  
And from there I crawl beneath Lucifers claws just for one last kiss
