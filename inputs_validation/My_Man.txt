My man is the best in the world  
Hes got the sun in his heart and the moon in his soul  
His heads in the clouds but his feet on the ground  
And when he speaks all the birds come around  
I love you I love you  
  
My man is the best in the world  
His eyes got the shine of the ancient stars  
His heartbeat is the beat of the ocean  
He smells like an Aztec magic potion  
I love you I love you  
  
Ah ah ah  
  
Babalubabalubabalu I love you I love you  
Babalubabalubabalu I love you I love you  
  
My man is the best in the world  
He knows me like the palm of his hand  
When Im good hes so very good  
And when Im bad he laughs and says dont be sad  
I love you I love you  
  
Babalubabalubabalu babalu I love you I love you  
Babalubabalubabalu babalu I love you I love you  
I love you I love you I love you  
  
Babalubabalubabalu babalu I love you I love you  
Babalubabalubabalu babalu I love you I love you  
I love you I love you I love you  
  
Babalubabalubabalu babalu I love you I love you  
Babalubabalubabalu babalu I love you I love you  
I love you I love you I love you  
  
Babalubabalubabalu babalu I love you I love you  
I love you I love you I love you
