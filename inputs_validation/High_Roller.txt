Jump in my love car  
Dont have to go very far  
Just far enough to show you a thing or two  
  
I can really swing  
The best of everything  
And I want to have a thing with you  
  
High roller  
What I buy is mine  
And I always get the things that I choose  
My my my such a high roller  
I know hes gone away and left you  
Ill take real good care of you  
  
Im in the mood for love  
Youre all Im thinking of  
Ill make you feel alright when were alone  
  
I can really swing  
The best of everything  
And I want to have a thing with you  
  
High roller  
What I buy is mine  
And I always get the things that I choose  
My my my such a high roller is that you  
I knew youd be here tonight  
And Ill make it alright  
Ill take real good care of you  
Ill tuck you in tonight  
And Ill make it alright  
I know hes gone away and left you  
Ill take real good care of you
