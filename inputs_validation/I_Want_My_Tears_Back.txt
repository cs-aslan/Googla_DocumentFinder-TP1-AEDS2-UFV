The treetops the chimneys the snowbed stories winter grey  
Wildflowers those meadows of heaven wind in the wheat  
  
A railroad across waters the scent of grandfatherly love  
Blue bayous Decembers moon through a dragonflys wings  
  
Where is the wonder wheres the awe  
Wheres dear Alice knocking on the door  
Wheres the trapdoor that takes me there  
Wheres the real is shattered by a Mad Marsh Hare  
  
Where is the wonder wheres the awe  
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for  
Before the years take me  
I wish to see  
The lost in me  
  
I want my tears back  
I want my tears back now  
  
A ballet on a grove still growing young all alone  
A rag doll a best friend the voice of Mary Costa
