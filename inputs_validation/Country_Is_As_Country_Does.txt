I can live in a mansion or a doublewide  
Eat sushi raw or my catfish fried  
Wherever I am then thats where I belong  
Cause Im quite content with who I am  
And if you aint well kiss my ham  
Country is as country does and Im country to the bone  
  
Country is as country does  
Its the way I am and its the way I was  
Its the way I always will be thats for sure  
Country born and country bred  
Countrified and countryfed  
A country heart and a country head  
Cause Im country to the core  
  
Now I can drive a tractor or a Cadillac  
I can fly first class or slum in the back  
But Ill be the same ol gal when I arrive  
Oh I can wear denim or I can wear silk  
Drink champagne or chocolate milk  
Take the best or live with less cause a country girl survives  
  
Country is as country does  
Its the way I am and its the way I was  
And the way Ill be until they lay me low  
Country born and country bred  
Im countrified and Im countryfed  
And Ill be that way til Im country dead  
Cause Im country head to toe  
  
And what you see is what you get  
Nothings ever changed me yet  
Nothing will its a pretty safe bet  
Cause Im country through and through  
  
Oh thats country  
  
Country is as country does  
Its the way I am and its the way I was  
Its the way Ill be until my dying day  
Im country born and country bred  
Countrified and countryfed  
And nothing done and nothing said can change my country ways  
Nothing done and nothing said  
Nothings gonna change my country ways  
  
I dont think so  
Wouldnt change if I could  
  
Country is as country does  
Its the way I is and its the way I was  
Country born and country bred  
Im countrified and Im countryfed you know that  
Im country shes country  
But now that dont mean I cant go to town
