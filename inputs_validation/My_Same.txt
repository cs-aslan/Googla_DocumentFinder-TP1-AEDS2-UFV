You said Im stubborn and I never give in  
I think youre stubborn cept youre always softening  
You say Im selfish I agree with you on that  
I think youre giving out in way too much in fact  
I say weve only known each other a year  
You say Ive known you longer my dear  
You like to be so close I like to be alone  
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor  
Walking with each other  
Think well never match at all but we do  
But we do but we do but we do  
  
I thought I knew myself somehow you know me more  
Ive never known this never before  
Youre the first to make up whenever we argue  
I dont know who Id be if I didnt know you  
Youre so provocative Im so conservative  
Youre so adventurous Im so very cautious combining  
You think we would and we do  
But we do but we do but we do  
  
Favoritism aint my thing but  
In this situation Ill be glad  
  
Favoritism aint my thing but  
In this situation Ill be glad to make an exception
