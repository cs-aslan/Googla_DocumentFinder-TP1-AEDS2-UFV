I hear you had a good offer down on Third Avenue  
You tell me that was the reason  
For whatcha put me through yeah  
And now you come collapsin back  
I feel the heat of your attack  
Want me to take you back  
Im givin you the sack  
So dont waste your time  
  
Chorus  
Its a little too little  
Its a little too late  
Im a little too hurt  
And theres nothin left that Ive gotta say  
You can cry to me baby  
But theres only so much I can take  
Ah its a little too little  
Its a little too late  
  
You say you had a good time  
But did ya think it was for free  yeah  
And how much did it get ya all their flattery  
And now you come back runnin for protection  
Youve been bitten by love and stung by rejection  
You cant connect  
What did you expect  
Im still gettin over you  
  
Chorus x4
