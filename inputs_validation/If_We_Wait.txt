Theres some food upon the table boys  
And if you have ever seen me flying  
Then you know that I am weak  
And you are free to take me downstairs  
Away from cares  
Ill be with you in the morning boys  
Cause you know that if we wait for our time  
Well all be dead  
  
Oh now Ill bore you crying my life away  
Dont I know it always the things I say  
Always too far  
If you could be anything that you want to be  
do you think that you would be who you see in the mirror  
If I look long enough my face would start to change  
If I look close enough Ill take away the pain  
Oh I dont care anymore  
Anymore anymore anymore anymore  
  
Ill be with you in the morning boys  
Cause you know that if we wait  
For our time  
Then well be there
