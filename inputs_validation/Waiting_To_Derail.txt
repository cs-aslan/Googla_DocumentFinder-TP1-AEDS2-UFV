Yeah you say that all the time  
And you mean it only sometimes  
Are you out in all that sunshine  
Waiting to derail  
Wanting needing fighting feeling  
Waiting to derail  
Needing wanting feeling fighting  
Waiting to derail  
Yeah you say that only sometimes  
But you mean it all the same  
Are you out in all that sunshine  
Just waiting to derail  
Wanting needing feeling wanting  
Waiting to derail  
Wanting changing  
Do you feel it  
Do you feel it  
Are you waiting to derail  
To derail  
Waiting to derail  
Waiting to derail  
Waiting to derail  
Waiting to derail  
Are you waiting  
Yeah you say that all the time  
But you mean it only sometimes  
Are you out in all that sunshine  
Are you feeling better now  
That youre waiting to derail  
Wanting feeling trying embracing  
But youre waiting to derail  
Waiting yeah waiting to derail  
Youre waiting to derail  
Yes youre waiting to derail
