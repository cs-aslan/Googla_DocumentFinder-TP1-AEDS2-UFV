Hey baby  
You go your way  
And Ill go mine  
But in the meantime  
  
Move closer  
When were together  
Touching each other  
And our bodies  
Do what we feel  
  
When were dancing  
Smooching and swaying  
Tender love song  
Softly playing  
  
Move closer move closer  
Move your body real close until we  
Feel like were making love  
  
Get closer  
So when I say sugar  
And I whisper I love you I love you  
Well I know youre gonna answer  
In the sweetest voice yeah my sexy baby

Theres much room for passion oh no no  
There no room for fears  
When the love flows smoothly between us  
My dear
