Niggas talk more than bitches these days  
Just let that shit sink in  
Niggas talk more than bitches these days  
Who could get the pussy quicker these days  
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days  
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin these days  
Bunch of journalists been searchin for a story  
My exgirl been searchin for a sorry  
Couple bitches tryin to have me on the Maury like nigga its yours  
You should be supportin but where you been at On tour gettin money  
Yall dont even really check for me  
You aint even hit me when that nigga had threats for me  
Girl you dont love me you just say that shit to get to me  
Girl cause you got the Batphone in my workline  
You should call it  
When the last time you did something for the first time  
You have done it all swear to God  
Niggas talk more than bitches these days  
Got you thinkin Im different these days  
Broken telephone for every single conversation  
By the time it gets to you shit switches these days  
Its yours its your its yours its always gonna be yours
