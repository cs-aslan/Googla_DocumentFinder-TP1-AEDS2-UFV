Fuck all that bullshit  
You watch me play  
I look away  
Your lights turn bright  
You found the light  
Take up in space  
You and I  
Take up in space  
You and I  
  
Youre gonna die  
What made me whine  
I wish I hadnt drank  
Inside your soul escapes  
  
Take up in space  
You and I  
Take up in space  
You and I  
  
Cry into me  
Hold me something alright  
The kids that die listening to me  
You are alive  
  
Take up in space  
You and I stay  
Take up in space  
You and I  
Take up in space  
You and I
