Once dividednothing left to subtract  
Some words when spokencant be taken back  
Walks on his ownwith thoughts he cant help thinking  
Futures abovebut in the past hes slow and sinking  
Caught a bolt a lightnincursed the day he let it go  
Nothingman 2x  
Isnt it something  
Nothingman  
She once believedin every story he had to tell  
One day she stiffenedtook the other side  
Empty staresfrom each corner of a shared prison cell  
One just escapesones left inside the well  
And he who forgetswill be destined to rememberohohoh  
Nothingman 2x  
Isnt it something  
Nothingman  
Oh she dont want him  
Oh she wont feed himafter hes flown away  
Oh into the sunah into the sun  
Burnburn  
Nothingman 2x  
Isnt it something  
Nothingman  
Nothingman 2x  
Coulda been something  
Nothingman  
Ohohhohh
