Somethings wrong  
Cause my mind is fadin  
And everywhere I look  
Theres a dead end waiting  
Temperatures dropping  
At the rottin oasis  
Stealing kisses  
From the leperous faces  
  
Heads are hanging  
From the garbageman trees  
Mouthwash jukebox gasoline  
Pistols are pointing  
At a poor mans pockets  
Smiling eyes  
Whippin out of the sockets  
  
Got a devils haircut in my mind X4  
  
Love machines  
On the sympathy crutches  
Discount orgies  
On the dropout buses  
Hitchin a ride  
With the bleedin noses  
Comin to town  
With the briefcase blues  
  
Got a devils haircut in my mind X4  
  
Somethin wrong  
Cause my mind is fading  
Ghetto blastin disintegrating  
Rock n roll  
Know what Im saying  
Everywhere I look  
Theres a devil in waiting  
  
Got a devils haircut in my mind X7
