This is just another town that I painted  
Youre just another girl that were not too well equated  
Im a drifter at this time and we parted oh but why am I so heavy hearted  
Its just another town on the highway  
Just like a thousand others I passed her goin my way  
I just came to say goodbye why do I want to cry after all its just another
town  
Thats just another door why cant I open it and go  
If I told you whats in my heart Im sure that youd say no  
Its just another town that wont miss me  
Youre just another girl that was kind enough to kiss me  
My mind says walk away why does my heart say stay  
After all its just another town after all its just another town
