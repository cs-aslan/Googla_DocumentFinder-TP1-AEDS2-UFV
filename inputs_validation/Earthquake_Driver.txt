I was born again a little north of Disney Land  
Somewhere under Wonderland and Hollywood  
But then I had to go skipping and diving and bouncing back to New York City  
Straight through the heart of America where all the wild things grow  
  
I want to be an earthquake driver  
I want to be an aquarium diver  
I just dont want to go home  
  
I mean I live alone but I am hungry for affection  
I just struggle with connection til the water calls me home  
Down into ocean among millions of other lonely people  
Drowning among the only people we are ever going to know  
  
I want to be an earthquake driver  
I want to be an aquarium diver  
I just dont want to go home  
  
I want to be like the people I see  
They run all over just like me  
I was saved but what keeps me awake  
Is Im tied into the lightning line  
And I wanna be where the sun is shining  
All night just a waste of time I I dont want to see people like me  
Just sleeping in waking in hoping in hating in  
  
You look at me like Im some kind of carnival attraction  
You say loves this abstraction just some ghost that you chase  
Well I am sorry friend I am a blank space  
But the words you remember from whenever you saw my face  
  
I want to be an earthquake driver  
I dont want to be an aquarium diver  
I just dont want to go home  
  
I want to be like the people I see  
Hey man they run all over just like me  
I want to thank for what keeps me awake  
This unplugged ears to the lightning lining  
I want to see if the sun is shining  
All night chasing time I I dont want to be with people like me  
Just creeping in waking in hoping in hating in  
  
So what is the point of this famous self absorption  
We turn ourselves into orphans and then spend out nights alone  
Living in fear of some kind of imaginary consequence  
Terror incognito obladi oblada  
  
I want to be an earthquake driver  
I dont want to be an aquarium diver  
I just dont want to go home  
  
Truth is I dont want to be no earthquake driver  
And I dont want to be an aquarium diver  
I just dont want to go home  
  
Oh man just dont want to go home  
No I do not want to go home
