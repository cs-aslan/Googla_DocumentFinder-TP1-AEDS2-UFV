Chorus  
Aint that lovin you baby  
Aint that lovin you baby  
Aint that lovin you baby  
But you dont even know my name  
  
Listen to me baby  
What I say is true  
They could drop me in the ocean  
Id swim to the bank  
And get back home to you  
  
Chorus  
  
They may kill me darlin  
Honey just like they do  
Well my body might die  
But my spirits gonna rise  
And crawl back home to you  
  
Chorus  
  
Aint that lovin you baby  
Aint that lovin you baby  
Aint that lovin you baby  
But you dont even know my name  
Dont even know my name  
  
Aint that lovin you baby  
Aint that lovin you baby  
Aint that lovin you baby  
But you dont even know my name  
Said you dont even know my name  
Said you dont even know my name  
No you dont even know my name  
No you dont even know my name  
No you dont even know my name
