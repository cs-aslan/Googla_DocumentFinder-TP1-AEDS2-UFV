Weve got something so good  
Were gonna show you  
It makes me happy  
Always makes me feel free  
When Im in His hands  
Do you understand  
Not trying to sell you  
Im only trying to tell you  
That His love is for real  
Its there for you to feel  
There is no reason to run from the One  
Who can free you oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
Weve got something so good  
Were gonna show you  
Stand in His light youll see  
Its gonna shine through  
  
Open you heart its real  
And waiting for you  
Weve got something so good  
All through the highs and lows  
The only thing you need to know  
Is that Jesus will be true  
Hes there to comfort you  
Youre not the only one  
Who feels like everything youve done  
Is measured in pain  
Come in from the rain  
Theres no reason to run from the One  
Who can free you oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
A love we can give  
A love we can share  
A love that is more than money can buy  
I believe  
That Hell  
Set you free
