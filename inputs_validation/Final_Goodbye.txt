Its time to say goodbye  
Its over now  
Its time to say goodbye  
  
Is there a reason why our love could not last  
I ask was it too strong for you to hold on pretty  
Lady  
I thought we had a master plan  
But it takes a stronger man to walk away  
Than to watch our love fade away  
  
I often wonder how and why  
I did not cheat I did not lie  
I hope you know how hard I tried  
But its over for now  
Its time to say goodbye  
  
Chorus  
I cant believe how suddenly things change  
Yesterday we were in love but all I feel were  
Heartaches  
And pain  
Day and night I tried deep inside to work things out  
But in my heart I knew  
I still had my doubts  
  
I thought we made a symphony  
Its over now no more harmony  
I prayed so hard for love to fly oh yeah  
Its time to say goodbye  
Ooh bye bye bye bye bye  
  
Chorus  
  
Sorry I gotta leave  
Baby Im beggin please  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah  
Bye bye bye bye  
  
Chorus
