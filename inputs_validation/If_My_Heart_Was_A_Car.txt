I remember the Alamo I dont recall who won  
They had swords they had horses I hear we had mighty guns  
Like the ones from Navarone last night on Channel 21  
Its a long way back to El Paso  
It was early Monday morning in the Central Standard Zone  
You were quiet like the TV hung up like the telephone  
You were sleeping next to me I might as well have been alone  
Its a long way back to El Paso  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it a long time ago  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it a long time ago  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it down and sold it off  
To the greasy man in the salvage lot  
As it is its just a heart  
No no it aint worth nothin  
I aint talkin bout tomorrow Im talkin bout tonight  
You told me you were drunk already that dont make it right  
You want at me well have at it cause Im in the mood to fight  
And its a long way back to El Paso  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it a long time ago  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it a long time ago  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it a long time ago  
And if my heart was a and if my heart was a  
And if my heart was a car  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it a long time ago  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it a long time ago  
And if my heart was a car
