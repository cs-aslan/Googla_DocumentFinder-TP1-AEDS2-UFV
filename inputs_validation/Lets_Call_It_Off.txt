Verse 1  
Uh when did you get like this  
Least you coulda done is gone an give me a warning  
I dont regret like this  
So Ill be right there when you wake up in the morning  
Saying this just aint my style  
You cant say youre happy either  
You dont even smile for me  
  
Chorus  
Did you agree we should let it be  
And did you agree its a must  
Lets call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us  
Lets call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us  
  
Verse 2  
When you decided to knock on my door  
Did you remember what happened before  
The look on your face said you were expecting more  
But some things look better inside of the store  
  
Chorus  
Did you agree we should let it be  
And did you agree its a must  
Lets call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us  
Lets call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us  
  
Verse 3  
Leave me leave me I cant fkn stand you  
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to  
My girlfriend my girlfriend call herself my girlfriend  
Tell me that we posed to be together til the world end  
But ion really feel that  
I just really wanna turn the wheels back  
Give you all ya sweaters and ya heels back  
Convince you that time will heal that  
Uh you look for reasons for us to argue  
I swear everytime I call  
You jus tell me how I dont call you  
Why you do that Do that Do that  
Yeah

Did you agree we should let it be  
And did you agree its a must

Lets call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us
