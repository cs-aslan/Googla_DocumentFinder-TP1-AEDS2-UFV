Its gotta be love  
La la la la  
  
Its gotta be love or nothing  
You gotta make up your mind  
cause youre running out of time  
You know its your game  
And the winner takes all  
Its time for you to realize  
Theres gonna be no compromise  
Its gonna be love  
Its gonna be love or nothing at all  
Its gonna be love or nothing

Ive thought about a new beginning  
But you know your hearts not in  
Theres something inside  
That aint hearing my call  
  
And each new misty morning  
Brings a constant warning  
Its gotta be love  
Its gotta be love or nothing at all

Its no good coming in the back seat  
In the name of love  
Or tryin to be somebody  
That you know youre not  
Sneaking out the back door  
At the dead of night

What its really like
