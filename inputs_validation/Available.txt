Anytime you call Im so available anytime you call  
Anytime anytime Anytime at all Im so available anytime at all  
Anytime anytime Dont have to bring a cake or a band home  
You dont have to phone ahead  
  
Make no mistake Im still the old standby  
I am as you might guess at the old address  
Chances are that you are unassailable and that we are through  
Chances are chances are  
  
But what can I do Im still available just like the first evening star  
You can trust that Ill be there summer spring or fall  
Im in love and available anytime at all  
But what could I do Im still available like the first evening star  
  
You can trust that Ill be there summer spring or fall  
Im in love and available anytime at all
