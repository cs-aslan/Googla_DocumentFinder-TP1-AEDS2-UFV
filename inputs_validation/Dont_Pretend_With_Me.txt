They say youll lie they say youll cheat  
And your kisses taste so sweet  
If youre not in love then let me be  
No baby dont pretend with me  
  
That honkytonking life you lead  
With neon lights youll never leave  
Give me one reason to believe  
But baby dont pretend with me  
  
Your foolish heart will never change  
Well I want no part of your lovesick games  
I know youre wild and runnin free  
So baby dont pretend with me  
  
Ill lay my poor heart at your feet  
If youll leave behind those lonely streets  
Oh we could make sweet memories  
So baby dont pretend with me  
  
Your foolish heart will never change  
I want no part of your lovesick games  
I know youre wild and runnin free  
So baby dont pretend with me  
I know youre wild and runnin free  
So baby dont pretend with me
