Everybodys been in my face  
Tellin me I gotta make a change  
All I ever hear day and night isYou better hurry up and get a life  
I need some directioncause the clock is tickin away  
Then a friend of a friend of mine  
Says Ive really been on his mind  
And wants to go out and check out what the feelins about  
Says we have a deep connectionwell it sure is news to me  
And all I can say is  
Intuition tells me how to live my day  
Intuition tells me when to walk away  
Could have turned left  
Could have turned right  
But I ended up here  
Bang in the middle of real life  
Then another one always saysshed do anything to get ahead  
She doesnt care if she has to scratch and claw to get in the door  
She wants her 15 minutes of fame and 20 would be nice  
But I guess its her life  
Cause intuition tells me that Im doin fine  
Intuition tells me when to draw the line  
Could have turned left  
Could have turned right  
But I ended up here  
Bang in the middle of real life  
should have turned left  
But I turned right  
And I ended up here  
And I fell alright  
You make it hard for me  
Cant find the real you  
You really think that I cant see  
What it is that youre trying to do  
CHORUS
