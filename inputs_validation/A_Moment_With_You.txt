Hey this wont take much time  
We wont touch well just wait for signs  
And nothing was further from my mind  
Than this moment with you  
  
But if youd only told me baby  
I would have made some other plans  
If Id only seen it sooner  
But what a way with your hands you had  
I wanted that moment with you  
  
I know that is wrong  
But if you need me Im here turns me on  
I cant help thinking its a miracle youre here  
I cant help thinking its a miracle  
  
Say you dont waste much time  
We dont touch do we baby  
But still my hands are tied  
For that moment with you  
  
But if youd only told me baby  
I would have made some other plans  
If Id only seen it sooner  
But what a way with your hands you had  
I wanted that moment with you  
  
You know that Im strong  
And Ive no reason to fear am I wrong  
I cant help thinking its a miracle youre here  
I cant help thinking its a miracle  
I cant help thinking its a miracle  
I cant help thinking its a miracle  
I cant help thinking its a miracle youre here  
  
You cant keep holding it in when its something good  
Get up get up  
You cant keep holding it in when its something good  
Get up get up  
  
And who can you trust  
Dealing out justice with a minimum of fuss  
Who baby  
Dealing out justice
