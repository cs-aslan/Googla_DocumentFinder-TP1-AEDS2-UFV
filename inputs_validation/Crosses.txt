Dont you know that Ill be around to guide you  
Through your weakest moments to leave them behind you  
Returning nightmares only shadows  
Well cast some light and youll be alright  
Well cast some light and youll be alright for now  
  
Crosses all over heavy on your shoulders  
The sirens inside you waiting to step forward  
Disturbing silence darkens you sight  
Well cast some light and youll be alright  
Well cast some light and youll be alright for now  
  
Crosses all over the boulevard  
Crosses all over the boulevard  
Crosses all over the boulevard  
Crosses all over the boulevard  
  
The streets outside your window over flooded  
People staring they know youve been broken  
Repeatedly reminded by the looks on their faces  
Ignore them tonight and youll be alright  
Well cast some light and youll be alright
