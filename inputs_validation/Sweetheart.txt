Sweetheart  
Im changing my role in life  
Im not rearranging the main things in my life  
I aint sacrificing what I hold as true  
I aint sacrificing sweetheart even for you  
  
Sweetheart Im changing my mode of life  
Im not rearranging the main things in my life  
Im not giving up now in mixed company  
Ill be holding on now looking to find my identity  
  
My freedom means too much to give up now  
It doesnt matter to you anyhow  
  
Sweetheart  
Sweetheart  
  
My freedom means too much to give up now  
And did it matter so much anyhow
