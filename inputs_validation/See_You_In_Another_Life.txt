Well I believe in love but not the kinda screws you up no  
  
I believe in time and chance  
Cause Im not one for making plans  
Well youll go down in history  
And thats just what it is to me  
I believe in moving on  
When sentimental and love is gone  
  
But if Im crying over you  
I wont lie even its hard to do  
When you turn around  
Ill be gone and I mean goodbye  
  
I see you in another life  
I see you in another life  
I dont know where Im going but when you turn around Ill be gone and that  
Means goodbye  
  
I believe in love but not the kinda breaks you up no  
I dont regret the day I felt  
Kiss the life I wish you well  
  
But if Im crying over you  
I wont lie even its hard to do  
When you turn around  
Ill be gone and I mean goodbye  
  
I see you in another life  
I see you in another life  
I dont know where Im going but when you turn around Ill be gone and I  
Mean goodbye  
  
Well I know youre full full of good intentions yeah  
But that dont change a thing cause Im already out of here  
Oh oh oh  
When you turn around Ill be gone and I mean goodbye  
  
I see you in another life  
I see you in another life  
I dont know where Im going but when you turn around Ill be gone and I  
Mean goodbye  
I see you in another life  
  
I see you in another life  
I see you in another life  
I dont know where Im going but when you turn around Ill be gone and I  
Mean goodbye  
  
I see you in another life  
I see you in another life  
I dont know where Im going but when you turn around Ill be gone and I  
Mean goodbye
