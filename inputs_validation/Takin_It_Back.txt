When they found you you were driven and hungry  
You were playin for your life then  
You were livin for the chance to be heard  
What they promised what they offered  
Was more than youd ever hoped for  
To walk away ya know that wouldve been absurd  
And talk about absurdity it was madness  
It was everything in excess  
It was too much too many and too little time  
It was faceless people in jackets and ties  
Who thought of you when they made love to their wives  
Somehow it wasnt what you had in mind  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell em youre Takin It Back  
So they might as well get used to the idea  
Youre Takin It Back those cooperation days are over  
You got no one to blame but yourself  
So dont put it on nobody else  
Put it behind you start over today  
  
There were parties and photos and televised award shows  
And covers of magazines  
There was gold and platinum and everyone was smiling  
You were coming apart at the seems  
There were jerk offs too numerous to mention  
When everybody shared the dream  
But when it came time to share the nightmare  
They were conveniently nowhere to be seen  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh theyll argue what they gave you was exactly what you wanted  
And just to be fair ya know that some of its true  
Thats why ya gotta be careful bout your wishes  
Take your time and think em over  
Sometimes those wishes just might come true  
  
Tell em youre Takin It Back  
So they might as well get used to the idea  
Youre Takin It Back those cooperation days are over  
Tell em youve had enough and if they dont like it its tough  
Youre Takin It Back those cooperation days are over  
Youre Takin It Back  
Tell em youre Takin It Back
