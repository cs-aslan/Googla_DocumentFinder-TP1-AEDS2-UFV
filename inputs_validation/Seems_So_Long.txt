Lady love and lady cared  
But lady went away  
And left me all alone to suffer  
  
And now I feel its not fair  
For me to fall in love  
The truth is the real me you must uncover  
  
Seems so long since Ive heard the sound  
Its been so long since Ive trusted in someone else  
Had to see it all for myself  
Its been so long that the world seems cold  
But I think its time in my life to find myself again  
  
Lady loved and lady stayed  
Until she was too pleased  
She knew I wouldnt leave for her to suffer  
Id never make her suffer  
  
Now I believe youre just like me  
In that you understand  
And want me for your man to always love me  
  
You can believe its seems so long since Ive touched a wanting hand  
Oh it seems so long since Ive trusted in someone else  
Had to see this world for myself  
And its been so long that the world seems cold  
Now I think Ive found someone to make me trust in someone again  
  
I believe that I can trust in you
