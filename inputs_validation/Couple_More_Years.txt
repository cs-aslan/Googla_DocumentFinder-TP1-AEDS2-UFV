Ive got a couple more years on you babythats all  
Ive had more chances to fly and more places to fall  
And it aint that Im wiser  
Its only that Ive spent more time with my back to the wall  
And Ive picked up a couple more years on you baby thats all  
  
Ive walked a couple more roads than you babythats all  
And Im tired of runnin while youre only learning to crawl  
And youre headin somewhere  
But Ive been to somewhere and found it was nowhere at all  
And Ive picked up a couple of years on you baby thats all  
  
Now sayin goodbye girl dont never come easy at all  
But youve got to fly cause youre hearin those young eagles call  
And someday when youre older youll smile at a man strong and tall  
And youll say Ive got a couple more years on you baby thats all  
  
Ive got a couple more years on you baby thats all  
Youll say Ive had more chances to fly and more places to fall  
It aint that Im wiser  
Its only that Ive spent more time with my back to the wall  
And Ive picked up a couple more years on you baby thats all
