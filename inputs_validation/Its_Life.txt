The child breaks each moment of sadness for our sakes  
Leaving trying his best to believe then  
Hoping this dream will come true  
Sadness is only a face for you  
  
I will try like the devil to bear your names  
Anything for you  
In only a moment your life can change  
  
Still lake rocking the boat its not too late  
Leaving trying your best to believe then  
Hoping this dream will come true  
Sadness is only a face for you  
  
I will try like the devil to bear your names  
Anything for you  
In only a moment your life can change  
  
You fell through the window and down on the floor  
You found a direction you hope will say more  
With your life its taken every one in view  
  
The people are pretty  
The flowers are too  
You dont get to heaven  
If they dont say you do  
  
Cause its life and its taken every one of you  
And its true  
Id like to take you but I dont think theres room for two  
Id like to take Id like to take you Repeat x9
