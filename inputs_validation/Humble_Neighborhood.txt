We dont wanna go home  
Were bad people and we do bad things 2x  
Verse  
Here we go dont ya know  
Were the ones that keep it wicked  
Rock n Roll all good mix it up  
Thats my ticket  
Cruisin in my Cadillac Escalade trickin  
Sometimes like it easy sometimes  
Like it rugged  
Keep control dont ya know  
Hit the floor run for cover  
Flew around the world about fifty times over  
From New York to la to the white cliffs of  
Dover the road can be my enemy  
The road can be my lover  
watch how we do this here  
Yeah watch how we do this here  
Chorus  
From the humble neighborhoods  
Were takin over the dance floor  
From the humble neighborhoods  
Were gettin out of control  
Verse 2  
Here we go dont ya know  
Were the ones that make it crazy  
This aint time to get lazy  
Meetin at 11 in the hotel lobby  
Same faces different places  
Never knowin where we going now  
Someday Im gonna die but it  
Wont be from boredom  
If youve got the skills then I suggest  
That you throw down  
Meet us at the spot cause its  
Gonna be a showdown  
Naw you cant ride the bus  
Man you better cool down  
Chorus  
Verses 1
