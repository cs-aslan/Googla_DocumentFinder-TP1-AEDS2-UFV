I used to live in a poor neighborhood  
My friends and me we always had a time  
Never had no money but we had it so good  
Those days are gone and I wanna go back  
  
So pure so simple  
  
Never thought about it  
When youre young you dont care  
You dont realize it til its all behind  
Take it for granted just not well  
  
Oh oh it was pure and simple  
Ill remember those days til the end  
Oh oh God knows its simple  
If I could live my life all over again  
Id keep it pure and simple  
  
Those days are gone and I wanna go back  
  
Got me a feelin Im not alone  
Wish I had a road so I could go back home  
  
Oh oh it was pure and simple  
Ill remember those days til the end  
Oh oh God knows its simple  
If I could live my life all over again  
  
Oh oh it was pure and simple  
Ill remember those days til the end  
Oh oh God knows its simple  
If I could live my life all over again  
Id keep it pure and simple
