And Sara thinks shes died here once before  
Shes crazy  
A popup book of flowers from grade four  
Are driving her insane  
  
Noone knows why  
Shes sad tonight  
Noone can help her find  
Crying she couldnt afford the view  
Crying these automatic flowers wont do  
  
Another brick  
Another window frames the confusion  
Her garden blooms but Sara cant see straight  
Shes drinking herself blind  
  
Noone knows why  
Shes stares outside  
Noone can help her find  
Crying she couldnt afford the view  
Crying these automatic flowers wont do  
These automatic flowers wont do
