Ryan  
Its hard to believe  
That I couldnt see  
  
Together  
You were always there beside me  
Thought I was alone  
With no one to hold  
But you were always right beside me  
  
Sharpay  
This feelings like no other  
  
Together  
I want you to know  
  
Ive never had someone that knows me like you do  
The way you do  
Ive never had someone as good for me as you  
No one like you so lonely before i finally found  
What ive been looking for  
  
Sharpay  
So good to be seen  
So good to be heard  
  
Together  
Dont have to say a word  
  
Ryan  
For so long I was lost  
So good to be found  
  
Together  
Im loving having you around  
  
Ryan  
This feelings like no other  
  
Together  
I want you to know  
  
Ive never had someone that knows me like you do  
The way you do  
Ive never had someone as good for me as you  
No one like you  
So lonely before I finally found  
What Ive ben looking for  
  
Together
