And Id like to take you take you away  
And if youd come with me wed leave here today  
Theres nothing to hold you as strong as this feeling  
And Ive got to have you as soon as I can  
  
And I know youre worried about where you stand  
The ring that he gave you is still on your hand  
You want to be faithful you want to believe  
Hes easy to lie to but hard to deceive  
And you say its over between you and him  
He tells you he needs you but chances are slim  
That he even wants you as much as I do  
So why dont you go on and tell him youre through  
Cause Id like to take you  
And Id like to take you  
And Ive got to have you as soon as I can as soon as I can
