Intro  
Just got off the phone my nigger smithy  
Shit too real back home Real  
  
This for my niggers here hold your head  
I know shit rough but nigger we dont give up  
We dont get mad nigger we just get tough  
We just get right nigger we dont get left  
Fuck what they said  
Cause what we learned coming up  
You cant teach that shit  
Like dealer nigger blows but we eat that shit  
This one heres for my brothers we gonna beat that shit  
Now I say my prayers  
I got too many people in my head right now  
So many thats in jail or theyre dead right now  
One time for my nigger crag right now  
He in the feds damn the times change  
And these stupid niggers talking bout crime pays  
You can keep that shit I just made a million  
Call me when reach that shit  
I aint bragging Im just shedding some light  
One time for my granny up would happen tonight  
And a young boy from a show down in hampton  
Told me that my song was the reason he beat cancer  
Didnt know what to say I just froze  
Little too deep I suppose  
But after a year of review  
I figured it out it wasnt me  
It was you nigger congratulations
