Dear Dad  
Things didnt turn out quite like I wanted them to  
Sometimes I feel like Im gonna explode  
  
Everybody want to see you down for the count  
But that aint what being a real mans about  
The brave and the bold hang around for the kill  
So the bigger the hole the bigger we fill it fill it  
They can hit us with all they got  
But cha know what  
What  
  
I cant stop this feeling I got  
I feel it right down to my toes  
I cant stop this feeling I got  
My body got to have it you know

Cant stop try to tell me how to paint my palace  
That aint where its at  
Thats like trying to tell Columbus that the world is flat  
If the song were singing truly is the best  
Then that my brothers is the ultimate test  
All in favor say hey  
We can change anything at all

Hey pardon me for living pardon me for living  
But this is my world this is my world  
You cant make me change you cant make me change  
Maybe we all got to rearrange rearrange  
Our brains our brains
