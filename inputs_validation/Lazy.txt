I wish I could go  
Off far away  
Where time moves too slow  
Day after day  
  
Ill wait and Ill sit and watch  
The clouds as they pass by  
Ill wait and Ill sit and watch  
The crowds as they walk by  
  
I have a fixation with laziness  
Procrastination is what I do best  
  
Ill wait and Ill sit and watch  
The clouds as they pass by  
Ill wait and Ill sit and watch  
The crowds as they walk by  
  
Where has my ambition gone  
I havent seen it for so long  
Am I a burden to someone  
  
Life I am so tired  
Of everything  
All my desire  
Is vanishing  
  
Ill wait and Ill sit and watch  
The clouds as they pass by  
Ill wait and Ill sit and watch  
The crowds as they walk by
