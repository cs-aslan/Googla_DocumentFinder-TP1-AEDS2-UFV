Let me tell you something  
  
In the darkness of the room  
Im leaning back against the wall  
Try to walk on broken glass  
A cut so deep just hurts so bad  
  
I remember what you said  
Tears were rollin down your face  
And after alls been said and done  
Youre a woman Im a man  
Could I turn back the time again  
  
You must know by now  
I wont let you down  
Whatever comes along the way  
Dont you agree that one thing is true  
Im not the best but the best for you  
  
And I step outside the door step outside the door  
Blinded by a million lights  
In the valley of the fools in the valley of the fools  
Another day went by so fast  
What in the world will ever last  
  
You must know by now  
I wont let you down  
Whatever comes along the way  
Dont you agree that one thing is true  
Im not the best but the best for you  
  
Theres nothin else that we have got  
But our love is like a rock  
Standing up against the tide  
  
Theres nothin else that we have got

Im not the best but the best for you

Dont you agree that one thing is true  
Im not the best but the best for you  
Im not the best but the best for you  
Im not the best but the best for you
