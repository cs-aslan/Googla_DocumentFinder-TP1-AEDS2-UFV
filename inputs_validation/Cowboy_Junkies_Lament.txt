Baby hit the back door breathin real heavy  
Said the boys in the alley wouldnt leave her alone  
Mama did her makeup in a terrible hurry  
She finally got ready but the boys were gone  
Mama dont you worry nights aproachin  
Theres a hole in heaven where some sin slips through  
Close your eyes and dream real steady  
Maybe just a little will spill on you  
  
The dark dont lie  
And dreams come true  
Could be a few will see you through  
  
Old lady Rose lookin down her nose  
At lonely Miss Lily hiding in the hall  
Lilys just praying for the trial to be over  
Rosys just waitin for the ax to fall  
Show me off on the way to town  
The skys still shiny and the earths still brown  
Tell the judge Im ready for the vases  
Gonna dance in their faces  
When the guitar sounds  
  
It wont be long  
I wont be gone  
Ive been leaning toward the shadows all along  
  
Those in the know say how it goes  
You plan on reapin you better sow  
You plan on sleepin you better keep movin  
Sleepin aint allowed around here you know  
Tell me please when the rollins over  
Me and my baby gonna have some fun  
Bury our backs in a bed of clover  
Smile in style while the sun goes down  
  
Snake eyes cry  
And boxcars sigh  
Sevens stuck in the middle just wonderin why  
  
The dark dont lie  
And dreams come true  
All it takes is one or two  
Maybe just a few will see you through  
Maybe just a few will see you through
