Theres a place Id love to go  
Strangers they can meet there  
Dream about the day I lernt to fly  
Im afraid of airaplains  
Even though I like their wings  
Fears to be a person in the sky  
  
Its alright  
And its good this time  
  
I look out and on the ground  
Really dont believe it  
Gravity can pull me from this hight  
One day well come crashing down  
What will I do  
Never had a chance to say goodbye  
Close my eyes and hope that its a real smooth flight  
this time  
Close my eyes and hope that its a real smooth flight  
And its good this time  
I looked down out on the ground  
I looked down out on the ground  
I looked down out on the ground  
I look out were going down
