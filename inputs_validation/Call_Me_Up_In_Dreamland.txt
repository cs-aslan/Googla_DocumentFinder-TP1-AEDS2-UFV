Well Ive tried and Ive tried  
But the river seems so wide  
And my head hurts and my hands are tied  
And its so hard  
When youre standing on the yard  
Every time that your number comes around  
  
Chorus  
Call me up in dreamland  
Radio to me man  
Get the message to me  
Any way you can  
Let your river roll  
Way down to your soul  
Never to grow old  
On a saxophone  
  
From the airport to the plane  
Way to the railroad train  
Why dont we take it from the top  
And start over all over again  
Every time you hear that whistle blow  
You know you gotta put on your show  
Every time your number comes around  
  
Chorus  
  
From the car to the bar  
Why dont you pour it in a jar  
And put a label on it  
And send it off to the lost and found  
You gotta get it in your brain  
Before you go insane  
Every time your number comes around  
  
Chorus  
Never to grow old  
On a saxophone  
Never to grow old  
On a saxophone  
Never to grow old  
On a saxophone
