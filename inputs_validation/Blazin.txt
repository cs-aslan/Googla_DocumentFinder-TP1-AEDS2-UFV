Chorus  
I fly I fly high Im blazing  
Im blazing feels like Im blazing  
I fly I fly high Im blazing  
Im blazing feels like Im blazing  
  
Feels like Im bl  
  
How could it me little me  
Had the power to be the best B in the league  
Yeah inevitably but could it be little me  
You was heckling me now its monotony when I regularly  
I catch wreck on recreation so I exceed all your expectations  
Because I got it in em I kill em and then I skin em  
The contract is on but I am the addendum  
So whwhere my dogs at Randy  
Mamamatter fact get off my dick bitch Andy  
Cacacacause everything is fine and dandy  
Go against me now I dare you Bambi  
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show  
I aint even detonate the bombs and the arsenal  
Before the storm comes the calm  
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron  
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Im the best now  
Anybody with some money should invest now  
Soccer mom needs to organize a pep rall  
You game over bitch Gatorade wet towel  
Motherfuckers aint ready they never been  
As long as I am in the game youll never win  
Im on that different type of high heroin  
Put on my cape and hit the sky heroine  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Ugh yea ugh this is the moment grab your Kodak  
While Im flying with a flow that  
Is the greatest throwback  
Since that Nolan Ryan and the days  
Been crazy and the nights even wilder  
And the lights even brighter  
Baby stand next to my fire  
Only higher is Messiah  
Or notes from Mariah  
Rari six hundred horses  
Thats my chariot of fire  
Where we flying  
They cant find us all them broke days behind us  
I just took your whole life and redesigned it ugh  
I think Im Marc Jacobs I think Im Lagerfeld  
I think without makeup you still bad as hell  
Im a grab your waist then  
Im a grab your face and  
Then Im a taste it  
Then Im a blaze it  
Hello all my bad girls  
This just in  
Yeezy hurt the beat  
Like he fucked her best friend  
And she let him back in  
And he just did it again  
He crazy he blazin he off the deep end  
Im blazin Im flagrant Im crazy Im saying  
Too much for the world so they abbreviate him  
His tatts is her fav his stats is amaze  
Her dress is just per uh  
Prada colored babes  
It obvi we the ish  
And Im rolling with my bricks  
So real you so trill baby everything legit  
How you feel they say we crazed  
Cause our styles so diff  
They be jail when we in the mag looking magnif  
As if I aint used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch  
Fuck these background niggas I was tryna adlib  
Add this we blazin
