Its like whatever I do  
Oh  
Just cant get through to you  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Im never gonna tell you nothin more  
Listen  
  
Now now she loved me shawty I loved her  
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out  
Used to care she used to share  
The love that she used to give me cant be found  
I lost my way she said shed stay  
And lately Ive been sleeping with a ghost  
My stock is down and out I used to be worth my weight in gold  
That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us  
And that was before the hurricane came came in and stopped us  
I told you to leave but you lied to me  
When you said that baby no worries I promise to get us back  
  
Chorus  
I know sorries just wouldnt do it  
Her heart is obliterated Im trying to travel through  
But its like moving mountains  
Its like moving mountains Hey  
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change  
And the sky turns gray and the water from the rain washes progress away  
Its like moving mountains moving mountains  
Its like moving mountains moving mountains  
Why just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be oh  
  
She she dont touch me I dont touch her  
We rarely even ever say a word  
I really want to give her everything she deserves  
But the bad took away the good  
She thinks that Im full of it arguments always pissed man Im tired  
Every kiss that I miss girl you know Im trying  
You never believe when I say and I never believe it when you say  
I love you and I shouldnt complain about it  
I should take it like a man and walk up out it  
Cause we will never be the same oh  
Ive been standing in gas and you have been the flame  
  
Chorus  
I know sorries just wouldnt do it  
Her heart is obliterated Im trying to get through  
Got to move this mountain  
Its like moving mountains Hey  
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change  
And the sky turns gray and the water from the rain washes progress away  
Its like moving mountains moving  
Its like moving mountains moving  
Well baby why you just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be oh  
  
This must be a slow death that Im travelin on  
It feels so wrong Im barely holdin on  
  
See no matter what it takes Ive gotta get it together baby yea  
  
And these hills that Im travelin up  
She aint showin me love  
Im down on my love  
  
Chorus  
I know sorries just wouldnt do it  
Her heart is obliterated Im trying Im trying my boo  
But its like moving mountains  
Its like moving mountains Hey  
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change  
And the sky turns gray and the water from the rain washes progress away  
Its like moving mountains  
Its like moving mountains  
Well baby why you just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be  
Why you just leave me  
Just leave me be oh
