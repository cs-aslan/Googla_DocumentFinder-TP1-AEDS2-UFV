Welcome to the jungle weve got fun and games  
We got everything you want honey we know the names  
We are the people that can find whatever you may need  
If you got the money honey we got your disease  
  
Chorus  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your knnn knne knees knees  
I want to watch you bleed  
  
Welcome to the jungle we take it day by day  
If you want it youre gonna bleed but its the price to pay  
And youre a very sexy girl thats very hard to please  
You can taste the bright lights but you wont get there for free  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Feel my my my serpentine  
Ooh I want to hear you scream  
  
Welcome to the jungle it gets worse here every day  
Ya learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play  
If you hunger for what you see youll take it eventually  
You can have everything you want but you better not take it from me  
  
Chorus  
  
And when youre high you never ever want to come down  
So down so down so down yeah  
  
You know where you are  
Youre down in the jungle baby youre gonna dieee  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your knees knees  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Feel my my my serpentine  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your knees knees  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to you  
Its gonna bring you down ha
