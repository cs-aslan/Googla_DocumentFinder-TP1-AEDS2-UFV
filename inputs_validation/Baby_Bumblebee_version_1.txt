Im bringing home a baby bumblebee  
Wont my mommy be so proud of me  
Cup hands together as if holding bee  
  
Im bringing home a baby bumblebee  
Ouch It stung me  
Shake hands as if just stung  
  
Im squishing up the baby bumblebee  
Wont my mommy be so proud of me  
Squish bee between palms of hands  
  
Im squishing up a baby bumblebee  
Ooh Its yucky  
Open up hands to look at mess  
  
  
Im wiping off the baby bumblebee  
Wont my mommy be so proud of me  
Wipe hands off on shirt  
  
Im wiping off the baby bumblebee  
Now my mommy wont be mad at me  
Hold hands up to show they are clean
