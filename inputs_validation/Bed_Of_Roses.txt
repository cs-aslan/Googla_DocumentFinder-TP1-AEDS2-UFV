Theres something bout your manner  
That makes it hard to see  
Just how you take advantage  
Of a workin girl like me  
Ive seen you set em up  
And Ive seen you take em down  
Our love is legal tender  
For your kind to pass around  
  
Dont want your bed of roses  
Dont want no handful of thorns  
Dont want to be your livin doll  
Dont want to be no woman scorned  
I dont want to watch you turn the page  
When our chapter closes  
No Im not gonna lay me down  
In your bed of roses  
  
Ive tasted good and bad love  
In the honkytonks and bars  
Ive settled for the moon  
When I was reachin for the stars  
And though sometimes I have stumbled  
Ive been known to fall  
It was always true love  
That took me to the wall  
  
Dont want your bed of roses  
Dont want no handful of thorns  
Dont want to be your livin doll  
Dont want to be no woman scorned  
I dont want to watch you turn the page  
When our chapter closes  
No Im not gonna lay me down  
In your bed of roses  
  
Girl you better hide your love away  
Girl you better save it for another day
