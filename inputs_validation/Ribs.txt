The drink you spilt all over me  
Lovers Spit left on repeat  
My mom and dad let me stay home  
It drives you crazy getting old  
  
We can talk it so good  
We can make it so divine  
We can talk it good  
How you wish it would be all the time  
  
The drink you spilt all over me  
Lovers Spit left on repeat  
My mom and dad let me stay home  
It drives you crazy getting old  
  
The drink you spilt all over me  
Lovers Spit left on repeat  
My mom and dad let me stay home  
It drives you crazy getting old  
  
This dream isnt feeling sweet  
Were reeling through the midnight streets  
And Ive never felt more alone  
It feels so scary getting old  
  
We can talk it so good  
We can make it so divine  
We can talk it good  
How you wish it would be all the time  
  
This dream isnt feeling sweet  
Were reeling through the midnight streets  
And Ive never felt more alone  
It feels so scary getting old

I want em back I want em back  
The minds we had the minds we had  
How all the thoughts how all the thoughts  
Moved round our heads moved round our heads  
I want em back I want em back  
The minds we had the minds we had  
Its not enough to feel the lack  
I want em back I want em back I want em  
  
Youre the only friend I need  
Sharing beds like little kids  
Laughing til our ribs get tough  
But that will never be enough
