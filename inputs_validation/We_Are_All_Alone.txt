We are all alone thats the way it seems to be  
Love is in my sight and I can see it if you can  
Where do we come from Ive been waiting for so long  
We are all alone say you will  
The lights have all gone home and are safely tucked away  
Theres nothing to come between us but the words weve got to say  
  
Chorus  
Where do we come from Ive been waiting for so long  
We are all alone  
And now we are both here are we really within reach  
Of the things we need to do seeest a ou seeest la vie  
  
Chorus  
  
And now we can both spend all the time thats come our way  
Im not going to let you go for another single day  
  
Chorus
