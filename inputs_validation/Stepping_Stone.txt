I sure got the blues this morning baby  
Yeah And Im here to tell you about it  
So you might as well pick up on it Yeah  
Im a man  
At least Im tryin to be  
Ive lived before  
The other half of me  
Ive lived before  
That you dont want me  
But in this search  
For nothing desperately  
Oh Im tryin tryin  
Not to be a fool  
Im tryin tryin  
Lord to keep my cool baby tryin so hard to keep it together  
After I find baby  
That true love of mine  
Im just rollin screamin  
Cryin flyin  
Cant be trusted but busted  
Rolling Stone  
Youre a woman  
At least you say you are  
Youre a woman  
At least you look like you are  
Youre a woman  
At least you taste like you are  
But you can take it off  
In bed with my guitar  
And then you leave them  
Throw me outside  
To cry cry  
To the moon and the nighttime  
Save my soul  
You cant find  
All you want is a ticket to ride  
After you show me everything  
It did prove otherwise  
You just rollin screamin cryin good love is sometime but cant be
trusted  
Steppin stone  
Steppin stone  
Steppin stone
