And I love you so the people ask me how  
How Ive lived till now I tell them I dont know  
I guess they understand how lonely life has been  
But life began again the day you took my hand  
And yes I know how lonely life can be  
The shadows follow me and the night wont set me free  
But I dont let the evenings get me down now that youre around me  
And you love me too your thoughts are just for me  
You set my spirit free Im happy that you do  
The book of life is brief and once the pages read all but life is dead that is
my belief  
And yes I know  
And I love you so
