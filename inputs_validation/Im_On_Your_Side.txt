Baby wont you come and tell me  
Tell me what were gonna doyeah baby  
Ive tried everything I know just to  
Just to try and get along with you  
  
Wake up in the morning and already  
You are aimin for a fight  
No matter what I say or do  
Im never gonna get it right  
  
But aint we gettin kind of tore down  
Always layin it on the line  
I dont think that when they called it love  
This what they had in mind  
  
Chorus  
Hey Baby dont you know that  
Im on your side  
All you got to do now darlin  
  
Take my little heart and open wide  
Hey baby I know we can work it out  
Might take a little mojo workin baby  
But aint that what love is all about  
  
Hey Baby must be somethin bout this  
Push and pull  
Makes me wonder if we stir it up  
Just to make sure thingsll never get dull  
  
Come on baby take the gloves off  
And then untie those shoes  
I got something more tantalizin  
For you left and right to do  
  
Chorus
