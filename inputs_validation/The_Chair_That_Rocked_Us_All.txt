I called you all together for in just an hour or two  
Therell be an auction on the square that just might interest you  
Its the first time Ive seen most of you since mama passed away  
And that old chair that rocked us all will be auctioned off today  
  
Well I guess you know of course I lost the farm that daddy sweated all his
life to keep  
And even worked sometimes by moonlight when all of us kids were sound to
asleep  
Now I guess we were all just too busy fulfilling each ones worldly dreams  
To even care when they took the old chair along with all the other things  
You know if you could capture all the love that we found in that old chair  
  
Why you could wipe out all the hatred in this old world  
And youd still have a lotta love to spare  
Now all I ask and its not too much is just go with me down to the square  
And lets take a look among all the other things at mamas old rocking chair  
And look at all the teeth marks put there when we were small  
Just go with me for one last look at the chair that rocked us all
