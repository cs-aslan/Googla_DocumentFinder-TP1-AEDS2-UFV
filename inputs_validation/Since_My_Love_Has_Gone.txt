1853 wasserman aaron neville  
Oh Im lonely and left with tears and sorrow  
I cant face tomorrow since my love has gone  
Hes left me left me for another and my heart went with him  
How can I go on  
Was our love a game played for a day  
Were you pretending two hearts gone astray  
Am I to blame for this unhappy ending  
Nothing else is left me but a memory  
Beloved how I long to hold you in my arms enfold you  
Live again out happiness but now I can face tomorrow alone  
Since my love has gone
