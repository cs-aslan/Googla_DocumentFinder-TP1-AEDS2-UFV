Shouldve listened when you said Id miss you  
Shouldve listened but I could not hear  
You said Id want you back  
I said not a chance  
Now I can see I was so blind  
  
Youre right I was wrong  
To ever leave you  
I made a mistake  
Im sorry now  
  
Youre right I was wrong  
To ever let you go  
Now I know now I know  
Youre right I was wrong  
  
Couldnt see it when I had you with me  
Couldnt see that I had everything  
And now I see it clear  
And youre not here  
You said someday Id change my mind  
  
Youre right I was wrong  
To ever leave you  
I made a mistake  
Im sorry now  
  
Youre right I was wrong  
To ever let you go  
Now I know now I know  
Youre right I was wrong  
  
If I could have one more chance to hold you  
I would keep you here in my arms  
And never let you go  
Because now I know  
  
Youre right I was wrong  
To ever leave you  
I made a mistake  
Im sorry now  
  
Youre right I was wrong  
To ever let you go  
Now I know baby now I know  
Youre right I was wrong
