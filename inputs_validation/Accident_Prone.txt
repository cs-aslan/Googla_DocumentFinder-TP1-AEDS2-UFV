Im a layby lover  
And youre just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
Cause Im accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun  
  
They say the devil loves his own  
And lady you just got the roll  
He drives you modusoperandi  
Well lady you dont get this soul  
What you call love I cant take no more  
Go knock on someone elses door  
  
Im a layby lover  
And youre just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
Cause Im accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun  
  
Cause you specialise your own kind of lies  
Lady you just hit and run  
I just want to say you keep driving that way  
And one day you will be undone  
  
I try to love you my way  
But lady you just wouldnt slow down  
You drove a right on through me  
When other guys came around  
What you call love wouldnt give to a stray  
I wouldnt treat a dog that way  
  
Im a layby lover  
And youre just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
cause Im accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun  
  
Cause you specialise your own kind of lies  
Lady you just hit and run  
I just want to say you keep driving that way  
And one day you will be undone  
  
One day youll have to slow down  
And lady it could be too late  
You keep on acceleratin  
And lady I could see your fate  
Noone wants a secondhand car  
They know it been push too far  
  
Im a layby lover  
And youre just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
Cause Im accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun  
  
Cause you specialise your own kind of lies  
Lady you just hit and run  
Youre dragginme down with this riding around  
And one day you will be undone  
  
Im a layby lover  
And youre just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
Cause Im accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun
