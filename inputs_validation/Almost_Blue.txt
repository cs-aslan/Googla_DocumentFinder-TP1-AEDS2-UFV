Almost blue  
Almost doing things we used to do  
Theres a girl here and shes almost you almost  
All the things that your eyes once promised  
I see in hers too  
Now your eyes are red from crying  
  
Almost blue  
Flirting with this disaster became me  
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be  
  
Almost blue  
Its almost touching it will almost do  
There is part of me thats always truealways  
Not all good things come to an end now it is only a chosen few  
Ive seen such an unhappy couple  
  
Almost me  
Almost you  
Almost blue
