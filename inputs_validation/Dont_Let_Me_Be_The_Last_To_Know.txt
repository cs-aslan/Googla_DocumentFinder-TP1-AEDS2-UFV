My friends say youre so into me  
And that you need me desperately  
They say you say were so complete  
  
But I need to hear it straight from you  
If you want me to believe its true  
Ive been waiting for so long it hurts  
I want to hear you say the words please  
  
Chorus  
Dont dont let me be the last to know  
Dont hold back just let it go  
I need to hear you say  
You need me all the way  
Oh if you love me so  
Dont let me be the last to know  
  
Ooh  
  
Your body language says so much  
Yeah I feel it in the way you touch  
But til you say the words its not enough  
Come on and tell me youre in love please  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on baby come on darling ooh yeah  
Come on let me be the one  
Come on now oh yeah  
  
I need to hear you say  
You love me all the way  
And I dont want to wait another day  
I want to feel the way you feel  
Oh come on  
  
Dont just let me be the one  
Dont hold back just let it go  
I need to hear you say  
You need me all the way  
So baby if you love me  
Dont let me be the last to know
