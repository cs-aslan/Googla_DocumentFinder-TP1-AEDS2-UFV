Heres a little story I gotta tell  
Bout this boy I know so well  
Back in the day was cool and all  
He fell in love I fell in love  
I thought he was the one for me  
Other boys I could not see  
And look what happened to our love  
Im like how could it be  
  
It shoulda been me and you  
It coulda been you and me  
But boy you broke my heart  
And now Im standing there  
It shoulda been me and you  
It coulda been you and me  
  
Now all I got are these photographs  
All Ive got  
All Ive got  
All Ive got  
Are these photographs  
All Ive got  
All Ive got  
  
Its nothing without you you you  
Got nothing without you you you  
Got nothing without you  
  
Now baby its killing me  
Im saying its killing me  
The fact that you aint around  
Baby Im falling down  
I need me a remedy  
Been looking for remedies  
I need you to be around  
Baby Im hurting now  
I know youre a better man when I was your girl  
This land is a better land when youre in my world  
  
Today will be better babe  
If it were like yesterday so happy and lovely  
Hey hey hey  
  
All Ive got  
All Ive got  
All Ive got  
Are these photographs  
All Ive got  
All Ive got  
  
Its nothing without you you you  
Got nothing without you you you  
Got nothing without you  
  
All Ive got are these photographs  
I remember when I used to make you laugh  
I dont wanna be stuck in the past  
But youre all that I have that I had  
And I dont wanna lose what weve felt this far  
This is me and you youre my superstar  
Ill give anything baby heres my heart  
My heart my heart  
  
My heart dont stop  
My heart be beating over  
My loving never stops  
Even though that its over  
Girl I been reminiscing  
With that way that Casanova  
Way back when we was kissing on your grand mommas sofa  
Girl I got us lovey dubby on my photo album  
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein  
You had your Guess jeans on  
Looking sexy on home  
Girl why couldnt I be the one  
  
Why why why  
Why couldnt I be the one  
Why why why  
Why couldnt you be the one  
Why why why  
Why couldnt you be the one  
Why why why  
  
All Ive got  
All Ive got  
Its nothing without you  
All Ive got  
All Ive got  
Its nothing without you you you  
Its nothing without you you you  
Its nothing without you  
All Ive got  
Its nothing without  
All Ive got  
Its nothing without  
All Ive got  
All Ive got are these photographs
