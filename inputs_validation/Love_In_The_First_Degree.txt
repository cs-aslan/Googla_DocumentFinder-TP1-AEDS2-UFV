I once thought of love as a prison  
a place I didnt want to be  
So long ago I made a decision  
to be footloose and fancyfree  
  
But you came and I was so tempted  
to gamble on love just one time  
I never thought that I would get caught  
It seemed like the perfect crime  
  
Chorus  
Baby you left me defenseless  
Ive only got one plea  
Lock me away inside of your love  
and throw away the key  
Im guiltyof love in the first degree  
  
I thought it would be so simple  
like a thousand times before  
Id take what I wanted and just walk away  
but I never made it to the door  
  
Now babe Im not beggin for mercy  
go ahead and throw the book at me  
If lovin yous a crime  
I know that Im as guilty as a man can be  
  
Chorus  
  
Love in the first degree ohoh yeah  
Love in the first degree  
Oh Yeeeaaaah  
  
Chorus
