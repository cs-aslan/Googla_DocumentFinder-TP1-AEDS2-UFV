The night is falling like an angel on your memory  
And we are well acquainted  
We are sworn enemies  
And the lonely beating of my heart tonight is only one more thing  
I gotta fight  
  
Well I think about you baby days of heaven that we had  
Then I get to thinking maybe maybe too much thinkings bad  
Well my mind takes no prisoners pities no one  
Spares not even me till the harm is done  
  
Here I go again  
The night just walked in  
In walks the night  
In walks my fantasy  
Darkness all around me  
And Im dying for the light  
  
I reach down for a little strength deep inside  
Well I know I love my freedom but lonely feelings come and go  
And night time is a season  
Feel the cold wind blow  
  
And I toss and I turn and I walk the floor  
I dont want to cry dont want to cry no more  
Here I go again the night just walked in  
In walks the night  
  
In walks my fantasy  
Darkness all around me  
And Im dying for the light I reach down for a little strength deep inside  
I reach down for my sanity  
If only these eyes could see through all the emptiness I found around me  
In walks the night  
  
I can almost feel you in the darkness all around  
Still Im waiting for the break of day  
Waiting for a miracle a dream that wont wander away  
Well my mind takes no prisoners pities no one  
It spares not even me till the harm is done  
  
Here I go again  
The night just walked in  
In walks the night  
In walks my fantasy  
Darkness all around me  
And Im dying for the light  
  
I reach down for a little strength deep inside  
I reach down for my sanity  
If only these eyes would see through all the emptiness I found around me  
  
In walks the night  
The night just walked in  
In walks the night  
The night just walked in  
Maybe Ill be all right  
In walks the night
