You will search babe at any cost  
But how long babe can you search for whats not lost   
Everybody will help you  
Some people are very kind  
But if I can save you any time  
Come on give it to me  
Ill keep it with mine  
  
I cant help it if you might think I am odd  
If I say Im not loving you for what you are  
But for what youre not  
Everybody will help you  
Discover what you set out to find  
But if I can save you any time  
Come on give it to me  
Ill keep it with mine  
  
The train leaves at half past ten  
But itll be back tomorrow same time again  
The conductor hes weary  
Still stuck on the line  
But if I can save you any time  
Come on give it to me  
Ill keep it with mine
