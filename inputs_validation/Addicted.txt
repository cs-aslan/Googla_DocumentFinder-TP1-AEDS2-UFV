Its like youre a drug  
Its like youre a demon I cant face down  
Its like Im stuck  
Its like Im running from you all the time  
And I know I let you have all the power  
Its like the only company I seek is misery all around  
Its like youre a leech  
Sucking the life from me  
Its like I cant breathe  
Without you inside of me  
And I know I let you have all the power  
And I realize Im never gonna quit you over time  
  
Its like I cant breathe  
Its like I cant see anything  
Nothing but you  
Im addicted to you  
Its like I cant think  
Without you interrupting me  
In my thoughts  
In my dreams  
Youve taken over me  
Its like Im not me  
Its like Im not me  
  
Its like Im lost  
Its like Im giving up slowly  
Its like youre a ghost thats haunting me  
Leave me alone  
And I know these voices in my head  
Are mine alone  
And I know Ill never change my ways  
If I dont give you up now  
  
Its like I cant breathe  
Its like I cant see anything  
Nothing but you  
Im addicted to you  
Its like I cant think  
Without you interrupting me  
In my thoughts  
In my dreams  
Youve taken over me  
Its like Im not me  
Its like Im not me  
  
Im hooked on you I need a fix I cant take it  
Just one more hit I promise I can deal with it  
Ill handle it quit it just one more time then thats it  
Just a little bit more to get me through this
