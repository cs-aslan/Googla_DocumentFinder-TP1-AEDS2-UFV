Come on over tonight  
Well put on some Catt Butt and  
Do it up right  
No need to get all caught up  
In societies stipulations  
Youre a member of the freak generation  
Youre gonna burn to have delation  
When the pendulum swings it cuts  
When the big door swings open and shuts  
Yeah well be middleage children  
But so what  
I havent changed so drastically  
They can talk so sarcastically  
Theyll bust up  
But well bust in  
Get my down back up again  
When the pendulum swings it cuts  
When the big door swings open and shuts  
Ohhhh well be swollen   
But so what  
When the pendulum swings it cuts  
When the big door swings open and shuts  
Yeah well be middlechildren  
But so what  
Ohhhh well be swollen  
But so what
