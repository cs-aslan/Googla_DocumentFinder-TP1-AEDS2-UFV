Play me some music and pour me some wine  
Im in the mood now I got love on my mind  
I want you to know that I like it real slow  
And whenever your ready you can slide off my clothes  
And touch my body anywhere  
Im yours tonight make it right  
Baby just take me there  
  
Chorus  
Take your time and work me slowly work it  
Cause Im the kind of girl  
Who needs the kind of guy  
That can last work it  
Dont need a man around  
If hes throwin down too fast  
You gotta work me slowly  
  
Now change your position and keep it right there  
Just go with my motions rub you hands through my hair  
I hope you dont mind it if I let out a scream  
Cause its feeling to good to me its more than I dreamed  
Its more than pleasure its ecstasy  
Up and down round and round  
Baby just come with me take your time  
  
Chorus  
  
Then in the morning  
Well do it all over again  
do it all over again  
I dont want this feeling to never end  
I cant believe how your loving me  
You give me all  
I cant believe your still stroking me  
Cause baby your taking it all  
  
Chorus
