Repeat x2  
If you see my friend  
Doesnt matter where or when  
Tell me if you see Kay  
Tell me if you see Kay  
  
She said I won the battle but I lost the war  
And now my head is sore  
And if I try sail back in  
Shes gon push me from the shore  
Now I wont ever get the time of day  
No way no way no  
Now for what I said  
But for what I didnt say Repeat x2  
So  
  
Chorus  
If you see kay  
Will you tell her that I love her  
If you see kay  
Let her know I want her back  
If she listens  
Say Im missing everything about her  
Make sure you say Im sweet FA  
Without her  
If you see kay  
  
She got me saying sorry through the door  
She dont care anymore  
She says its too late now  
Should have thought of this before  
But I aint gonna take this as defeat  
No way No way no  
Cos Im gonna shout it out to everyone  
Everyone I meet  
  
Chorus  
  
Now Im sitting here in disbelief  
At how it truly broke my heart to have to watch her leave  
But she was torn between what she wants and what she needs  
They say you love someone enough you gotta set them free  
She said that was born to leave this town behind  
Knew the truth but still she looked me in the eyes and lied  
Saying its time to cut the ties  
Time to say goodbye So she left  
But she never never left my never never left my mind  
  
Chorus
