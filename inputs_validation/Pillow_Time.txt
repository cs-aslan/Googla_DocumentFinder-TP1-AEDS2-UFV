Theres a wonderland for Alice  
Theres a tall beanstalk for Jack  
The sleepy train will take you there  
So safely down the track  
With the sandman at the throttle  
Youll be off to dreams and back  
Its pillow time again  
  
You will meet all your storybook friends  
As you go down Mother Goose Lane  
Romp with Jack and Jill  
Up and down the hill  
And try to put Humpty together again  
  
Close your sleepy eyes and listen  
While we take a little hop  
The candy whistles blowin  
Dont you miss your station stop  
So good night my wee way fairer  
Pleasant dreams to you oh tot  
Its pillow time again  
  
You will meet all your storybook friends

The candy whistles blowin  
Dont you miss your station stop  
So good night my wee way fairer  
Pleasant dreams to you oh tot  
Its pillow time again  
  
Its pillow time again
