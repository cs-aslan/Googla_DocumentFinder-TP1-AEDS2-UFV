You came to see me when the moon was new  
Saw you standin in the pouring rain  
Left my message on the window pain  
Back on the street again  
Back on the beat again  
Im back on the top again  
  
Saw me climbing to the top of the hill  
You saw me meeting with the fools on the hill  
Learned my lesson and I had my fill  
Learnt it all in vain  
Went through it all again  
Now Im back on the top again  
  
Always strivin always climbing way beyond my will  
Same old sensation isolation at the top of the bill  
Always seeming like Im moving but Im really going slow  
What do you do when you get to the top and theres nowhere to go  
  
Just how I get there will be anybodys guess  
With all the so called trappings of success  
Left all the deadbeats on the top of the hill  
Too busy raisin Cain  
Im back on the street again  
Im back on the top again  
  
Always strivin always climbing way beyond my will  
Its the same old sensation isolation at the top of the hill  
Always seeming like Im moving but Im really going slow  
Youll find out when you get to the top that theres nowhere to go  
  
How you get there will be anybodys guess  
With all the so called trappings of success  
Left all the deadbeats on the top of the hill  
Too busy raisin Cain  
Im back on the street again  
Im back on the top again  
  
Back on my feet again  
Im back on the street again  
Im back on the top again
