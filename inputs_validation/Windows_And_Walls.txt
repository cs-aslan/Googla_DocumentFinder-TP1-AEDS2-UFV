Up every morning long before day  
Cooking her breakfast alone  
She quietly dresses  
And pulls up the shade  
And sits in the chair by the phone  
  
But nobody ever comes by anymore  
Nobody ever calls  
Most days she sits and just stares  
At the windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
  
Children all married  
Husbands passed on  
Nothing but time on her hands  
Most of her mornings  
Are spent in her dreams  
Or making her sad little plans  
  
Maybe shell go to the corner today  
And pick up the new McCalls  
If just to escape for an hour  
From her windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
  
The clock on the mantel  
Chiming the hours  
Must be the loneliest sound  
She washes her dishes  
And waters her flowers  
And afterwards has to sit down  
  
Sometimes she still  
Can remember a child  
Playing with china dolls  
Now all that shes left  
Are these memories  
And windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
Windows and walls
