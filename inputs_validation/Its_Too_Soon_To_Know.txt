Does he love me  
Its too soon to know  
Can I believe him  
When he tells me so  
And is he fooling  
Is this all a game  
Am I the fire  
Or just another flame  
A one sided love  
Would break my heart  
He may be just  
Acting and playing a part  
If he dont love me  
Let him tell me so  
And I cant hold him  
If he wants to go  
And though Ill cry  
When hes gone  
I wont die  
Ill live on  
If its so  
Its too soon  
Way too soon to know  
And though Ill cry  
When hes gone  
I wont die  
Ill live on  
If its so  
Its too soon  
Way too soon to know
