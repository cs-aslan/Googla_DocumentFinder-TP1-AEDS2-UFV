Sanctuary  
Is what you  
Are to me

Can find  
The words to say  
How much  
I love you  
Hallelujah  
Its bout time I found someone Whose gonna love me  
For me  
Hey Miss Beloved  
Since you come into my life  
And unlocked the door  
To my heart  
Ive been free  
  
Many have called  
But the chosen are few

Thats why Im so happy  
Woman  
To be lying next to you

You put the light at the end of my  
Tunnel

And you did not let me die  
When it looks like life was gettin away  
From me  
Ohhh  
You loved  
And clothed  
And you fed me woman

Let your rain fall down

We can cuddle up together

We can weather any storm  
A family that prays together  
Will stay together
