She used to drive a beat up pickup  
Down around San Antone  
Stealin the heart of every guy in town  
Includin the one I own  
But this sweet young thing of seventeen  
Would sting you with the lovesick blues  
Just a blonde haired blue eyed picture of sin  
Lookin for someone to use  
Shes a lover n fighter shes a wild bull rider  
And Im wonderin why she left me such a long time ago  
Shes a heartbreaker shes a love taker  
But she can break a heart and take all the love she needs  
Ooh well I heard she got down in beaumont  
And she wound up in El Paso  
She was tuff as a boot and thin as a rail  
And she could step to the cotton eyed joe  
If you run across this flagrant fuzzy  
I slip in and I get her while you can  
Cause far too long shell be good as gone  
And runnin with another man  
Shes a lover n fighter shes a wild bull rider  
And Im wonderin why she left me such a long time ago  
And shes a heartbreaker shes a love taker  
She can break a heart and take all the love she needs  
Shes a heartbreaker shes a love taker  
Well she can break a heart and take all the love she needs
