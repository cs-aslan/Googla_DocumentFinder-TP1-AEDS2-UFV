Chorus  
Shes a brickhouse  
Mighty might just lettin it all hang out  
Shes a brickhouse  
The ladys stacked and thats a fact  
Aint holding nothing back  
  
Shes a brickhouse  
Shes the one the only one  
Whos built like a amazon pronounced amakazawn  
Were together everybody knows  
And heres how the story goes  
  
She knows she got everything  
A woman needs to get a man yeah  
How can she lose with what she use  
362436 what a winning hand  
  
Chorus  
  
The clothes she wears the sexy ways  
Make an old man wish for younger days  
She knows shes built and knows how to please  
Sure enough to knock a man to his knees  
  
Chorus  
  
Shake it down shake it down now repeat
