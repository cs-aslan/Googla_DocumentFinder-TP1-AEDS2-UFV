We see him dancing in the morning  
Stars depart the yawning sky  
Hell take the hour that is passing  
And leave it in his lovers eye  
And if you want hell make it seem  
As though youre walking in his dream  
A mystic sea  
  
We hear him laughing in the shadows  
As he smuggles in the sand  
Hes found another kind of color  
In the magic he has donned  
And if you want hell take the time  
To ask the sun and moon to rhyme  
And then combine  
He draws no lines between what hes imagining
