Your boyfriend he  
Went down on one knee  
Well could it be  
Hes only got one knee  
  
I tried to surprise you  
With Vodka  
Or Tizer  
I cant quite quite remember  
But you didnt thank me  
You didnt even thank me  
Because you never do  
  
Your boyfriend he  
Has the gift of the gab  
Or could it be  
The gift of the grab  
I tried to surprise you  
I lay down beside you  
Andnothing much happened  
And you didnt phone me  
You didnt even phone me  
Because its not your style  
To dial  
  
Your boyfriend he  
Has displayed to me  
More than just a  
Real hint of cruelty  
I tried to surprise you  
I crept up behind you  
With a homeless chihuahua  
You cooed for an hour  
You handed him back and said   
Youll never guess  Im bored now
