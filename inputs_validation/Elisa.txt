Elisa  
Bee Gees  
  
All that I need is just a piece of paper  
Say a few lines make up my mind  
so she can read it later when Im gone  
Elisa goodbye  Elisa  
  
All that I need is just a quiet corner  
Bring to the light  things I must write  
Got to get it over with choose  
Elisa  goodbye Elisa  
  
The song that I sing  
The times Ive tried to hide it  
Im sorry to say Im going away  
Thats what Ive decided on  
Ive tried  
Elisa  goodbye Elisa  
  
Goodbye Elisa  
Elisa goodbye  
Elisa goodbye  
Elisa Elisa
