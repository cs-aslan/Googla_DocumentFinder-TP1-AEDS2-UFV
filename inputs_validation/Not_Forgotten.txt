I am not forgotten  
I am not forgotten  
I am not forgotten  
God knows my name  
He knows my name  
Light over darkness  
Strength over weakness  
Joy over sadness  
He knows my name  
Father to the fatherless  
Friend to the friendless  
Hope for the hopeless  
He knows my name  
I will praise You I will praise You  
For I am fearfully and wonderfully made  
I am not forgotten never forsaken  
I am not forgotten  
I am not forgotten  
I am not forgotten  
God knows my name  
He knows my name  
Do you realize that youre alive  
At the greatest time in history  
We are the chosen generation  
We are the chosen generation  
Were gonna change the world  
Were gonna change the world
