I cant I cant make love to your memory  
I cant put my arms around what used to be  
Everything I had was apart of me  
Well you went and it walked out that front door with you  
  
My friends tell me itll be alright  
But my friends never no never held you close at night  
Every dream I had that could see the light  
Well you went and it walked out the front door with you  
Well you went and it walked out that front door with you  
  
I never knew I never thought that youd take my love and tear it apart  
I gave you my best when I gave you my heart  
Oh are you listening Or is this all in vain yeah  
I still cant believe youre never comin back again  
  
Everything I had oh except my pain  
Well you went and it walked out the front door with you  
Well you went and it walked out that front door with you hey yeah  
Well you went and it walked well you went and it walked  
Right out the front door with you  
Well you went and it walked right out  
Never comin back no more  
Right out
