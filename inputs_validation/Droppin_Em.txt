Just like Pauline you allin  
  
Oh  
Brace yourself Im the ace with grace  
Ima win the race and make you feel disgrace  
In any case yo Im moving like a steeplechase  
MC soldiers about face  
Now step off I need room for my takeoff  
My custom made lyrics slays yours are soft  
I think you better tape this yo you cant escape this  
Yo I planned it out just like a landscapist  
Whippersnapper back up for coming crap up  
I plan to trap a MC and kidnap em  
Phony so skip the baloney  
You and your cronies need to jump on a pony  
And roll cause youre just a rookie  
When it was time for rap school you must of played hooky  
Im the showstopper your rhymes are improper  
Ima teach you like the master taught the grasshopper  
Just getting warmer Im a transform a  
Regular rhyme into a barnstormer  
Try to jump Ill bump you chump my job is thorough  
Any MC state city or boroughll get ragged  
I drop like a sandbag  
Serious as the mob I dont play tag  
Best of the batch no man can catch up  
Hoes cant be passed a battles a mis match  
I flip lyrics like a acrobat  
And avoid combat like a diplomat  
But when its time for back lash jacked or killed  
Its a thrill to drill a run of the mill Bill  
With my skill Im the lord of the rhymes  
And I be writing at a rate that pace way past my bedtime  
I rock the mic unlike  
Some brothers I know I guess they flow pysch  
Im dropping em  
  
Dropping em  
  
Yo youre all in stiff as a mannequin  
Im sharp as a pen and Ima teach discipline  
I get busy like its two of me  
Evidently Im hated by a few MCs  
But so what I just max like Im playing the sax  
And take the crowd to the climax  
Yo Cool J Ill never go astray  
Im funky you can hear me at the Milky Way  
Youre weak wick raps Im cool as jazz  
Got razzmatazz ask my man Shabazz  
I know youre afraid because Im selfmade  
I invade and blow up like a hand grenade  
MCs are terrorstruck Ima run amuck  
Cause your rhymes suck you made a record on potluck  
Just a toy boy cant stop my convoy  
Rhymes I said last year were just decoys  
Im like a fox you annoy me like chicken pox  
Im back with a style thats unorthodox  
You must of had a teaspoon full of bull  
Im like The Hulk with more bulk Im powerful  
They try to get with this to me thats an insult  
Boys shouldnt mess with an adult thats too difficult  
I enter like a giant saying fee fi foe fum  
Then rock the auditorium until its pandemonium  
Im dropping em  
  
Yo E dropping em  
  
Dont sleep cause Ima go deeper  
All you sleepers Im the Grim Reaper  
My rhymes are rising the angles getting steeper  
I hated Mussolini Martini so Ima sweep a  
Emcee like hes one of the two  
Break him into fragments right in front of you  
Mic check one two is too fundamental  
My rhymes are monumental over an instrumental  
In the center I had to enter  
Tormentor mentor experimenter and inventor  
Of lyrics so all you nonbelievers  
Itll echo in your dreams at night when you receive a  
Rude awakening you cant do anything  
You enter my kingdom and you cry as men bring  
Gifts to the prince of excellence and magnificence  
Alarm clock rings you wake up and youre convinced  
That the crew invader soloist exterminator  
Greater evader of ducks concert crusader  
Is bad my nicknames the circuit breaker  
Eating up the world acre by acre  
Im dropping em  
  
Word to mother dropping em  
Know what Im saying Straight til 1999 dropping em  
Yo year two thousand ya know what Im saying  
Audi man  
  
Yo Im dropping em
