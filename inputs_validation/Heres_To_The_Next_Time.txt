Like I said baby  
If you go astray  
Well then go on  
Go your own sweet way  
I thought you knew by now  
You do just what you please  
And heres to the next time  
Heres to the next time  
  
How many times  
Have you gone before  
And how many times  
Have I forgiven you once more  
Never had to wait  
Like I waited for you  
And heres to the next time  
Heres to the next time  
  
When youre gone  
The time drags by  
I wish youd learn  
Not to make me cry  
To make me cry  
  
So if youre gonna leave me  
Never to come back  
Break it to me gently  
Or my world will crack  
So be sure to let me know  
That Ill never say  
Heres to the next time  
Heres to the next time  
Heres to the next time
