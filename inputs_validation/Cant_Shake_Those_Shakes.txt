Blind in my one good eye  
My mind just wont reply  
Somethin from way down south  
Kinda formin a dust in my mouth  
Lookin for a place to hide  
Lookin for a space to die  
Rattlin like an old tin can  
Im cruisin like a laundry van  
Hot n cold fever down to my knees  
Wearin out all of my rosary beads  
  
Cant shake those shakes  
Can t shake those shakes no more  
Cant shake those shakes  
Feels like Im dyin when Im already dead  
  
Date with my medicine man  
He got the remedies I understand  
Gotta find the price to pay  
Gonna send me on my way  
Gotta desperate need gotta feed the fire  
I got a chemical love and a burned out desire  
  
Cant shake those shakes  
Cant shake those shakes no more  
Cant shake those shakes eels like Im dyin  
When Im already dead Im dead  
  
Dont care for sentiment dont even pay my rent  
Got enough bad habits to blame  
Got enough of them to keep me sane  
Losin altitude in this neighborhood  
Cant break the fall though I know that I should  
  
Cant shake those shakes
