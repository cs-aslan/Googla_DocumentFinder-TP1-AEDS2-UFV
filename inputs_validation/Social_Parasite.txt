You say you dont like the way we look  
Well fuck off  
I aint some dying dog that you can kick  
So fuck off  
Its so easy to fall into that hole  
And youre the one who cast me in that role  
If you loved me would you call me a social parasite  
And whos the one to tell me whether its wrong or right  
You say you dont like the place I live  
Well get out  
There aint no vacancy in my bed  
So get out  
Its so easy to fall into that hole  
And youre the one who cast me in that role  
If you loved me would you call me a social parasite  
And whos the one to tell me whether its wrong or right  
If you loved me would you call me a social parasite  
And whos the one to tell me whether its wrong or right  
1 2 3 Go  
You say you dont like the way we look  
Well fuck off  
I aint some dying dog that you can kick  
So fuck off  
Its so easy to fall into that hole  
And youre the one who cast me in that role  
If you loved me would you call me a social parasite  
And whos the one to tell me whether its wrong or right  
If you loved me would you call me a social parasite  
And whos the one to tell me whether its wrong or right
