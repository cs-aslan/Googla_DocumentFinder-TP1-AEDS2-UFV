A lovely poignant song  
About a man fated to be kept apart from his true love  
  
well sometimes I dream of gettin outta here  
Headin down towards them old tracks  
I swore Id come and get her  
But I know I aint never goin back  
  
theres nights I cant sleep  
No matter how hard I try  
So from my window I watch the moonlight  
Fall on the far hillside  
  
I imagine I put on my jacket  
Go down to this little roadside bar  
Pick a stranger and spin around the dance floor  
To a mexican guitar
