JayZ  
We got brothers full of Armi mamis in Manolo  
Bags by Chanel all Louis Vuitton logos  
All attracted to Hov because they know dough  
When they see him whips be European  
If youre a ten chances youre with him  
If youre a five you know you ridin with them  
Sick with the pen nigga no physician in the world could fix him  
No prescription you could prescribe to subside his affliction  
Hes not a sane man hes more like reign man  twitchin  
You cant rain dance on his picnic  
No Haitian voodoo no headless chickens can dead his sickness  
No Ouija board you cant see me dog nigga you cb4

And Im the franchise like a Houston Rocket Yao Ming

Verse Three Kanye West  
She playin she hate when Im name droppin  
So when I talk rap she gon change topics  
But I got a plan B thats planned out for when things dont pan out  
Hov tellin ya mind brother Ima play shy brother  
So you take the Destiny Child girl in the Coupe  
Then Ima try bag the ones that got kicked out the group  
I figured thatll be simple Ill just help em with their demo  
Help em to the limo play the upboard instrumentals  
And she  grabbed my tattoo peeped my credentials  
And she  grabbed my pants felt the potential  
And I  rubbed bout every essential  
That have fun breakin her fundamentals  
Excuse me miss the artist of the new millenium  
Has finally stopped drivin that blue Millenium  
And got a good of trenny and filled it with plenty of Henney  
And Remi and weed til she higher than Hilliam  
  
Hook  
If she pass me smoke that lalala
