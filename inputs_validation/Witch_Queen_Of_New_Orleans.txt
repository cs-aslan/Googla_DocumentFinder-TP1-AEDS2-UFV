Im gonna tell you a story  
Strange as it now seems  
Of zombie voodoo gris gris and  
The witch queen of New Orleans  
She lived in a world of magic  
Possessed by the devils skew  
From a shack near the swamp lands  
Of mud pie brick  
Marie stirred her witches brew

Dime or a nickel any one could buy  
Voodoo of any kind  
She had potions and lotions herbs and tanna leaves  
Guaranteed to blow your mind  
Early one mornin into mucky swamp dew  
Vanished Marie with hate in her eyes  
Though shell never return all the Cajuns knew  
A witch queen never dies
