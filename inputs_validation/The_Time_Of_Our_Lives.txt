Seems like were holding on forever  
I gotta let it go  
Times up you pushed me to surrender tonight  
Who knows whats happens now whatever  
Wherever the wind blows  
And Im there as long as were together  
Alright  
  
Lets have the time of our lives  
Like theres no one else around  
Just throw your hands up high  
Even when they try to take us down  
Well have the time of our lives  
Till the lights burn out  
Lets laugh until we cry  
Life is only what you make it now  
Lets have the time of our lives  
  
Dreamers dont care if its right  
I think Im really into you  
Restless lets leave it all behind  
And tonight  
  
Crazy when you cross my mind  
Oh the trouble we could get into  
So what lets just give this a try  
Alright  
  
Lets have the time of our lives  
Like theres no one else around  
Just throw your hands up high  
Even when they try to take us down  
Well have the time of our lives  
Till the lights burn out  
Lets laugh until we cry  
Life is only what you make it now  
Lets have the time of our lives  
  
Lookin back what are we waitin for  
Take the chance  
Nows all we got for sure  
  
Lets have the time of our lives  
Like theres no one else around  
Just throw your hands up high  
Even when they try to take us down  
Well have the time of our lives  
Till the lights burn out  
Lets laugh until we cry  
Life is only what you make it now  
Lets have the time of our lives
