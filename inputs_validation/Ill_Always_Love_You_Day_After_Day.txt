Day after day Ill always love you  
Where just to say Ill always love you  
Dear one your nearness is my treasure  
Dear one your kiss is rich as wine  
And its mine yes its mine the wonder of you  
Yours love is yours because I love you  
To you I give my heart so madly madly beating  
With every beat repeating Ill always love you so  
And its mine yes its mine the wonder of you  
Yours love is yours because I love you  
To you I give my heart so madly madly beating  
With every beat repeating Ill always love you so
