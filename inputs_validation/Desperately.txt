Every night its the same  
I hear you callin my name  
Youre lyin next to me  
I give into your charms  
You disappear in my arms  
I realize its just a dream but  
  
Chorus  
Desperately I long to feel your touch  
But you left me all alone in love  
  
And now I  
Shake the sleep from my head  
And try to crawl out of bed  
Today is just another day  
I make the coffee for one  
I turn the radio on  
Pretend that everythings ok but  
  
Chorus  
  
And now I  
Know theres no reason to smile  
Its gonna take me awhile  
Cause I still love you desperately  
  
Chorus  
  
And now I  
Watch the sun goin down  
There aint nobody around  
I feel a night in the breeze  
I keep on tellin myself  
I dont need nobody else  
And I can do as I please but  
  
Chorus  
  
And now I  
  
Chorus  
  
And now  
Every night its the same  
I hear you callin my name  
I still love you desperately  
I still love you  
I still want you  
I still love you desperately
