Richard talks too slow  
Hed get interrupted long before  
I always loved that guy  
And hes not on TV anymore  
To get before he had  
The wherewithal to get out before  
He had the wherewithal  
  
Youve got to coax him slow  
Thats the only way that hell confess  
Tell him that the truth will  
Help him live with less  
To get out before he had the wherewithal  
To get out before he had the wherewithal  
Thats a breathy body of work  
Set your sights inward for a leaner look  
  
Richard died real slow  
He wont get interrupted anymore  
I always loved that guy  
And hes not on TV anymore  
To get out before he had the  
Wherewithal to get out before  
He had the wherewithal
