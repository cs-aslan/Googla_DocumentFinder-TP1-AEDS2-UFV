  
  
  
  
Jesus wrote a blank check  
  
One I havent cashed quite yet  
  
I hope Ive got a little more time  
  
I hope its not the end of the line  
  
Yeah Jesus wrote a blank check  
  
One I havent cashed yet all right  
  
But if I had to choose a number  
  
Id want it to be number one  
  
I dont want to be number two  
  
Yeah I dont want to be number four  
  
But I can hear a knock on the door  
  
Jesus wrote a blank check all right  
  
If Jesus saw me dying  
  
Would angels come a flying down  
  
I hope Ive got a little more time  
  
I hope somebody lends me a dime  
  
Now Jesus wrote a blank check  
  
Ah one I havent cashed yet  
  
Still I build my towers high  
  
I watch them pierce the blue blue sky  
  
Still I wallow in the mire  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire  
  
Still I build my towers high  
  
I watch them pierce the blue blue sky  
  
Still I wallow in the mire  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire
