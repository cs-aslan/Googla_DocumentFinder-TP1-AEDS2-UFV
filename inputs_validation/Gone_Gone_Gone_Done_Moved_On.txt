Some sunny dayhay baby  
When everything seems okay baby  
Youll wake up and find out youre alone  
Cause Ill be gone  
Gone gone gone really gone  
Gone gagone cause you done me wrong  
  
Everyone that you meet baby  
As you walk down the street baby  
Will ask you why youre walkin all alone  
Why youre on your own  
Just say Im gone  
Gone gone gone  
Gone gagone cause you done me wrong  
  
If you change your way baby  
You might get me to stay baby  
Ya better hurry up if ya dont wanna be alone  
Or Ill be gone  
Gone gone gone  
Really gone  
Gone gagone  
Cause you done me wrong
