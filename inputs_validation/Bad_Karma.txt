Was it something I did  
In another life  
I try and try  
But nothing comes out right  
For me  
Bad Karma  
  
Killing me by degrees  
I took a wrong turn  
On the astral plane  
Now I keep on thinkin  
My luck is gonna change  
Someday  
Bad Karma  
  
Its uphill all the way  
I cant run Cant hide  
Cant get away  
It must be my destiny  
The same thing happens to me every day  
Bad Karma  
  
Coming after me  
Bad Karma  
Killing me by degrees  
Bad Karma  
Bad Karma  
  
Its a dogs life  
And its not my fault  
Ought to hang my picture  
In the AllTime Losers  
Hall of Fame  
Bad Karma  
  
Its a lowdown dirty shame  
I cant run Cant hide  
Cant get away  
It must be my destiny  
The same thing happens to me every day  
Bad Karma  
  
Coming after me  
Bad Karma  
Killing me by degrees  
Bad Karma  
Bad Karma
