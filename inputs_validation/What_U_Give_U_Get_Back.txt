Lyrics Klaus Meine Rudolf Schenker  
  
What you give you get back  
As long as I can think Ive been  
Running to be free  
Theres not a place that could have been too far  
Had nothing but a bag of dreams  
And this old guitar  
A couple of songs to play for you an me  
Theres so much love inside of me  
That wants to be released  
I cant help it so I give it all away  
What you give you get it back  
So take my love just because its all I have  
Take my heart take my soul  
I just never want it back  
As long as Ive been living  
Ive had music in my veins  
I cant go on without it anymore  
My suitcase is a wanderer  
That takes me I believe  
For a walk right across your heart  
Theres so much love inside of you  
That wants to be released  
And all you gotta do is let it go  
What you give you get back  
So take my love just because its all I have  
Take my heart take my soul  
I just never want it back  
Cause the love you give is the love youll get  
Theres so much love inside of me  
That wants to be released  
I cant help it so I gave it all away  
What you give you get back  
So take my love just because its all I have  
What you give you get back  
So take my love just because its all I have  
Take my heart take my soul  
I just never want it back  
Cause your love your love is all I have  
All I have  
Love is all we have  
All I have
