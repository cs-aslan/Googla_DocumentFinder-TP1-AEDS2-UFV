Every good man needs a helping hand  
so I travel alone if I can  
Every man has a guiding star  
and he knows what hes gonna get  
when hes going too far  
  
Living on the dark side once again  
Its sad to lose a friend  
Looking at things with empty feelings  
Still were going on  
  
For Every good man needs a helping hand  
I should have known too  
Some of us learn too late Im sorry  
Every good man needs a helping hand  
Its true
