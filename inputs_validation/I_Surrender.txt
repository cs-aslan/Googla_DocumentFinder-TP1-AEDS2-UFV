I surrender to your heart babe  
Do anything that you want me to do  
Please be tender Im in your hands girl  
This is a feeling I never knew  
You know I tried to make it on my own  
Thats not the way it was meant to be  
Spend my time waiting by the phone  
Oh darling come back to me  
  
I surrender I surrender  
Im giving up the role of pretender  
Oh be tender Girl be tender  
Cant you feel the love that I send her  
I surrender  
  
I remember seems like a lifetime  
Cant believe its a matter of days  
Since you left me Im near to heartbreak  
I want you so bad dont turn away  
What does it take to stay by my side  
You know Ill do what you want me to  
Dont take away this feeling inside  
Im still in love with you  
  
I surrender I surrender  
Im giving up the role of pretender  
I remember I remember  
Cant you feel the love that I send her  
I surrender  
  
I surrender I surrender  
Darling now wont you be tender  
Surrender oh surrender  
Feel the love that I send her  
I surrender
