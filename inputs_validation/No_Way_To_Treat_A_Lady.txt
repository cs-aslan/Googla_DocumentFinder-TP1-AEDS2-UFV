You can please me  
You can sweet talk and lead me on  
But believe me  
Wont be long till Im catching on  
Now you left me here with nothing  
And you put my love on hold  
Well there must be something behind those eyes  
Because I believe every lie you told  
  
That aint no way to treat a lady  
That aint no way to treat a woman in love  
That aint no way to treat a lady  
I could of sworn that youd had enough  
  
So you leave me  
Well Im lonely and in despair  
It intrigues me  
How you dont really seem to care  
Well I aint here for nothing  
And my love doesnt come that cheap  
I will hold you to all your promises  
If I could find one you meant to keep  
  
That aint aint no way to treat a lady  
That aint no way to treat a woman in love  
That aint aint no way to treat a lady  
That aint no way no way to treat a woman in love  
  
You can tease me  
You can sweet talk and lead me on  
But believe me  
Wont be long till Im catching on  
For I aint here for nothing  
And my love doesnt come that cheap  
And I will hold you to all your promises  
If I could find one you meant to keep
