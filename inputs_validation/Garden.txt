The direction of the eye  
So misleading  
The defection of the soul  
Nauseously quick  
I dont question  
Our existence  
I just question  
Our modern needs  
  
I will walk with my hands bound  
I will walk with my face blood  
I will walk with my shadow flag  
  
Into your garden  
Garden of stone  
After all is done  
Were still alone  
I wont be taken  
Yet Ill go  
  
I will walk with my hands bound  
I will walk with my face blood  
I will walk with my shadow flag  
  
Into your garden  
Garden of stone  
I dont show  
I dont share  
I dont need  
What you have to give
