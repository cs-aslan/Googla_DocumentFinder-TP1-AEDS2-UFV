Maybe Ill be your solider  
Gladly Ill do your business  
For just a taste of what youre holding  
For just a taste you could only mean  
  
Save your summers  
For someone thats afraid to love  
Ill be right here  
Lying in the hands of god  
  
Here it comes diving into to me  
Now the floor is the ceiling  
If you never flew why would you  
Cut the wings off a butterfly fly  
  
Save your summers  
For someone thats afraid to  
Love you knew what I feel  
Then you couldnt be so sure  
Ill be right here  
Lying in the hands of god  
  
Few feel angels in your head  
Tears drop  
Of Joy runs down your face  
You will rise  
  
Feeling me up now drink me  
Skin begins to grow back slowly  
Faster into until Im chocking  
Rinse for my mother  
  
Save your summers  
For someone thats afraid to  
Love you knew what I feel  
Then you couldnt be so sure  
Ill be right here  
Lying in the hands of god  
  
I am in love with my fingers  
Tear drops runs joy off my face  
I will rise  
For someone thats afraid to  
Love you knew what I feel  
Then you couldnt be so sure  
Ill be right here  
Lying in the hands of god  
  
Now the floor is the ceiling  
If you never flew why would you  
Why would you
