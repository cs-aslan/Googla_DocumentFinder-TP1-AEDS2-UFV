It seems like only yesterday  
I sailed from out of Cork  
A wanderer from Erins isle  
I landed in New York  
There wasnt a soul to greet me there  
A stranger on your shore  
But Irish luck was with me here  
And riches came galore  
And now that Im going back again  
To dear old Erins isle  
My friends will meet me on the pier  
And greet me with a smile  
Their faces sure Ive almost forgot  
Ive been so long away  
But me mother will introduce them all  
And this to me will say  
  
Shake hands with your Uncle Mike me boy  
And here is your sister Kate  
And theres the girl you used to swing  
Down by the garden gate  
Shake hands with all of the neighbours  
And kiss the colleens all  
Youre as welcome as the flowers in May  
To dear old Donnegal  
  
Theyll give a party when I go home  
Theyll come from near and far  
Theyll line the roads for miles and miles  
With Irish jauntin cars  
The spiritsll flow and well be gay  
Well fill your hearts with joy  
The piperll play an Irish reel  
To greet the Yankee boy  
Well dance and sing the whole night long  
Such fun as never seen  
The ladsll be decked in corduroy  
The colleens wearin green  
Therell be thousands there that I never saw  
Ive been so long away  
But me mother will introduce them all  
And this to me will say  
  
Shake hands with your Uncle Mike me boy  
And here is your sister Kate  
And theres the girl you used to swing  
Down by the garden gate  
Shake hands with all of the neighbors  
And kiss the colleens all  
Youre as welcome as the flowers in May  
To dear old Donnegal
