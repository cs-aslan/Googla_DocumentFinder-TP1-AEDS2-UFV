Chorus Mary J Blige  
A woman aint supposed to cry  
So why dont you just wipe your eyes dry your eyes  
Youve learned a house is not a home  
When youre living all alone and you want back home  
  
Wyclef  
Wait a minute girl Youre my joy happiness that you bring  
Turn the fall back to spring girl youre my bling  
You a hiphop song I heard for the first time time  
Studied all the words to the rhyme  
Youre my life without you theres no sun theres no moon  
Theres no stars shinin in the niiight  
  
Mary J Blige  
But if I give you a chance would you show me you care  
Be a man no matter what the circumstances  
Ahhhow  
  
Wyclef  
A grown man aint supposed to cry  
So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice  
Blige  
Youve learned a house is not a home  
When youre living all alone and you want back home  
  
Chorus Wyclef  
A grown man aint supposed to cry  
So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice  
What about the baby What about the baby  
Everything gon be alright  
Baby girl Im by your side I apologize
