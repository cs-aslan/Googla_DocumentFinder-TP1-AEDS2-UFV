The rain falls on my windows  
And the coldness runs through my soul  
And the rain falls oh the rain falls  
I dont want to be alone  
I wish that I could Photoshop  
All our bad memories  
Cause the flashbacks oh the flashbacks  
Wont leave me alone  
  
If you come back to me  
Ill be all that you need  
Baby come back to me  
Let me make up for what happened in the past  
  
Baby come back to me  
Ill be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
Boy youre one in a million  
Baby come back to me  
Ill be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
Youre one in a million One in a million  
  
Lower East Side of Manhattan  
She goes shopping for new clothes  
And she buys this and she buys that  
Just leave her alone  
I wish that he would listen to her side of the story  
It isnt that bad it isnt that bad  
And shes wiser for it now  
  
I admit I cheated  
Dont know why I did it  
But I do regret it  
Nothing I can do or say can change the past  
  
Baby come back to me  
Ill be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
Boy youre one in a million  
Baby come back to me  
Ill be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
Youre one in a million One in a million  
  
Everything I ever did  
Heaven knows Im sorry babe  
I was too young to see  
You were always there for me  
And my curiosity got the better of me  
Baby take it easy on me  
  
Anything from A to Z  
Call me what you wanna babe  
I open my heart to thee  
You are my priority  
Cant you see youve punished me  
More than enough already  
Baby take it easy on me  
  
Baby come back to me  
Ill be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
Boy youre one in a million  
Baby come back to me  
Ill be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
Youre one in a million One in a million  
  
Baby come back to me  
Ill be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
Boy youre one in a million  
Baby come back to me  
Ill be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
Youre one in a million One in a million
