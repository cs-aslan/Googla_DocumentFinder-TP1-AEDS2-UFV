Sell the kids for food  
Weather changes moods  
Spring is here again  
Reproductive glands  
  
Hes the one  
Who likes all the pretty songs  
And he likes to sing along  
And he likes to shoot his gun  
But he knows not what it means  
Knows not what it means  
And I say  
Hes the one  
Who likes all the pretty songs  
And he likes to sing along  
And he likes to shoot his gun  
But he knows not what it means  
Knows not what it means  
And I say yeah  
  
We can have some more  
Nature is a whore  
Bruises on the fruit  
Tender age in bloom  
  
Hes the one  
Who likes all the pretty songs  
And he likes to sing along  
And he likes to shoot his gun  
But he knows not what it means  
Knows not what it means  
And I say  
Hes the one  
Who likes all the pretty songs  
And he likes to sing along  
And he likes to shoot his gun  
But he knows not what it means  
Knows not what it means  
And I say yeah  
  
Hes the one  
Who likes all the pretty songs  
And he likes to sing along  
And he likes to shoot his gun  
But he knows not what it means  
Knows not what it means  
And I say  
Hes the one  
Who likes all the pretty songs  
And he likes to sing along  
And he likes to shoot his gun  
But he knows not what it means  
Knows not what it means  
And I say yeah
