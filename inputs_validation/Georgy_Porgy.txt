Its not your situation I just need contemplation over you  
Im not so systematic its just that Im an addict for your love  
  
Not the only one that holds you I never ever should have told you  
Youre my only girl  
Im not the only one that holds you I never ever should have told you  
Youre my only world  
  
Just think how long Ive known you its long for me to own you lock and key  
Its really not confusing Im just the young illusion cant you see  
  
Im not the only one that holds you I never ever should have told you  
Youre my only girl  
Im not the only one that holds you I never ever should have told you  
Youre my only world
