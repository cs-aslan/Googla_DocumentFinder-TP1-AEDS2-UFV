Silver bells are ringing  
Carolers are singing  
Snowflakes drifting  
Through the air  
Everybodys shopping  
Got no time for stopping  
It looks like Christmas is here  
  
So tell me  
How do I wrap my heart up for Christmas  
I wanna give it to you  
Pretty bows and ribbons  
Dont fit the gift Im givin  
Your lovin ares will have to do  
  
At first I though of giving you  
A pretty diamond ring  
Wore myself out shopping  
For a million other things  
Finally decided  
On something you cant buy  
But how will I disguise it  
So you will be surprised  
  
How do I wrap my heart up for Christmas  
I wanna give it to you  
Pretty bows and ribbons  
Dont fit the gift Im givin  
Your lovin ares will have to do  
  
A gift of love was given to  
The world so long ago  
Laying in a manger  
He was wrapped in swadlin clothes  
And every year we celebrate  
And thank the Lord above  
And give to one another  
Our little gifts of love  
  
How do I wrap my heart up for Christmas  
I wanna give it to you  
Pretty bows and ribbons  
Dont fit the gift Im givin  
Your lovin ares will have to do  
  
Pretty bows and ribbons  
Dont fit the gift Im givin  
Your lovin ares will have to do
