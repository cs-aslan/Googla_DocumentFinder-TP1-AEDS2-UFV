Everybodys talkin bout something  
A lot of static and a lot of nothin  
Pollutin the air with who the hell cares kinda gossip  
Headlines to spare in our pockets in our pockets  
Its a shame but we could all stop it  
Tell a neighbor tell a friend it aint a 60s thing  
We still need a little help  
  
Chorus  
Rumor bout a revolution  
Spread a little soul solution  
Let it stir in the wind  
Come on let a chance begin  
Raise a hand not a fist  
Yeah ignorance aint bliss if it leaves us in ruins  
Rumor bout a revolution  
  
Aint it easy passing judgment  
Just to entertain ourselves  
Im not here pointing fingers  
Been guilty myself  
You see theres a bigger picture  
With a million point of views  
Well love aint a color  
Its a damn strong mother  
And it aint gonna lie  
  
Rumor bout a revolution  
Spread a little soul solution  
Let it stir in the wind  
Come on let a chance begin  
Raise a hand not a fist  
Yeah ignorance aint bliss if it leaves us in ruins  
Rumor bout a revolution  
  
Tell a neighbor tell a friend it aint a 60s thing  
We still need a little help  
  
Chorus
