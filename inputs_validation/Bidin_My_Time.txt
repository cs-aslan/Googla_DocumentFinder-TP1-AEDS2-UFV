Some fellers like to tiptoe through the tulips  
Some fellers go on singin in the rain  
Some fellers keep on painting skies with rainbows  
Some fellers go on singin down the lane  
  
Bidin my time  
Cause thats the kind of guy Im  
While other folks grow dizzy Ill keep busy  
Bidin my time  
  
Next year Next year  
Somethings bound to happen  
This year this year  
Ill just keep on nappin  
  
Bidin my time  
Thats the kind of guy Im  
Theres no regrettin when Im settin  
Bidin my time  
  
Bidin my time  
Thats the kind of guy Im  
While other grow dizzy Ill keep busy  
Bidin my time  
  
Next year Next year  
Somethings bound to happen  
This year this year  
Ill just keep on nappin  
  
Bidin my time  
Thats the kind of guy Im  
Theres no regrettin when Im settin  
Bidin my time
