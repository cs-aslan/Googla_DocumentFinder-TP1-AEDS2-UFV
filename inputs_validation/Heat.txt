Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat  
Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Ahhh  
They said I couldnt come no harder  
Cant sleep on this heat dont bother  
They said I couldnt they said I couldnt  
Cant sleep on this heat dont bother  
I see you with your favorite dress on again  
I guess you thought that you were slick  
But I already peeped  
You got your tag tucked in  
Youre strugglin  
Tryin to look cute in your best friends boots  
But they dont hardly fit  
Why you back again  
Tryin to steal my man  
I told you once before but  
You dont hear me  
I aint who you think Im is  
I will snatch off all this ish  
You think I wont come out these heels  
And make it clear  
I aint the one  
You think I wont fuck up my hair  
And take it there  
I aint the one  
Keep your hands up off my boo  
Aint no telling what Ill do  
What makes you think you fly enough to  
Take my man no  
Sho aint the one  
Sho aint the one  
I aint the one  
All these JOs want whats mine  
But they done lost their mind  
They on him like the ice cream man  
Night and day  
Why I got to fight to keep em all away  
They crammin but they know  
They cant have none  
Obsessin but theyre messin with the wrong one  
I aint who you think Im is  
I will snatch off all this ish  
You think I wont come out these heels  
And make it clear  
I aint the one  
You think I wont fuck up my hair  
And take it there  
I aint the one  
Keep your hands up off my boo  
Aint no telling what Ill do  
What makes you think you fly enough to  
Take my man no  
I aint the one  
They said I couldnt come no harder  
Cant sleep on this heat dont bother  
They said I couldnt come no harder  
Cant sleep on this heat dont bother  
They said I couldnt come no harder  
Cant sleep on this heat dont bother  
They said I couldnt they said I couldnt  
Cant sleep on this heat dont bother  
You think I wont come out these heels  
And make it clear  
I aint the one  
You think I wont fuck up my hair  
And take it there  
I aint the one  
Keep your hands up off my boo  
Aint no telling what Ill do  
What makes you think you fly enough to  
Take my man  
I aint the one  
Sho aint the one  
Sho aint the one
