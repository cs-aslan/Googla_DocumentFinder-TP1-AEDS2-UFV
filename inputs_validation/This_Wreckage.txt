And what if Gods dead  
We must have done something wrong  
This dark facade ends  
Were independent from someone  
  
This wreckage I call me  
Would like to frame your voice  
This wreckage I call me  
Would like to meet you  
Meet you  
Soon  
  
We write suggestions  
Suggesting fading to silence  
And that must please you  
My mirrors tarnished with nohelp  
  
This wreckage I call me  
Would like to frame your voice  
This wreckage I call me  
Would like to meet you  
Meet you  
Soon  
  
Turn out these eyes  
Wipe off my face  
Erase me  
  
Replay the end  
Its all just show  
Erase you  
  
I need to  
I need to  
I need to  
  
This wreckage I call me  
Would like to frame your voice  
This wreckage I call me  
Would like to leave you  
Leave you  
Leave you  
Leave you soon
