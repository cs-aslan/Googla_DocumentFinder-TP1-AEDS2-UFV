Theres a noble fleet of whalers  
Theyre sailing from Dundee  
Manned by British sailors  
That take them oer the sea  
On a western ocean passage  
We started on the trip  
We flew along just like a song  
On a gallant whaling ship  
Was the second Sunday morning  
Just after leaving port  
We met a heavy souwest gale  
And washed away our boat  
It washed away our quarterdeck  
Our stanchions just as well  
And so we set the whole shebang  
Afloatin in the gale  
  
Chorus  
For the wind was on our quarter  
The engines working free  
Theres not another whaler  
That sails the arctic sea  
Cant beat the Old Polina  
You need not try my sons  
We challenged all both great and small  
From Dundee to St Johns  
  
Art Jackman set his canvas  
Fair Weather galloped steam  
And Captain Guy the daring boy  
Came plunging through the stream  
And Mullins in the Husky  
Tried to beat the bloody lot  
But to beat the Old Polina boys  
Was something he could not  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres the noble terra Nova  
A model without doubt  
The Arctic and Aurora  
They talk so much about  
Art Jackmans model mail boat  
The terror of the sea  
Tried to beat the Old Polina  
On a passage from Dundee  
  
Chorus  
  
Now were back in old St Johns  
Where rum is very cheap  
Well drink a health of Captain Guy  
Who brought us oer the deep  
A health to all our sweethearts  
And to our wives so fair  
Not another ship could make the trip  
The Polina I declare  
  
Chorus x2
