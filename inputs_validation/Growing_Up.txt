Your life begins when teardrops start a broken toy a broken heart  
All of these things are just a part of growing up  
From kiddie cars to walking shoes from lullabyes to lonely blues  
Somehow you never quite get used to growing up  
Yeah Yeah youre growing up yeah Yeah youre growing up  
Its good to know youre growing up  
  
The wheel of fortune takes a spin  
Sometimes you lose sometimes you win  
But you must play the game again  
Drink another cupYoure growing up  
Yeah Yeah youre growing up yeah yeah youre growing up  
Its good to know youre growing up  
  
Heeeeey eeeeey now little one youre growing up  
Heeeeey eeeeey now little one youre growing up  
To be a man to be a woman to understand takes a lot of growing growing up  
Youll live to learn youll learn to live youll give to love your love to
give  
And when youre wise enough youll know youre growing up
