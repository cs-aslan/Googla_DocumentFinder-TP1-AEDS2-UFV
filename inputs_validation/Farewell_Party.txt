When the last breath of life is gone from my body and my lips are as cold as
the sea  
When my friends gather round to my farewell party  
Please wont you pretend you love me  
Therell be flowers from those wholl cry when Ill go  
And leave you in this old world alone  
Will you shed a tear at my farewell party or will you be glad when Im gone  
Dont be angry with me a wanting to keep you  
Till my life in this old world is done and through  
Youll be free at the end of my farewell party but Ill go away loving you  
Therell be flowers from those
