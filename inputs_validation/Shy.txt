Chorus  
Can you shelter me  
From this anxiety  
Hey baby dont look me in the eye  
Cause Im sexually shy shy shy  
Sexually shy shy shy  
  
I dont know why  
With other girls Im fine  
But with you baby Im shy shy shy  
I hate for you to see me like this  
Cause nowhere else in my life  
Does this exist  
  
Chorus  
  
Every time we talk  
I cant catch my breath  
I want a conversation  
But I scare myself  
I really cant hide behind this lie  
Cause with you baby  
Im shy shy shy  
  
Woman  
Well Im ashamed to say  
Woman  
That Im afraid this way  
Woman  
Yeah  
Woman  
I gotta stop acting so crazy  
  
Chorus x3  
  
I dont know why  
With other girls Im fine  
But with you baby Im shy shy shy  
I dont know why  
With other women Im fine  
But with you baby Im shy shy shy  
  
I dont know why  
I dont know why
