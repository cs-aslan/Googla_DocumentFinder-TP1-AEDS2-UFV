Im wide awake  
Im wide awake  
  
Im wide awake  
Yeah I was in the dark  
I was falling hard  
With an open heart  
Im wide awake  
How did I read the stars so wrong  
  
Im wide awake  
And now its clear to me  
That everything you see  
Aint always what it seems  
Im wide awake  
Yeah I was dreaming for so long  
  
I wish I knew then  
What I know now  
Wouldnt dive in  
Wouldnt bow down  
Gravity hurts  
You made it so sweet  
Till I woke up on  
On the concrete  
  
Chorus  
Falling from cloud nine  
Crashing from the high  
Im letting go tonight  
Im falling from cloud to night  
  
Im wide awake  
Not losing any sleep  
Picked up every piece  
And landed on my feet  
Im wide awake  
Need nothing to complete myself no  
  
Im wide awake  
Yeah I am born again  
Out of the lions den  
I dont have to pretend  
And its too late  
The storys over now the end  
  
I wish I knew then  
What I know now  
Wouldnt dive in  
Wouldnt bow down  
Gravity hurts  
You made it so sweet  
Till I woke up on  
On the concrete  
  
Chorus  
  
Thunder rumbling  
Castles crumbling  
I am trying to hold on  
God knows that I tried  
Seeing the bright side  
But Im not blind anymore  
Im wide awake  
Im wide awake  
  
Chorus  
  
Im wide awake  
Im wide awake  
Im wide awake  
Im wide awake  
Im wide awake
