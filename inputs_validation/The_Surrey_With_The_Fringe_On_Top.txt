When I take you out tonight with me  
Honey heres the way its gonna be  
You will sit behind a team of snow white horses  
In the slickest gig youve ever seen  
  
Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry  
When I take you out in the surrey  
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top  
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters  
When I drive them high steppen strutters  
Nosy pokes will peek through their shutters and their eyes will pop  
  
The wheels are yellow the upholstrys brown  
The dashboards genuine leather  
With Isinglass curtains you can roll right down  
In case theres a change in the weather  
  
Two bright side lights winkin and blinkin  
Aint no finer rig Im a thinkin  
You can keep your rig if youre thinkin that Id keer to swap  
Fer that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top  
  
Would you say the fringe was made of silk  
Wouldnt have no other kind but silk  
Has it really got a team of snow white horses  
Ones like snow the others more like milk  
  
All the worldll fly in a flurry  
When I take you out in the surrey  
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top  
When we hit that road hellforleather  
Cats and dogs will dance in the heather  
Birds and frogs will sing all together and the toads will hop  
The windll whistle as we rattle along  
The cowsll moo in the clover  
The river will ripple out a whispered song  
And whisper over and over  
Dont you wish youd go on forever  
Dont you wish youd go on forever  
Dont you wish youd go on forever  
And youd never stop  
In that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top  
  
I can see the stars gettin blurry  
When we ride back home in the surrey  
Ridin slowly home on the surrey  
With the fringe on top  
I can feel the day gettin older  
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder  
Noddin droopin close to my shoulder  
Till it falls kerplop  
  
The sun is swimming on the rim of a hill  
The moon is taking a header  
And just when Im thinking all the earth is still  
A larkll wake up in the meader  
  
Hush you bird My babys a sleepin  
Maybe got a dream worth a keepin  
Whoa you team and just keep a creepin  
At a slow clip clop  
Dont you hurry little surrey  
With the fringe on the top
