So she smiled at you when you saw her today  
And youre still thinking bout the things she had to say  
She said leaving you was hard to do and its sad we had to part  
But dont let it go to your heart  
So she told you she thinks of you now and then  
Now youre thinking she might take you back again  
But its only cause shes lonely and shes about to fall apart  
So dont let it go to your heart  
Cause Im your heart and I can tell you that it doesnt mean a thing  
Shes just like you she hangs on to a helpless hopeless dream  
Shes made the break and its hard to take  
As you watch her teardrops start  
But dont let it go to your heart  
 guitar   
Cause Im your heart  
No dont let it go to your heart
