I woke up this morning  
Then I went back to bed  
Said I woke up this morning  
Then I went right back to bed  
Got a funny kind of feelin like I got broken glass in my underwear  
And a herd of wild pigs is trying to chew off my head  
You know what Im sayin  
  
Well I aint got not money  
Im just walkin down the road  
Said I aint got no money honey  
So Im just walking down this lonely old road  
Well I wish I could get me some money  
But I forgot my automated teller code  
  
I was born in a paper sack in the bottom of a sewer  
I had to eat dirt clods for breakfast my family was so poor  
My daddy was a waitress my mama sold bathroom tiles  
My brothers and sisters all hated me cause I was an only child  
  
I got the blues so bad woo  
Kinda wish I was dead  
Maybe Ill blow my brains out mama  
Or maybe Ill yeah maybe Ill just go bowlin instead  
  
Im just a no good scum sucking nose picking boot licking  
Sniveling groveling worthless hunk of slime  
  
Nothing but a lowdown beer bellied bone headed pigeon toed  
Turkey necked weasel faced worthless hunk of slime  
  
Guess I pretty low self image  
Maybe its a chemical imbalance or something I  
I should probably go and see a doctor about it when Ive got the time  
Make it talk  
Aw make it talk son make it talk  
OK now make it shut up  
  
Plagues and famine and pestilence always seem to get me down  
I always feel so miserable whenever Im around  
I wish somebody would come along stick a pitchfork through my brain  
Id flush myself right down the toilet but Id just clog up the drain  
  
I got the blues so bad  
Kinda wish I was dead  
Maybe Ill blow my brains out mama  
Or maybe Ill go bowling  
Or I just might go bowling  
Maybe Ill just rent some shoes and go bowling  
Maybe Ill join a league enter a tournament put on a stupid looking  
Shirt and go bowling instead  
Yeah
