Now every woman is entitled to one mistake  
The Lord knows Ive made one  
But baby forgive me half a chance  
I wanna make it up to you  
  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
Whos calling me oh whos calling me  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
  
When I told you I was through  
And I told you  
To move on  
I didnt know Id miss you so  
But baby I was wrong  
Those nights without your love  
They aint worth thinking of ha ha  
  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
Oh woman save your breath  
Little woman save your breath  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
  
When you told me you was through  
And you told me to move on  
I found a sweeter love than you  
And it didnt take me long  
  
No now baby please dont you do that to me  
I need your crazy kisses so to rock me tenderly  
Those nights without your love  
They aint worth thinking of ha ha  
  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
Im never coming back aint never coming back  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
  
Now Im pleading with you baby  
What you got to say about it  
I aint coming honey  
  
Now please Ill apologize  
I admit I was wrong  
Ill help you all I can  
But aint coming remember  
I told you Id get on my feet again  
  
Now wait a minute Jack Ill help you  
I told you I was sorry  
Baby I done found someone else
