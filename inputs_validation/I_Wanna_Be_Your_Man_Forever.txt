Chorus  
Youre such a pretty little thing  
I want to put a wedding ring on your finger  
Baby cant you see that we were meant to be together  
Yeah the joinin of our hearts is written in the stars  
Weve got a love made in heaven  
So baby take my hand I want to be your man forever  
  
Well I cant think of anyone else its true  
All day long theres no one on my mind but you  
And I have loved you since you were a little girl  
You mean everything to me and youre all Ill ever need in this world  
  
Chorus  
  
Every time I look into your eyes I see  
The one I want beside me for eternity  
You could make me the happiest man alive  
By settin up a date and takin my name for life  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Baby take my hand I want to be your man forever
