Headed south on 65 route 5 or 6 Ill drive  
Theres a place where the folks from dixie go  
You dont need no cowboy boots tradeem in for a bathing suit  
Hang out on the Gulf Of Mexico  
  
On a weekend holiday  
We dont parlez vous francais  
Turnin it up from a sunny day  
Then we dance the night away  
On the redneck riviera  
On the reded neck riviera  
On the redneck riviera  
Its a paradise oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Sippin hospitality under proud umbrella trees  
Good ol boys and the long necks scattered round  
Girls come rushin from a far when I strum Louie Louie on my old guitar  
String bikini happy hunting ground  
  
Chorus  
  
We dont have to parlez vous francais  
Well the surf is up in Alabam  
Mississippi Florida and the Gulf shore sand  
Stoke your fire with a sunny day yeah  
Just like them folks in St Tropez  
  
On the redneck riviera  
On the reded neck riviera  
On the redneck riviera  
Its a paradise oh yeah  
Its a paradise oh yeah  
Its a paradise Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Oh the surf is up in Florida down  
Panama City to the Destin Sound  
You can stoke your fire with a sunny day yeah  
Just like them folks in St Topez  
  
Hey this is the south  
Not the south of France
