Listen here this will only be  
A small portion of your nighttime  
That youll sacrifice for me  
I asked and you were born  
And like the wind you snuck up on me  
Got me begging for your storm  
  
Fiftytwo fifty more days until I come back from war  
Im gonna lock you up and love you down  
I cant take this anymore  
Nights are old but I am young  
Across the sea writing letters home  
Answer me let me hear your voice  
I cant take it anymore  
  
And I dont know were youve gone  
Theres so much more you need to know  
  
Take it slow now  
Smooth running  
Live the day cool  
Smooth running  
Show me strength  
True loving  
And trust me girl  
True loving  
  
Listen here this will only be  
A small portion of your lifetime  
That youll sacrifice for me  
I asked and your were born  
Like the snow you fall upon me  
Got me begging for some more  
  
Fiftytwo fifty more days until I come back from war  
Im gonna love you up  
And love you down  
Id cross the world just to  
Hear your sound  
  
Reign on love  
Reign on love  
Reign on love  
Rain
