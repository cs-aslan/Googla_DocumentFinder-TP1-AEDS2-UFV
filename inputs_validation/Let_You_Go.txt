You were amazing in ways I never knew  
Its driving me crazy but I cant get over you  
You were holding on and I was letting go  
Looking for a love I thought I could control  
All the things we said when we had a fight  
Now I realize that I was wrong and you were right  
  
But its all right now  
I need you back somehow  
  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you  
  
I never held you the way Id hold you now  
I wish I could change it the way it all came down  
Its killing me to know I let you get away  
Holding on to all the things I didnt say  
I thought I couldnt be the way you wanted me  
But there is more to love than I could ever see  
  
But its all right now  
I need you back somehow  
  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
  
Lets turn it around  
I know that its love that Ive found  
And I promise I wont let you down  
  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go
