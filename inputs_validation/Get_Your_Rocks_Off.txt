By Bob Dylan  
  
You know theres two ol maids layin in the bed  
One picked herself up an the other one she said  
Get your rocks off  
Get your rocks off Get em off  
Get your rocks off Get em off  
Get your rocks offa me Get em off  
  
Well you know there late one night up on Blueberry Hill  
One man turned to the other man and said with a bloodcurdlin chill he
said  
Get your rocks off Get em off  
Get your rocks off Get em off  
Get your rocks off Get em off  
Get your rocks offa me Get em off  
  
Well you know we was layin down around Mink Muscle Creek  
One man said to the other man he began to speak he said  
Get your rocks off Get em off  
Get your rocks off Get em off  
Get your rocks off Get em off  
Get your rocks offa me Get em off  
  
Well you know we was cruisin down the highway in a Greyhound bus  
All kindsa children in the side road they was hollerin at us sayin  
Get your rocks off Get em off  
Get your rocks off Get em off  
Get your rocks off Get em off  
Get your rocks offa me
