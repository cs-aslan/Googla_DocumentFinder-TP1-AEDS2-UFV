I heard about the rock for sometime I know  
Its easy to do when you feel the roll  
Makes you want to get up makes you want to move your feet  
No matter how its done you know it cant be beat  
Cause I cant stop rockin  
no I cant stop rockin  
Well I cant stop rockin  
baby till I lose my mind  
  
Somebody said its wrong but I know its all right  
then it really hits you like a shot in the night  
Im never gonna stop as long as I can stay  
Listen to me now cant you hear me say  
I cant stop rockin  
no I cant stop rockin  
Well I cant stop rockin  
baby till I lose my mind  
  
I like to work it down low I like to work it to the top  
And when it starts rockin I aint never gonna stop  
Get yourself loose get yourself high  
I love to feel the motion and Im tellin you why  
Cause I cant stop rockin  
no I cant stop rockin  
No I cant stop rockin  
no matter what they do do do do do or say  
No matter what you do do do do do or say no no
