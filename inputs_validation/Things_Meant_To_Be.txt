You can find things meant to be  
If you look hard into the sea  
As the waves land on the beach  
I feel her eyes fixed on me  
Through the wind in the trees  
Mother nature she speaks  
Take what she says  
Let your heart do the rest  
Its in the wind  
Its in the trees  
Its in the way you smile  
At me  
Its in the waves up from the sea  
Its in the way you feel  
When youre pleased  
And its all meant to be  
And its all meant to be  
Your heart knows where to go  
But your mind can take it slow  
Its okay to rest your mind  
Let your heart seek and find  
Its in the wind  
Its in the trees  
Listen hard and you  
Will see  
Its in the waves up from the sea  
Its in the way you feel  
When youre pleased  
And its all meant to be  
And its all meant to be  
These are things just meant to be  
These are things like you and me  
Its all meant to be  
Its all meant to be  
These are things just meant to be  
These are things like you and me  
Mother nature sings and breathes
