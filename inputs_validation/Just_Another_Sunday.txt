I know youve been dreaming bout the times in our lives  
But Ive been screaming in my bed late at night  
A space a little little and your stack of pain  
Makes it grip that skull to me child that youll stay  
Youve been in my life so long can I get through to you  
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue  
Theres something I need to say before its to late  
But I wont hold you back while Im begging you to stay  
  
Just another Sunday  
Just another Sunday  
Oh yaaa just another Sunday  
Just another Sunday oh yaaa  
  
Theres too many games in a day for a simple man to face  
That desperate moment in your life where you cant be afraid  
Dont think your second chance will break around the bend  
Cause hearts dont always share love or the person on the other  
End  
Youve been in my life so long can I get through to you  
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue  
Theres something I need to say before its to late  
But I wont hold you back while Im begging you to stay ya  
  
Just another Sunday yaa  
Just another Sunday oh baby  
Its only one more Sunday  
Just another Sunday oh yaaa  
  
Those are tickets for the same plane bring it back to me  
Cause felling the same pain makes half the luxery  
Take a walk away wont end the carousel  
But if walking away can bring you back then I wish you well  
Youve been in my life so long can I get through to you  
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue  
Theres something I need to say before its to late  
But I wont hold you back while Im begging you to stay  
  
Just another Sunday yaa  
Just another Sunday oh baby  
Its only one more Sunday  
Just another Sunday  
Its just another Sunday  
Its just another  
Just another Sunday  
Just another oh yaa  
Just another Sunday
