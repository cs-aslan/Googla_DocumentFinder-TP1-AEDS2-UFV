Youve been crying  
And there aint no use denying  
It was me  
Who put you through this misery  
And Id like to say Im sorry  
But I cant no I cant  
Nothings gonna change me  
Baby thats the way I am  
I was born bad  
Always been the same yes I was born bad  
Never gonna change cause I was born bad  
Only me to blame cause I was born bad  
Yes I was born bad  
Always been my habit I was born bad  
Just cant seem to help it I was born bad  
Always gonna happen I was born bad  
Cause I was born bad  
I mistreat you  
And you know I always cheat you  
But thats me  
And thats the its always been  
And Id like to say Im sorry  
But I cant no I cant  
Nothings gonna change me  
Baby thats the way I am
