Deeper Dig Deeper  
  
Deeper Deeper dig dig Deeper Deeper  
  
Get a little closer  
You dont have to be afraid  
You have to trust your inner pilot  
Dont let it drift away  
  
Dig a little deeper  
You gotta get it in your soul  
Reach out with your spirit  
And let your feelings show  
  
Deeper Deeper dig dig Deeper Deeper  
  
You cant deny the feeling  
That touches you inside  
When youre tired and lonely  
You dont have to lose your pride  
  
Take the time to listen  
Stay a little while  
Got a song to sing for you  
Let the music get you higher higher
