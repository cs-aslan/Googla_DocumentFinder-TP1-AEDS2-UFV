One time a thing occurred to me  
Whats real and whats for sale  
Blew a kiss and tried to take it home  
  
It isnt you isnt me  
Search for things that you cant see  
Going blind out of reach  
Somewhere in the vasoline  
  
Two times and it has rendered me  
Punch drunk and without bail  
Think Id be safer all alone  
  
Flies in the vasoline we are  
Sometimes it blows my mind  
Keep getting stuck here all the time  
  
It isnt you isnt me  
  
Youll see the look  
And youll see the lies  
Youll eat the lies  
And you will  
  
Flies in the vasoline we are  
Sometimes it blows my mind  
Keep getting stuck here all the time  
  
It isnt you isnt me
