Do you know what youre looking for  
Streets of gold fame and fortune  
You didnt fancy working in a factory  
But your mum and dad didnt agree  
  
You slept on Waterloo station at first  
But now youve moved to a posher squat  
You wonder where your next meal will come from  
Still its better than living at home  
  
Youre looking tired cause its been three weeks  
Since you changed your clothes or washed your feet  
But youre learning fast all the time  
How to cadge cigarettes and pills  
  
I dont condemn what you done  
I know what it is to be young  
Youre only searching for today  
To see the answers about yesterday   
And I hope you find
