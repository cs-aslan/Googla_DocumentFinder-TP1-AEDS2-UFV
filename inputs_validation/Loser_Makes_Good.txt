I hate waking up it means that I have to die again tonight  
35 years old and Im still sleeping outside  
Yeah I think I know your face I dont want to to know your name  
I wont give in Im not like that  
I wont give in  
  
You say its Christmas Eve that dont mean nothing to me  
Just another fucked up day just another waste of time  
You wonder why I live like this man you just wont understand  
I wont give in Im not like that  
Yeah I wont give in  
  
You smart ass college fuck  
Act like you think youre tough  
I was just like you  
More pride than you could know  
Think you pity me  
  
Ill kick your ass if you pity me  
I wont give in Im not like that  
No I wont give in to you  
Just go away  
  
You college boy act like you think youre tall  
I wont give in Im not like that  
No I wont give in
