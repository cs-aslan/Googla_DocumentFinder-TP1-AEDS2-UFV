She hangs brightly from the tree  
Wonders what shes done to me  
Im aware of your game  
Come and watch me  
Watch me come down  
Takes me down deep and wide  
Pulls me through to the other side  
Shes the winner of her game  
Come and watch her  
Watch her come down  
It stays down  
Sour in truth  
Lies of lovin  
The storys cheap  
Shes the winner of her game  
Come and watch her  
Watch her come down  
Deep and wide  
Inside inside inside
