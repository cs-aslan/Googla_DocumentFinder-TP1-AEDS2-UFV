Verse one black rob  
  
I met her uptown on dyckman aight then  
Talkin that how she only dealt with businessmen  
Niggaz baggin joints money off and on the books  
The ones who stand firm like aint nuttin shook  
About them I doubt them cats waitin for me  
You know them niggaz them big dudes across the street  
She say yeah they from over on mayfair  
Bullets from out of nowhere told her to stay there and duck down  
I hit the ground but managed to pull a piece out  
This bitch over them with them pointin the chief out  
They want beef out here they gon get it  
In the worst way ima show em how black play  
Roll the dice fuckin with me is like snake eyes  
I break guys sit back and watch my cake rise  
Its all about the benjamins true that be the motto  
Ran out of ammo and started throwin bottles  
Runnin and I aint lookin back for shit  
Crooked ass bitch today I get you back for this  
Ill get you back  
  
Chorus repeat 2x  
  
I love you baby no you dont  
You drive me crazythats right  
Ill never betray theeuhh

Verse two black rob starts rapping during the chorus  
  
Yo since the last altercation I been goin to street  
Seein honey at the club ery week and I speak  
Ima rock that ass to sleep before I strike  
I aint know the real deal until last night  
How one of them brothers was locked with bankroll  
Used to call my crib to see seventyfour  
Kick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the dac  
Babe bro told him you wanna get money see black  
When you get home we never had chance to get up  
And wouldnt have if his gun had left me hit up  
Hed explain how his whole crew was slappin honey  
Besides all that she owed them cats a lot of money  
Funny how its a small world baby girl  
Youse about to get fucked with no jail  
Ima sit back and watch this cake finish bakin  
And plan your extermination word  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse three puff daddy  
  
It took a while to peep your style miss ibeinworkin  
Low profile single house in staten island  
And manhattan while them same cats  
You sent to get me boo is on they to get you  
Fuckin witchu that small time crack dealin nigga  
He a bitch too they gon bust his shit too  
Shits real you think you gonna set me up  
And get away scot free without some type of injury  
Nah kill it ima flip the script on you  
Same thing you did to me ima do it to you  
Who knew she was the female rambo  
Fill one of they chest with four soon as he came in the door  
Life is out snuffed all they mans in  
In the end she had to be the last bitch standin  
Not for long the buck the fortyfour strong  
Just like that she was gone now its over  
Assumin Ill go back to my everyday life  
Of a rich millionaire just rockin the mic  
Gotta pause and think about honey no doubt  
And admire how the chick went out  
  
Chorus repeat to fade
