Ill just turn away theres not need to watch her leaving  
I dont want to let her see me cry  
And the part of me thats breaking  
Is The part that has been taking her for granted  
And thats why she said goodbye  
I twas me that let her down and left her lonely  
But her leaving me was never in my plan  
It started with my lying  
And it ended with me crying  
And shes taken all the lonely she can stand  
Its out of my hands now  
Its over and done  
Shes made her choice now  
And Im not the one  
Shell find her future with some other man  
It was all up to me but I just couldnt see  
Now its out of my hands  
She tried every way she knew to make me happy  
She was more than just a lover and a friend  
I was just too blind to see  
And now she set me free  
So its best to walk away and let it end  
Its out of my hands now  
Its over and done  
Shes made her choice now  
And Im not the one  
Shell find her future with some other man  
It was all up to me but I just couldnt see  
Now its out of my hands
