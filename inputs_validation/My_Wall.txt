And along came something sacred  
I never knew what I found  
The demons dance around elated  
Theyre hurting me  
  
I put my wall up each day  
You tear it down  
I hide in my space  
The space you found  
And one of these days  
Ill come unbound  
The feelings I hate  
Will finally drown  
  
Falling awake in a nightmare  
Images of horror abound  
Thought I stumbled upon salvation  
Hell I found  
  
I put my wall up each day  
You tear it down  
I hide in my space  
The space you found  
And one of these days  
Ill come unbound  
The feelings I hate  
Will finally drown  
  
Well Ill never be the same  
Its the greatest lie ever told  
No Ill never be the same  
I sold my soul  
  
I put my wall up each day  
You tear it down  
I hide in my space  
The space you found  
And one of these days  
Ill come unbound  
The feelings I hate  
Will finally drown
