Ive watched your face for a long time  
Its always the same  
Ive studied the cracks and the wrinkles  
You were always so vain  
Well now you live your life like a shadow  
In the pouring rain  
Oh its called love  
Yes its called love  
Oh its called love  
And it belongs to us  
Oh it dies so quickly  
It grows so slowly  
But when it dies it dies for good  
Its called love  
And it belongs to everyone but us  
  
Ive lived my life in the valleys  
Ive lived my life on the hills  
Ive lived my life on alcohol  
Ive lived my life on pills  
But its called love  
And it belongs to us  
Its called love  
And its the only thing thats worth living for  
Its called love  
And it belongs to us  
Its called love  
Yes its called love  
  
Oh love is found in the east and west  
But when love is at home its the best  
Love is the cure for every evil  
Love is the air that supports the eagle  
Its called love  
And its so uncool  
Its called love  
And somehow its become unmentionable  
Its called love  
And it belongs to every one of us  
Its called love  
And it cuts your life like a broken knife
