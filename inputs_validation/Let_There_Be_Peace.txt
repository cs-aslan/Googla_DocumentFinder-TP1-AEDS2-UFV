Someone let communication out the door  
Someone decides its worth fighting for  
Why havent we learned by what weve done before  
Dont you know historys keeping score  
And just once more  
For every boy and every girl let there be love  
All over the world  
For everyone  
Under the sun  
Chorus  
Let there be peace on earth  
Let every voice be heard  
Le there be peace on earth  
Brother to brother  
til its felt around the world  
Theres only one world in which we all mus live  
Heaven shoe us how to forgive  
And on that marble wall which holds a million names  
Generations of dreams gone down in flames  
Isnt isnt it a shame  
For every boy and every girl  
Under the sun  
Chorus  
Let there be peace on earth  
why dont you try just a little harder  
Let every voice be heard  
my brother  
Let there be peace on earth  
oh if we could just get it together  
til its felt around the world  
Were running out of time  
As our leaders roll the dice  
The human spirit cries  
Its a precious precious precioussacrifice  
Chorus x2  
Save the babies save the babies  
If we only get it together  
If we could only get it together  
I think we could make it  
Think we could make it  
Save the children  
Save the children
