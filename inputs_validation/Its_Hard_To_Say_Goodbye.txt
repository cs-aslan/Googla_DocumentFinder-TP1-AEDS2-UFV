Theres something in the air  
A feeling of danger  
Theres something wrong with you  
I know I see it in your eyes  
Believe me when I say  
Its gonna be okay  
  
I told you from the start  
I wont be demanding  
If you have a change of heart  
Ill be understanding  
I only know just where I stand  
Or where I lie  
  
Believe me when I say  
Well work it out some way  
  
Ill never try to hold you back  
I wouldnt try controlling you  
If its what you want  
Its what I want  
  
I want whats best for you  
And if theres something else  
That your looking for  
Ill be the first to help you try  
  
Believe me when I say  
Its hard to say goodbye  
  
I can tell by the way you lay your head  
In my shoulder  
Your hand is cold as ice your hearts even  
Colder  
  
Its tearing me up inside to think  
No matter how hard I try  
You may still walk away  
  
No matter what I do or say  
If its what you want  
Its what I want  
I want whats best for you  
And if theres something else  
That your looking for  
Ill be the first to help you try  
Believe me when I say  
Its hard to say goodbye
