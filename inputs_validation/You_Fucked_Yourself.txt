You fucked yourself  
And you dont know where to go  
Split wide open like a sturgeon for the row  
Blood was splashed on pure white snow  
  
You fucked yourself  
And youre looking for the go  
Drown in your sink  
Condemned if you float  
You placed the blame but missed the boat  
  
You fucked yourself  
You chose your fate  
You changed your mind  
When its too late  
Your selfdeceit your worst mistake
