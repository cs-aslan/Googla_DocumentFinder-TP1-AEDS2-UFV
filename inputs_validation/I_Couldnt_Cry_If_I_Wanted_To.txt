You ask if I remembered when we first met  
Girl tell me how could I ever forget  
  
There you were standing there  
Aw with ruby lips and the golden hair  
Your beauty seem to hypnotize me  
I had that feeling I was no longer free  
  
But when I ask you for a dance For a dance  
You wouldnt even give me a chance Me a chance  
And it hurt me through and through  
That was the first time I got over you  
  
You had my heart dingling  
Like a puppet on a string  
To you I meant nothing darling  
But to me it meant everything  
Girl you know since then through the years Through the years  
Ive shed so many tears So many tears  
And all because of you I couldnt cry if I wanted to  
  
I dont know why I still love you  
Cause you dont even want me around  
Year after year its the same o thing  
You build me up to let me down  
  
So go on and hurt me Hurt me  
Aw like you did  
This time itll be different  
Mmm my tears youll see no more  
Cause Ive cried so through the years Through the years  
Until I run out of tears Run out of tears  
And all because of you I couldnt cry if I wanted to  
  
Ill never shed another tear  
I couldnt cry no more darling  
Seems as though the pain  
Have gone the tears from my eyes  
Never cry never  
Never no more  
Ill never shed another tear
