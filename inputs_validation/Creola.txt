Creola in my soula  
I loved what they were sayin  
I loved what they were playin  
Creola  
  
CHORUS 1  
Creola on my victrola  
Makes me feel like dancin  
Fall in love romancing the melody  
Creola Creola Creola for me  
  
I remember as a child all the happiness and smiles  
That flowed around my grandmas Sunday table  
While Auntie Mae was sayin grace  
Papa T would sneak a taste  
And catch a funny look from my cousin Mabel  
  
Then daddyd beat the drum  
The old folks start to hum  
Sing the only songs that we all know  
Ambiance so fine dancin drinkin wine  
Sing about the lifestyle on the bayou  
  
CHORUS 2  
Creola in my soula  
I loved what they were sayin  
I loved what they were playin  
Creola  
  
Creola on my victrola  
Makes me feel like dancin  
Fall in love romancin the melody  
Creola Creola Creola for me  
  
Its in the mood its in the blood  
Its in the food its in the mud  
Its a spicy kind of life  
Creola  
  
Its in the mood its in the blood  
Its in the food its in the mud  
Creola Creola Creola for me  
  
INSTRUMENTAL 2 VERSES  
  
Well the years have come and gone  
Still the old song lingers on  
I keep it in my heart with fond affection  
Like the family good luck charm  
That keeps away the harm  
Creolas always there for my protection  
  
CHORUS 3  
Creola good for your soula  
I loved what they were sayin  
I loved what they were playin  
Creola  
  
Creola on my victrola  
Makes me feel like dancin  
You fall in love ramancin the melody  
Creola Creola Creola for me
