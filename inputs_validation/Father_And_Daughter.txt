If you ever awake  
In the mirror of a bad dream  
  
And for a fraction of a second  
You cant remember where you are  
Just open your window  
And follow your memories  
Upstream  
To the meadow in the mountain  
Where we counted every falling star  
  
I believe the light that shines on you  
Will shine on you forever  
forever  
And though I cant guarantee theres nothing scary  
Hidin under your bed  
Im gonna  
Stand guard  
Like the postcard  
Of the golden retriever  
And never leave  
Til I leave you  
With a sweet dream in your head  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna watch you shine  
Gonna watch you grow  
Gonna paint a sign  
So you always know  
As long as one and one is two  
Ooh ooh  
There could never be a father  
Love his daughter more than I love you  
  
Trust your intuition  
Its just like going fishin  
You cast your line and  
Hope you get a bite  
  
But you dont need to waste your time  
Worryin about the marketplace  
Trying to help the human race  
Struggling to survive  
Its as harsh as night  
  
ChorusRepeat x2
