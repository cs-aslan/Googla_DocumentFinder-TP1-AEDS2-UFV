I go back to the water  
When I get nowhere in the air  
I thought you should know its no worse  
Covering ground youve heard before  
  
Its a power of power of power of  
Power of free and easy  
Its a power of power of power of  
Power of free and easy  
  
You weigh a snowflake  
Cause great trees to fall  
Descending  
On perfect arms  
Like Jeff Beck  
To give me the lookahead  
  
I go back to the brusque nurse  
Her heart a bad cake in a melting box  
I thought you should know its no worse  
Her blood is still clear and sanguineous  
  
Its a power of power of power of  
Power of free and easy  
Its a power of power of power of  
Power of free and easy  
  
You weigh a snowflake  
The glamor of the sky  
Descending  
Past perfect eyes  
And hearts leapt  
To give me the lookahead  
Come on honey  
Just give me that lookahead
