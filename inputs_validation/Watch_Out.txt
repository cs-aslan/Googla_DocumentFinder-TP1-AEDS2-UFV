You move like a flame of fire  
Your eyes like a flash of lightning  
You lie since youre cold inside  
And Im gonna tame you wild thing  
Youd better watch out  
I said youd better watch out  
Watch out  
Anywhere you go Ill find you  
Watch out  
Ill be staying close behind you  
And Ive tired of waiting Ohalala  
Yes its driving me crazy Ohalalala  
And my patience is fading Ohalala  
Oh youd better watch out  
I said youd better watch out  
  
You speak and youre funny lately  
You act like I was a stranger  
I think youre beginning to hate me  
But then youre a girl in danger  
  
Youd better watch out  
Ooh I said youd better watch out  
Watch out  
Anywhere you go Ill find you  
Watch out  
Ill be staying close behind you  
And Ive tired of waiting Ohalala  
Yes its driving me crazy Ohalalala  
And my patience is fading Ohalala  
So youd better watch out  
Yes I said youd better watch out  
Watch out  
Watch out  
  
And Ive tired of waiting Ohalala  
Yes its driving me crazy Ohalalala  
And my patience is fading Ohalala  
I said youd better watch out  
Oh girl youd better watch out  
Ah youd better watch out  
Oh ah youd better watch out
