I spend my time sittin on the fence with a mate of mine  
Im tryin to write the line of a story  
  
We believe that everything said is a waste of time  
Cause life is well tried and it bores me  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
In my well paid opinion  
These things they really dont matter  
But from my crystal gazing eye  
There shines a light like dynamite  
  
Sittin on a throne will give a bad back to you  
Livin on my own was like a Flashback  
To the days when I was lost and lonely  
Saying what I said was just a different story  
All your lies man they still bore me  
Theres nothin wrong with my world  
And these things they really dont matter now
