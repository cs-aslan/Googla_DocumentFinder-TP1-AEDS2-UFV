Sliding out of reverse into drive  
This wheel will be turning right then straight  
Off in the sunset shell ride  
  
She can remember a time denied  
Stood by the side of the road  
Spilled like wine now  
Shes out on her own and line high  
  
Theres no leaving here  
Ask Im an ear  
Shes disappeared now  
  
They said that timing was everything  
Made him want to be everywhere  
Theres a lot to be said for nowhere  
  
Theres no leaving here  
Ask Im an ear  
Hes disappeared now  
Theres no leaving here  
Ask Im an ear  
Fuck it Well disappear now
