Yeah  
  
Every night I rock myself to sleep every night I rock myself to sleep  
Every night I rock myself to sleep thinkin about you thinkin about you  
Every night I rock myself to sleep every night I rock myself to sleep  
Every night I rock myself to sleep thinkin about you thinkin about you  
  
And I want to say its not the same since you went away  
And its not right youre not here with me tonight  
And its a crime just lying here wasting my precious time  
Im so lonely and Im so blue thinkin bout the things I could do to you  
  
Every night I rock myself to sleep every night I rock myself to sleep  
Every night I rock myself to sleep thinkin about you thinkin about you  
  
And I want to know dont you see how you hurt me so  
Going out of my head yeah Im here in this empty bed  
And its a crime whoa just lying here wasting my precious time  
Im so lonely baby Im so blue  
Thinkin bout all the things I could do to you  
  
Every night I rock myself to sleep every night I rock myself to sleep  
Every night I rock myself to sleep thinkin about you thinkin about you
