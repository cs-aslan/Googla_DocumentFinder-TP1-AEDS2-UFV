He fell from grace and hit the ground  
They tried in vain to bring him round  
No one saw him make the fall  
They couldnt understand at all  
  
His fall from grace was swift and straight  
The doctors didnt hesitate  
What he had they were not sure  
He didnt have a temperature  
  
His fall from grace was swift and sure  
The doctors said they knew no cure  
They felt and poked and pushed his pulse  
He couldnt understand at all  
  
He fell from grace and hit the ground  
He fell into the sea and drowned  
They saw him struggling from the harbor  
They saw him wave as he went under
