Im the kind of brotha  
Who been doin it my way  
Gettin my bread for years  
In my career  
And every lover  
In and out my life  
I hear love and left the tears  
Without a care  
Until I met this girl who turned the tables around  
She caught me by surprise  
I never thought Id be the one breaking down  
I cant figure it out why  
  
Im so caught up  
Got me feelin it caught up  
I dont know what it is  
But it seems shes got me twisted  
Im so caught up  
Got me feelin it caught up  
Im losin control this girls got a hold on me  
  
Let me go baby  
Now listen  
My momma told me  
Be careful who you do cause karma comes back around  
Same ol song  
But I was so sure  
That it wouldnt happen to me  
cause I know how to put it down  
But I was so wrong  
This girl was mean  
She really turned me out  
Her body was so tight  
Im lookin for her in the daytime with a flashlight  
My homies say this girl is crampin my style  
And I cant figure it out  
  
But Im so caught up  
Got me feelin it caught up  
I dont know what it is  
But it seems shes got me twisted  
  
Im so caught up  
Got me feelin it caught up  
Im losin control  
This girls got a hold  
Im so caught up  
Really feelin it caught up  
I dont know what it is  
But it seems shes got me twisted  
  
Im so caught up  
Really feelin it caught up  
Im losin control  
This girls got a hold on me  
  
And I think I like it baby  
Oh no oh no ooh yeah oh my  
  
This girl was mean  
She really turned me out  
Yeah yeah yeah suga  
My homies say this girl is crampin my style  
Im so caught up caught up  
Dont know what it is  
But it seems shes got me twisted  
Im so caught up
