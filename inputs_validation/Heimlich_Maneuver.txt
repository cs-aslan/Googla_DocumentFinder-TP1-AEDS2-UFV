I love you so much I need the Heimlich Maneuver  
  
The sun goes down on another day  
A day where I havent found love  
I try to eat but all I taste  
Is the flavor of a broken heart  
Then I saw you across the room  
I gasp and my breathing stops  
My hearts in my throat or is it a potato  
  
I love you so much I need the Hiemlich manuver  
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat  
Shes in my thoughts and itll need a jolt to remove her  
My love is consumating while Im asphyxiating  
Over her  
  
When I wake up Im on the floor  
Faint dizzy and alone  
My stomach hurts I think my ribs are cracked  
Not sure if Im in a dream  
I turn my head and there you are  
I call out and my breathing stops  
Its her again crushing my esophagus  
  
I love you so much I need the Hiemlich manuver  
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat  
Shes in my thoughts and itll need a jolt to remove her  
Before my expiration I need resuscitation  
Mouth to mouth  
  
She throws water on my face slaps my cheek  
Helps me back on my stool  
Shes a waitress here but in the night  
Shes a student at nursing school  
She comes again with a smile and the bill  
I pick it up and choke again  
Shes charged me for my lunch and for the medical procedure  
  
I love you so much I need the Hiemlich manuver  
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat  
Shes in my thoughts and itll need a jolt to remove her  
For my lasting endurance Ill need medical insurance  
For my bill  
For me to get some peace Ill need a tracheotomy  
And an airbag
