I went out fishing on a sandy beach  
Cast my line out as far as it would reach  
Looking for something from the frying pan  
I kick back with a beer in my hand  
  
I mustve got a big one cause its bending my pole  
Im having to fight just to keep my hold  
It could be a whale oh God only knows  
Whatever it is its not wearing any clothes  
  
Shes larger than life  
Made from holy water  
Shes covered in green  
Shes got little scales upon her  
Shes larger than life  
Shes a mermaid in the night  
  
Shes got a set of gills like no fish Ive ever seen  
Long blonde hair and a tail in between  
Im in love with a creature from the sea  
And shes bringin out the crustacean in me  
  
Her voice is a temptation its a siren song  
When we kiss there could be no wrong  
I ask her to marry me to be my wife  
And we could do the backstroke for the rest of our lives  
  
Shes larger than life  
Made from holy water  
Shes covered in green  
Shes got little scales upon her  
Shes larger than life  
Shes a mermaid in the night
