Ive tried so hard  
You know I cant do more  
Its the turn of the card  
Its the close of the door  
  
The lies you told  
You know they hurt so deep  
So Ill go home  
And cry myself to sleep  
  
And day after day  
Youve been treating me bad  
Friends come up and say  
Why do you take all that  
  
Cause its making me moan  
And its making me weep  
So Ill go home  
And cry myself to sleep  
  
You play at love  
Like a child plays games  
One day Im in  
Then Im out again  
  
You change the rules  
And I just cant win  
Youve broken me now  
So I give in yeah yeah  
Ive been through worse  
  
But I dont know what  
Oh I gave to you  
Everything that I got  
So take this heart  
Or whats left to keep  
  
And Ill go home  
And cry myself to sleep  
So Ill go home and cry myself to sleep  
Cry myself to sleep
