Capture your soul with a vengeful feast  
I will hunt down and conquer  
Send your best to the grave  
For your crime they all will pay  
I lurk in the shadows entombed in spite filled rage  
No Crow will escape the blade  
For your crime they all will pay  
Hell on your earth  
Hells wrath brought on your head  
Hell on your Earth  
For your crime Ive suffered  
Theyll pay with their blood  
Hell on your Earth  
Hells Wrath brought on your head  
Hell on your earth  
Hells wrath brought on your head  
Hell on your Earth  
For your crime Ive suffered  
Ive suffered  
A 20 year way ends at last  
This revered soldier lays his vengeance down
