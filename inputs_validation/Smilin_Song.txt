Ive done some things that I hadnt oughta  
Like coming home late with the preachers daughter  
Id hit the back door seeing double  
My ol man waiting with a fistful of trouble  
  
Sometimes you lose sometimes youre a winner  
You talk about love I aint no beginner  
Im a sucker for a juke joint jumpin  
I never stop chasin the scent of the woman  
  
Its just the way that Ive always been  
You knock me down Im coming back again  
I sing Ive been there and Ive done that  
I come up smilin song  
  
Ive been on top and Ive hit the bottom  
You talk about hard times Lord Ive got em  
Just keep on runnin and go in full of throttle  
There aint no answer in the bottom of a bottle  
  
Its just the way that Ive always been  
You knock me down Im coming back again  
I sing Ive been there and Ive done that  
I come up smilin song  
  
Come up smilin  
  
Its just the way that Ive always been  
You knock me down Im coming back again  
I sing Ive been there and Ive done that  
I come up smilin song  
  
Its just the way that Ive always been  
You knock me down Im coming back again  
I sing Ive been there and Ive done that  
And I come up smilin song  
  
Oh keep on smilin  
Oh keep on smilin
