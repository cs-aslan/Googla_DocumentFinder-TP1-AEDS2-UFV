Your eyes and my eyes havent talked in quite a while  
Seems like a lifetime since I walked beside your smile  
Theres a dark cloud thats hanging above  
Memories never lie  
Still we talk about the way that it was  
And I think we both know the feeling hasnt died  
  
I wasnt the one who said goodbye oh no  
I wasnt the one who disappeared in the night  
And I wont be the one to say that we cant try  
Da da  
  
Your touch and my touch havent spoken for some time  
You say weve both changed and your always on my mind  
I can tell you that its over and done but I would only lose  
Being close to the want that I want  
So go on and ask me if Im still in love with you  
  
I wasnt the one who said goodbye oh no  
I wasnt the one who disappeared in the night  
And I wont be the one to say that we cant try  
Da da  
  
There was no need for you to ask  please dont ask  
You oughta know by now ooo babe I want you back  
  
I wasnt the one who said goodbye oh no  
I wasnt the one who disappeared in the night  
  
I wasnt the one who said goodbye oh no  
I wasnt the one who disappeared in the night
