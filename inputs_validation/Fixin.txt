I saw a glimpse a shimmer a shadow  
Of something I had once but since lost  
And now I Ive got a feeling that Im not complete anymore  
  
Dont even tell me where we are going  
Hands over my eyes hands over my eyes  
Dont even tell me where we are going  
Just walk just walk by my side  
  
It starts with a glimpse  
A shimmer a shadow  
Of something I had once but since lost  
And now I Ive got a feeling that Im not complete anymore  
  
The salt in my eyes as I clear the border  
Imagining lines shatter and shimmer  
I get to you to ask you a question  
I get to you to find out for certain  
Are you fixin  
Dont even tell me where we are going  
Hands over my eyes hands over my eyes  
Dont even tell me where we are going  
Just walk just walk by my side  
  
Dont even tell me where we are going  
Hands over my eyes hands over my eyes  
Dont even tell me where we are going  
Just walk just walk by my side  
Just walk by my side  
  
Are you fixin to come with me  
Are you fixin to fix me fix me  
  
Dont even tell me where we are going  
Hands over my eyes hands over my eyes  
Dont even tell me where we are going  
Just walk just walk by my side  
  
Dont even tell me where we are going  
Hands over my eyes hands over my eyes  
Dont even tell me where we are going  
Just walk just walk just walk just walk by my side  
Just walk by my side
