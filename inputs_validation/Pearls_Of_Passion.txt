There was a banquet of believers when we walked into the room  
December days of Xmas felt like days in June  
And there were morning light and sunrise chimes ecoed all around  
Nows the time for weary minds the moon is northern bound  
  
And you know Im going back going back today  
Back to where I came from  
And you know Im going back going back to stay  
To the alleys where pearls of passion came my way  
  
Theres a promise in the twilight its so innocent and wild  
Two hearts that break the silence you can hear a distant cry  
And theres emptiness and loneliness its more or less the same  
Lets run between the raindrops babe and catch the midnight train
