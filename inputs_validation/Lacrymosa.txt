Out on your own cold and alone again  
Can this be what you really wanted baby  
  
Blame it on me set your guilt free  
Nothing can hold you back now  
  
Now that youre gone feel like myself again  
Grieving the things I cant repair and willing  
  
To let you blame it on me and set your guilt free  
I dont want to hold you back now love  
  
I cant change who I am not this time  
I wont lie to keep you near me  
And in this short life theres no time to waste on giving up  
My love wasnt enough  
  
And you can blame it on me just set your guilt free honey  
I dont want to hold you back now love
