You and me  
We used to be together  
Everyday together always  
I really feel  
That Im losing my best friend  
I cant believe  
This could be the end  
It looks as though youre letting go  
And if its real  
Well I dont want to know  
  
Dont speak  
I know just what youre saying  
So please stop explaining  
Dont tell me cause it hurts  
Dont speak  
I know what youre thinking  
I dont need your reasons  
Dont tell me cause it hurts  
  
Our memories  
Well they can be inviting  
But some are altogether  
Mighty frightening  
As we die both you and I  
With my head in my hands  
I sit and cry  
  
Dont speak  
I know just what youre saying  
So please stop explaining  
Dont tell me cause it hurts no no no  
Dont speak  
I know what youre thinking  
I dont need your reasons  
Dont tell me cause it hurts  
  
Its all ending  
I gotta stop pretending who we are  
You and me I can see us dying are we  
  
Dont speak  
I know just what youre saying  
So please stop explaining  
Dont tell me cause it hurts no no no  
Dont speak  
I know what youre thinking  
I dont need your reasons  
Dont tell me cause it hurts  
Dont tell me cause it hurts  
I know what youre saying  
So please stop explaining  
  
Dont speak  
Dont speak  
Dont speak  
Oh I know what youre thinking  
And I dont need your reasons  
I know youre good  
I know youre good  
I know youre real good  
Oh la la la la la la La la la la la la  
Dont dont uhhuh hush hush darlin  
Hush hush darlin hush hush  
Dont tell me tell me cause it hurts  
Hush hush darlin hush hush darlin  
Hush hush dont tell me tell me cause it hurts
