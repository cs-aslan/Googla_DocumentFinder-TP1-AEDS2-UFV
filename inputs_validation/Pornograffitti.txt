Sex  
  
Sex on the brain  
Pumped in my veins  
Flowing from my head to my feet  
Sex on TV  
Rotation heavy  
You and I are what we eat  
Sex when Im all alone  
It calls me on the phone  
Cant stop this ringing in my ear  
Sex in excess  
Filling all our senses  
Keep saying theres nothing to fear  
  
Cant you read the writing on the wall  
Cant you see the rising and the fall  
  
All I see is pornograffitti  
All I hear pornograffiti  
See no hear no  
All I speak pornograffitti  
All I fear pornograffitti  
Speak no evil  
  
Sex in 3d  
No evil eyes see  
Too much of it and youll go blind  
Sex education  
Misinformation  
Kiss me where the sun dont shine  
Sex it surrounds me  
Pornograffiti  
Its all so constitutional  
Sex is literate  
Read all about it  
But censor where you all can go  
  
Cant you read the writing on the wall  
Cant you see the rising and the fall  
  
All I see is pornograffitti  
All I hear pornograffitti  
See no hear no  
All I speak pornograffitti  
All I fear pornograffitti  
Speak no evil  
  
Sex sells
