You tell a joke and forget the punchline  
Why you always wastin my time  
Hey baby trust me you just disgust me  
Your hairs a mess and your makeups crusty  
  
I dont know too many females  
Who make a habit of biting their toenails  
Wo every time you call you drive me up the wall  
Honey just the sight of you makes my flesh crawl  
  
Im sure wed be happy together  
If only one little thing werent true  
Oh baby I yi yi yi yi  
Im so sick of you  
  
You drink the milk right from the carton  
What are you in kindergarten  
Youre belchin everywhere foulin up the air  
Then you use my razor to shave your back hair  
  
You dont have an ounce of class  
Youre just one big pain in the neck  
How much more can I take now  
Give me a break now  
  
You even snore when youre wide awake now  
You tell all your friends were the perfect couple  
Well maybe you should get a clue  
Cause baby I yi yi yi yi  
  
Im so sick of you  
Baby youre so nauseatin  
I yi yi yi yi  
Im so sick of you  
  
And when you softly call my name  
Its like Im listenin to a squeaky chalk sound  
And when you look at me that special way  
Its hard for me to keep my lunch down  
  
And when you ask me what Im thinkin honey usually Im thinkin  
How Id really like to tie your head completely up in duct tape  
So I wouldnt have to listen to you asking me those stupid questions  
Over and over again  
  
Well that disgusting noise you make when you laugh  
Gives me a throbbing migraine  
Cant stand you I just cant stand you  
Until you came along I never dated anyone this low on the food chain  
  
Cant stand you I just cant stand you  
Youve got inhuman body odor  
Youve got the hair of a boxing promoter  
Yeah your teeth are all yellow your butts made of JellO  
  
You wake up in a puddle droolin on your pillow  
I hate the way you crack your knuckles  
I hate your whiny loser girlfriends too  
But mostly I yi yi yi yi  
  
Im so sick of you  
Really now youre aggravatin  
I yi yi yi yi  
Im so sick of you  
  
Not to mention irratatin  
I yi yi yi yi  
Im so sick of you  
Well now wont you give my best regards to Satan  
  
I yi yi yi yi  
Im so sick of you  
  
Im so sick of you  
Im so sick of you  
Im so sick of you  
You make me sick  
Im so sick of you now
