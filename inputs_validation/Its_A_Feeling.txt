Its a feeling I dont belong here  
But a mans on the outside looking in wondering whos in his old armchair  
  
Its a feeling you never belonged to me  
First youre on the up n up I only look down and see  
Only look down and see  
  
Youre fighting me you knew me all desires  
No lock or key can hide the truth youre keeping from me  
  
Youre fighting me you knew me all desires  
No lock or key can hide the truth youre keeping from me  
  
Its a feeling
