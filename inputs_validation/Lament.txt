Ive seen your fairground hair  
Your seaside eyes  
Your vampire tooth your little truth  
Your tiny lies  
  
I know your trembling hand your guilty prize  
Your sleeping limbs your foreign hymns  
Your midnight cries  
  
So dry your eyes  
And turn your head away  
Now theres nothing more to say  
Now youre gone away  
  
I know your trail of tears your slip of hand  
Your monkey claw your monkey paw  
And your monkey hand  
  
Ive seen your trick of blood your trap of fire  
Your ancient wound your scarlet moon  
And your jailhouse smile  
  
So dry your eyes  
And turn your head away  
Now theres nothing more to say  
Now youre gone away  
  
Ill miss your urchin smile your orphan tears  
Your shining prize your tiny cries  
Your little fears  
Ill miss your fairground hair your seaside eyes  
Your little truth your vampire tooth  
And your tiny lies  
  
So dry your eyes  
And turn your head away  
Now theres nothing more to say  
Now youre gone away  
Repeat
