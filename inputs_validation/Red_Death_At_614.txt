Whats that she said   
Whats that she said with her fingers turning blue  
And her face was turning red  
Whoo  
Was that her dad

With the magic marker writing little angel on her head

If the only sound I hear  
Are the devils by her bed

coughing  
Whoo  
Whats that she said  
Whats that she said  
Whats that she said  
With her fingers turning blue  
And her face was turning red
