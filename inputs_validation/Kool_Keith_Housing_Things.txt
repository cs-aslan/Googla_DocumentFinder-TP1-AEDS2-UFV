Well Im sonicly high bionically  
For you dummies ironically stupid  
What are you Cupid  
You steal my rhymes and then you loop it  
  
Wrong Back this way  
Follow me now head this way  
Into this while I rap on through this  
For many germs who never knew this  
  
Switches upside down  
Turn around look in the mirror  
You rap catchers are makin a error  
Every inning Im back to the dugout  
  
You on the field Im ready to bugout  
Like a manager smackin up your team  
Male or female ducks who dream  
Of takin me on the mic and makin me  
Rack up MCs I stack up  
  
Foreign precinct rappers need to back up  
Quickly Im a rip your brain off  
Throw it down so the blood can drain off  
My hands while I wave to a fan  
  
Im Kool Keith not a Bill or a Dan  
But a General equal to a mineral  
Pushin a crowd to keep on dancin  
Im Housing Things  
  
Now Im back to continue my verses  
Im never screamin loud with any curses  
Rougly that a child can learn  
I teach kids and ducks that burn  
  
With a flamethrower and how do you show a  
Grass rapper cut him with a lawnmower  
Twice into golden wheat  
Ground the rest into moldin meat  
  
And cook em til they all well done  
They not ready they dont smell done  
like fish it aint my favorite dish  
I grab a steak and to battle I wish  
  
A Coke MC or Pepsi Ill sip up  
Drop your face and bring the other lip up  
Watch while I stun and amaze you  
Kick out lyrics that truly daze you  
  
Im your boss the one that pays you  
Nine to five all ducks are hired  
And when I come MCs are fired  
No pay no way today  
  
Youre an employer with nothin to say  
But I can say one thing for sure  
Im Housing Things  
  
I think its pitiful that you had taunted me  
Your girl sulkin she wanted me first  
Before you was thought about  
Back in the days when I taught about  
  
Science the real construction  
No other solo team or production  
Did that or got with that  
I play brain ball using a bat  
  
To your skull smack it out the park  
I rhyme bright and youre in the dark  
With shadows hallucinating battles  
To compel the capital K as in Kool  
  
Combined in Keith  
Rap metal is terminal chief  
And joy squashin the beef  
On time and my mic will stay on  
  
For any roach or germ who wanna pray on  
a weakness but my uniqueness  
has a way to show that Im slicker  
Creating rhymes you have to be quicker  
And versatile on the microphone  
Im Kool Keith cold Housing Things  
  
And Id like to say whats up to my man Father Mashon  
And also my brother Kevvy Kev Ced Gee Moe Love TR  
And my man I God Paul C Public Enemy and the Jungle Brothers  
Peace Im outta here
