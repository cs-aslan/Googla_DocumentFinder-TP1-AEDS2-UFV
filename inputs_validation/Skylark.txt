Skylark have you anything to say to me  
Can you tell me where my love may be  
Is there a meadow in the mist  
Where hes just waiting to be kissed  
  
Skylark have you seen a valley green with spring  
Where my heart can go a journeying  
Over the shadows and the rain  
To a blossom covered lane  
  
And in your lonely flight have you heard the music  
In the night wonderful music  
Faint as a willothewisp crazy as a loon  
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon  
  
Oh skylark i dont know i dont know  
If you can find these things  
But my heart my heart is riding on your wings  
So if you see them anywhere  
Wont you lead me there  
  
Oh wont you lead me there  
Lead me there lead me there  
Lead me there skylark skylark skylark there
