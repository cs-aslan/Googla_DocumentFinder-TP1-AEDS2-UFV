Drones since the dawn of time  
Compelled to live your sheltered lives  
Not once has anyone ever seen  
Such a rise of pure hypocrisy  
Ill instigate Ill free your mind  
Ill show you what Ive known all this time  
  
God hates us all god hates us all  
You know its true god hates this place  
You know its true he hates this race  
  
Homicidesuicide  
Hate heals you should try it sometime  
Strive for peace with acts of war  
The beauty of death we all adore  
I have no faith distracting me  
I know why your prayers will never be answered  
  
God hates us all god hates us all  
He fuckin hates me  
  
Pessimist terrorist targeting the next mark  
Global chaos feeding on hysteria  
Cut throat slit your wrist shoot you in the back fair game  
Drug abuse self abuse searching for the next high  
Sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time  
Im waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies  
  
I never said I wanted to be gods disciple  
Ill never be the one to blindly follow  
  
Man made virus infecting the world  
Selfdestruct human time bomb  
What if there is no god would you think the fuckin same  
Wasting your life in a leap of blind faith  
Wake the fuck up cant ignore what I say  
I got my own philosophy  
  
I hate everyone equally  
You cant tear that out of me  
No segregation separation  
Just me in my world of enemies  
  
I never said I wanted to be gods disciple  
Ill never be the one to blindly follow  
Ill never be the one to bear the crossdisciple  
  
I reject this fuckin race  
I despise this fuckin place
