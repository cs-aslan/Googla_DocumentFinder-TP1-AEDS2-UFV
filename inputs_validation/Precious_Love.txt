In this world where life keeps changin  
Nothin ever seems to be enough  
I kept on my soul was searchin  
Lookin for something that would fill me up  
I have always felt a yearnin  
Somethin inside me was unsatisfied  
  
Precious love you woke my heart up  
Its been sleepin for such a long time  
This crazy feelin I can believe in  
Your love has found its way into my life  
  
Take our time slow and easy  
Im so comfortable when Im with you  
Catch my breath when you come near me  
Cant control this if I wanted to  
Thought Id never trust another  
But here in your arms I feel safe again  
  
Precious love you woke my heart up  
Its been sleepin for such a long time  
This crazy feelin I must be dreamin  
Your love has found its way into my life  
  
You touched a part of me  
And set my spirit free  
Precious love  
  
This crazy feelin I must be dreamin  
Your love has found its way into my life  
You know your precious love has changed my life
