Lost and lonely  
Clouds hide the sun  
Out on the highway  
Its all hit and run  
  
Cold empty nights  
Demons in my head  
Its something I did  
Or baby something you said  
  
And its hard to discover  
That youre just another  
Jealous Lover  
And its so tough to take  
  
But youre making no mistake  
Jealous Lover  
Oh Yeah  
Dont want no other  
  
Shades of red  
Eyes of green  
Sees black and white  
And theres no in between  
  
Ask me no questions  
Ill tell you no lies  
Still you keep thinking  
That its all alibis  
  
And its hard to discover  
Youre like any other  
Jealous Lover  
And youre saying Im a fake  
  
But youre making a mistake  
Oh no no  
Every day its the same  
The faces and the names  
  
How long can I go on  
Playing this game  
So I live for the nights  
Soft candle lights  
  
Today they love you  
Then tomorrow they might  
And its hard to face  
Someone else takes your place  
  
Jealous Lover  
And theyre saying thats the brakes  
But I got what it takes  
Jealous Lover oh oh  
  
Jealous Lover  
Jealous Lover  
Dont need no no no  
Dont need no other  
  
Jealous Lover yeah  
Jealous Lover
