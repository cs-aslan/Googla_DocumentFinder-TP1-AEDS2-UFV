And I wont make love to you  
And I feel love feel love  
  
Jailhouse gets empty  
Rudy gets plenty  
The baton stick gets shorter  
Rudy gets taller  
Cant fight against the youth  
Cause were strong and theyre the rude rude people  
Cant fight against the youth  
Cause were strong and the rude rude people  
  
Baby get down  
When I was a youth in 1983  
It was the best day of my life had the eighty nine vision  
We didnt fuss or no fight  
When all the little daughters wanna be my wife  
My vision  
It was playin on my guitar on my guitar  
  
I had to be there  
I had to be there  
I had to be there  
I had to be there

And Eric Wilson will be bangin up there yea  
Oh and well be all singin with version with version

What has been told to the wise and uprooted  
Its gonna be revealed unto babes and Sublime

Cant fight against the youth right now  
Them are rude rude people  
Cant fight against the resistance oh right now  
Them are rude rude people  
  
We gonna rule this land among children

We had the eighty nine vision  
  
We didnt fuss or no fight  
When all the little daughters wanna be my wife  
When that rhythm it was playin on my guitar  
On my guitar  
  
I had to be there

And fight against the youth  
Cause were strong them are rude rude people  
Cant fight against the youth
