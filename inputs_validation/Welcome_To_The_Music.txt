Welcome To The Music  
Bread  
David Gates  
  
Welcome to the music  welcome to the Guitar man  
Know youre gonna love it  gonna do the best we can  
And to help us along  think were gonna need us a band  
  
Lately we been playin  travelin in the jets and cars  
Smilin at the people  lookinat the rock and roll stars  
I tell you Carnegie Halls better than those honky tonk bars  
  
Well if its true what music can do  
To soothe the savage beast like they say  
Well just relax and lie on your backs  
Cause beastly is the way we play  
  
Now were through talkin  gonna speak another day  
Love to play it funky  love to hear the symphony  
And to star us along  Larrys gonna play it in see  
Dont touch that dial  wont you come and stay for awhile
