d fagen  
I knew from the first time I saw you  
I wanted you for myself  
You feel the same though its got to be wrong  
We each belong to somebody else  
Once it was vague desire  
Now its a raging fire  
Those things that people are saying  
Cant keep our love on the shelf  
How long can we talk about it  
What good is life without it  
Love will make it right  
Love will make it right  
Love will choose the night  
Love will make it right  
Four friends are driving on Sunday  
Our smiles a useless disguise  
By now they know whats inside our hearts  
My sweet it shows in your eyes  
Through all the foolish laughter  
They know just what were after  
How long can we keep on living  
This life of unspoken lies  
Some will be touched with sadness  
But how can we stop the madness  
Love will make it right  
Love will make it right  
Love will choose the night  
Love will make it right  
Some will be touched with sadness  
But how can we stop the madness  
Love will make it right  
Love will make it right  
Love will choose the night  
Love will make it right
