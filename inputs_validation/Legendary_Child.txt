Legendary child  
I tell ya what Im talkin about  
  
Makin love at seventeen yeah we had the luck  
But we traded em toys and other joys and we didnt give a whoaohoh  
I took a chance at the high school dance never knowing wrong from right  
And that same show forty years ago being televised tonight  
  
Cause journey from inside my head to the Taj Mahal  
I went from neverhavinnone to wannahaveitall  
I wanna keep that dream alive  
And eat that honey from the hive  
With all the noise and all the glamor  
No surprise you know I am a  
  
Legendary child  
I think that what Im tryin to say is  
  
Sticks and stones will break your bones at least theyll rearrange  
I drop a dime and every time I get myself a nickels change whoaohoh  
They say we dont know jack  
At the plant we proved em wrong  
We traded in our souls at night and sold em for a song  
  
And if Satan had a lady friend her name was Mary Jane  
I never wondered why she tried to drive us quite insane  
And how we got the golden fleece  
From tokin on that pipe of peace  
Yeah as far as I can see  
There is a God cause I got me a
