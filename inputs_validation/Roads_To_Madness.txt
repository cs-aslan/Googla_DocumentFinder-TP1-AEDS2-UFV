Most of this is memory now  
Ive gone too far to turn back now  
Im not quite what I thought I was but  
Then again Im maybe more  
The bloodwords promised Ive spoken  
Releasing the names from the circle  
Maybe I can leave here now and o  
Transcend the boundaries  
  
For now Im standing here  
Im awaiting this grand transition  
The future is but past forgotten  
On the road to madness  
  
Times measure rusts as it crawls  
I see its face in the looking glass  stop  
This screaming laughter hides the pain of its reality  
Black the door was locked I opened  
And now Ive paid that price tenfold over  
Knowledge  was it worth such torment oh  
To see the far side of shadow  
  
And still Im standing here  
Im awaiting this grand transition  
Im a fool in search of wisdom  
And Im on the road to madness  
Yes Im on the road to madness  
  
Im awaiting endlessly  
Pounding rhythms echo me  
Wont you take me somewhere far beyond the void  
  
And still Im standing here  
Im awaiting this grand transition  
Maybe one day oh Ill meet you and well  
Walk the roads to madness  
Yes were on the road to madness  
  
Oh I think theyve come to take me  
I hear the voice but theres noone to see  
I cant scream too late its time  
  
Stay on the course to pass  
Youll never find the answer  
To a place where darkened angels  
Seemed lost and never found  
Scream to see the light of  
Forming figures fast behind you  
Lay the past in the wind to spin  
And your fate will sail beyond the open plains  
Sail with angels onward  
Live or die for the chosen one said  
Saber sights cast a spell behind you  
And they lock in all around  
  
Free the scene insider  
Never looking back to find why  
Ride a course till the end of time  
And youll stand atop the gate  
Laying waste in a path recited  
Fighting force wont avenge the guided black wing  
Oh electric might poses fright inside me  
Seeing light at the end of sight reminds me  
Ive passed away
