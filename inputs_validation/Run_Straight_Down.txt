I went walking in the wasted city  
Started thinking about entropy  
Smelled the wind from the ruined river  
Went home to watch TV  
  
And its worse when I try to remember  
When I think about then and now  
Id rather see it on the news at eleven  
Sit back and watch it run straight down  
  
Run straight down  
Run straight down  
I can see it with my eyes closed  
Run straight down  
  
Weve been living in the shadows all our lives  
Where its stand in line and dont look back and dont look left and dont
look right  
So we hide our eyes and wonder wholl survive  
Waiting for the night  
  
Fluorocarbons in the ozone layer  
First the water and the wildlife go  
Pretty soon theres not a creature stirring  
Cept the robots at the dynamo  
  
And its worse when I try to remember  
When I think about then and now  
Id rather see it on the news at eleven  
Sit back and watch it run straight down  
  
Run straight down  
Run straight down  
I can see it with my eyes closed  
Run straight down
