And all the goyim say Im pretty fly for a rabbi  
  
He shops at discount stores not just any will suffice  
He has to find a bargain cause he wont pay retail price  
He never acts meshugga and hes hardly a schlemiel  
But if you want to haggle oy hell make you such a deal  
  
People used to scoff now they say Mazel tov  
Hes such a macher cause he works his tuchis off  
Yeah he keeps his cool and teaches shul  
Whats not to like Whats not to like  
  
Oh high holy days you know he prays and prays  
And he never eats pastrami on white bread with mayonnaise  
Put on your yarmulka and  
Hey Hey Do that Hebrew thing  
  
When hes doing a Bar Mitzvah now that you shouldnt miss  
Hell always shlep on down for a wedding or a briss  
They say hes got a lot of chutzpah hes really quite hhhhhip  
The parents pay the moyl and he gets to keep the tip
