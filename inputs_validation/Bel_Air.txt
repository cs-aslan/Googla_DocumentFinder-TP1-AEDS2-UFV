Ive been lightin matches in the boiler room  
Wearing sulfur perfume dont I smell nice  
You come sniffin around just like you own the joint  
You know its rude to point dont make me tell you twice  
Well I like the way you walk thats why I left my door unlocked  
I must be going off halfcocked I sometimes do  
You think its funny but I know it aint no joke  
Theres nothing left to read in here theres nothing left to smoke  
Before the band kicks in the getting better start  
Ill stomp a mud hole in your heart  
You poured whiskey in my Slurpee swear to God you got me drunk  
Now Im thinking that Im sunk and I cant swim  
Im drowning in the back seat of a 61 Bel Air  
I got a mouthful of your hair a handful of skin  
I aint suffocating Im just sick and tired of waiting  
Stop this pointless hesitating pull me in  
Theres an awful lot of stars out here an awful lot of sky  
Im turning on the radio theyre playing Ready to ride  
Before the band kicks in the getting better start  
Ill stomp a mud hole in your heart  
We could cruise the lake like psychos  
Scare the kids on motorcycles there aint nothing I would rather do  
Its 3D on the TV but its empty on the street  
If it werent for me and you the avenue would be incomplete  
And I should say this before this whole thing even starts  
Ill stomp a mud hole in your heart
