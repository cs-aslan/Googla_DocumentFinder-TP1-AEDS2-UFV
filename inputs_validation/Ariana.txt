Driving down the streets listening to the radio  
What do I get ariana  
Reading the papers and the news they scream  
Havent you heard ariana  
She rules the business shes sucha restless genuine juvenile  
Everyone knows wherever she goes  
She got chique she got class she got style  
Arianamaniacs rulr the world havent you heard  
Arianamania sets the scenes on fire  
Were goin nutz for ariana  
Were goin carazzy forrr herrr  
Everything glows wherever she goes  
She got sex from her lips to her toes  
All the casanovas even zombies agree  
With the hummingbirds and the beasts from the sea  
Arianas a real sensation  
When will she be on the screeeeeen
