Whyd you have to take me there  
You start the fire then you put it out  
I have to depend on my imagination  
I didnt want to fade what youve been puttin down  
  
But then you say the word  
Then I go under  
  
Every time you go  
Missing you so  
Somethin deep  
Baby come around  
Missing you now  
Somethin deep  
Deeper going deeper down without you honey  
  
Its more confusing by the hour  
You set me free but you dont go away  
I try to think about somebody else  
Thats when I know I just cant help myself  
So baby say the word and take me over  
  
Every time you go  
Missing you so  
Somethin deep  
Baby come around  
Missing you now  
Somethin deeply
