Lullaby and good night with roses bestride  
With lilies bedecked neath Babys sweet bed  
May thou sleep may thou rest may thy slumber be blest  
May thou sleep may thou rest may thy slumber be blest  
Lullaby and good night thy mothers delight  
Bright angels around my darling shall guard  
They will guide thee from harm thou art safe in my arms  
They will guide thee from harm thou art safe in my arms  
Good evening good night covered with roses  
With tiny fingernails hidden slipping under the blankets  
Tomorrow morning if God wills you will wake again  
Tomorrow morning if God wills you will wake again  
God evening good night watched over by tiny angels  
Who show the little Christ Childs tree in dreams  
Sleep now blessed and sweet look at dreams paradise  
Sleep now blessed and sweet look at dreams paradise
