Ill pretend that I want you for what is on the inside  
But when I get inside Ill just want to get out  
Im your first and last deposit through sickness and in hell  
Ill never you promise you a garden youll just water me down  
  
I cant believe that you are for real  
I dont care as long as youre mine  
  
When I said we you know I meant me  
And when I said sweet I meant dirty  
When I said we you know I meant me  
And when I said sweet I meant dirty  
  
Im unsafe  
Im unsafe  
I wont regret  
So I memorize the words to the porno movies  
Its the only thing I want to believe  
I memorize the words to the porno movies  
This is a new religion to me  
Im a VCR funeral a definite waste  
My smiles a chainlink fence that I have put up  
I love the enemy my love is the enemy  
They say they dont want fame  
But they get famous when we fuck  
  
When I said we you know I meant me  
And when I said sweet I meant dirty  
When I said we you know I meant me  
And when I said sweet I meant dirty  
  
Im unsafe  
Im unsafe  
I wont regret  
So I memorize the words to the porno movies  
Its the only thing I want to believe  
I memorize the words to the porno movies  
This is a new religion to me  
  
I never believed the devil was real  
But God couldnt make someone filthy as you  
  
When I said we you know I meant me  
And when I said sweet I meant dirty  
When I said we you know I meant me  
And when I said sweet I meant dirty  
When I said we you know I meant me  
And when I said sweet I meant dirty  
When I said we you know I meant me  
And when I said sweet I meant dirty  
  
You are the church and I am the steeple  
When we fuck we are all Gods people  
You are the church and I am the steeple  
When we fuck we are all Gods people
