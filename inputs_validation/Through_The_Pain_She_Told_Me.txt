I Could Tell How You Doubted Me  
I Knew My Heart Was Broken  
And So Empty  
Even Though My Girl Was Next To Me  
She Didnt See  
I Do Believe  
That You Wanna Come By  
Rescue Me  
If You Read My Mind  
I Have Set You A Place  
I Wonder If Ill Just Will Be  
In Time Well See  
She Told Me  
  
She Told Me  
She Showed Me  
But She Hurt Me  
Yet She Loved Me The Same  
Has Anybody Ever Made You Feel That Way  
Could You Really Love Her Through The Pain
