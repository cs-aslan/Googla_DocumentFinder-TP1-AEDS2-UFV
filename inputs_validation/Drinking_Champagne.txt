Im drinking champagne feeling no pain till early morning  
Dinning and dancing with every pretty girl I can find  
Im having a fling with a pretty young thing till early morning  
Knowing tomorrow Ill wake up with you on my mind  
  
Guilty conscience I guess  
I must confess  
I never loved you much when you were mine  
  
So Ill keep drinking champagne feeling no pain till early morning  
Dinning and dancing with every pretty girl I can find  
Having a fling with a pretty young thing till early morning  
Knowing tomorrow Ill wake up with you on my mind  
  
Guilty conscience I guess  
I must confess  
I never loved you much when you were mine  
  
So Ill keep drinking champagne feeling no pain till early morning  
Dinning and dancing with every pretty girl I can find  
Ill keep having a fling with a pretty young thing till early morning  
Knowing tomorrow Ill wake up with you on my mind
