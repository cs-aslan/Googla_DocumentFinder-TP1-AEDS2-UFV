If I was a flag Id have no nation  
Just the colours and the wind  
And if I was a church Id have no treasure  
Except the prayers and the hyms  
And if I was a seagull Id just rise up  
And carry my soul across the sea  
Drifting beyond the horizon  
Lost by the ground to be free  
If I was a lifeboat Id be waiting all my life  
For another stormy day  
And if I was a dolphin Id be playing all the time  
Just playing my life away  
And if I was a kite Id just be laughing  
And dragging you up to the sky  
Setting you down on a white cloud  
While a seagulls floating by  
And the silence roars like thunder
