Weve seen a lifetime since we met  
Through good and bad  
And things we wont forget  
Forgotten promises and broken vows  
But we always made it through somehow  
But the key to you is broken in the lock  
And a simple band of gold is all weve got  
Its in the things that I cant say  
That tear us both apart  
But if you keep listening  
Youll hear inside my heart of hearts  
Darling the simple things are hard to say  
And darling the words get in the way  
The poet sees the world through rhymes  
But only says so much  
See darling the words are in my touch  
The meanings in my touch  
And maybe theres something I should say  
To make everything thats wrong Ok  
A simple phrase a sonnet from a play  
But a man can only say so much these days  
And were drifting to the deep end of the lake  
Trying to make good on our past mistakes  
And I know youre tired  
But heavens here and now  
Ive got no explanation  
Words are worthless to me now  
Darling etc
