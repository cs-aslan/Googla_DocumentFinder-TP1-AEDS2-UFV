Shes a wonderful lady  
And shes mine all mine  
And there doesnt seem a way  
That she wont come and lose my mind  
Its too easy humming songs  
To a girl in a yellow dress  
Its been a long time since the party  
And the room is in a mess  
  
The four kings of EMI are sitting stately on the floor  
There are birds out on the sidewalk  
And a valet at the door  
He reminds me of a penguin  
With few and plastered hair  
Theres talcum powder on the letter  
And the birthday boy is there  
  
Why dont you cut your hair  
Why dont you live up there  
Why dont you do what I do  
See what I feel when I care  
  
Now theyve darkened all the windows  
And the seats are naugahide  
Ive been waiting for an hour  
I cant find a place to hide  
The being known as wondergirl  
Is speaking I believe  
Its not easy trying to tell her  
That I shortly have to leave  
  
Why dont you be like me  
Why dont you stop and see  
Why dont you hate who I hate  
Kill who I kill to be free  
  
Why dont you cut your hair  
Why dont you live up there  
Why dodnt you do what I do  
See what I feel when I care  
  
Why dont you be like me Shes a wonderful lady  
Why dont you stop and see And shes mine all mine  
Why dont you hate who I hate And there doesnt seem a way  
Kill who I kill to be free That she wont come and lose my mind  
Why dont you cut your hair Its too easy humming songs  
Why dont you live up there To a girl in a yellow dress  
Why dont you do what I do Its been a long time since the party  
See what I feel when I care And the room is in a mess
