Got a quarter  
I passed out last night and I never made it home  
Wound up on a bus to San Antone  
My head hurts bad and I aint wearing shoes  
Going to find my wallet and my way back home to you  
  
Were gonna make this day  
A little better than the last  
Its amazing how slow days like this can go  
Find a way to wash away  
Any regret you have dont let this moment pass  
Live inside this day  
  
I got cuffs on my hands  
Chains on my feet  
I got locked up for the second time this week  
And I know I make you cry but girl my love is true  
Im going to find my wallet and my way back home to you  
  
Were gonna make this day  
A little better than the last  
Its amazing how slow the days like this can go  
Find a way to wash away  
Any regret you have dont let this moment pass  
Live inside this day  
  
Now Im back on the street  
Thumb in the air  
Dont know how the hell that I got here  
But Im gonna hitch that ride  
If its the last thing I do  
Gonna find that wallet and bring it home to you  
  
Were gonna make this day  
A little better than the last  
Know dont you let this life come whoop your  
Find a way to wash away  
Any regrets you have  
Dont let this moment pass  
Live inside this day
