And in reflection of days gone by  
I stayed awake all last night  
When morning came I was still unsure  
To laugh or cry Im needin more  
  
And its not easy to take the time  
From all we need we cannot hide  
We live our dreams and all we find  
Is bittersweet and full of pride  
  
Ooh what have we done  
Built it up a little too strong  
I need every minute with you  
No one else can do whatcha do whatcha  
  
I need every minute with you  
No one else can do whatcha do whatcha  
And in reflection of days gone by  
I stayed awake all last night  
  
When morning came I was still unsure  
To laugh or cry Im needin more  
Ooh what have we done  
Built it up a little too strong  
  
I need every minute with you  
No one else can do whatcha do whatcha  
I need every minute with you  
No one else can do whatcha do whatcha  
  
Ooh what have we done  
Built it up a little too strong  
I need every minute with you  
No one else can do whatcha do whatcha  
  
I need every minute with you  
No one else can do whatcha do whatcha
