I was not so happy being lonely living without you  
So I prayed so hard for your love in my heart I needed you  
Then I looked up in the sky and Im thinking why oh why  
These are all the many changes in my life  
  
After all the caring and the laughter no one is like you  
I am not a preacher with a sermon Im so in love with you  
Cause to live without your love like the sun that shines above  
Is the magic of the changes in my life  
  
And Ill never forget your love  
You and I we were meant to be  
Sweet as rain falling from the sky  
You and I  
These are all the many changes in my life  
  
Listen to these words I want to give you on our love so true  
Dont forget I love you and I need you Ill always be with you  
So just looked up in the sky and youll find out why oh why  
These are all the many changes in my life  
  
And Ill never forget your love  
You and I we were meant to be  
Sweet as rain falling from the sky  
You and I  
These are all the many changes  
These are all the many changes  
These are all the many changes in my life  
  
Instrumental  
  
And Ill never forget your love  
You and I we were meant to be  
Sweet as rain falling from the sky  
You and I  
These are all the many changes  
These are all the many changes  
These are all the many changes in my life  
These are all the many changes  
These are all the many changes  
These are all the many changes in my life
