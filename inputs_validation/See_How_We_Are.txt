There are men lost in jail  
Crowded fifty to a room  
Theres too many rats in this cage of the world  
And the women know their place  
They sit home and write letters  
And when they visit once a year  
Well they both just sit there and stare  
  
See how we are  
Gotta keep bars in between us  
See how we are  
We only sing about it once in every twenty years  
See how we are  
Oh see how we are  
  
Now there are seven kinds of Coke  
500 kinds of cigarettes  
This freedom of choice in the USA drives everybody crazy  
But in Acapulco  
Well they dont give a damn  
About kids selling Chiclets with no shoes on their feet  
  
See how we are  
Hey man whats in it for me  
See how we are  
We only sing about it once in every twenty years  
See how we are  
Oh see how we are  
  
Now that highways coming through  
So you all gotta move  
This bottom rung aint no fun at all  
No fires and rockhouses and grapeflavored rat poison  
They are the new trinity  
For this socalled community  
  
See how we are  
Gotta keep bars on all of our windows  
See how we are  
We only sing about it once in every twenty years  
See how we are  
Oh see how we are  
  
Well this morning the alarm rang at noon  
And Im trying to write this letter to you  
About how much I care and why I just cant be there  
To draw your bath and comband comb your hair  
  
Last night in a nightspot  
Where things arent so hot  
My friend said I met a boy and Im in love  
I said Oh really Whats this ones name  
She said His first name is Homeboy  
I said Could his last name be Trouble  
  
See how we are  
Ah Homeboy Isnt that a Mexican name  
See how we are  
We only sing about it once in every twenty years  
See how we are  
Oh see how we are  
Yeah see how we are
