You say you dont like my kind  
A bitter picture in your mind  
No it dont matter what I say  
I hear you bitchin when I walk away  
Ill never be what you want me to be  
You tell me Im wrong but I disagree  
I aint go no apology  
Just because I dont look like you talk like you think like you  
Judge and jury a hangmans noose  
I see them in your eyes  
  
Good guys dont always wear white  
Good guys dont always wear white  
  
You judge a man who dont stand in line  
Just because he aint on your side  
You know the man who wears those shoes  
If you cut me dont I bleed like you You know I do  
  
I dont know what youve been told  
Cant buy guts with a pot o gold  
A rich mans poor if he got no soul  
Rich man poor man beggar man king  
All that shit dont mean a thing  
Do you know which ones behind those eyes  
Its all a disguise  
  
Good guys dont always wear white  
Good guys dont always wear white  
  
Hey baby whose side you on  
You think you got it all figured out where we belong  
Forget all about your dark from light  
Day from night  
Wrong from right  
  
Good guys dont always wear white  
Good guys dont always wear white  
Good guys dont always wear white  
Good guys dont always wear white  
  
Tell your Mama baby  
Good guys dont always wear white  
Dont always wear dont always wear  
Dont always wear dont always wear  
Dont always wear dont always wear  
White
