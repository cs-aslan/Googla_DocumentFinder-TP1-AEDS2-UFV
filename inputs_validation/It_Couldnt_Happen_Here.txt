Yesterday remember how clear it seemed  
In six inch heels quoting magazines  
Go all the way you knew you could  
So far so good  
  
Someone asked Who do you think you are  
Who pays your bills How come you came this far  
Shrugged him off and locked the door  
So good this far  
  
Now it almost seems impossible  
Weve drunk too much and woke up everyone  
I may be wrong I thought we said  
It couldnt happen here here  
  
I dont expect to talk in terms of sense  
Our dignity and injured innocence  
It contradicts your battlescars  
Still healed so far  
  
Now it almost seems incredible  
Weve laughed too loud and woke up everyone  
I may be wrong but I thought we said  
It couldnt happen here  
  
Now it almost seems impossible  
Weve found ourselves back where we started from  
I may be wrong I thought we said  
It couldnt happen here  
  
I may be wrong I thought we said  
It couldnt happen here
