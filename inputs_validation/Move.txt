Hey baby  
Tell me your name  
I gotta fever for you  
I just cant explain  
But theres just one problem  
Im a bit old school  
When it comes to lovin  
I aint chasing you  
Keep waiting  
Im on a roll  
Youve got to let yourself go  
  
Whoa you know that Ive been waiting for you  
Dont leave me standing all by myself  
Cause I aint looking at no one else  
  
Hey get your back off the wall  
Dont you get comfortable  
Looking so hot  
I think that I might fall  
Feeling like its my birthday  
Like Christmas day came early  
Just what I want  
So when we move  
You move  
  
Hey get your back off the wall  
Dont you get comfortable  
Looking so hot  
I think that I might fall  
Feeling like its my birthday  
Like Christmas day came early  
Just what I want  
So when we move  
You move  
  
Oh silly  
Why you afraid  
Dont be a big baby  
Quit playing games  
And put your arms around me  
You know what to do  
And we can take it down low  
  
Whoa you know that Ive been waiting for you  
Dont leave me standing all by myself  
Cause I aint looking at no one else  
Looking at no one else  
  
Hey get your back off the wall  
Dont you get comfortable  
Looking so hot  
I think that I might fall  
Feeling like its my birthday  
Like Christmas day came early  
Just what I want

You move  
  
Get your back off the wall  
Dont you get comfortable  
Looking so hot  
I think that I might fall  
Feeling like its my birthday  
Like Christmas day came early  
Just what I want  
So when we move  
You move

But you cant cause you gotta  
Stay cool in the corner  
When the truth is that you wanna move  
So move

So move
