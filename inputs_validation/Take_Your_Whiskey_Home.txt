Well my baby she dont want me around  
She said shes tired of watchin me fall down  
She wants the good life only the best  
But I like that bottle better than the rest  
And she said I think that youre headed for a whole lot of trouble  
Well I think that youre headed for a whole lot of trouble  
Well I think that youre headed for a whole lot of trouble  
If you take your whiskey  
Well that liquor in the nighttime leaves strange memories  
Seems a lifetime since yesterday  
Come the daybreak come the morrow  
That womans waited up all night for me again  
She said Well I think that youre headed for a whole lot of trouble  
Yeah I think that youre headed for a whole lot of trouble  
Yeah you know that youre headed for a lot of trouble  
If you take your whiskey home  
Some goes to women some goes to Jesus  
Though Im absolutely certain boths all right  
But it takes me at least halfway to the label  
Fore I can even make it through the night  
Well I think that youre headed for a whole lot of trouble  
Yeah I think that youre headed for a whole lot of trouble  
Yeah you know that youre headed for a lot of trouble  
If you take your whiskey home
