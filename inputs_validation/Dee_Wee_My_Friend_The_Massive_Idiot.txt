He said hed be here at seven  
The clock just hit 722  
Its too cold outside  
To wait for my ride  
Watching mamma try out a new doo Bruins  
  
He said hed be here at seven  
But it just hit 735 already  
Here in Brockton Mass  
I got my thumb in my ass  
Mammas combing up a big beehive Celtics  
  
Where the fuck is he  
Where the fuck is he  
  
The bitch doesnt even bother calling  
Even though its 744 I fell asleep pally  
Im feeling kinda antsy  
Mammas getting fancy  
Slicking back a wet pompadour Red Sox  
  
He said hed be here at seven  
Its closing in on 801 Trimmin the stache kid  
Me lookin like a sap  
In a wool knit cap  
Mammas next move is a bun fuckin Patriots  
  
Where the fuck is he My pants are still in the dryer dude  
Where the fuck is he I couldnt find my fuckin snowboots pal  
I wish I had a car Huge huge hangover  
Oh no Massive hailstorm massive hailstorm massive  
  
That stupid little punk  
Hes probably fuckin drunk  
I bet he drank a case  
Want to pop him in the face right now  
Mammas eyebrow  
  
Wicked good  
Wicked good Oh GOD  
Wicked good  
Wicked good Fuck yeah  
Wicked good  
Wicked good Pisser  
  
Well my friend is still a noshow  
And Im getting fucking pissed Why  
Cause I couldve gone with Charlie  
In the side of his Harley  
Mammas on the phone with a stylist Fuck Charlie  
  
So I guess I aint going out tonight  
Cause the digits say 1209 Shitfaced  
But call the operator  
Cause one perm later  
Mammas hair sure do look fine Heffenreffer  
  
Where the fuck is he Ah ha ha My stepfather was tellin me a wicked funny
joke  
Where the fuck is he Ah ha ha I forgot it though  
  
I wish I had a car
