Oh Lyrics  
Dave Matthews  
  
The world is blowing up  
The world is caving in  
The world has lost her way again  
But you are here with me  
But you are here with me  
Makes it ok  
  
I hear you still talk to me  
As if youre sitting in that dusty chair  
Makes the hours easier to bear  
I know despite the years alone  
Ill always listen to you sing your sweet song  
And if its all the same to you  
  
I love you oh so well  
Like a kid loves candy and fresh snow  
I love you oh so well  
Enough to fill up heaven overflow and fill hell  
Love you oh so well  
  
And its cold and darkness falls  
Its as if youre in the next room so alive  
I could swear I hear you singing to me  
  
I love you oh so well  
Like a kid loves candy and fresh snow  
I love you oh so well  
Enough to fill up heaven overflow and fill hell  
  
The world is blowing up  
The world is caving in  
The world has lost her way again  
But you are here with me  
But you are here with me  
Makes it ok  
  
Oh girl youre singing to me still  
I love you oh so well  
Like a kid loves candy and fresh snow  
I love you oh so well  
Enough to fill up heaven overflow and fill hell  
Love you oh so well
