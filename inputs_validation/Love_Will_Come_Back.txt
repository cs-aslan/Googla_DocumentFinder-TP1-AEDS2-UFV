I dont love you anymore  
Weve all heard those words before  
Somebody takes your heart and then  
Leaves you the pieces  
  
Lying shattered on the floor  
They say that when you close a door  
Another one is waiting there  
For you to open if you believe  
  
Chorus  
Love will come back  
Hit you when you least expect it  
Fill in the cracks  
Of a broken heart you thought  
That you could never mend  
You you can start again  
  
When youre barely getting by  
And its hard to find the strength to try  
And loneliness is all youve known  
If you let go then you will find  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh when you think youve lost the only way  
All you really need  
Is a little faith  
  
Chorus  
  
Just let love return to you  
You can start again
