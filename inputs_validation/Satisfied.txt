We work our bodies weary to stay alive  
There must be more to living than nine to five  
  
Why should we wait for some better time  
There may not even be a tomorrow  
Aint no sense in losing your mind  
Im gonna make it worth the ride  
  
Dont you know I wont give up until Im satisfied  
Dont you know why should I stop until Im satisfied  
  
Ignore the hesitation that ties your hands  
Use your imagination and take a chance  
  
I wont let my moment of truth pass me by  
Ive gotta make my move now or never  
And if they turn me loose on this town  
Theyre gonna have to hold me down  
  
Dont you know I wont give up until Im satisfied  
Dont you know why should I stop until Im satisfied Yeah  
  
Oh dont you know aint gonna stop until were satisfied  
Dont you know we shouldnt stop until were satisfied  
  
Dont you know aint gonna stop until Im satisfied  
Dont you know we wont give up until were satisfied
