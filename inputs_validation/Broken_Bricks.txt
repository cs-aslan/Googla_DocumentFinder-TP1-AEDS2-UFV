Have you been to the broken bricks girl  
Snuck down through the cyclone fence  
Past the caution tape  
And the security gate  
Back way to the break room bench  
Well theres a little corner  
Where you first got kissed  
And felt your boyfriends fist  
And made the company list  
And theres a little spot  
Where your dad ate lunch  
And your brother landed his first punch yeahyeahyeah  
  
Well have you been to the broken bricks girl  
Seen the barrels that they left behind  
Seen the machine  
That cut aluminum clean  
And got tape from the caution sign  
And broke into the window panes  
Just a rusty colored rain  
That drives a man insane  
You try to jump over water  
But you land in oil  
Climb the ladder up a broken crane  
Yeahyeahyeah  
  
Dont go to the broken bricks girl  
Its not a place that you want to be  
Think of the spot your father spent his life  
Demolition calls it  
Building see  
Demolition calls it  
Building see now  
Demolition calls it  
Building see now
