Oh Im feeling so fine and youre looking so good  
And Id like to get together  
Oh Lord I wish we could  
But theres someone at home  
Whos depending on me  
And boy theyd never know it  
If I set my passions free  
  
But I dont think love ought to be that way  
No I dont think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know Id get by  
But I dont think love ought to be that way  
  
You say a precious moment  
Is all that it would be  
That Id forget about you  
And youd forget me  
Oh I love what youre saying  
Its tempting me so  
And though I love to hear it  
Theres no way that Ill let go  
  
But I dont think love ought to be that way  
No I dont think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know Id get by  
But I dont think love ought to be that way  
  
No  
  
But I dont think love ought to be that way  
No I dont think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know Id get by  
But I dont think love ought to be that way  
  
But I dont think love ought to be that way  
No I dont think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know Id get by  
But I dont think love ought to be that way  
  
But I dont think love ought to be that way  
No I dont think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know Id get by  
But I dont think love ought to be that way
