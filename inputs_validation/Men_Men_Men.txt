Men men men umm uum

Men men milk and honey  
Gods little gift for woman  
  
I want you clever but not too clever  
I want you bad but not too bad  
I want you strong but not too strong  
I want you to try your rightful position  
  
Oh too too much I mean its so good  
  
Men men snails and puppies  
Your muscles are not for fighting in war  
Your lips are not for voicing opinions  
Your eyes are there for us to look into  
I want you to take your rightful position  
  
Oh too too much I mean its so good  
  
Men men grapes and nuts  
Your pants are never tight enough  
Your boots are never long enough  
Your skin is never young enough  
I want you to hold your rightful position  
  
Pardon me honeycum your hair pieces slipping  
  
Men men apples and figs  
I like you to be faithful but not very fussy  
I like you to be behind me but not just beside me  
I like you to shut up but know when to say yes  
I want you to learn your frightful position  
  
Pardon me starstud your cod pieces showing  
  
Now you know what you have to dooh  
Now you know whats expected of youhoohoohoo  
So come come come come  
Come up and hum hum  
Come up and hum hum  
Come up and see me sometime  
Come up and see me sometime  
  
Ladies and gents Id like to introduce you to my lower half  
Without whom I wont be breathing so heavily  
Honey juice you can come out of the box now  
  
Yes dear
