Yeah yeah oh  
  
Oh I was broken hearted  
Feeling sad and all alone  
I thought I was going crazy  
  
I thought the pain would last forever  
I thought hed never ever hurt me and hurt me  
Over and over again  
  
Ohh  
When you tried into my world  
You showed the loving ways of how  
A guy should treat a girl  
The love you give that makes me breathe again  
  
Ive found someone who feels me  
An understanding friend till the end  
  
I know the future no one can see  
But I feel deep in my heart  
You will stay with me eternally  
  
So just love me  
Even every day  
And hold me in your arms now  
Please love the hurt away  
  
Ill make it go away yes I will  
Britney Oh hurt away ohhh  
  
I see heaven in your eyes  
Tell me why would he make you cry and lie  
He must have been out of his mind  
  
I would never hurt you baby  
Dont let one fool turn you cold oh no  
Youve got a heart of gold  
  
Heart Of gold  
I love everything about you  
All I know is  
  
Every word I take it straight to you  
A special part of I give for everything I do  
  
Nobody else comes close to the love you give  
Body and soul  
Im gonna love you for as long as I live  
  
And I know  
Its not easy letting go No its not easy  
But I wont let you fall  
Together you and me  
Weve got it all

More and more each day  
I rest my head on your shoulder  
Please love the hurt away  
  
Love the hurt away

But I feel deep in my heart  
You will stay with me eternally
