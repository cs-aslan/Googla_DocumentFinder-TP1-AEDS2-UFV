It was 96 in South Carolina  
Thats the place and not the goddamn year  
Just sittin on the porch out at Bobbys place  
Just tuggin on a lukewarm beer  
And there i was peepin like an old sidewinder  
Just an inch or so above the mud  
The first to find out that its rainin  
is the last to find out its a flood  
  
It was Paradise Valley Nevada  
Not far from where the west was won  
I am the only black face in the whole damn place  
Just a raisin in the blazing sun  
And there i am like that old sidewinder  
Just wishin that her eggs aint hatched  
And the chain i wear has em wishin for the day when it came with a ball
attached  
  
So Im gonna move right outta this town  
When this old skin stops weighin me down  
This old skin  
  
He was sittin in the very same spot that  
Otis sat to watch the dock of the bay  
In the very same spot that the ships rolled in  
Now theres nothing but the mud and the clay  
  
Im gonna move right outta this town  
This old skin its weighin me down  
This old skin  
  
Outside Orlando when the sunshine state  
Has just upped itself another degree  
I am the very last orange of the whole years crop  
Hangin dearly to the branch of the tree  
And the wind and the spring couldnt do anything  
So im burnin in the sun of the south  
That old sidewinder in the dust below  
Im just waiting till it opens its mouth  
  
So Im gonna move right outta this town  
When this old skin finally touches the ground  
this old skin  
  
He was sittin in the very same spot that  
Otis sat to watch the dock of the bay  
In the very same spot that the ships rolled in  
Now theres nothing but the mud and the clay  
  
Now Im gonna move right outta this town  
When this old skin finally touches the ground  
This old skin  
This old skin  
This old skin  
This old skin
