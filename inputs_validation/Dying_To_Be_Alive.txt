I heard you crying  
Somebody stole my soul  
How could I be dying  
I turned twenty five days ago yeah  
Were all on the ground just crying out  
Would somebody save me please  
I wont sit around just thinkin bout the troubles that tomorrow brings yeah  
  
Chorus  
Im dying to be alive yeah  
Im dying to be alive yeah  
Lets not go through our lives  
With out just dying to be alive  
  
The people youve touched  
They way youve touched them  
I hope theydve touched you too  
cause in this life its hard to tell  
Whats false and what is true yea  
Were all on the ground just cryin out  
Would somebody save me please  
I wont sit around just thinking about  
The troubles that tomorrow brings  
  
Chorus  
  
And we all come tumbling down  
No matter how strong we all return to the ground  
Another day gone  
A day closer to fate  
And soon well find its a little bit too late  
  
The things you see the way you see them  
Will never be seen again  
Lets go through life livin on luck  
Betting ten thousand to ten  
Mistakes Ive made in this life  
I cant say why or when  
But the thing thats strange is you only live once  
Ill never look back again yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
And we all come tumbling down  
No matter how strong  
We all return to the ground  
In the days to come youll say why did I wait  
You cant just leave your life up to fate  
Youve gotta turn it around before its too late
