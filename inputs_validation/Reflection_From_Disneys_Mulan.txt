Look at me now yeah  
You may think you see  
Who I really am  
But youll never know me  
  
Everyday  
Its as if I play  
A part  
  
Now I see  
If I wear a mask  
I can fool the world  
But I cannot fool my heart  
  
Chorus  
  
Who is that girl I see  
Staring straight  
Back at me  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am inside  
  
I am now  
In a world  
Where I have to hide my heart  
And what I believe in  
  
But somehow  
I will show the world whats inside my heart  
And be loved for who I am  
  
Who is that girl I see  
Staring straight  
Back at me  
Why is my reflection someone I dont know  
  
Must I pretend that Im  
Someone else  
For all time  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am inside  
  
Theres a heart that must be free  
To fly  
That burns with a need to know  
The reason why  
  
Why must we all conceal  
What we think  
How we feel  
  
Must there be  
A secret me  
Im forced to hide  
I wont pretend that Im  
Someone else  
For all time  
  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am inside  
  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am inside  
  
Oh ooh yeah
