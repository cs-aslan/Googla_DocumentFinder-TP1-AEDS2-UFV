Today well be talking about the reporting artists The Insane Clown Posse  
They look too spooky Dickface It kinda reminds me of gang related  
Before the antiChrist who is coming  
  
Remember me bitch 8th grade  
Ball park skinny ass wellfare aid  
Ulster and Bruce brothers we was the shit  
Dungeons Dragons and Bruce Lee flicks  
Quit school nobody missed us  
Nobody hugged and kissed us only dissed us  
Now look at these beautiful model type high class women  
Takin my dick in em  
You dont remember my kind in class  
The whipped out freak starin at your ass  
Never had the courage to even say hi  
Only smell your perfume vapors as you walk by  
Im the scrub that never crossed your mind  
Now your flashing your titties at me waitin in line  
And thats fine while youre working your charm  
Look beneath the paint bitch its the scrubs who won  
  
You used to say Ahhh Hah  
Look at him the same pair of pants and that shirt again  
An outcast I knew I had to do something  
Figure out a way to make something out of nothin  
Open up shop got what you need  
Speakers clothes CDs or bags of weed  
But that shit got me nowhere except jail  
Me and all my homies to broke to make the bail  
So now were right back at the place we started  
Chuckles and laugh the second we turn our backs  
Assed out but we was like fuck yall  
We got each other and the drop of the homie call  
Look at us now bitch holdin platinum  
All up on my dick but Im the same as back then  
Forget the money and fame because  
Beneath the paint lifes just as it always was  
  
Look at me  
Analyze What you see  
Look at me  
Analyze What you see  
  
Another girl I dont dare to confide in  
Playing that role it hurts inside  
Here I am thinking she wants me  
She only wants that killer on her CD  
Just when I couldnt feel any worse  
Bitch asked me if I could paint my face first  
The day I finally get to leave this land  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man  
The shell of a used up man  
The shell of a used up man  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man Analyze  
The shell of a used up man  
The shell of a used up man  
Nothing left but the shell of a used up man  
Nothing left but the shell of a used up man  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man Analyze  
The shell of a used up man  
The shell of a used up man
