Day after day Im more confused  
But I look for the light through the pouring rain  
You know thats a game that I hate to lose  
Oh Im feeling strange aint it a shame  
  
Ohh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away  
  
Im getting the feelin that Im wasting my time  
You dont understand the things I do  
The World outside looks so unkind  
Im countin on you to carry me through  
  
Ohh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boy and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away  
  
And when my mind is free  
No melody can move me  
When Im feelin blue  
I guess Im coming through and soothe me  
Thanks for the joy that youve given me  
I want you to klnow I believe in your soul  
Let me rhyme in harmony  
You helped me along youre makin me strong  
  
Ohh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boy and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away  
  
Ohh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boy and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away
