And hell tell her hes working late again  
But she knows to well theres something goin on  
Shes been neglected and she needs a friend  
So her trembling fingers dial the telephone  
  
And Lord it hurts her doin this again  
Hes the best friend that her husband ever knew  
When shes lonely hes more than just a friend  
Hes the one she loans her body to  
  
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers  
Hoping no one else discovers  
Where they go what they do  
In their secret hideaway  
  
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers  
They dont want to hurt the others  
So they love in the nighttime  
And shake hands in the light of day  
  
And when its over theres no peace of mind  
Just a longin for the way things should have been  
And she wonders why some men never find  
That a woman needs a lover and a friend  
  
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
