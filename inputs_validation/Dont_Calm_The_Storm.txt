  
  
  
  
You say you need some time on your own  
  
You say we should put our love on hold  
  
But baby dont leave me now all alone in the cold  
  
You said you believed in us  
  
But now your walking away from me  
  
  
Chorus Dont calm the stormkeep a walking baby  
  
Just walk out that door  
  
Or youll stay a whilebut you stayed a while  
  
And well make it right  
  
Dont be afraid  
  
I know how to ease my pain  
  
  
I know there were things I said that were wrong  
  
 Girl I always knew where my heart belonged  
  
If you want me to walk away I will but it hurts me so  
  
Oh baby open your eyes  
  
open youre ever Hear me now  
  
heam me now It doesnt have to be this way  
  
CHORUS x2
