DW Washburn I heard a sweet voice say  
DW Washburn this is your lucky day  
A hot bowl of soup is waitin  
A hot bowl of soup and a shave  
DW Washburn we picked you to say  
  
Cant you hear the bugle call Cant you hear the bells  
Even you can be reborn you naughty  
If you dont get out of that gutter  
before the next big rain  
DW Wahsburn youre gonna wash right down the drain  
  
Up up come on get up off your street  
If you can only make it from your hands to your knees  
I know you can make it to your feet Wooah  
DW Washburn I said to myself  
DW Washburn why dont you go save sombody else  
  
Well I got no job to go to  
I dont work and I dont get paid  
I got a bottle of wine Im feelin fine  
And I believe I got it made  
  
Id like to thank all you good people  
for comin to my aid  
But Im DW Washburn  
I do believe I got it made  
  
I do believe I got it made dont need nobody  
I do believe I got it made I do believe I got it made
