Theres a song in the air  
But the fair senorita  
Doesnt seem to care  
For the song in the air  
So Ill sing to my mule  
If youre sure she wont think that  
I am just a fool  
Serenading a mule  
  
Amigo mio does she not have a dainty bray  
She listens carefully to each little word we play  
La bella Senorita  
Si si mi muchachito  
Shed love to sing it too if only she knew the way  
But try as she may  
In her voice theres a flaw  
And all that the lady can say  
Is EEAW  
  
Theres a light in her eye  
Tho she may try to hide it  
She cannot deny  
Theres a light in her eye  
Oh the charm of her smile  
So beguiles all who see her  
That theyd ride a mile  
For the charm of her smile  
  
Amigo mio is she listenin to my song  
No no mi muchachito how could you be so wrong  
La bella Senorita  
Si Si la senorita  
If she knew all the words  
  
Well maybe shed sing along  
  
Her face is a dream  
Like an angel I saw  
But all that my darlin can scream  
Is EEAW  
Senorita donkey sita not so fleet as a mosquito  
But so sweet like my Chiquita  
Youre the one for me  
  
Youre the one for me
