Its the story of a lovely lady  
Who was bringing up three very lovely girls  
All of them had hair of gold like their mother  
The youngest one in curls  
  
Its a story of a man named Brady  
Who was busy with three boys of his own  
They were four men living all together  
Yeah but they were all alone  
  
Until the one day one day when the lady met the fellow  
And they knew and they knew it was much more than a hunch  
Then they knew this group must somehow form a family  
Thats the way thats the way thats the way they all became
