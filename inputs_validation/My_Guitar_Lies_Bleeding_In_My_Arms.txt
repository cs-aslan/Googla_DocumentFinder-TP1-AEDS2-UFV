Misery likes company I like the way that sounds  
Ive been trying to find the meaning  
So I can write it down  
Staring out the window its such a long way down  
Id like to jump but Im afraid to hit the ground  
  
I cant write a love song the way I fell today  
I cant sing no song of hope  
Ive got nothing to say  
Life is feeling kind of strange  
Since you went away  
I sing this song to you wherever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms  
  
Im tired of watching TV it makes me want to scream  
Outside the world is burning  
Man its so hard to believe  
Each day you know youre dying  
From the cradle to the grave  
I get so numb sometimes that I just feel the pain  
  
I cant write a love song the way I feel today  
I cant sing no song of hope  
I got nothing to say  
Life is feeling kind of strange  
Strange enough these days  
I send this song to you whoever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms  
  
Staring at the paper I dont know what to write  
Ill have my cigarettewell turn out the lights  
Maybe tomorrow Ill feel a different way  
But here in my delusion I dont know what to say  
  
I cant write a love song the way I feel today  
I cant sing no song of hope  
Ive got nothing to say  
And I cant fight the feelings  
That are burning in my veins  
I send this song to you wherever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding  
  
I cant write a love song the way I feel today  
I cant sing no song of hope  
Theres no one left to save  
And I cant fight the feelings buried in my brains  
I send this song to you wherever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
