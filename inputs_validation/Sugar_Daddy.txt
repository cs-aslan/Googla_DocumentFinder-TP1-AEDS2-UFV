Ive got male intuition  
Ive got sexual ambition  
Im the last great tradition  
Let me state my position  
  
The older I get  
The better I was  
Its all just a show  
Its all just because  
The show must go on  
What else can it do  
Im gonna drop the load on you  
  
Sugar sugar daddy Sugar  
  
I got no inhibition  
I got all the ammunition  
Got the moves with position  
Cant you see my condition  
  
You gotta get your hands dirty  
When youre digging a ditch  
And gods  
Revenge on the rich  
  
Got the money got the moves  
Got the looks and the brakes  
Got the shirt got the shoes  
Got what it takes  
  
Youve got to lay it down  
Tell me what you need  
Youve got to lay it down  
Get up up from your feet you know  
I get it down  
You wanted sorrow want it sweet  
Daddy always gives you what is good for you  
  
Sugar sugar daddy Sugar  
  
Ive got male intuition  
Its a desperate condition  
Nearly out of ammunition  
Sexual ambition  
  
Whoa  
Holy schmoly  
Im a one man army  
Yeah a one man mob  
Woohoo  
Im the McDaddy  
You dont send a boy to do a mans job  
  
And you make me feel  
Like Im not alone  
Ive been singing this song  
Since before you were born  
Baby youre invited  
But your friend cant come  
Hes a little too excited  
Maybe a little too young  
  
Ah baby youre invited  
But your friend cant come  
Hes a little too rich  
Maybe a little too young  
The show must go on  
What else can it do  
Im gonna drop it all on you  
  
Sugar sugar daddy  
Sugar sugar daddy  
Sugar sugar daddy  
Sugar sugar daddy  
Sugar
