When the train pulls in the station youll be waiting by the track  
Youre havin trouble sleepin nights you want me to come back  
But that old train will roll on by youll know I never came  
While I sleep good and miss a lot of trains  
  
I sleep good and I miss a lot of trains  
That one way track to no mans love Ill never ride again  
I used to lie awake at night callin out your name  
Now I sleep good and miss a lot of trains  
  
Your standin in the station I can see you in my mind  
You think that Ill forgive again but youre so wrong this time  
Your sleepless eyes and selfish heart are waiting there in vain  
While I sleep good and miss a lot of trains  
  
I sleep good and I miss a lot of trains  
That one way track to no mans love Ill never ride again  
I used to lie awake at night callin out your name  
Now I sleep good and miss a lot of trains
