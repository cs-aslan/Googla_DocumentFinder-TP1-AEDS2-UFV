Bartender I may sit here on this bar stool all night long  
But I wont need much attention  
I just need some time alone  
So if youll give me some quarters and a bottle of your best  
You can just sit back and let the jukebox do the rest  
  
Give it to me Strait  
Sing Am I Blue while I sit here and cry  
And tell me how my babys gotten so good at goodbye  
Its gonna take a fireman to put this old flame out  
So come on give it to me Strait  
Before I come unwound  
  
Lets start off nice and easy  
Something like If I Know Me  
And well work our way up slowly to Fool Hearted Memory  
Yeah Ive got all night long to sit right here and fall apart  
So dont leave out one single song  
I know em all by broken heart  
  
Give it to me Strait  
Sing Am I Blue  
While I sit here and cry  
And tell me how my babys gotten so good at goodbye  
Its gonna take a fireman to put this old flame out  
So come on give it to me Strait  
Before I come unwound  
  
There aint one country singer  
That aint good for a bad heartache  
And for me theres nothing smoother  
Than a good stiff shot of Strait  
  
Its gonna take a fireman to put this old flame out  
So come on give it to me Strait  
Before I come unwound  
So come on give it to me Strait  
Before I come unwound
