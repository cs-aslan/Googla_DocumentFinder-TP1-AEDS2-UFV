Im gonna build a private graveyard  
On the outskirts of town  
And if my baby dont get home tonight  
Im agonna lower her down  
Cause it aint right  
Lord no everything aint right  
  
I saw her out just the other night  
She was really on a spree  
She was makin love to some other guy  
Right there in front of me  
That aint right  
Uhhuh no everything aint right  
  
But Im agonna buy her pretty things  
And try to change her mind  
Cause I gotta have her with me tonight  
I need her lovin all of the time  
My heart aint right  
Lord no everything aint right  
  
I could build the highest bridges  
Over waters deep and wide  
To have her love back with me again  
It would ease this pain inside  
The world aint right  
Uhhuh no everything aint right  
  
And I find myself in darkness  
You took away the light  
And I know theres never been a fool  
Like me before tonight  
That aint right  
Lord no everything aint right  
  
But I think Ill write my will out  
And sign it before too long  
You aint agonna spend my money uhhuh  
Not after this poor boys gone  
That wouldnt be right  
Lord no everything aint right
