Sometimes we fall down and cant get back up  
Were hiding behind skin thats too tough  
How come we dont say I love you enough  
Till its too late its not too late  
  
Our hearts are hungry for a food that wont come  
We could make a feast from these crumbs  
And were all staring down the barrel of a gun  
So if your life flashed before you  
What would you wish you wouldve done  
  
Yeah gotta start  
Lookin at the hand of the time weve been given here  
This is all we got and we gotta start thinkin  
If every second counts on a clock thats tickin  
Gotta live like were dying  
  
Yeah we got 86400 seconds in a day  
To turn it all around or throw it all away  
We gotta tell em that we love em  
While we got the chance to say  
Gotta live like were dying  
  
And if your plane fell out of the skies  
Who would you call with your last goodbyes  
Should be so careful who we let fall out of our lives  
So when we long for absolution  
Therell be no one on the line  
  
Yeah gotta start  
Lookin at the hand of the time weve been given here  
This is all we got and we gotta start thinkin if  
Every second counts on a clock thats tickin  
Gotta live like were dying  
  
We only got 86400 seconds in a day  
To turn it all around or throw it all away  
We gotta tell em that we love em  
While we got the chance to say  
Gotta live like were dying  
  
Like were dying oh  
Like were dying  
Like were dying oh  
Like were dying  
  
We only got 86400 seconds in a day  
To turn it all around or throw it all away  
We gotta tell em that we love em  
While we got the chance to say  
Gotta live like were dying  
  
You never know a good thing till its gone  
You never see a crash until its head on  
All these people right when were dead wrong  
You never know a good thing till its gone  
  
Yeah gotta start  
Lookin at the hand of the time weve been given here  
This is all we got and we gotta start thinkin if  
Every second counts on a clock thats tickin  
Gotta live like were dying  
  
We only got 86400 seconds in a day  
To turn it all around or throw it all away  
We gotta tell em that we love em  
While we got the chance to say  
Gotta live like were dying  
  
Like were dying oh  
Like were dying  
Like were dying oh  
Like were dying  
  
We only got 86400 seconds in a day  
To turn it all around or throw it all away  
We gotta tell em that we love em  
While we got the chance to say  
Gotta live like were dying  
Live like were dying
