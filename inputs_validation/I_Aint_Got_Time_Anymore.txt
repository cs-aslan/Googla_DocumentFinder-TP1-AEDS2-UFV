Got no time to stop to speak to friends passing by  
Got no strength to wipe away the tears from my eyes  
I dont care whats going on  
Only know shes gone  
  
The sun dont shine anymore  
And I dont feel fine anymore  
She aint mine anymore  
No I dont feel fine anymore  
I aint got time anymore  
  
Seems to be such sadness in each place I go  
The people laugh and still I just wouldnt know  
Never stop to see whos there  
Once I used to care  
  
But the sun dont shine anymore  
I dont feel fine anymore  
She aint mine anymore  
No I dont feel fine anymore  
I aint got time anymore  
  
I cant get used to being left on my own  
It takes up all the time just trying to be alone  
Used to take an interest in the state of affairs  
Now I only know how much Im missing that girl  
Hope the world will understand I cant lend a hand  
  
Cause she aint mine anymore  
I dont feel fine anymore  
She aint mine anymore  
No I dont feel fine anymore  
Aint got time anymore  
  
She aint mine anymore  
I dont feel fine anymore  
Aint got time anymore  
She aint mine anymore  
No I dont feel fine anymore
