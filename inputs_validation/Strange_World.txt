Flowers and lights are taking my feet of the ground  
And Im flying speeds completely unknown to man  
No one can help me once Im off to dreaming time  
Ive entered that world and Im on my own  
And I feel it all right  
chorus  
Its a strange strange world  
That I live in  
Its a strange strange world  
At night  
Mama Mary what you got cooking for me this time  
I swear I saw the devil running across the room last night  
Doctors an dioxine aint gonna medicate me no  
Darling in your arms Ill be fine with a cup of tea  
chorus  
Well I Im a parnanoia schizophrenic being  
What about the monkey talking nonsense on tv  
chorus
