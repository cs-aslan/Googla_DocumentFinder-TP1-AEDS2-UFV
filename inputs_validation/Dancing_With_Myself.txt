On the floors of Tokyo  
Down in London towns a gogo  
With the record selection  
And the mirrors reflection  
Im adancing with myself  
  
Oh when theres no one else in sight  
In the crowded lonely night  
Well I wait so long for my love vibration  
And Im dancing with myself  
  
Oh dancing with myself  
Oh dancing with myself  
Well theres nothing to lose  
And theres nothing to prove  
And Im dancing with myself  
  
If I looked all over the world  
And theres every type of girl  
But your empty eyes seem to pass me by  
And leave me dancing with myself  
  
So lets sink another drink  
Cause itll give me time to think  
If I had a chance Id ask one to dance  
And Id be dancing with myself  
  
Oh dancing with myself  
Oh dancing with myself  
Well theres nothing to lose  
And theres nothing to prove  
And Im dancing with myself  
  
Oh dancing with myself  
Oh dancing with myself  
Well theres nothing to lose  
And theres nothing to prove  
And Im dancing with myself  
  
So lets sink another drink  
Cause itll give me time to think  
If I had a chance Id ask the world to dance  
And Ill be dancing with myself  
Ill be dancing with myself  
So lets sink another drink  
Cause itll give me time to think  
  
Oh dancing with myself  
Oh dancing with myself  
Well theres nothing to lose  
And theres nothing to prove  
And Im dancing with myself  
  
Oh dancing with myself  
Oh dancing with myself  
Well theres nothing to lose  
And theres nothing to prove  
And Im dancing with myself
