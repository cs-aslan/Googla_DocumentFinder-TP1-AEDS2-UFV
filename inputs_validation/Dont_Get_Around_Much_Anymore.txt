Missed the Saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldnt bear it without you  
Dont Get Around Much Anymore  
  
Thought Id visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
Theyd have asked me about you  
Dont Get Around Much Anymore  
  
Oh darling I guess  
My minds more at ease  
But nevertheless  
Why bring my memo why bring my memo  
Why bring my memories  
  
Been invited on dates  
Might have gone but what for  
Its awfully different without you  
Dont Get Around Much Anymore  
  
Thought Id visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
Theyd have asked me about you  
Dont Get Around Much Anymore  
  
Oh darling I guess  
My minds more at ease  
But nevertheless  
Why bring my memo why bring my memo  
Why bring my memories  
  
Oooooh
