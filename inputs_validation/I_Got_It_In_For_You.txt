Baby Ive been your shadow  
Im on your heels both night and day  
Baby Im getting warmer  
Im getting closer inches away  
Ive been watching every move you make  
And Ive got feelings overdue  
  
I got it in for you  
I got it in for you  
I got it in for you  
I got it in for you  
  
Ive been runnin under cover  
In the darkness of the night  
So if youre looking over your shoulder  
You will see me out of sight  
Now Im moving into your light  
I think its high time you knew  
  
I got it in for you  
Im not gonna give up  
I got it in for you  
Dont want to do without  
I got it in for you  
Ill win you over  
I got it in for you  
Over and over  
I got it in for you  
I got it in for you  
I got it in for you  
I got it in for you  
  
Baby dont you worry  
You wont be lonely anymore  
Baby Ive been planning  
All the romance youre looking for  
And its right outside your door  
And tonight Im comin through  
  
I got it in for you  
I got it in for you  
I got it in for you  
I got it in for you
