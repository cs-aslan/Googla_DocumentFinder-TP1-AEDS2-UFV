Deep in my heart theres a fear  
And in my eyes youll find a tear  
Im scared that Im losing you  
Thats why I cry  
If I should lose you little angel Id die  
Oh little angel Id die  
Ohoh I had a dream and you were gone  
Without your love I was alone  
So dont ever leave me and dont say goodbye  
If I should lose you little angel Id die  
Oh little angel Id die  
Deep in my heart I have to know  
Your love is true dont ever go  
So tell me Im crazy to worry bout you  
Tell me that your love little angel is true  
Oh that your love is true
