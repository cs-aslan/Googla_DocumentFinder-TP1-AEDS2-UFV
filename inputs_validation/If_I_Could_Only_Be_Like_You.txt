Reba Mcentire with Susie Luchsinger  
  
I know I havent said the words the way I used to  
I shouldve made the time I know  
When I didnt know which way to turn I turned to you  
You always seemed to know which way to go  
You know you always seem to see the best in me  
You stand by me no matter how things are  
If I havent told you lately how I feel  
Let me tell you now whats in my heart  
  
If I could only be like you  
You always seemed to see the good  
And then you make a dream come true  
And ask for nothing in return  
You always know just what to do  
Youre someone I can look up to  
Id be a better me  
If I could only be like you  
  
You know youve always seen me through the worst of times  
You have a way of lighting up the dark  
And though were sometimes far apart somehow across the miles  
I still know youre never very far  
You know you always seem to see the best in me  
And you stand by me no matter how things are  
If I havent told you lately how I feel  
Let me tell you now whats in my heart  
  
If I could only be like you  
You always seemed to see the good  
And then you make a dream come true  
And ask for nothing in return  
You always know just what to do  
Youre someone I can look up to  
Id be a better me  
If I could only be like you  
Like you  like you
