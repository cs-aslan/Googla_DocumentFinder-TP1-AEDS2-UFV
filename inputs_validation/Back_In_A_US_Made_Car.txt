Back In A us Made Car  
Back In The ussrBeatles  
  
Ohhh  
Used to drive a Honda CIVIC  
Didnt sleep a wink at night  
Autoworkers laidoff in Detroit last week  
Man its such a dreadful sight  
  
Im back in a us made car  
You know how lazy we are boys  
Back in a us made car  
  
Power steering power windows seats and brakes  
Its bigger than the Astrodome  
Drive it under 50 or the backend shakes  
God I hope it gets me home  
  
Im back in a us made car  
You know how lazy we are boys  
Back in a us  
Back in the DoLess  
Back in a us made car  
  
Those foreign cars really knock me out  
They leave Chevettes behind  
They cruise right past all the screams and shouts  
From gm unemployment lili  
Lililililililines  
  
Oh tow that Iacocca monster to my house  
You didnt have to twist my arm  
Its my patriotic duty to be helping out  
Cant let the big three buy the farm  
  
Im back in us made car  
A gallon dont go too far boy  
Back in a us made car
