A silent call from a distant land  
Crying for a helping hand so  
How long will it go on  
Ignorance and vanity  
Supersede humanity so  
How long it will go on  
I want to know how long will it go on  
  
We cant wait any longer  
Theyre crying out doesnt it matter  
We cant wait any longer  
No no Too long in a slumber  
Shake it upwake it up now  
We cant wait any longer No no  
  
Another child is laid to rest  
Another day of hopelessness so  
How long it will go on  
And every day were on the fence brings  
Another fatal consequence so  
How long will it go on  
I want to know how long will it go on  
  
Yuko awezayo kusikia kilio chetu Can somebody hear us crying out  
Twaomba msaada wenu Somebody help us  
Aweko mwenye kuttuoka Somebody save us  
Aweko mwenye kutupa uhuru Somebody free us
