All aboard the disco train  
Alright now oh yeah oh yeah  
  
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk  
Im a womans man no time to talk  
Musics loud and women warm  
Ive been kicked around since Ive been born  
  
Its all right its okay  
And you may look the other way  
We can try to understand  
The New York Times effect on man  
  
Whether youre a brother or whether youre a mother  
Youre stayin alive stayin alive  
Feel the city breakin and everyone is shakin  
And stayin alive stayin alive  
Ha ha ha ha stayin alive stayin alive  
Ha ha ha ha ha stayin alive  
  
Everybody on the dance floor darlins  
Were goin to dance with the Devil  
  
Well I get low and I get high  
And if I cant get either I really try  
Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes  
Im a dancin man and I just cant lose  
  
Now its all right its okay  
Ill live to see another day  
We can try to understand  
The New York Times effect on man  
  
Whether youre a brother or whether youre a mother  
Youre stayin alive stayin alive  
Feel the city breakin and everyone is shakin  
Theyre stayin alive stayin alive  
Ha ha ha ha stayin alive stayin alive  
Ha ha ha ha stayin alive  
  
Its all right its okay  
And you may look the other way  
We can try to understand  
The New York Times effect on man  
  
Its all right its okay  
Ill live to see another day  
We can try to understand  
The New York Times effect on man  
  
Are you ready Disco Man  
Oh yeah all right now  
Im back
