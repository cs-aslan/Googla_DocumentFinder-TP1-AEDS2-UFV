Just when I think Ive forgotten you and our cheating loves at an end  
I vowed to myself Ill see you no more but here we are again  
  
That dimly cafe where I first met you slowly has turned into our secret
randezvous  
Our vows belong to others that makes our love unfair  
But I just cant seem to find a way to end our love affair  
Just when I think Ive forgotten you  
 guitar   
Just when I think Ive forgotten you
