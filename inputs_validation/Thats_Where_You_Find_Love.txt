In your eyes  
I found the greatest prize  
You and I could not be closer  
  
And in your arms  
Is everything I want  
Now I know my search is over  
  
And I dont know where you take me  
But its exactly where I wanna be  
  
Its where the stars line up  
Its where the oceans touch  
Its in a place youve never been that feels like home  
Its in the air right now  
Its where you give your all  
And give a little more  
Ive never been so sure  
Thats where you find love  
  
People pass  
And listen to us laugh  
Wishing that they had the same thing  
  
And our friends they ask  
How we made it last  
I just smile and say the same thing  
  
Im not sure how we got here  
Baby Im just glad you got here  
  
Its where the stars line up  
Its where the oceans touch  
Its in a place youve never been that feels like home  
Its in the air right now  
Its where you give your all  
And give a little more  
Ive never been so sure  
Thats where you find love  
  
Thats where you find love  
  
Its where the stars line up  
Its where the oceans touch  
Its in a place youve never been that feels like home  
  
Its in the air right now  
Its where you give your all  
And give a little more  
Ive never been this sure  
Thats where you find love  
  
Find love  
Thats where you find love
