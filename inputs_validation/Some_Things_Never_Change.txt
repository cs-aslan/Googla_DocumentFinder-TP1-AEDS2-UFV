After all this time I still miss you everyday  
The same world spins around  
I guess some things never change  
  
Sometimes I go out but it never feels the same  
I still look for you  
Baby some things never change  
  
When I said Id love you for eternity  
I just never knew how true those words would be  
  
Just an old love song just the mention of your name  
My heart breaks in two again  
I guess some things never change  
  
Maybe someday someone else will set me free  
Until then Ill live with your loves legacy  
  
And Ill keep holding on  
Hoping youll come back someday  
You can rest assured baby some things never change  
  
Girl Im still in love with you I guess  
Some things never change
