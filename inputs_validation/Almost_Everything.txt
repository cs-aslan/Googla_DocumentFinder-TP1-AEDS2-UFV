Im waiting for some kind of healing to begin  
And I wonder if you know the kind of pain Im in  
Its hard wondering just what it is you see  
  
There hasnt been a moment youve been off my mind  
Ive searched through every meditation I can find  
As if something could bring you back to me  
  
Do I go on in silence  
Or shout at the sky  
  
Give me all the earthly treasures  
That a single man can hold  
Put the magic in my fingers  
That turns everything to gold  
Hand me the sun say that Ive won  
The world on a string  
And then I will have almost everything  
  
I imagine you until I swear I feel your touch  
And I read the words you wrote me when it gets too much  
The one piece of solace I can steal  
  
I still need you in my life  
Like never before  
  
Give me all the earthly treasures  
That a single man can hold  
Put the magic in my fingers  
That turns everything to gold  
Hand me the sun say I have won  
The world on a string  
And then I will have almost everything  
  
I still need you in my life  
More than ever before  
  
Give me all the earthly treasures  
That a single man can hold  
Put the magic in my fingers  
That turns everything to gold  
Hand me the sun say I have won  
The world on a string  
And then I will have almost everything
