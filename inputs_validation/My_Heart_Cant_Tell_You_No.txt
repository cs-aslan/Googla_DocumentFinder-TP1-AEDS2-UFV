I dont want you  
To come round here no more  
I beg you for mercy  
You dont know how strong  
My weakness is  
Or how much it hurts me  
Cause when you said its over with him  
I want to believe its true  
So I let you in knowing tomorrow  
Im gonna wake up missing you  
Wake up missing you  
  
When the one you loves  
In love with someone else  
Dont you know its torture  
I mean its a living hell  
No matter how I try to convince myself  
This time I wont lose control  
One look in your blue eyes  
And suddenly my heart cant tell you no  
  
I dont want you  
To call me up no more  
Saying you need me  
Youre crazy if you think  
Just half your love  
Could ever please me  
Still I want to hold you touch you  
When you look at me that way  
Theres only one solution I know  
You gotta stay away from me  
Stay away from me  
  
When the one you loves  
In love with someone else  
Dont you know its torture  
I mean its a living hell  
No matter how I try to convince myself  
This time I wont lose control  
One look in your sad eyes  
And suddenly my heart cant tell you no  
My Heart cant tell you no  
  
I dont want you  
To come round here no more  
I beg you for mercy  
You dont know how strong  
My weakness is  
Or how much it hurts me  
Cause when you say its over with him  
I want to believe its true  
So I let you in knowing tomorrow  
Im gonna wake up missing you  
Wake up missing you  
  
When the one you loves  
In love with someone else  
Dont you know its torture  
I mean its a living hell a living hell  
When the one you loves  
In love with someone else  
Dont you know its torture  
I mean its a living hell a living hell
