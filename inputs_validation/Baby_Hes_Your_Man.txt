Well its two am  
Youre just getting in  
Soon youll be creepin into bed  
Later youll pretend  
You were out with a friend  
But Im still inside your head  
  
I dont understand  
You say Im your man  
When its clear youre seein another  
You can call me a fool for just loving you  
But girl Ill never find another  
  
If you think hell love you better  
Your every wish is his command  
Baby hes your man  
  
Baby hes your man  
  
Well you spoke your mind  
But I still cant find whats wrong with you and me  
I got something to say and baby come what may  
Baby we were never meant to be  
  
So I want you to know  
I cant let him go  
til find a love thats real  
I dont like this game  
I dont need this pain  
Im just saying what I feel  
I know he can love me better  
My every wish is his command  
  
Baby hes your man  
  
Baby hes your man  
  
Baby hes your man
