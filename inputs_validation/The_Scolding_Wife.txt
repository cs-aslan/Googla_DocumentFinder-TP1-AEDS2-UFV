Well I came into a scolding wife a few short years ago  
And ever since I lead a life of misery and woe  
My wife she is a tyrant around the   
Ah Id sell her to the devil for a glass or two of gin  
  
Sure Ill get up and go to work as mild as any man  
And shell get up and dress herself and go and have her dram  
And I chance to say a word its well I know my due  
Shell follow me with the fire shovel up and down the room  
  
Chorus  
And if the devild take her Id thank him for his pain  
I swear to God Ill hang myself if I get married again  
And if the devild take her Id thank him for his pain  
Though I swear to God Ill hang myself if I get married again  
  
When I get up at breakfast time shell tap me on the head  
When I come home at dinner time Ill find her drunk in bed  
When I come home at supper time at patience I must stop  
Cause she drinks whats in the teapot and I must drink the slop  
  
Chorus  
  
Well once I asked me scolding wife if I could go to bed  
She scare gave me an hour on the pillow to lay me head  
When like a roarin lion she came bustin down the door  
She caught me by the middle and threw me naked on the floor  
  
Chorus  
  
Now me and my companions go to a public place  
Shell search around the neighborhood until she finds my face  
Shell hoist me up in ridicule before the company  
Sayin Petticoats is your master and forever more shall be
