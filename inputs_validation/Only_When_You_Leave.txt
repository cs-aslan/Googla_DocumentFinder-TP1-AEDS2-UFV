Layin in the after glow  
I only want to learn what you know  
But now youre leavin  
How many hearts must you break  
And how many calls must I make  
  
But now youre leavin  
In this world all that I choose has come unbearable  
But love is in your touch  
Ooh its killing me so much  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh only when you leave  
Ill need to love you  
And when the action has all gone  
Im just a little fool enough to need you  
A fool enough too long  
Only when you leave youll leave in danger  
Ooh Ill make sure that you pay  
So give a little passion to a stranger  
And take this soul away  
  
I only want to make this things last  
So how could this have gone so fast  
And now youre leavin  
How many times must I learn  
Its only when youve gone that I burn  
  
And now youre leavin  
In the end all that is left has come unbearable  
Its hard to change your mind  
So leave it all behind  
  
Chorus  
  
Layin in the after glow  
I only want to learn what you know  
Ooh but now youre leavin  
How many hearts must you break  
And how many calls must I make  
  
But now youre leavin  
In this world all that I choose has come unbearable  
But love is in your touch  
Ooh its killing me so much  
  
Chorus  
  
Wooohohohno no no no  
  
Only when you leave youll leave in danger  
Ooh Ill make sure that you pay  
So give a little passion to a stranger
