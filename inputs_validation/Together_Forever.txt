If theres anything you need  
All you have to do is say  
You know you satisfy everything in me  
We shouldnt waste a single day  
  
So dont stop me falling  
Its destiny calling  
A power I just cant deny  
Its never changing  
Cant you hear me Im saying  
I want you for the rest of my life  
  
Chorus  
Together forever and never to part  
Together forever we two  
And dont you know  
I would move heaven and earth  
To be together forever with you  
  
If they ever get you down  
Theres always something I can do  
Because I wouldnt ever want to see you frown  
Ill always do whats best for you  
  
There aint no mistaking  
Its true love were making  
Something to last for all time  
Its never changing  
Cant you hear me Im saying  
I want you for the rest of my life  
  
Chorus  
  
So dont stop me falling  
Its destiny calling  
A power I just cant deny  
Its never changing  
Cant you hear me Im saying  
I want you for the rest of my life  
  
Chorus
