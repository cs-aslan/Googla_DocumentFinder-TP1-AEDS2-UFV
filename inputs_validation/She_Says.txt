Father Ive sinned  
Over and over and over and over again  
Sorry my friends  
Im such a mess  
Im doing the best I can  
She says where ya goin where ya been  
She says I dont want you hanging out with them  
She leaves like shes never coming back again on and on  
It goes on and on yea  
  
She says I dont love you like I loved you before  
She says she says I dont love you anymore  
  
And mother Ive tried over and over and over to open my eyes  
Look at my life  
Tell me when did I die  
Cause Im not alive  
Flip through the script and tell me what it says  
Skip through the story tell me how it ends  
She says that were probably better off as friends  
On and on and yea  
  
She says I dont love you like I loved you before  
She says she says yea  
She says I dont love you  
I dont love you anymore  
She says she says I dont love you I dont love you I dont love you
anymore  
She says she says she says where ya going  
I know I know I know I know I know  
She says she says she says where ya going  
I know I know I know I know I know  
She says she says she says where ya going  
I know I know I know I know I know  
She says she says she says where ya going  
I know I know I know I know I know  
What I want  
  
You you called the police  
You called them on me  
And I want to go anywhere but home  
I Im done listening to whats wrong with me  
Cause it goes on and on and on and on YEA  
  
She says I dont love you like I loved you before  
She says she says yea  
She says I dont love you I dont love you anymore  
She says she says I dont love like I love you anymore
