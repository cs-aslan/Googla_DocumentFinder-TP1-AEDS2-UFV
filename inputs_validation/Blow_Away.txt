One of the band told me last night  
That music is all that hes got in his life  
So where does it go  
Surely not with his soul  
Will all of his licks and his rnb  
Blow away  
  
Blow away blow away  
Blow away blow away  
Blow away blow away  
Blow away  
  
Our engineer had a different idea  
From people who nearly died but survived  
Feeling no fear of leaving their bodies here  
And went to a room that was soon full of visitors  
  
Hello minnie moony vicious vicious buddy holly sandy denny  
Please dont thump me  
Dont bump me  
Dont dump me back there  
Please dont thump me  
Dont bump me  
Dont dump me back there  
Please dont thump me  
Dont bump me

Put out the light then put out the light  
Vibes in the sky invite you to dine  
Dust to dust  
Blow to blow  
Bolan and moony are heading the show tonight
