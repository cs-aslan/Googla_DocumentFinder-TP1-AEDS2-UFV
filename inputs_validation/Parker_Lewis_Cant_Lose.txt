You laughed off my affections  
While I passed by your direction  
I should have known from your walk yeah  
It was the end of you  
  
Its not like I dont respect your opinion  
Quick with lips just rip me apart  
Sometimes its times like this yeah  
  
I got a big mouth  
And maybe you could handle shutting it up  
A simple contradiction  
Could shake my whole foundation  
Parker Lewis cant lose  
  
Taking back every step towards you  
Still failing at everything I do  
In the meantime just talking with my shoes  
Converse with my Converse  
At least they hear a word I say  
And scrutinize it  
Just as far as they can tell what Im getting at  
Tied my tongue around my neck  
For the last time  
  
Its not like I dont respect your opinion  
Quick with lips just tear me apart  
Sometimes its times like this yeah  
  
I got a big mouth  
And maybe you could handle shutting it up  
A simple contradiction  
Could shake my whole foundation  
Parker Lewis cant lose  
  
This is the last song about you
