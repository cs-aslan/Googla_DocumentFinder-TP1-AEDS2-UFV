Tell you bout a dream that I have every night  
Tell you bout a Dream that I have every night  
It aint kodachrome and it isnt black and white  
Take me for a fool if you feel thats right  
Well Im Never on my own but theres nobody in sight  
  
I dont know if Im scared of the Lightning  
Trying to reach me  
I cant turn to the left or the right  
Im too scared to run and Im too weak to fight  
But I dont Care its all psychobabble rap to me  
  
Tell you bout a dream that I have every night  
Its in dolby stereo but I never hear it right  
Take me for a fool well thats alright  
Well I see the way to go But there isnt any light  
  
I dont know why Im scared of the lightning  
Trying to reach me  
Help me to find what I dont want to know  
Youre taking me There but I dont want to go  
I dont care its all Psychobabble rap to me  
Psychobabble all psychobabble  
Psychobabble all psychobabble  
I dont care its all psychobabble rap to me  
  
Youre readin my mind you wont look in my eyes  
You say I do things that I dont Realise  
But I dont care its all psychobabble rap to me  
Psychobabble all psychobabble  
Psychobabble all psychobabble  
Youre lighting a scene thats faded to black  
I threw it away cause I dont want it back  
But I dont care its all psychbabble rap
