Its funny how money change a situation  
Miscommunication leads to complication  
My emancipation dont fit your equation  
I was on the humble you on every station  
Some wan play young lauryn like she dumb  
But remember not a game new under the sun  
Everything you did has already been done  
I know all the tricks from bricks to kingston  
My ting done made your kingdom wan run  
Now understand lboogies nonviolent  
But if a thing test me run for mi gun  
Cant take a threat to mi new born son  
Ls been this way since creation  
A groupie call you fall from temptation  
Now you want to ball over separation  
Tarnish my image in your conversation  
Who you gon scrimmage like you the champion  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
Now now how come your talk turn cold  
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul  
Tryin to grab hold of what you cant control  
Now you all floss what a sight to behold  
Wisdom is better than silver and gold  
I was hopeless now Im more hopeful  
Every man want to act like hes exempt  
Need to get down on his knees and repent  
Cant slick talk on the day of judgment  
Your movements similar to a serpent  
Tried to play straight how your whole style bent  
Consequence is no coincidence  
Hypocrites always want to play innocent  
Always want to take it to the full out extent  
Always want to make it seem like good intent  
Never want to face it when it time for punishment  
I know you dont want to hear my opinion  
But there come many paths and you must choose one  
And if you dont change then the rain soon come  
See you might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some but you really lost one  
You just lost one its so silly how come  
When its all done did you really gain from  
What you done done its so silly how come  
You just lost one  
  
Now dont you understand man universal law  
What you throw out comes back to you star  
Never underestimate those who you scar  
Cause karma karma karma comes back to you hard  
You cant hold gods people back that long  
The chain of shatan wasnt made that strong  
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond  
But until you do right all you do will go wrong  
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song  
And some dont know what they have til its gone  
Now even when youre gone you can still be reborn  
And from the night can arrive the sweet dawn  
Now some might listen and some might shun  
And some may think that theyve reached perfection  
If you look closely youll see what youve become  
Cause you might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some but you really lost one  
You just lost one its so silly how come  
When its all done did you really gain from  
What you done done its so silly how come  
  
You might win some but you really lost one  
You just lost one its so silly how come  
When its all done did you really gain from  
What you done done its so silly how come  
  
You just lost one  
What a bumbum
