Whoa  
Im definitely sure  
That Im not sure  
Whoa  
  
Sittin on the corner of nowhere road  
Just between I wish I could  
And I dont know  
Rain is splashing up between  
Her toes  
She doesnt know her own area code  
Shes the picture  
Of a heart of gold  
On the edge of depression I note  
And a picture  
Of the wrong high road  
Now its too late for  
A fight or foe  
  
Now shes lookin at me to know  
The faucets runnin  
And my car got towed  
  
Im sure about it  
Im definitely sure  
That I do surely doubt it  
I wish that I could say  
That I was sure about it  
Im definitely sure  
That Im not sure  
Whoa  
  
Did you see the man  
With the cocaine load  
Its on sale for the price of your soul  
And a man with a long trench coat  
Wish I could hide in a big black hole  
Sell you all your pain 10fold  
And youre calling  
Out a long wrong road  
Fitted for the box they mold  
All youre missing is  
A heart they stole  
Theyre lookin at me to know  
My heart is pumpin  
And my feet got cold  
  
Im sure about it  
Im definitely sure  
That I do surely doubt it  
I wish that I could say  
That I was sure about it  
Im definitely sure  
That Im not sure  
Yeah

Oh huh  
  
Sittin on the corner of nowhere road  
Just between I wish I could  
And I dont know  
Theres a man with a long trench coat  
Wish I could hide in a big black hole  
  
Theyre lookin at me to know  
My heart is pumpin  
And my feet got cold

Im definitely sure  
That I do surely doubt it  
I wish that I could say
