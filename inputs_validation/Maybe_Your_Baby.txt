Im feelin down and some kind of lonely  
Cause my baby done left me here  
Hearts blazing like a five alarm fire  
And I dont even give a care  
  
I feel like the world is turnin on me  
My dreams turnin to ashes right in front of my face  
And Im gettin kind of worried  
And I feel so out of place  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans  
  
Background   I feel like cryin yeh yeh  
Maybe baby baby baby baby baby  
  
In the mornin when Ive got heartache  
I cant call up the doctor for help  
Cause the only person that could ever do me any good  
Is steppin out with my best friend  
  
I feel like Im slippin deeper  
Slippin deeper into myself  
And I cant take it  
This stuff is scarin me to death  
  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans  
Kinda makin me worried  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans  
  
Little Sally Walker sittin in a saucer  
Checkin out the guys that are passing by  
  
Backgroundby by by by  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans  
  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans  
Not includin future plans  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans  
Maybe my baby done made some other plans  
Maybe my baby done made another plan  
With another man Your baby your baby stupid baby your baby  
That you put so trust so much trust in your baby  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
