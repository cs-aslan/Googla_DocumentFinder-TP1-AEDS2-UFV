The girl who cried Love wont you come and play with me  
You can be Cassandra underneath the sword of Damocles  
Well tear this baby apart wise like Salomon  
  
Chorus  
Run come shatter me now shatter me with hope  
Crawl come breathe me in bleed out all sorrows  
Scream me a dream untouched by shadows  
Baby shatter me now shatter me now  
Shatter me with hope  
  
Shell be the witness to the repose of Evelyn  
Push the needles into the of canticles of ecstasy  
Turn to page forty three  
And youll know how I feel  
  
Chorus  
  
Swear on your hearts grave Im wrong  
And run like your lifes depending on it  
Cause it is  
  
Well tear this baby apart wise like Solomon  
Turn to page forty three and youll know how I feel  
  
Chorus  
  
Shatter me now shatter me now shatter me now  
Oh you oh  
Shatter me now shatter me now shatter me now  
Oh you oh  
Scream me a dream  
Shatter me now shatter me now shatter me now  
Scream me a dream  
Shatter me now shatter me now shatter me now
