You think that I dont feel love  
But what I feel for you is real love  
In others eyes I see reflected  
A hurt scorned rejected  
  
Love child never meant to be  
Love child born in poverty  
Love child never meant to be  
Love child take a look at me  
  
I started my life in an old cold run down tenement slum  
My father left he never even married mom  
I shared the guilt my mama knew  
So afraid that others knew I had no name  
  
This love were contemplating  
Is worth the pain of waiting  
Well only end up hating  
The child we maybe creating  
  
Love child never meant to be  
Love child scorned by society  
Love child always second best  
Love child different from the rest  
  
Mm baby hold on hold on just a little bit  
Mm baby hold on hold on just a little bit  
I started school in a worn torn dress that somebody threw out  
I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt  
To be without the simple things  
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me  
  
Dont think that I dont need you  
Dont think I dont want to please you  
No child of mine ll be bearing  
The name of shame Ive been wearing  
  
Love child love child never quite as good  
Afraid ashamed misunderstood  
  
But Ill always love you  
Ill always love you  
Ill always love you  
Ill always love you  
Ill always love you  
Ill always love you
