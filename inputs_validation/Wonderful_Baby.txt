Wonderful baby livin on love  
The sandman says maybe hell take you above  
Up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows  
Where babies float by just  
Counting their toes  
Wonderful baby nothin but new  
The world has gone crazy Im glad Im not you  
At the beginning or is it the end  
It goes in and comes out and starts over again  
Wonderful baby livin on love  
The sandman says maybe hell take you above  
Up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows  
Where babies float by just  
Counting their toes  
Wonderful baby Ill watch while you grow  
If I knew the future youd be first to know  
But I dont know nothin of what  
Lifes about  
Just as long as you live youll never find out  
Wonderful baby nothin to fear  
Love whom you will but doubt what you hear  
Theyll whisper sweet things to make untrue  
So be good to yourself thats all  
You can do  
Wonderful baby livin on love the sandman says maybe hell  
Take you above  
Up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows  
Where babies float by just counting their toes  
Where babies float by just counting their toes  
Oh
