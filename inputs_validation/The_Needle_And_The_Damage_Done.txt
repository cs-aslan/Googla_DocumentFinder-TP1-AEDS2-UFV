Caught you knocking at my cellar door  
Love you baby can I have some more  
Oh The damage done  
I hit the city and I lost my band  
Watched the needle take another man  
Gone gone the damage done  
Ow Oh my my my  
Sing the song because I love the man  
Know that some of you dont understand  
Milk blood to keep from running out  
Ow Oh my my my  
Ive seen the needle and the damage done  
Oh a little part of us in everyone  
Ive seen the needle and the damage done  
A little part little part little part  
Ive seen the needle  
Oh I  
Ive seen the needle  
Seen the needle and the damage done  
A little part of us in everyone  
Every junkies like a setting sun
