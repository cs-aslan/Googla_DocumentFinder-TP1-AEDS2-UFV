Verse 1  
Yo yo forget the club  
Today we play in the block  
Its going down and its blazing hot  
Jeff pop the new CD turn tables joints  
You just got to get the amps from Boogie  
Get the van from Rock and then  
Call up Ishcabibbles Jims and Pats  
And tell em we need cheese steaks for like 300 cats  
And yo make sure its hot or else Im sending em back  
And get my mic right  
If I get hyped I might rap  
Then take the speakers find a good spot  
Subs on the bottom tweeters up top  
Yo you know where little John lives on the corner  
The extension cordll run perfectly to his crib  
And then tell Officer Mike to barricade the block  
Regardless what car you got leave it up top  
You want to come you got to come on your feet  
Aint nothing like having a party  
When its out in the street come on  
  
Chorus TraKnox  
Nine oclock Ima call my crew  
And ten oclock we gonna roll on through  
I dont know what you goin do  
But whatever you do hit the block party tonight  
  
All the ladies rolling up with friends  
And dont be late or you wont get in  
Our partys packed from beginning to end  
Everybody tell a friend that the block partys tonight  
  
Verse 2  
Its aint nothing like  
Having a party on the block  
When everybody know everybody on the block  
And everybody on the block  
Come to the party on the block  
And when the sun drop we dont stop  
Funny how fast they travel the word  
A dozen divas from North Philly drove in when they heard  
That its a block party down in West Philly  
Come block party with Jeff and Big Willy  
Stand back everybody come to see the man rap  
Jeff got it jam packed  
Everybody hands in the air  
Just get your hands in the air  
Yo Philly thats where the partys at  
DC why yall thats where the partys at  
ATL thats where the partys at  
West side thats where the partys at  
Midwest why yall thats where the partys at  
Dirty South now thats where the partys at  
Yo I cant hear why yall thats where the partys at  
Where ever we at thats where the partys at  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
Yo yo and when the sun drop  
Back in Philly that dont mean that the fun stop  
All it mean is that its time to turn the lights on  
All day long I been plotting on this nice john  
Its ten oclock now Jeff is trying to hype me  
Will the Fresh Prince come up to the mic please  
Hear the crowd cheer brought a little smile out  
Mic check one two Im bout to wild out  
I know hes old but  
Maybe its a slight chance  
I could get my brother hype  
Make him break dance ha maybe not  
Lemme get the crowd jumping  
Let me him em with the brand new funk or something  
Im like Rob Base I want to rock right now  
why yall know who run the block right now  
All we need is a mic and a beat  
And a couple of speakers  
And some turn tables out in the street come on  
  
Chorus
