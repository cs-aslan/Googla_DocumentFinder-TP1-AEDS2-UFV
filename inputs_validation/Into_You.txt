For a minute shes stuck spinning in it  
Still its better to lose hope than dying in it  
Off track impact slam  
Shes lying in it  
  
Now she leads the way to the lost cost exhibit  
You got to break through the walls that try to hold you  
Fool you so that fear will always mold you  
Push through  
  
Find that the walls are beneath you  
And the end of the line is a brand new avenue  
You said nothing in this world could ever  
Make you feel better than I do hey hey  
You said no one in this world could ever  
  
Take away all this from you  
So hold on just a little longer  
When you dont feel that you belong  
All I want is a chance to fall into you  
What a sin its to find fulfillment  
If its better to crash land than flying in it  
  
Violins silence anger violence  
Says to herself Im going out of my mind  
  
Chorus  
  
Break yourself from old ties that hold you down  
You inspire me You inspire me  
I dont mind wasting time with you  
  
Chorus
