Gabe  
Theres a world  
Theres a world I know  
A place we can go  
Where the pain will go away  
Theres a world  
Where the sun shines  
Each day  
  
Theres a world  
Theres a world out there  
Ill show you just where  
And in time I know youll see  
Theres a world where  
We can be free  
Come with me  
Come with me  
Theres a world where  
We can be free  
Come with me
