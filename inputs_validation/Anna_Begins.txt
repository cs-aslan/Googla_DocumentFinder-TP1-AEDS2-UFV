My friend assures me its all or nothing  
I am not worried I am not overly concerned  
My friend implores me For one time only make an exception  
I am not not worried  
Wrap her up in a package of lies send her off to a coconut island  
I am not worried I am not overly concerned  
With the status of my emotions Oh She says Youre changing  
  
But were always changing  
It does not bother me to say this isnt love  
Because if you dont want to talk about it then it isnt love  
And I guess Im going to have to live with that  
But Im sure theres something in a shade of grey or something in between  
And I can always change my name if thats what you mean  
  
My friend assures me Its all or nothing  
But I am not really worried I am not overly concerned  
You try to tell yourself the things you tell yourself to make yourself forget  
I am not worried  
If its love she said then were gonna have to think about the  
consequences  
She cant stop shaking and I cant stop touching her and  
  
This time when kindness falls like rain  
It washes her away and Anna begins to change her mind  
These seconds when Im shaking leave me shuddering for days she says  
And Im not ready for this sort of thing  
  
But Im not gonna break and Im not going to worry about it anymore  
Im not gonna bend and Im not gonna break  
Im not gonna worry about it anymore  
It seems like I should say as long as this is love  
But its not all that easy so maybe I should just  
Snap her up in a butter fly net and just pin her down on a photograph album  
I am not worried Ive done this sort of thing before  
But then I start to think about the consequences  
Because I dont get no sleep in a quiet room and  
  
The time when kindness falls like rain  
It washes me away and Anna begins to change my mind  
And every time she sneezes I believe its its love and  
Oh lord Im not ready for this sort of thing  
  
Shes talking in her sleep  
Its keeping me awake and Anna begins to toss and turn  
And every word is nonsense but I understand and  
Oh lord Im not ready for this sort of thing  
  
Her kindness bangs a gong  
Its moving me along and Anna begins to fade away  
Its chasing me away  
She disappears and  
Oh lord Im not ready for this sort of thing
