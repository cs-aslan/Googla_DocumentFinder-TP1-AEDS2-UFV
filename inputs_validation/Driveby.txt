Its a random kind of thing  
Came upon a delicate flower  
I cant believe  
A machine gun sings  
Driveby driveby  
Driveby driveby  
  
Well he borrowed  
His girlfiends car  
Went out riding with the boys  
Now shes gone  
Like a shooting star  
Driveby driveby  
Driveby driveby  
  
Now shes gone  
Like a shooting star  
Trail of dreams  
Tragic trail of fire  
Now shes gone  
Like a shooting star  
Driveby driveby  
Driveby driveby  
  
Well you feel invincible  
Its just a part of life  
Theres a feud going on  
And you dont know  
Driveby driveby  
Driveby driveby
