They love me like I was their brother  
They protect me listen to me  
They dug me my very own garden  
Gave me sunshine made me happy  
Nice dream nice dream  
Nice dream  
  
I call up my friend the good angel  
But shes out with her answerphone  
She says shed love to come help but  
The sea would electrocute us all  
Nice dream nice dream  
Nice dream nice dream  
  
Nice dream if you think that youre strong enough  
Nice dream if you think that you belong enough  
Nice dream if you think that youre strong enough  
Nice dream if you think that you belong enough  
  
Now come home now come home  
Now come home now come home  
  
Nice dream nice dream  
Nice dream nice dream
