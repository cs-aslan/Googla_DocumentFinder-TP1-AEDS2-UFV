I love you girl thats what you used to say  
And that no one would ever take it away  
I gave you all I had inside baby its alright  
But then you took the love right from my heart  
Its funny a thing so strong can fall apart  
I gave you all I had inside baby its alright ooh  
One day youll wear out the lines you always use  
Why do you say that youll change when you never do  
Ive always found a reason to let it slide baby not this time  
Ooh because I know where youre going from here Dont take me down with you  
  
Dont take me down take me down with you  
Cause I dont need no one and no ones ever gonna bring me down  
Dont take me down Dont take me down with you  
And I dont need no one and no ones ever gonna bring me down  
You had someone you had me to love  
  
Why do we put up all these fronts  
Theres something about the way that you loved me once  
And why why is it wrong to want it back again  
Oh no one day youll wear out the lines you always use  
Why do you say that you change when you never do  
Ive always found a reason to let it slide baby not this time  
Ooh because I know where youre going from here Dont take me down with you  
  
Dont take me down take me down with you  
Cause I dont need no one and no ones ever gonna bring me down  
Dont take me down Dont take me down with you  
And I dont need no one and no ones ever gonna bring me down  
You had someone you had me to love  
  
Too many times Ive realized the truth dont take me down dont take me  
down Too many times  
Ive seen enough Ive seen it enough to know  
This time youre not youre not gonna take me down  
Down down down down yeah  
  
Dont take me down take me down with you  
Cause I dont need no one and no ones ever gonna bring me down  
Dont take me down Dont take me down with you  
And I dont need no one and no ones ever gonna bring me down  
You had someone you had me to love
