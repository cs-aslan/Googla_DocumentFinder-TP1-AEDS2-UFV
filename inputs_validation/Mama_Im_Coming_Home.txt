Times have changed and times are strange  
Here I come but I aint the same  
Mama Im coming home  
Times gone by seems to be  
You could have been a better friend to me  
Mama Im coming home  
  
Took me in and you drove me out  
Yeah you had me hypnotized  
Lost and found and turned around  
By the fire in your eyes  
  
You made me cry you told me lies  
But I cant stand to say goodbye  
Mama Im coming home  
I could be right I could be wrong  
Hurts so bad its been so long  
Mama Im coming home  
  
Selfish love yeah were both alone  
The ride before a fall  
But Im gonna take this heart of stone  
I just got to have it all  
  
Ive seen your face a hundred times  
Everyday weve been apart  
I dont care about the sunshine yeah  
  
Cause mama mama Im coming home  
Im coming home  
  
You took me in and you drove me out  
Yeah you had me hypnotized  
Lost and found and turned around  
By the fire in your eyes  
  
Ive seen your face a thousand times  
Every day weve been apart  
And I dont care about the sunshine yeah  
  
Cause mama mama Im coming home  
Im coming home  
Im coming home  
Im coming home
