Another time you were the one in my life  
And this world of mine just turned around you  
Another time you were the love of my life  
That was so long ago now youre here  
And those feelings are starting to reappear  
Another time I wouldve run to you  
I finally learned that I could love somebody new  
And now Im finally over you  
But dont look at me that way  
Coz Im trying to be strong  
And Im begging you baby  
Dont you look at me that way  
Coz if you look at me now  
It just might be more that I can take  
Got someone somebody new in my life  
Ive got someone who cares about me  
And what we had is only what used to be  
Im happy now happy with someone else  
But when youre close  
I know the flame has never died  
And now its burning me alive  
So dont look at me that way  
Coz Im trying to be strong  
And Im begging you baby  
Dont you look at me that way  
Coz if you look at me now  
It just might be more that I can take  
I finally learned that I could love somebody new  
And now Im finally over you
