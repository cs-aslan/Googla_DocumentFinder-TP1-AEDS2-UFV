Lately I just dont Everything  
But some secrets I meant to keep  
So rest and sure that I aint listening  
I keep my head down so I cant see anything  
What I dont know cant hurt  
  
Chorus  
Cause you are my escape from everything  
In this place be my holiday  
Love it and  
You are my escape  
You are my escape  
 Just like the movie  
  
Some say that ignorance is best  
Well I am the one to disagree  
If there aint love  
Lately I just dont Everything  
But some secrets I meant to keep  
So rest and sure that I aint listening  
Close the door and keep on continuing  
But I what I dont know cant hurt  
  
Cause you are my escape from everything  
 Everything  
I am in this place Love it  
You are my escape oh nu  
You are my escape  
Lets keep it just like the movie  
  
You are like a good book I get lost in  
The perfect place to run and hide away  
Dont wanna pressure you to the next chapter  
Cause I dont know how it ends  
  
Chorus  
Cause you are my escape from everything  
In this place be my holiday  
Love it and  
You are my escape  
You are my escape  
Lets keep it just like the movie
