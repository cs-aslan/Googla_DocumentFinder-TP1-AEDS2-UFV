It aint nuthin Gee its just a small thing 4X  
  
Hey I got a flow that is wicked so sit back while I kick it  
The incredible edible change my pitch while I rip it  
We can make it just happen while Im keepin you snappin  
Now the style is correct so Ima keep gangsta rappin  
Cause Im back and Im flowin Ima keep people knowin  
that Im just like the Energizer Still going  
So get that and make that somethin you think is real fat  
Its a small thing Im back on the Delta Force track  
As the figure get bigger as the soul brother nigga  
I dont plan to waste time black I just pull the trigger  
Now my mic is just smokin like the are Im not jokin  
Fuck around step to me troop your big toes is broken  
Now I be the headbanger releasin more anger  
Cause my fury is deep so dont challengers scatter  
When Im  the head I make beats that just flip  
So I write up a rhyme next then flex  
Back at the ranch with the 4H Horsemen  
The flavor is steady move your head to the bass  
So check the rhymes and check my stats  
And now you know that Ced Gee is back  
Im still the Delta
