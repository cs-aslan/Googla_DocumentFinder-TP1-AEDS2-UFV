Yo I dont appreciate you telling me  
The way that I should live  
No I think the choices youve laid out for me  
The end is negative  
So take all your imagery and ideology  
Yes Ill be fine  
When you go Id rather not display my physical  
Id rather use my mind oh  
You act like all I am to be is just a sexy sexy thing  
Just a showpiece for all to see like a Bently or your diamond ring  
I know that I am more than that dont believe the hype  
The One who made the stars and sun gave meaning to my life  
Oh I dont need you to define my beEAyouTwhy  
Id rather draw the line  
Oh I dont need you on my team what youre sellings a pipe dream  
And I dont need it baby  
Hey it seems a shame to me Ive been reduced  
To an object of lust and hate  
No way please understand that I refuse to be  
Simply a height and weight  
This day somewhere weve lost the value  
Of what a woman is supposed to be  
A queen respected and defined by her creator  
Size 24 size 10 or size 3  
You act like all I am to be is just a sexy sexy thing  
Just a showpiece for all to see like a Bently or your diamond ring  
I know that I am more than that dont believe the hype  
The One who made the stars and sun gave meaning to my life  
Oh I dont need you to define my beEAyouTwhy  
Id rather draw the line  
Oh I dont need you on my team what youre sellings a pipe dream  
And I dont need it baby  
Its my choice and I will decide I wont let you destroy my pride  
Im no showpiece for you to hide and lose all that I am inside  
God made me and Im beautiful I wont dress like that kind of girl  
AreESPEseeT see thats the way that you got to look at me  
Its my choice and I will decide I wont let you destroy my pride  
Im no showpiece for you to hide and lose all that I am inside  
God made me and Im beautiful I wont dress like that kind of girl  
AreESPEseeT see thats the way that you got to look at me  
Oh I dont need you to define my beEAyouTwhy  
Id rather draw the line  
Oh I dont need you on my team what youre sellings a pipe dream  
And I dont need it baby
