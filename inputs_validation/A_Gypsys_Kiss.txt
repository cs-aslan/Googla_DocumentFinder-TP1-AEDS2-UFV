John San what you can  
La la Janette dance in sand  
Whats the mystery my son  
Gypsy Dan Caravan  
Won Tun Wan with your Chinese fan  
Its part of history my son  
  
Murder and rape with your power  
The 10th revolution in far away days  
Its come to this  
A gypsys kiss  
All your powers gonna fade in the haze  
  
Ya who Jumme gae bile ya heed  
The Senorita said  
Ill drag your lungs out through your nose  
Space truckers free and high  
Teamsters get you by and by  
That should keep you on your toes  
  
They got a gun at your head  
But you aint necessarily playing their game  
They cant resist  
A Gypsys Kiss  
All thats needed to drive them insane  
  
John Wayne the Alamo  
Crazy Horse Geronimo  
Ill smoke a piece with you  
Mind body heart and soul  
We got rock and roll  
And theres nothing they can do  
  
Hear the small voice of truth  
Above the shouting despair of the crowd  
What do you wish  
A Gypsys Kiss  
Gets you strong for crying out loud
