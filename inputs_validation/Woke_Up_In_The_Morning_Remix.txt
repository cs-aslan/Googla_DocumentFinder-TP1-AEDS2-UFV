Chorus Carl Thomas  
Woke up in the morning you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow weeping willow  
Whyd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that youd be gone  
You should of known one day that Id be gone  
You should of known one day that wed be  
Verse One by Carl Thomas  
Why did you have to be this way  
Baby all you had to say  
Is that you were sick and tired of the man I began to be  
But you planned a great escape  
Bright and early before I wake  
We both knew we had to break  
You could of chose a better way  
  
Chorus Carl Thomas  
Woke up in the morning you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow weeping willow  
Whyd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that youd be gone  
You should of known one day that Id be gone  
You should of known one day that wed be  
  
Verse Two Carl Thomas  
It was cold the way you left  
Still the pain is in my chest  
Because in my heart I felt you should of came and talked to me  
If you put away your pride  
And look deep into my eyes  
It would of been to your surprise  
That I got up to apologize  
But you were gone  
  
Chorus Carl Thomas 2x  
Woke up in the morning you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow weeping willow  
Whyd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that youd be gone  
You should of known one day that Id be gone  
You should of known one day that wed be  
  
Break Carl Thomas  
Oh I thought we had forever now its gone  
Its time to carry on  
I thought that you made me happy  
But its this thing thats come between us girl  
At one time you were my world  
Now it seems its gone away gone away  
  
The Notorious BIG  Rap Verse  
Uhh I dreams filthy  
My moms and pops mixed in with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey  
Huh what a set up  
Shoulda pushed em dead off wipe the sweat off  
Uhh cause in this world Im dead off squeeze lead off  
Benz sped off aint no shook hands in Brookland  
Army fatigue break up teams the enemies  
Look man you wanna see me locked up shot up  
Moms crotched up over the casket screamin Bastard  
Cryin know my friends is lying  
Yall know who killed em filled em with the lugars from they Rugers  
Or they Desert dyin aint the shit but its pleasant  
Kinda quiet watch my niggaz bring the riot  
Giving cats the opposite of diets  
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie lazy eye  
I was high when they hit me took a few cats with me  
Shit I need the company uhhuh  
Apologies in order to TYanna my daughter  
If it was up to me you would be with me sorta like  
Daddy Dearest my vision be the clearest  
Silencers so you cant hear it  
Competition still fear it shit dont ask me  
I went from ashy to nasty to classy and still
