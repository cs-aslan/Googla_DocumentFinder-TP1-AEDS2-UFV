A funny thing to do  
Is everyone like you  
cause people seldom change  
They all just stay the same  
  
A funny thing to say  
Suppose youre just that way  
Although youre sure youre sure  
There really is no cure  
  
A funny kind of way  
A funny kind of day  
Youre funny all the time  
Do you want a piece of mine  
cause Ive seen it all before  
When youre closing all the doors  
  
Its not funny anymore  
A funny thing to do  
Because the sky was blue  
You ran away for good  
cause no one understood  
  
The funny things you said  
Because the sky was red  
It all went to your head  
Because the sky was red  
  
A funny kind of way  
A funny kind of day  
Youre funny all the time  
Do you want a piece of mine  
cause Ive seen it all before  
When youre closing all the doors  
Its not funny anymore  
  
A funny thing to do  
Is everyone like you  
cause people seldom change  
They all just stay the same
