Verse 1  
Im a 45 spinning on an old Victrola  
Im a two strike swinger Im a Pepsi Cola  
Im a blue jean quarterback saying I love you to the prom queen  
In a Chevy  
Im John Wayne Superman California  
Im a Kris Kristofferson Sunday morning  
Im a mom and daddy singing along to Don McLean  
At the levee  
  
Chorus  
And Im a child of a backseat freedom baptized by rock and roll  
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden never grow up never grow old  
Just another rebel in the great wide open on the boulevard of broken dreams  
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar John Deere John
316  
  
PostChorus  
Hey hey  
Everything I needed  
Thats right  
  
Verse 2  
Im Mark Twain on the Mississippi  
Im Hemingway with a shot of whiskey  
Im a TV dinner on a tray trying to figure out the Wheel of Fortune  
Im a Texaco star Im a Gibson guitar  
Im still a teenage kid trying to go too far  
Im a jukebox waiting in a neon bar for a quarter  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
I spent a lot of years running from believing looking for another way to save
my soul  
The longer I live the more I see it theres only one way home  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Outro

Everything I needed  
John Cougar John Deere John 316  
Everything I needed  
John Cougar John Deere John 316
