High we get so high  
But we fall down  
Its no surprise  
Its here we go fighting  
There you go again  
  
Light on your own  
Let this love  
Turn to stone  
There we go fighting  
There you go again  
Here we go again  
  
So let me go let me go  
I dont know how we grow  
Something incredible  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You shot me in the heart this time  
I hope you know hope you know  
You let it go  
Lost it all something incredible  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You shot me in the heart this time  
  
Dont call me home  
You only gave what youve stole  
There I go hurting  
There I go again  
Here we go again  
  
So let me go let me go  
I dont know how we grow  
Something incredible  
Oh ohoh oh oh oh oh  
You shot me in the heart this time  
I hope you know hope you know  
You let it go  
Lost it all something incredible  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You shot me in the heart this time  
  
Only try to make you  
Only try to make you mine  
Only try to make you  
Only try to make you mine  
  
So let me go let me go  
I dont know how we grow  
Something incredible  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You shot me in the heart this time  
I hope you know hope you know  
You let it go  
Lost it all something incredible  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You shot me in the heart this time  
Shot me in the heart this time  
Shot me in the heart this time
