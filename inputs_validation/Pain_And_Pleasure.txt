I wanna tell ya hey I think you oughta know  
The way youre treating me I feel Ill have ta go  
Ive heard the rumors and it seems theyre comin true  
You do what suits ya but then thats nothin new  
  
Do what you wanna do  
Oh what you put me through  
How I suffer for your love  
Say what you wanna say  
You know that youre gonna pay  
For all the times that Ive cried  
  
You give me pain but you bring me pleasure  
Get out of my life  
You bring me pain but you give me pleasure  
Dont know what I like  
  
Youve got me tied up dog upon a leash  
Instead of messin round practice what you preach  
Your days are numbered my days arrived  
The way I see it were dead or were alive  
  
You give me pain but you bring me pleasure  
Get out of my life  
You bring me pain but you give me pleasure  
Dont know what I like
