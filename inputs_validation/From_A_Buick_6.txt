I got this graveyard woman you know she keeps my kids  
But my soulful mama you know she keeps me hid  
Shes a junkyard angel and she always gives me the bread  
Well if I go down dyin you know shes bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well when the pipeline gets broken and Im lost on the river bridge  
Im all cracked up on the highway and in the waters edge  
And then she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with a thread  
Well if I go down dyin you know shes bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well she dont make me nervous she dont talk too much  
She walks like Bo Diddley and she dont need no crutch  
She keeps this fourten all loaded with lead  
Well if I go down dyin you know shes bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well you know I need a steam shovel mama to keep away the dead  
I need a dump truck baby to unload my head  
She brings me everything and more and just like I said  
Well if I go down dyin you know shes bound to put a blanket on my bed
