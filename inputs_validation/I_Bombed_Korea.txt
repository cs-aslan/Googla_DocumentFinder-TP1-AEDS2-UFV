I bombed Korea every night  
My engine sang into the salty sky  
I didnt know if I would live or die  
I bombed Korea every night  
I bombed Korea every night  
I bombed Korea every night  
Red flowers bursting down below us  
Those people didnt even know us  
We didnt know if we would live or die  
We didnt know if it was wrong or right  
I bombed Korea every night  
And so I sit here at this bar  
Im not a hero  
Im not a movie star  
Ive got my beer  
Ive got my stories to tell  
But they wont tell you what its like in hell  
Red flowers bursting down below us  
Those people didnt even know us  
We didnt know if we would live or die  
We didnt know if it was wrong or right  
We didnt know if we would live or die  
I bombed Korea every night
