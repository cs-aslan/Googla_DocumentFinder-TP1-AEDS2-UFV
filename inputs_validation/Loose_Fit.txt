Has to be a loose fit  
Has to be a loose fit  
  
Go on move in it go on do your bit  
Small big take your pick  
Doesnt have to be legit  
  
It s gotta be a loose fit  
It s gotta be a loose fit  
  
Dont need no skin tights in my wardrobe today  
Fold them all up and put them all away  
Wont be no misfit in my household today  
Pick them all out and send them on their way  
Do what youre doing say what youre saying  
Go where youre going think what youre thinking  
Sounds good to me  
  
Dont know what you saw but you know its against the law  
And you know that you want some more  
Ive heard it all before  
Gonna buy an airforce base  
Gonna wipe out your race  
Get stoned in a different place  
Dont you know I got better taste  
Do what youre doing say what youre saying  
Go where youre going think what youre thinking  
It sound good to me  
  
Do what youre doing spend what youre owing  
Pay what youre paying look where youre going  
Say what youre thinking kill who youre killing  
Sing if youre singing speak if youre speaking  
Sounds good to me
