Youre not hearing the answers youve been praying for  
You try and try cant find an open door  
Youre not seeing the miracles not a one in sight  
And the way you feel you sure need one tonight  
Your faith is crumbling your feet are stumbling  
Its so hard to believe in Him  
But He believes in you when youre at your weakest  
And hopes still burning through the night but you cant see it  
You know in your heart He loves you  
But in those moments when you cant believe its true  
He believes in you  
Chin deep in the water you tried walking on  
And you reach for Him and you think Hes gone  
Hes still there beside you with His stubborn love  
No He never left and He wont give up  
He will protect you until youre rescued  
Oh theres nothing that He cant do  
Cause He believes in you when youre at your weakest  
And hopes still burning through the night but you cant see it  
You know in your heart He loves you  
But in those moments when you cant believe its true  
He believes in you  
You know in your heart He loves you  
But at those moments when you cant believe its true  
He believes in you  
He believes in you He believes in you  
He believes He believes He believes in you  
He believes He believes He believes in you  
He believes He believes He believes in you  
He believes He believes He believes in you  
He believes He believes He believes in you  
He believes He believes He believes in you  
He believes He believes He believes in you  
He believes He believes He believes in you  
He believes He believes He believes in you  
He believes He believes He believes in you
