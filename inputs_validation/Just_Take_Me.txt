I am just a poor man got nowhere to go  
All my leaves have fallen left me all alone  
If I was a rich man if I was a king  
I would give you all I have give you everything  
  
If youd just take me  
Just take me now  
If youd just take me  
  
Never seen my daddy died when I was two  
Mama did the best she could taught me all she knew  
Said that love was everything tears came to her eyes  
Never knew the meaning now I realize  
  
Chorus  
Love is all you need  
All you need now  
If you just take me  
  
Im trying hard to get you Im not the only one  
Never had a big car but Im not on the run  
If love has got a meaning see it in my eyes  
If you see the beginning then youd realize  
  
Chorus  
Love is all you need  
All you need now  
If you just take me  
  
Just take me  
Just take me now  
Wont you just take me
