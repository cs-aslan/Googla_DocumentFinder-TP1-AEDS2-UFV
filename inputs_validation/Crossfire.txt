Julies sick and tired of her job nall the reasons lately  
She took it out on God and laid her soul to hell and let the baby die  
Julies child was born without a need or a reason for being  
She took it as a message from a real and a distant life  
  
Shirley gets to help her with the child though  
shes strung out on crack time  
Shirley never knew what it was to be held in real love  
Together getting high to get to mess up their night  
Anything to get up so theyre losing their mind  
Just to get high breaking out from this life gotta get them a drug to get  
higher  
  
Julie gets to walking out and drags the child says
