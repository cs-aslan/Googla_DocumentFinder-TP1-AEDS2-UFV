Hey old friend lets look back  
On the crazy clothes we wore  
Aint it fun to look back  
And to see its all been done before  
  
All those nights together  
Are a special memory  
And I cant wait for tomorrow  
Just as long as youre dancing next to me  
  
Cause its so clear every year we get stronger  
Whats gone is gone the past is the past  
Turn the radio up and then hit the gas cause  
  
I know weve come so far  
But weve got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it wont be long till its time to go  
  
So most days well take it fast  
And some nights well take it slow  
I know weve come so far  
But baby baby weve got so far to go  
  
Hey old friend together  
Side by side and year by year  
The road was filled with twists and turns  
Oh but thats the road that got us here  
  
Lets move past the bad times  
But before those memories fade  
Lets forgive but not forget  
And learn from the mistakes we made  
  
Cause its so clear every year we get stronger  
So dont give up and dont say when  
And just get back on the road again cause  
  
I know weve come so far  
But weve got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it wont be long till its time to go  
  
So most days well take it fast  
And some nights well take it slow  
I know weve come so far  
But baby baby weve got so far to go  
  
Hey old friend come along for this ride  
Theres plenty of room so jump inside  
The highways rocky every now and then  
But its so much better then where Ive been  
  
Just keep movin at your own speed  
Your heart is all the compass youll ever need  
Lets keep cruisin the road were on  
Cause the rear view mirror only shows whats gone gone gone  
We got so far to go  
  
Oh its so clear every year we get stronger  
So shine that light take my hand  
Lets dance into the promise land cause  
  
I know weve come so far  
But weve got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it wont be long till its time to go  
  
So most days well take it fast  
And some nights well take it slow  
I know weve come so far  
But baby baby weve got so far to go  
But baby baby weve got so far to go  
  
Baby baby ooh  
Baby baby weve got so far to go  
Baby baby ooh  
Baby baby weve got so far to go
