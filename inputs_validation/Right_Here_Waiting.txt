Oceans apart day after day  
And I slowly go insane  
I hear your voice on the line  
But it doesnt stop the pain  
  
If I see you next to never  
How can we say forever  
  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
I will be right here waiting for you  
Whatever it takes  
Or how my heart breaks  
I will be right here waiting for you  
  
I took for granted all the times  
That I thought would last somehow  
I hear the laughter I taste the tears  
But I cant get near you now  
  
Oh cant you see it baby  
Youve got me going crazy  
  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
I will be right here waiting for you  
Whatever it takes  
Or how my heart breaks  
I will be right here waiting for you  
  
I wonder how we can survive  
This romance  
But in the end if Im with you  
Ill take the chance  
  
Oh cant you see it baby  
Youve got me going crazy  
  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
I will be right here waiting for you  
Whatever it takes  
Or how my heart breaks  
I will be right here waiting for you  
Waiting for you
