Turn down the lights  
Turn down the bed  
Turn down these voices inside my head  
Lay down with me  
Tell me no lies  
Just hold me close dont patronize  
Dont patronize me  
  
Cause I cant make you love me if you dont  
You cant make your heart feel something that it wont  
Here in the dark in these final hours  
I will lay down my heart and Ill feel the power  
But you wont no you wont  
Cause I cant make you love me if you dont  
  
Ill close my eyes then I wont see  
The love you dont feel when youre holding me  
Morning will come and Ill do whats right  
Just give me till then to give up this fight  
And I will give up this fight  
  
Cause I cant make you love me if you dont  
You cant make your heart feel something it wont  
Here in the dark in these final hours  
I will lay down my heart and Ill feel the power  
But you wont no you wont  
Cause I cant make you love me if you dont
