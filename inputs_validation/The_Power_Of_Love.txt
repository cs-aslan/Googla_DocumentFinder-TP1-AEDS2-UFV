The whispers in the morning  
Of lovers sleeping tight  
Are rolling by like thunder now  
As I look in your eyes  
  
  
I hold on to your body  
And feel each move you make  
Your voice is warm and tender  
A love that I could not forsake  
  
  
Cause you are my lady  
And I am your man  
Whenever you reach for me  
Ill do all that I can  
  
  
Lost is how Im feeling  
Lying in your arms  
When the world outsides too much to take  
That all ends when Im with you  
  
  
Even though there may be times  
It seems Im far away  
Never wonder where I am  
Cause I am always by your side  
  
  
Cause you are my lady  
And I am your man  
Whenever you reach for me  
Ill do all that I can  
  
  
Were heading for something  
Somewhere Ive never been  
Sometimes I am frightened  
But Im ready to learn  
Bout the power of love  
  
  
The sound of your heart beating  
Made it clear suddenly  
The feeling that I cant go on  
Is light years away  
  
  
Cause you are my lady  
And I am your man  
Whenever you reach for me  
Ill do all that I can  
  
  
Were heading for something  
Somewhere Ive never been  
Sometimes I am frightened  
But Im ready to learn  
Bout the power of love
