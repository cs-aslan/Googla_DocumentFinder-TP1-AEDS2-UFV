Knuckle down  
Love his skin  
It doesnt matter what colour skin hes locked in  
Knuckle down  
Knuckle down and love that skin  
  
Knuckle down  
Love his race  
It doesnt matter if you win or lose a little face  
Knuckle down and love that race  
  
One bright morning the world might end with a big bang  
And youll never get yourself another chance  
Put aside the hoodoo and some of the voodoo  
Bout people being different  
Theyre not so different  
  
Take them by the arm and run to the street  
Take a little drum to supply the beat  
Soon the whole world will be up on its feet and dancing  
  
For my sake  
Wont you put your knuckles down boys  
For my sake  
Wont you put you knuckles down  
  
Love her skin  
It doesnt matter what colour skin shes locked in  
Knuckle down  
Knuckle down and love that skin  
  
Knuckle down  
Love her race  
It doesnt matter if you win or lose a little face  
Knuckle down and love that race  
  
One bright morning you just might wake when the coin drops  
Even though you think that love is such a corny thing  
You can burst the bubble full up with trouble  
Says that people always got to be fighting  
not right  
  
Take them by the arm and run to the fields  
Blow on your horn until Jericho yields  
Soon the whole world will lay down swords and shield for singing  
  
For my sake  
Wont you put your knuckles down boys  
For my sake  
Wont you put you knuckles down
