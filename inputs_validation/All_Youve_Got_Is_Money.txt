I cant tell ya how to run your life  
To get along with one another  
Everybody knows whats wrong and whats right  
But you cant trust your own brother yeah  
  
Everybody wants to be your friend  
All the chicks they call you honey  
But dont trust them till the very end  
cause all theyre after is your money  
  
All they want is all your money  
All theyre after is your money  
 is your money  
All they want is  
All your money  
All they want is   
  
Dont it scare ya  
When they take such good care of ya  
And all youve got is money  
Before they fool ya  
Please let me school ya  
All youve got is money  
  
various screams
