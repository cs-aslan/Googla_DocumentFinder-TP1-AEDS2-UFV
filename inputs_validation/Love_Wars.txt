Love wars love wars  
Love wars love wars  
  
Absence makes the heart grow fonder  
But its taking me under  
Since youre not here  
  
Its better when its hard to get  
But this hide and go seek  
Well its making me weep  
  
I promise to stop boxing you round  
So dont scratch my face  
End of round eight  
  
We need to get our act together  
Take it off the street  
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor  
  
Love wars we dont need  
Love wars  
Love wars we dont need  
Love wars  
  
The talks we had dont change a thing  
They only bring rain  
On top of pain  
  
Flash back and uncover tracks  
From when you left  
With my best friend  
  
We need to get our act together  
Take it off the street  
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor  
  
Make love in peace  
And then never ever cheat  
Vow to be strong and let the band roll on  
  
Love wars we dont need  
Love wars  
Love wars we dont want  
Love wars  
  
Love bombs explodin in air  
Until the last one  
I really dont care  
  
I remember losing my head  
And calling you things  
Like dirty names  
  
We need to get our act together  
Take it off the street  
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor  
  
Make love in peace  
And then never ever cheat  
Vow to be strong and let the band roll on  
  
Love wars we dont need  
Love wars  
Love wars we dont want  
Love wars  
Love wars we cant start  
Love wars  
Love wars we dont need  
Love wars
