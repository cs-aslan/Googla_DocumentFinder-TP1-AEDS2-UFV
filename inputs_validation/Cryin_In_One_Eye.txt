I am cryin in one eye over you  
While the other searches for someone new  
If you do me wrong Ill be gone  
Cause my other eye would tell me to roam  
Cryin in one eye over you  
The other feels for the one thats blue  
If you love me like you say you do  
Ill turn my other eye on you  
  
My one eye is shy the other weepin  
Cause I cry for you in my sleepin  
Thats no fib as you will know  
My other eye will soon start to flow  
My love for you is very strong  
Its my fault if Im all alone  
To love you and leave you is so wrong  
Ill be cryin in both eyes from now on
