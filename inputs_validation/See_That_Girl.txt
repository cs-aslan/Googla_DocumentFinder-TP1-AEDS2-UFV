If you dont open your eyes then youre gonna get hurt  
cause she keeps telling you lies shes just a full time flirt  
Now I know I dont count no more  
But youre the one I still care for  
And you wont see me no more if you see that girl  
Now you may think shes fine when shes out with you  
But she only comes around when shes got nothing to do  
I dont want to interfere  
But that girl seems so insincere  
And I wont hang around here if you see that girl  
Do you believe the things that she said to you tonight  
Why cant you see the way she treats you isnt right  
Now I wont tell you again its up to you  
But youd better make up your mind what youre gonna do  
Dont you know I want you still  
Im so afraid I always will  
And Ill be loving you till you see that girl  
Ill keep on loving you till you see that girl  
Ill still be loving you till you see that girl  
See that girl  
See that girl
