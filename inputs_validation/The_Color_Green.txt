I recall when you once said Theres truth in both of us  
And all that lies ahead I take it your tongue  
It just got twisted or maybe it got tired  
Or maybe your memory waved goodbye  
When your socalled friends forget your name  
When your socalled friends they aint the same  
When your socalled friends theyve lost thier way  
And they aint what they was just the other day hey  
Shoulda listened to what my folks they had to say  
Just like a dog thats turned on you  
Aint it funny what the color green will make some people do  
How I couldnt see through your thin disguise  
Lord only knows and such a fool was I  
Happygolucky thats what I was and what I hope to be  
But I feel that Ive lost that side of me  
When your socalled friends forget your name  
When your socalled friends they aint the same  
When your socalled friends theyve lost thier way  
And they aint what they was just the other day hey  
Shoulda listened to what my folks they had to say  
Just like a dog thats turned on you  
Aint it funny what the color green will make some people do
