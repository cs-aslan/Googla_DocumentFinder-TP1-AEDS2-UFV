Its 605 on Sunday mornin  
And I was supposed tove left for Memphis late last night  
But I stopped at one of them old highway places  
And cause I did Ill sleep in Tarren County Jail tonight  
  
Well I started out tonight with good intentions  
But I ended up gettin sidways drinkin wine  
Well the last thing I remember we was rollin  
And something hit my head and knocked me from my conscious mind  
  
Chorus  
And Im a victim of lifes circumstances  
Well I was raised around bar rooms and Friday night dances  
Singin them old country songs  
And half the time ending up some place I dont belong  
  
I said Jailer hey what yall got me charged with  
Well he looked at me and halfway closed one eye  
Well he said To mean to say you dont remember  
Cuttin up some fool with that bone handled knife  
  
Chorus x2
