Dance into my life only for a while  
Whirl me round and round  
Dance me like an angel child  
Hes passing through my world  
He doesnt even know  
Times not on my side  
No word or goodbye Ill go  
  
So dance on right now I want to dance on  
Until the moments over  
And Ill be going home  
ill be going home  
Just dance on right now  
I want to dance on  
I cant let him notice the tears in my eyes  
In my eyes in my eyes  
  
Dance into my life  
Hold the moment fast  
Make believe in us  
Nothing real in life can last dance within my life  
Dance me to the door  
I cant see the time but the time has come for sure  
  
So dance on right now I want to dance on  
Until the moments over  
And Ill be going home  
ill be going home  
Just dance on right now  
I want to dance on  
I cant let him notice the tears in my eyes  
In my eyes in my eyes  
  
Dance with me dance with me  
Wont you dance with me  
Dance with me dance with me  
Wont you dance with me  
  
So dance on right now  
I want to dance on  
Until the moments over  
And Ill be going home  
ill be going home  
So dance on right now  
I want to dance on  
Until the moments over  
And Ill be going home
