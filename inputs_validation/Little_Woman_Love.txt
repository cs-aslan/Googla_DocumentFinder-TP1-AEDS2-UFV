I got a little woman I can really love  
My woman fit me like a little glove  
You know Ill always love  
My little woman love  
  
I take her home most evry night  
My woman love to hold me tight  
You know I feel alright  
My little woman mine  
  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
I take her home most evry night  
My woman love to hold me tight  
You know I feel alright  
My little woman mine
