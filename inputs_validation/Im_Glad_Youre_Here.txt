Well theres no need explaining  
It doesnt really matter anyway  
So you let the rain in  
And being sorrys not enough to say  
And though youll never make it right  
Im glad youre here with me tonight  
  
Hey babe the sunshines on you  
Even though the skies are dark and gray  
Well if I have to miss you  
Id just as soon begin some other day  
And though youll never make it right  
Im glad youre here with me tonight  
  
Out there in the storm  
Not everyone is safe and warm  
  
Now the leaves are falling  
I guess they didnt have much more to say  
And with the winter calling  
Its gonna be a long and lonely day  
And though youll never make it right  
Im glad youre here with me tonight  
  
Cause out there in the storm  
Not everyone is safe and warm  
Oh no  
  
And if we never make it right  
Im glad youre here with me tonight  
If we never make it right  
Im glad youre here with me tonight  
So glad to have you babe stay right here tonight  
So glad baby oh no  
feels like old times
