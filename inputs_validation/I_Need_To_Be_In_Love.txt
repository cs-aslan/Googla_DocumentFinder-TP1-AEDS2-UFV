The hardest thing Ive ever done  
Is keep believing  
Theres someone in this crazy world  
For me  
The way that people come and go  
Through temporary lives  
My chance could come and I might never know  
  
I used to say No promises  
Lets keep it simple  
But freedom only helps you say  
Goodbye  
It took a while for me to learn  
That nothin comes for free  
The price Ive paid is high enough for me  
  
I know I need to be in love  
I know Ive wasted too much time  
I know I ask perfection of  
A quite imperfect world  
And fool enough to think thats what Ill find  
  
So here I am with pockets full of good intentions  
But none of them will comfort me tonight  
Im wide awake at four am  
Without a friend in sight  
Hanging on a hope but Im alright  
  
I know I need to be in love  
I know Ive wasted too much time  
I know I ask perfection of  
A quite imperfect world  
And fool enough to think thats what Ill find  
  
I know I need to be in love  
I know Ive wasted too much time  
I know I ask perfection of  
A quite imperfect world  
And fool enough to think thats what Ill find
