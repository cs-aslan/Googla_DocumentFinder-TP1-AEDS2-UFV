Verse 1  
I bought a little dog from my local pet shop  
He prances around with a little white mop  
I dont think hes an animal I can afford  
Everyday I take him surfin on his little surfboard  
  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah x2  
  
Verse 2  
Hes pickin up dogs and hes givin them licks  
Hes always gettin me a lot of chicks  
I dont think hes an animal I can afford  
Everyday I take him surfin on his little surfboard  
  
Chorus  
My dog is well hes doin mighty fine  
My dog is swell hes all mine  
My dog is good hes swingin through the vine  
My dog really should stop pretending hes a porcupine

One time I ran him over on my cars rear wheel

If he doesnt get his act together  
Ill be in really deep shit  
If I cant pay for kibble  
Ill have to morgage my house a bit  
  
Chorus  
My dog is well hes doin mighty fine  
My dog is swell hes all mine  
My dog is good hes swingin through the vine

My dog is swell hes all mine  
My dog is good hes swingin through the vine  
My dog really should stop pretending hes a porcupine
