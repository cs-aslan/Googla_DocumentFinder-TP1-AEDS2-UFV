Aint a cardinal sin baby lemme in girl Im gonna treat you right  
Well goodness sakes my snakes alive and its ready to bite  
Hornets nest lay me down to rest ooh I wanna shed my skin  
I got the urge to merge youre cold as ice baby wont you lemme in  
Night scenes wet dreams enough to make you drool  
And fire fire fire for the fuel  
  
Dont like to dress talk too good but I found my queen  
Not too clean know what I like if you know what I mean  
  
Baby baby guess you win the prize  
Maybe baby where the sun never shines  
  
This must be love fits like a glove  
Well it must be love it must be love  fits like a glove  fits like a glove  
  
Feel the heat drivers seat my blessing is my curse  
Think Im gonna burst a gonna burst a gonna burst  
  
Night scenes wet dreams enough to make you drool  
And fire fire fire for the fuel  
  
Ooh baby babe  fits like a glove  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  fits like a glove  fits like a glove  
  
Cause when I go through her its just like a hot knife through butter ooh

Baby baby guess you win the prize  
Maybe baby where the sun never shines  
  
Fits like a glove  well it must be love it must be love  fits like a glove  
Fits like a glove  well it must be love it must be love  
Fits like a glove
