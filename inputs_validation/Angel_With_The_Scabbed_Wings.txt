He is the angel with the scabbed wings  
Hard drug face want to powder his nose  
He will deflower the freshest crop  
Dry up all the wounds with his rock and roll sores  
Dead  
Is what he is he does what he please  
The things that he has youll never want to see  
What youre never gonna be now  
Sketch a little keyhole for looking glass people  
You dont want to see him  
You only want to be him  
Mommys got a scarecrow gotta let the corn grow  
Man cant always reap what he sow  
he is the maker  
he is the taker  
he is the saviour  
he is the raper  
  
Get back youre never gonna leave him  
Get back youre always gonna please him
