Its notyesterdayanymore  
I go visiting I talk loud  
I try to make myself clear  
In frontof a facethats nearer  
Than its ever been before  
Not this close before  
Nearer than before  
Not this close before  
  
It isis a millionyears ago  
I hear musicand it sounds like bells  
I feel like my head is high  
I wishI could meetevery one  
Meet them all over again  
Bring them up to my room  
Meet them all over again  
Everyones up in my room  
  
And nownow Im busybusy again  
I feel like sitting down but  
Im still thinkingthinking about my friends  
In my gardenmoments  
But now Im speaking out  
Speaking about my friends  
Now Im speaking out  
Thinking about my friends
