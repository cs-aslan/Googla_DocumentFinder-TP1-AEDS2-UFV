If I would tell you  
How much you mean to me  
I think you wouldnt understand it  
So I wait I wait  
Until this day comes  
When you will understand me  
  
But I cant help myself  
I cant stop myself  
I am going crazy  
And I cant stop myself  
I cannot control myself  
I am going crazy  
  
And I love you I want you  
I want to talk to you  
I want to be with you  
  
I cannot change it  
Im sure not making it  
One big hell of a fuss  
I cannot turn my back  
Ive got to face the fact  
Life without you is hazy  
  
And I love you  
  
Kiss me thrill me dont say good bye  
Hug me love me dont say goodbye  
Oh oh oh  
And dont say goodbye  
  
And I cant help myself  
And I cant stop myself  
I am going crazy  
I cannot turn my back  
Ive got to face the fact  
Life without you is hazy  
  
And I love you  
  
Oh uho uho oh oh uho uho oh  
And kiss me goodbye
