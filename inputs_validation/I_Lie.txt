What would you do if you knew how I was feelin  
I wonder what youd have to say  
Afraid of the answers Im not takin any chances  
I dont want to scare you away  
Oh so I lie  
I lie  
Oh yes I lie  
I lie  
Ooh I dont wanna let you go  
I dont wanna let you know so I lie  
Here in my heart I can hold on to this secret  
Im hopin that you wont see through  
I dont like denyin all the love that Ive been hidin  
I dont want to tell you the truth  
Oh so I lie  
I lie  
Oh yes I lie  
I lie  
Ooh I dont wanna let you know  
I dont wanna let you go so I lie  
Its not easy to deceive you  
Its so hard to keep from saying I love you  
Oh so I lie  
I lie  
Oh yes I lie  
I lie  
Ooh I dont wanna let you know  
I dont wanna let you go so I lie  
I lie  
Oh yes I lie
