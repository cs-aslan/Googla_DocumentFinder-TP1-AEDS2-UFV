Nobody wanna see us together  
But it dont matter no  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it dont matter no  
Cause we gon fight

Fight for our right to love yeah  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it dont matter no  
  
Nobody wanna see us together  
Nobody thought wed last forever  
Im a rollin that body  
Got every man in here wishin  
Sippin on coke and rum  
Im like so what Im drunk  
Its the freakin weekend baby  
Im about to have me some fun  
And all the Crystal poppin in the stretch Navigator  
We got food every where  
As if the party was catered  
I got fellas on my left  
Hunnies on my right  
We put the two together we be bumpin all night  
And after the show its the after party  
And after the party its the hotel lobby  
And round about 4 you gotta clear the lobby  
And take it to the room and somebody sayin  
  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it dont matter no  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it dont matter no  
Cause I got you babe  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it dont matter no  
Cause I got you babe  
Nobody wanna see us together  
But it dont matter no  
Cause I got you babe
