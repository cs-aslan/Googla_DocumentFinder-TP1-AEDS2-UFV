Something about the way you taste  
Makes me want to clear my throat  
Theres a message to your movements  
That really gets my goat  
I looked for sniffy linings  
But youre rotten to the core  
Ive had just about all I can take  
You know I cant take it no more  
Got a gut feeling  
Centered round long time ago  
On your ability to torment  
Then you took your tongs of love  
And stripped away my garment  
Got a gut feeling  
Slap your mammy down  
Slap your pappy down again  
Oh move it up and down now  
Oh move it all around now
