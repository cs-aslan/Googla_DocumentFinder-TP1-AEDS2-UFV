When he told me that I ought to come back home  
I tried  
And when he told me that he was tired of being  
alone  
I cried  
Now all these years have passed  
The music has always held my hand  
Well ride the back up train forever  
With this saintlike man  
  
He was the only one that Id ever listen to  
He was the only one  
  
Now when my lifes in doubt  
Theres always a reason to belong  
And when my wife was gone  
His music always made me strong  
If theres a heaven where good music goes  
I know it will be there  
We know he loves we know he sings we know he  
tries  
He cares
