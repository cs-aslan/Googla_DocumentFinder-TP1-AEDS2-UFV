Somethings goin on  
I dont know what it is  
But my phone just rang and I didnt get no call  
No call  
Just waiting here  
  
Abilene its got a lot of what you dont need  
Its got lots of space  
Still nothing seems misplaced  
Youve got a face  
You are spacey  
  
You got to take it as it comes to you  
Dont need no act of contemplation  
Just keep it off your wasteful way for now  
Its not you who has got to change  
Its not your way at all  
Its got to be you  
  
Its got to be you  
The look in your eyes  
the feel of your body close to me  
Its got to be you  
Who tells me the world spin away without love  
  
You  
Reason oh reason for being once more together  
Its got to be you  
  
Its got to be you  
The look in your eyes  
the feel of your body close to me  
Its got to be you  
Who tells me the world spin away without love  
  
You  
Reason oh reason for being once more together  
Its got to be you  
Its got to be you  
Its got to be you  
Its got to be you
