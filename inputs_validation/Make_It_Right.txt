I want you to brighten the days of my life  
I want you and I all alone to be together at night  
  
I cant stand it  
The feeling when youre far away  
I want to wrap you up in my little world  
So youll be here today  
  
When we fly through the night  
Cant you feel the rush of 1000 dancers  
come into your life  
Ill be there to make it right  
  
If something is wrong Ill make it right  
If something is wrong Ill make it right  
  
I want you to put your trust in me  
Say goodbye to all your heartaches as fast as you can  
I need you to surrender to me all your body and soul  
And the spirit we seek will enter us both and make us complete  
  
When we fly through the night  
And it feels like heavens wings were riding  
Youve got to hold on tight  
If you feel like I do  
Knowing nothing can go wrong between us  
Ill be there to make it right make it right  
  
Know me show me  
All your love  
Youre here today  
You know youre here always  
You know I cant get enough  
You know I cant get enough  
  
If something is wrong Ill make it right  
If something is wrong Ill make it right
