God and His only Son  
Paid a courtesy call on Earth  
One Sunday morning  
Orange blossoms opened their fragrant lips  
Songbirds sang from the tips of Cottonwoods  
Old folks wept for His love in these hard times  
  
Well we got to get going said the restless Lord to the Son  
There are galaxies yet to be born  
Creation is never done  
Anyway these people are slobs here  
If we stay its bound to be a mob scene  
But disappear and its love and hard times  
  
I loved her the first time I saw her  
I know thats an old songwriting cliche  
Loved you the first time I saw you  
Cant describe it any other way  
Any other way  
The light of her beauty was warm as a summer day  
Clouds of antelope rolled by  
No hint of rain to come  
In the prairie sky  
Its just love love love love love  
  
When the rains came the tears burned windows rattled locks turned  
Its easy to be generous when youre on a roll  
Its hard to be grateful when youre out of control  
And love is gone  
  
The light at the edge of the curtain  
Is the quiet dawn  
The bedroom breathes  
In clicks and clacks  
Uneasy heartbeat cant relax  
  
But then your hand takes mine  
Thank God I found you in time  
Thank God I found you  
Thank God I found you
