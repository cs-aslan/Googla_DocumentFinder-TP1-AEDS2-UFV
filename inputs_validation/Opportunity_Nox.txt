Well I like you I couldnt think of anything but you  
For a week I was in love with your hairdo  
I couldnt chew those muffins I used to  
I knew I was way over the moon  
When I met you when I met you I didnt know what to do  
When I saw you when I saw you you said  
  
Oohoohoohooh  
Im living in a box but Im out when opportunity nox  
Oohoohoohooh  
Im living in a box but Im out when opportunity nox  
Oohoohoohooh  
Im dying in a box but Im out when opportunity rox on  
  
Im sleeping and Im dreaming so solo  
I saw you in the crowd in the front row  
You couldnt get it right in the disco  
Youre dancing so much better in slomo  
When I met you when I met you I didnt know what to do  
When I saw you yeah when I saw you I said  
  
Oohoohoohooh  
Im living in a box but Im out when opportunity nox  
Oohoohoohooh  
Im living in a box but Im out when opportunity nox  
Oohoohoohooh  
Im dying in a box but Im out when opportunity rox on
