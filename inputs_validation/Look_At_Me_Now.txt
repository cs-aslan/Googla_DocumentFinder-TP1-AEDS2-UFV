Its hard to recall how we were at school  
Our ambitions and conditions and our hopes for the future  
The teachers we had our mums and our dads  
Their decisions and revisions and their hopes for the future  
But look at me now I cannot count the cost  
Of all the friends I lost and though my heart did break  
Look at me now Im on the candle flame  
I have a different name I have your hand to take  
But look at me now and here I am  
I used to believe in an idea received  
With concision but derision was my natural reaction  
You cannot pretend that its all gonna end  
In a second to be reckoned like a soldier in action  
But look at me now I cannot count the cost  
Of all the friends I lost and though my heart did break  
Look at me now Im on the candle flame  
I have a different name I have your hand to take  
But look at me now and here I am  
Wont you look at me now
