Their eyes are down and the track looks slow  
It dont look like a good thing  
Your horse could jump it when the pack runs wild  
It dont look like a sure thing  
You must be crazy  
To gamble this way  
The kids are crying  
And your bills aint paid  
Gamblin man ramblin fool  
I must be crazy to gamble on you  
The deal is done so you slip right in  
You got the depth but you cant win  
The cards are cold and the cut feels thin  
You got the deck but you cant win  
You must be crazy  
To gamble this way  
The kids are hungry  
And your brain aint paid  
Gamblin man ramblin fool  
I must be crazy to gamble on you  
Gamblin man youre a ramblin fool  
I must be crazy to gamble on you
