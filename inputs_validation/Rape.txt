He searched through his love like a thief on the run  
He searched through his face  to see the guilt water run  
But hes fresh out of tears and nobody has come  
And justice has got to be done  
  
Oh moon in the city stay open and clear  
For his vision aint good and his minds disappeared  
get along mother nature they spat at your son  
So justice has got to be done  
  
And beauty is lying alone in the park  
Her friend has gone bowling in the alleys so dark  
Wheres her knight in white armor who rides a chrome ford  
Justice would seem to be bored  
Justice would seem to be bored  
  
A knife full of life penetrated the bait  
While he thinks o the sister and the mother that he hates  
And he thinks hell get off cause hes sick and stoned  
And justice was made to be honed  
And justice was made to be honed  
  
And his lawyer is smiling one hell of a smile  
n hes lying all the lies  of the lies in exile  
While shes dying of grief hes defending his brief  
And justice would seem to be cheap  
And justice would seem to be cheap  
  
Well Ive searched through the falling and I searched through the failed  
Ive searched through the jury  the judge and the jailed  
But sleeping beauty is dead no use pricking her thumb  
And justice has got to be done  
  
Justice just is  justice just is  justice just is  not
