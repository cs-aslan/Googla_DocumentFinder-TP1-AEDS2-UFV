Chorus  
Jesus Your love  
Takes my breath away  
I cant get You off my mind  
I think about You night and day  
When the tears fell from my eyes  
You caught em in the nick of time  
Oh Jesus Your love  
Takes my  
Breath away  
  
Verse 1  
Jesus Your love  
Takes my breath away  
It feels like sunshine  
When I have a cloudy day  
Its a feeling that I cant explain  
All I have to do is just call Your name  
Oh Jesus Your love  
Takes my  
Breath away  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2  
Jesus Your love  
Is like a sweet melody sweededededeeeee  
I get joy when I think about all the Youve done for me  
No other love can compare  
When I needed You  
You were there  
Oh Jesus Your love  
Takes my  
Breath away  
  
Chorus  
  
I cant breathe cant breathe  
I cant sing cant sing  
I cant live cant live  
No no no no  
I cant walk cant walk  
I cant talk cant talk  
Without Your love without Your love Without Your love  
I cant walk cant walk  
I cant talk cant talk  
Without Your love without Your love  
  
Chorus
