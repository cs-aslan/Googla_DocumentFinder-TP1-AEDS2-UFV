The woman is out on her own  
Walking the streets sad and alone  
Yes she sells herself for nickles and dimes  
These are hard times for a Harlem woman  
Harlem woman  
  
Yes you work at nightI have held you tight  
But youre not aware of how much I care  
  
No you cant see your babys been hungry and cold  
So long nights through go on and do what you must do  
I love youI love you Harlem woman  
Harlem woman  
  
Sometimes I cry but Ill get by till your mine alone  
So carry on to other armstender but strong  
Till you belong to me  
  
Harlem woman hang on  
Ill take you away  
Someday Ill set you free to be with only me  
  
Till then Ill know  
Lord knows Ill know  
They can buy the body  
But not the soul of my Harlem woman  
Harlem woman Harlem woman  
Hang on
