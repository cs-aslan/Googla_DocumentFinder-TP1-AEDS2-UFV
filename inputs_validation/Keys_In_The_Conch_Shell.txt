Its the third thatched roof on the right  
Right beside crystal blue water  
First wave of the day  
Almost got away but my sail board caught her  
  
Funny when you called I was thinking how good itd be to see you again  
The keys in the conch shell come on in  
  
Been here bout a month  
Not doing much of nothing at all  
  
Dodging man o wars  
Man its hard to get bored when youre having a ball  
  
Make yourself at home theres a good chance Ill be gone reeling on in  
Girl the keys in the conch shell come on in  
  
Dont bring nothing but that sunshine smile  
Come on baby stay a while stay a while  
  
My favorite bars in view  
Work there a day or two just to cover my tab  
Other than that it aint cost me a dime for the time Ive had  
The only thing I need is some company from where have you been  
  
Girl the keys in the conch shell come on in  
Make yourself at home theres a good chance Ill be gone reeling on in  
Girl the keys in the conch shell come on in
