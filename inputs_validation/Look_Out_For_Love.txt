Look out where youre going  
Theres danger ahead  
The signal is showing  
A definite red  
  
Look out what youre doing  
Youre caught in a pot  
Whatever she is brewing  
Stay out of the pot  
  
You better get wise heres what I advise  
When she sighs for a squeeze  
Freeze blame it on the breeze  
Start to sneeze get the measles  
  
Shell get you off balance  
Then suddenly shove duck  
When she throws her hook out  
Dont let your heart get took out  
Pick up your pack and cook out  
Oh look out look out its love  
  
Look out where youre rowing  
Stay close to the bank  
That river is flowing  
Right into a tank  
  
Look out where you ramble  
Youre out on the loose  
Youre liable to amble  
Ride into a noose  
  
You better look out or better turn about  
Like a trout  
At the dam scram take it on the lamp  
Its a jam its a stampede  
  
Shell talk to her lawyer where by and where of  
Shell get the marriage book out  
And shell pick the perfect look out  
Her welcome masks been shook out  
Oh look out look out for love
