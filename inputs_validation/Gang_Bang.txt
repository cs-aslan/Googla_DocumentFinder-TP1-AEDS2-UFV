Like a bitch out of order  
Like a bat out of hell  
Like a fish out of water  
Im scared cant you tell

But you painted me bad  
Compared to the others

Bang Bang shot you dead  
Bang Bang shot you dead  
  
I thought it was you  
And I loved you the most  
But I was just keeping  
My enemies close  
  
I made a decision I would never look back  
So how did you end up with all my jack  
  
Bang Bang shot you dead  
Bang Bang shot you dead in the head
