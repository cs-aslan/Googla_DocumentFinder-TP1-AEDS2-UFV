Great fire burning  
You supplied the spark  
Fores burning spreading through the ark  
Animals are panicking  
Im animal and panicking  
  
Your glance a match on the tinder wood  
You never spoke but I understood  
Bring water  
Eyes bring water  
  
Chorus  
Great fire burning through  
Great fire burning through my house  
Great fire burning through my house and heart  
  
Great fire burning  
All because of you  
Fires burning spreading through the zoo  
Animals are panicking  
Im animal and panicking  
  
No round of drinks can extinguish this  
Feeling of love and engulfing bliss  
Bring water  
Eyes bring water  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive been in love before  
But its never been as hot as this  
Smoke curling round the door  
Memories of old loves crack and blister  
Mister fireman bet you couldnt put me out if you tried  
  
Your glance a match on the tinder wood  
You never spoke but I understood  
Bring water  
Eyes bring water  
  
Chorus
