Mother Im going to join the Air Force today  
I dont care what the neighbors may say  
But Im going to join the Air Force today  
  
MotherI dont care what my father might think  
Perhaps its going to drive him to drink  
But I dont care what my father might think  
Dont ask me why its my mind and its right  
Dont ask me why its my mind   
Its better its better than being alone  
Alone on the ground Now I find  
  
MotherIve got to join the Air Force you see  
Ive seen my friends and they all agree  
Thats its better than joining the army or going to sea  
  
MotherIve go to join the Air Force you see
