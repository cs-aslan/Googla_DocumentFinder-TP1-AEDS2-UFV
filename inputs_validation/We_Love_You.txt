Weve got to get a message to the stars above  
Like radios in heaven hearing just enough  
And every single tear drop along the way  
We put them in our pockets for a rainy day  
  
But here we are in truoble  
Like we always are  
Just praying for a mriacle  
And reaching for stars  
  
We love you  
Would die for you  
We need you  
Every day  
  
We got to get a message to the promised land  
Like semaphores in motion so theyll understand  
But every single vision that we saw today  
We didnt quite believe it in the usual way  
Yet here we are in heaven  
Who could wnat for more  
We always end up getting what were asking for  
  
We love you  
Would die for you  
We need you  
Every day  
  
Its just another promise like weve heard before  
Were never really knowing what were fighting for  
  
We love you  
Would die for you  
We need you  
Every day  
  
We love you  
Wouldnt leave you  
We miss you  
Far away  
  
We love you  
Would die for you  
We need you  
Every day  
  
We miss you  
Far away  
  
We love you  
Would die for you  
We need you  
Every day
