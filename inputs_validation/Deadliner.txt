So I close my eyes and drift into sleep  
But something is here  
In the dark in the dream  
Like a cruel wind clutching my heart  
I feel more than I see  
Like a clue to a nightmare that I cant believe  
Then it touches me and I try to scream  
And a thought tears me inside  
And I will do anything  
Anything you understand  
Just to wake up  
  
Sometimes it almost makes me cry  
Sometimes it seems to call my name out loud  
Sometimes it feels like Im alone  
And then it comes for me again  
  
Im told its called The unreality dream  
Im told its called The great American lie  
Im told that this is like the vengeance of God  
I cant believe that God would do this to me  
  
Ive known fear many times but nothing like this  
Im so scared I cant breathe  
I know Im asleep but I know this is real  
And nothing can help me here  
Im deep inside something and I may never come back  
And then it was gone  
And then I realized that The Rush brought it in  
And I will never sleep alone again  
  
Sometimes it almost breaks my heart  
Sometimes I swear I hear it laugh at me  
Sometimes it feels like I could die  
And then it leaves my dreams again  
  
Feels like Im fighting the possession of my soul  
Im told that this is called The sickness of need  
Ive got to cut the sex connection and slide  
A word of warning to the weary and wise
