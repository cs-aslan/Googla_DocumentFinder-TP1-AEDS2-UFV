Last night I dug your picture out from our old dresser drawer  
I set it on the table and I talked to it till four  
I read some old love letters right up to the break of dawn  
Yeah Ive been sittin alone diggin up bones  
  
Then I went through the jewelry and I found our wedding rings  
I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling  
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home  
Yeah tonight Im sittin alone diggin up bones  
  
Im diggin up bones Im diggin up bones  
Exhuming things thats better left alone  
And Im resurrecting memries of a love thats dead and gone  
Yeah tonight Im sittin alone diggin up bones  
  
And I went through the closet and I found some things in there  
Like that pretty lingerie that I bought you to wear  
And I recalled how good you looked each time you had it on  
Yeah tonight Im sittin alone diggin up bones  
  
Im diggin up bones Im diggin up bones  
Exhuming things thats better left alone  
And Im resurrecting memries of a love thats dead and gone  
Yeah tonight Im sittin alone diggin up bones
