Searching in the darkness  
Running from the day  
Hiding from tomorrow  
Nothing left to say  
  
Victims of the moment  
Future deep in doubt  
Living in a whisper  
Until we start to shout  
  
Ooh were creatures of the night  
Ooo were creatures of the night  
  
Breathing in the madness  
Spitting out the lies  
Searching for an answer  
Keep your alibis  
  
Dont know where were going  
Just know where weve been  
Remember when the clock strikes twelve  
The losers always win  
  
Ooh were creatures of the night  
Ooh were creatures of the night
