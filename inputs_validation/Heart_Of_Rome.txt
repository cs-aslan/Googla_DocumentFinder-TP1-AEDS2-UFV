In a little while youre leavin  
Starting on the journey home  
Soon Ill be alone the one who loves you  
La la la la la somewhere in the heart of Rome  
Ill make a wish in every fountain  
Say a prayer that youll return  
Minutes Ill be counting  
May the fire of love still burn  
Ill keep your picture by my pillow  
And pretend Im not alone  
Make believe that you are with me  
La la la la la in the heart of Rome  
Suddenly the tears are falling  
As we hear the whistle blow  
Hold me very close before you leave me  
La la la la la somewhere in the heart of Rome  
Ill make a wish in every fountain  
Say a prayer that youll return  
Minutes Ill be counting  
May the fire of love still burn  
Ill keep your picture by my pillow  
And pretend Im not alone  
Make believe that you are with me  
La la la la la in the heart of Rome  
Ill make a wish in every fountain  
Say a prayer that youll return  
Minutes Ill be counting  
May the fire of love still burn  
Ill keep your picture by my pillow  
And pretend Im not alone  
Make believe that you are with me  
La la la la la in the heart of Rome
