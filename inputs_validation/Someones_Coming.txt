Goodnight baby  
Someones acomin someones acomin  
Goodnight baby  
Gotta get arunnin gotta get arunnin  
  
Your father doesnt like me  
Told you that you couldnt see me any more  
Thats why we meet in secret  
Thats why were hiding here  
  
Goodnight baby  
Same time tomorrow same time tomorrow  
Goodnight baby  
See you here tomorrow see you here tomorrow  
  
Your mother made you stay in  
When she saw you going out with me  
Youll say youll take the dog out  
Then you sneak out here to me  
  
If your parents find you here  
Youre gonna get a hiding gonna get a hiding  
So Ill vanish disappear  
See you here tomorrow see you here tomorrow
