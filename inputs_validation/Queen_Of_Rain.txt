In that big big house there are fifty doors  
and one of them leads to your heart  
In the time of spring I passed your gate  
and tried to make a start  
All I knew was the scent of sea and dew  
but Ive been in love before  
how about you  
  
Theres a time for the good in life  
a time to kill the pain in life  
dream about the sun you queen of rain  
  
In that big house there are fifty beds  
and one of them leads to your soul  
Its a bed of fear a bed of threats  
regrets and sheets so cold  
All I knew your eyes so velvet blue  
Ive been in love before how about you  
  
Theres a time for the good in life  
a time to kill the pain in life  
dream about the sun you queen of rain  
  
Its time to place your bets in life  
Ive played the losers game of life  
dream about the sun you queen of rain  
  
Time went by as I wrote your name in the sky  
fly fly away bye bye
