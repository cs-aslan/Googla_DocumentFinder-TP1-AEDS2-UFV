So you think you are something special  
I wonder why baby is that so  
Could admit you are something special  
Wont you tell me girl Id love to know  
  
Yes Ive seen you with your other girlfriends  
I can tell they really think youre fine  
And Ive seen you with your other men friends  
They dont know if youre a love of mine  
  
Chorus  
It all depends on how you feel baby  
Ive got to know just how you feel baby  
It all depends on how you feel baby  
Ive got to know just how you feel baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause youve taken away  
The only thing I ever ever had  
Dont you know that I love you  
Whyd you make me feel bad  
Cause the only thing I ever loved  
Was loving you  
  
So you think you are something special  
I wonder why baby is that so  
Could admit you are something special  
Wont you tell me girl Id love to know  
  
Chorus  
  
So you think you are something special  
  
What makes you think you are something special
