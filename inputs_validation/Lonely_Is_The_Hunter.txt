My eggs in one basket but she threw me a bone  
She was dealt a full deck but she likes to live alone  
Aint just talkin to myself need a reason to stop oh yeah  
With a flower in her teeth she drained the last drop  
I said girls love money like bees the honey  
  
But lonely is the hunter youre my one and only and lonely is the hunter  
  
Asked her for a refill sweat flew off my face oh yeah  
Shes a legendary figure kept me in a cage  
Shes a torture chamber when I seduced her in my bed ooh yeah  
She gave a cold reading success went to her head  
  
In the heat of the battle the heart cannot rule Im such a fool  
  
But lonely is the hunter youre my one and only and lonely is the hunter  
Lonely is the hunter youre my one and only and lonely is the hunter  
  
Lonely is the hunter youre my one and only and lonely is the hunter  
Lonely is the hunter youre my one and only and lonely is the hunter
