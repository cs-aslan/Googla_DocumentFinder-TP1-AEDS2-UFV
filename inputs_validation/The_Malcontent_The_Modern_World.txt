I hear the ringing of the telephone  
No ones home and none of you can reach me  
Im alone and I feel fine  
Theres nothing anyone can sell to me  
Nothing new none of you can teach me  
But Im sure that you will try  
  
Im tired of living in the modern world  
With pretty boys and plastic girls  
Broken hearts vanities that disease  
  
I hear my music on the radio  
Whats that song from long ago theyre still playing  
Is it saying anything to you  
Pretty people in the magazines  
Play the part of kings and queens  
Hair and makeup can cover up the ugly truth  
  
Im tired of living in the modern world  
With pretty boys and plastic girls  
Broken hearts vanities that disease  
It really doesnt mean a thing to me  
It really doesnt mean a thing to me  
  
Im tired of living in the modern world  
With pretty boys and plastic girls  
Broken hearts vanities that disease  
  
I hear the ringing of the telephone  
No ones home and none of you can reach me  
Im alone and I feel fine  
  
Im tired of living in the modern world  
With pretty boys and plastic girls  
Broken hearts vanities that disease  
It really doesnt mean a thing to me  
It really doesnt mean a thing to me  
It really doesnt mean a thing to me
