Half moon night time sky  
Seven stars Heavens eyes  
Seven songs on seven seas  
Just to bring all your sweet love home to me  
  
Hey fill me like the mountains yeah yeah yeah  
Fill me like the sea Lord  
Not coming past still at last  
Your love brings life to me  
Your love brings life to me  
Hey  
  
Rings of cloud arms aflame  
Sunrise up to call your name  
Sunrise up and it burn the ground  
Just to shine above the first true love I found  
  
Hey Fill me like the mountains yeah yeah yeah  
Fill me like the sea Lord  
Not coming past still at last  
Your love brings life to me  
Your love brings life to me  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey yeah  
  
Half moon night time sky  
Seven stars Heavens eyes  
Seven songs on seven seas  
Just to bring all your sweet love home to me  
  
Hey Fill me like the mountains yeah yeah yeah  
Fill me like the sea Lord  
Not coming past still at last  
Lord Fill me like the mountains yeah yeah yeah  
Fill me like the sea Lord
