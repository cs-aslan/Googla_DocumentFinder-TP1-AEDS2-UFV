Jump back tell a friend  
Ooh la la la  
Ooh la la la  
Ooh la la la  
I want a movie moment  
Were so in love it hurts  
And Id be the main attraction  
Everybodys favorite girl  
Wanna be in Gucci dresses  
I know you like that style  
Symphony of stars to serenade us  
Im giving you my smile  
Cover me with kisses  
Sweet sweet kisses  
Come on over and kiss me all over  
Im gonna be here  
So cover me  
Run into you in slow motion  
Thunder claps and pouring rain  
The world is falling down around us  
We didnt notice anyway  
Wanna be in Gucci dresses  
I know you like that style  
Symphony of stars to serenade us  
Im giving you my smile  
Cover me with kisses  
Sweet sweet kisses  
Come on over and kiss me all over  
Im gonna be here  
Cover me with kisses  
Sweet sweet kisses  
Come on over and kiss me all over  
My love is for real  
Come on come on cover me baby
