Hey love dont be afraid to stay until tomorrow  
Lovers dawn is waiting just this side of day  
If you thought I loved you yesterday  
Ill love you more than that tomorrow  
  
Hey love dont be afraid to hear the songs of morning  
Birds will sing them as theyre calling up the day  
If I sang to you yesterday  
Ill sing more than that tomorrow  
  
If it should happen that you come to me  
In the night we share our hearts  
Whatever it is that you done to me  
Between you and me cant be undone  
  
If I should understand just why I need you by me  
Then I would know the reasons for the songs of morning  
Cause if I wanted you yesterday  
And if in the night we shared our hearts  
Whatever it is that you done to me  
Between you and me cant be undone  
  
Hey love dont be afraid to stay until tomorrow  
Lovers dawn is waiting just this side of day  
If you thought I loved you yesterday  
Ill love you more than that tomorrow  
  
If you thought I loved you yesterday  
Ill love you more than that tomorrow
