When I say I want you  
When I say I need you  
Why dont you believe me  
When I say I miss you  
When Im not there with you  
Why dont you believe me  
True love is so hard to find  
Why are you running away from mine  
  
When I say just call me  
Anytime you want me  
Why dont you believe me  
When I say Ill be there  
Now until forever  
Why dont you believe me  
True love is so hard to find  
Why are you running away from mine  
  
So darlin dont be afraid  
Ill never leave you alone  
I dont care how long it takes  
Im willing to wait  
Til you make my heart your home  
  
When you say I want you  
When I say I need you  
Why dont you believe me  
Believe me  
Why dont you believe me  
Believe me  
Why dont you believe me
