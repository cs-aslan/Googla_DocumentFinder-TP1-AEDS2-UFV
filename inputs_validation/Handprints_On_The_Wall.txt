The wait turned into hours  
Before you came my way  
The smile that filled a daddys heart  
On the special day  
The moment left me speechless  
I didnt know what to say  
Then you took your first breath  
That took mine away  
  
Days go by so quickly  
Summer turns to fall  
Seems like only yesterday  
That you began to crawl  
So dont be afraid to take that step  
Ill catch you when you fall  
I dont mind if you leave behind  
A few hand prints on the wall  
  
I cant describe this feeling  
Way down deep inside  
The itsybitsy spider  
Was the first thing that we tried  
Patty cake the bakers man  
With your hands so very small  
You could always stay this young  
And I wouldnt mind at all  
  
Days go by so quickly  
Summer turns to fall  
Seems like only yesterday  
That you began to crawl  
So dont be afraid to take that step  
Ill catch you when you fall  
I dont mind if you leave behind  
A few hand prints on the wall
