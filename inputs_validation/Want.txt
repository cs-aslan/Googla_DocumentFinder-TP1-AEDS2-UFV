A round of applause you got what you want  
Take a good look at what you give up  
Because Im telling you  
A heart cant be unbroken oh oh  
  
And can you remember how I kiss you  
Recall the sweet taste in your mouth  
Cause baby the memory is all you get now  
And Im moving moving moving on  
  
All that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
Cause I didnt  
  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
Cause I didnt  
  
Does every morning make you happy  
And tell me do you laugh yourself to sleep  
I hope you find its easy to forget me oh oh  
  
I hope you dont feel anything when you see me  
I wonder if youre out there having fun  
I hope you get all that you really wanted  
Cause Im moving moving moving on  
  
Dont you see the light has changed  
And nothing looks the same  
Just shadows on the ground  
And if you listen carefully youll hear the sound  
  
All that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
Cause I didnt  
  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
Cause I didnt  
  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
Cause I didnt  
All that you want  
Cause I didnt  
  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
Cause I didnt  
All that you want  
  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
Cause I didnt
