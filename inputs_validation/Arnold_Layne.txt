Arnold Layne had a strange hobby  
Collecting clothes  
Moonshine washing line  
They suit him fine  
On the wall hung a tall mirror  
Distorted view see through baby blue  
Oh Arnold Layne  
Its not the same takes two to know  
Two to know two to know  
Why cant you see  
Arnold Layne Arnold Layne Arnold Layne Arnold Layne  
  
Now hes caught a nasty sort of person  
They gave him time  
Doors bang chain gang he hates it  
Oh Arnold Layne  
Its not the same takes two to know  
Two to know two to know  
Why cant you see  
Arnold Layne Arnold Layne Arnold Layne Arnold Layne  
  
Dont do it again
