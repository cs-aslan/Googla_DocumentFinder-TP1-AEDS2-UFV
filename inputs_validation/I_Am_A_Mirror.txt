Suppose I were to tell you that the meaning of dreams  
Is not all that it seems and the ultimate truth is a lie  
And you are just a puppet who can dance on a string  
Do you feel anything  
Would you laugh Would you care Would you cry  
  
But the meaning of life is a mystery how can anyone disagree  
And the music is a symphony which we play in a minor key  
  
I am a mirror I am a mirror Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror I am a mirror Every face is someone else  
Look at me smile and youre the clown And if I dance you turn around  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears  
  
So if you are confused and dont know which way to go  
You will certainly know From the moment were living we die  
And if its all a crazy game you dont want to play  
Tell me what you can say  
Its a joke Its the truth Its a lie  
  
But the meaning of life is a mystery that we dont understand  
And the music is a rhapsody if youre happy the way that you are  
  
I am a mirror I am a mirror Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror I am a mirror Every face is someone else  
Look at me smile and youre the clown And if I dance you turn around  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears  
  
And the meaning of life is a mystery though we live it from day to day  
But the music of live should be harmony so that anyone here can play  
  
I am a mirror I am a mirror Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror I am a mirror Every face is someone else  
Look at me smile and youre the clown And if I dance you turn around  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears
