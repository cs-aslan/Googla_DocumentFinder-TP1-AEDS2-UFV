All the heartaches that Ive known would fill the sea  
Oh Im lonesome and youll be callin me yeah callin me  
Oh memries fill my little lonely room  
And if I never love again itll be too soon  
Cant help turnin by each love Ive ever had  
And your leavin hurt the worst it hurt so bad it hurt me bad  
For misery cast its shadow on the moon  
And if I never love again itll be too soon  
I dont wanna see another road than blue  
And if I never love again itll be too soon  
No I dont wanna ever see another road than blue  
And if I never never love again itll be too soon
