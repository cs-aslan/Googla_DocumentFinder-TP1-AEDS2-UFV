Lets turn the lights down soft and low  
And watch the fire embers glow  
Lets lock the world outside the door  
This is the night weve been waiting for  
  
The moon is shining through the window pane  
I hear the echo of a passing train  
Taking someones lover far away  
But in your arms is where I wanna stay  
  
Tonight Im the luckiest man in the world  
Wrapped in the arms of a beautiful girl  
And now that Ive found you  
Im never gonna let you go  
  
Let your hair fall across your breast  
Show me the warmth of your soft caress  
The musics playin soft and slow  
Were driftin into the afterglow  
  
Tonight Im the luckiest man in the world  
Wrapped in the arms of a beautiful girl  
And now that Ive found you  
Im never gonna let you go  
  
Im never gonna let you go  
  
Im never gonna let you go
