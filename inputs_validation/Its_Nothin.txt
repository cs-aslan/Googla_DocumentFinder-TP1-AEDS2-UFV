Count another grip smoke another zip  
Let them young niggas tell it I be on my shit  
Make a hundred k spend it all today  
What can I say my DNA is Givenchy  
What my swag is retarded  
What Im driving Ferrari  
What Im rocking Armani Gianni Versace huh  
Fuck around and Ill buy one of you broke niggas

Smokin weed till my head right

Smokin trees till my head right

My hair longer than your girl  
Go shawty its your world  
Subzero flow when I spit I see snow flurries  
Scarface all out  
All I want in this world  
I mean all I want for lunch is a blunt and your girl  
It aint nothin to me but its somethin to you  
Count money like its somethin to do  
Summer time Im like fuck the roof winter time Im in Lo boots  
And uh its nothin  
I like being high because its a better view  
And I told your ho my chain so cold its on Theraflu  
  
Its nothing its nothing
