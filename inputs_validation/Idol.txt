He was a light star  
Tripping on a high wire  
Bulldog stubborn born uneven  
A classless creature a man for all seasons  
But dont bet them  
They cant take him  
To the very bottom  
Because they made him and theyll waste him  
And I dont believe that I want to watch them  
  
Cause the fifties shifted out of gear  
He was an idol then now hes an idol here  
But his face has changed hes not the same no more  
And I have to say that I like the way his music sounded before  
  
He was tightassed  
Walking on broken glass  
Highly prized in the wallet size  
The number one crush in a schoolgirls eyes  
But dont pretend that it wont end  
In the depth of your despair  
You went from lame suits right down to tennis shoes  
To peanuts from the lions share
