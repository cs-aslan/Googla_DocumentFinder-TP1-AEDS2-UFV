I really cant stay  
But baby its cold outside  
Ive got to go away  
Ahh baby its cold outside  
  
This evening has been  
Been hoping that youd drop in  
So very nice  
Ill hold your hands theyre just like ice  
  
My mother will start to worry  
Beautiful whats your hurry  
My father will be pacing the floor  
Listen to that fireplace roar  
  
So really Id better scurry  
Oh beautiful please dont hurry  
Maybe just a half a drink more  
Why dont you put some records on while I pour  
  
The neighbors might think  
Oh baby its bad out there  
Say whats in this drink  
Theres no cabs to be had out there  
  
I wish I knew how  
Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell  
Ill take your hat your hair looks well  
  
I ought to say no no no sir  
Mind if I move a little closer  
At least therell be oh that I tried  
Whats the sense of hurting my pride  
  
I really cant stay  
Baby dont hold out  
Ahh but its cold outside  
Yeah  
  
I simply must go  
Oh baby its cold outside  
The answer is no  
You know its cold outside  
  
This welcome has been  
Im lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm  
Look out the window at that storm  
  
My sister will be suspicious  
Oh your lips look delicious  
My brother will be there at the door  
Like waves upon a tropical shore  
  
My maiden aunts mind is vicious  
Eww your lips are delicious  
Well maybe just a cigarette more  
Never such a blizzard before  
  
Ive got to go home  
Ahh baby you would freeze out there  
Say lend me a comb  
You know its up to your knees out there  
  
Youve really been grand  
I thrill when you touch my hand  
But dont you see  
How can you do this thing to me  
  
theres bound to be talk tomorrow  
Making my life long sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied  
If you caught pneumonia and died  
  
I really cant stay  
Get over and hold out  
Ahh but its cold outside yeah  
  
Bloody freezin aint it
