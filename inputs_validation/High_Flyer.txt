Here we go another twenty four hours  
Every one of them away from you  
Im laughing when I ought to be crying  
Baby tell me are you crying too  
You see a room in a fivestar hotel  
It never really meant much to me  
Who needs a bottle of 57  
When the water back home is free  
  
Im just a flyer getting higher  
Yeah Im getting higher a high flyer  
  
Ive got no time on the highway  
And too much time on the road  
Ive got no time on the highway  
On the highway  
  
Here we go another twenty four hours  
Making money for the GPO  
When we oughtta be taking it easy  
Were getting ready for another show  
And every day when youre all asleeping  
And in the night you see the sun  
Im just a face in a crowd of people  
Who want to tell me Im the only one  
  
Im just a flyer getting higher  
Yeah Im getting higher a high flyer  
  
But do I do I do I need to  
Im getting down when Ive gotta get back to you  
But do I do I do I want to  
Im getting down when Ive gotta get back to you  
  
Im just a flyer getting higher  
Yeah Im getting higher a high flyer
