This is a song written exclusively for me  
Something to warm me on a lonely Winters night  
And if I want to think someones thinking of me  
I look into my song see who I can see  
  
My pace is curlin hurlin now from key to key  
Written through the gloom  
Of a lonely empty room  
All the lines start to unlock my mind and I feel free  
The Winters night gives way to a warm Summers day yeah yeah  
  
The lights turned off but theres nobody to turn on  
And theres no happiness in having to undress  
I put such thoughts aside and listen to my song  
Now it makes things better  
My song does the rest yeah  
  
This is a song written exclusively for me  
Something to warm me on a lonely winters night  
And if I want to think of someones thinking of me  
I look into my song and see who I can see
