Nononono Im not bitter Im not mad  
Well maybe just a little just a tad  
I know every apple here aint bad  
But I found a worm in every single one I had  
Boys theyre only good for fruit I mean bananas  
Boys them boys are nuts theyre drivin me bananas

If you hate em boys shake it  
  
We would all be happy all be glad  
If sweet mama nature never had  
Aall this dirty little boys who think that the girls  
Are only made for toys  
Boys wants them women though they barely can remember  
Then again all men are dogs

Inflated egos  
Little dicks
