People making lists  
Buying special gifts  
Taking time to be kind  
To one and all  
Its that time of year  
When good friends  
Are dear  
And you wish you  
Could give more  
Than just presents  
From a store  
  
Why dont you give love  
On Christmas day  
On Christmas day  
Oh even the man  
Who has everything  
Would be so happy  
If you would bring  
Him love  
On Christmas day  
On Christmas day  
No greater gift  
Is there than love  
  
People you dont know  
Smiling out hello  
Everywhere theres an air  
Of Christmas joy  
Its that once a year  
When the worlds sincere  
And youd like  
To find a way  
To show the things  
That words cant say  
  
Why dont you give love  
On Christmas day  
On Christmas day  
Oh the man on the street  
And the couple upstairs  
All need to know  
That someone who cares  
Give love  
On Christmas day  
Christmas day  
No greater gift  
Is there than love  
What the world  
Needs is love  
Yes the world  
Needs your love  
  
Why dont you give love  
On Christmas day  
On Christmas Day  
Oh every little child  
On Santas knee  
Has room for your love  
Underneath his tree  
Give love  
On Christmas day  
Christmas day  
No greater gift  
Is there than love  
What the world  
Needs is love  
Yes the world  
Needs your love  
  
Give love  
On Christmas day  
Christmas day
