We been runnin away from  
Somethin we both know  
Weve long run out of things to say  
And I think I better go  
  
So dont be getting excited  
When you hear that slammin door  
Cause therell be one less set of footsteps  
On your floor in the mornin  
  
And weve been hidin from somethin  
That should have never gone this far  
But after all its what weve done  
That makes us what we are  
  
And you been talkin in silence  
If its silence you adore  
Oh therell be one less set of footsteps  
On your floor in the mornin  
  
Chorus  
Well therell be one less set of footsteps on your floor  
One less man to walk in  
One less pair of jeans upon your door  
One less voice atalkin  
  
But tomorrows a dream away  
Today has turned to dust  
Your silver tongue has turned to clay  
And your golden rule to rust  
If thats the way that you want it  
Thats the way I want it more  
Therell be one less set of footsteps  
On your floor in the mornin  
  
Chorus  
  
Therell be one less set of footsteps  
On your floor in the mornin
