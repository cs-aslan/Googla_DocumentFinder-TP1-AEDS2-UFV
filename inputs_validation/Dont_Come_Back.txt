You walk out your front door  
And say that you found love   
Thats how the best things start  
Thats for sure  
You ought to know that aint around anymore  
Thats where youre at  
Im at baby  
cause that just doesnt pay  
Now steal your stolen car  ride it on  
Oh you seem to think its cool  
That they stay out all night   
I only want to know where youve been  
So lets get back today  
So go down child  
To a rocknroll show alright  
You seem to think its cool  
To stay out all night
