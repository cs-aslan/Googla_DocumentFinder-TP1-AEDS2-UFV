Im sittin here all alone and I am thinking  startin out in the rain I
felt it pourin on the window pane  
  
I saw your face and I look and wait to see if youre lookin back at me I
swear it hit me like I want to be like I want to be with you girl  
  
Ive been running and running around been looking for you but theres no one
around  
I tried so hard to find you youve been blowing my mind coz I want you girl  
  
I returned to the place where I saw you sittin out in the rain Im wet I
felt it rollin down my face  
  
I felt the pain that I took coz Im wanting you bad girl if you only knew  
I wish I know just what to do you know Im dying just to have you  
  
Bridge  
Ive been longing Ive been longing for a girl like you I want to find you
I want to love you  
I really want to be with you
