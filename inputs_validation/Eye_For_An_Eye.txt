Even now in heaven  
There were angels carrying savage weapons  
  
An eye for an eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth for a tooth  
  
Run run run  
But you sure cant hide hide hide  
  
An eye for an eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth for a tooth  
  
Run run run  
But you sure cant hide hide hide  
  
Is that room been fit to earth  
Doesnt help the to grow sunshine  
Is this darkness all youll take  
Have youd passed through this life  
  
Run run run but you sure cant hide hide hide  
  
Where youre going youre not coming back from  
  
Run run run but you sure cant hide hide hide  
  
An eye for an eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth for a tooth  
Run run run  
But you sure cant hide hide hide  
  
An eye for an eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth for a tooth  
Run run run  
But you sure cant hide hide hide  
  
This grain evil  
Where is it come from  
Had it still the end of the world  
Whos doing this  
Whos killed us  
Marking us with the sign of the holy mighty man  
  
Run run run run run  
Run run run run run  
  
An eye for an eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth for a tooth  
Run run run but you sure cant hide hide hide  
  
An eye for an eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth for a tooth  
Run run run  
But you sure cant hide hide hide  
  
An eye for an eye  
Are you righteous  
A tooth for a tooth  
Kind  
Run run run but you sure cant hide  
Do you come for   
An eye for an eye  
Are you loved by heart  
A tooth for a tooth  
Do you imagine your suffers will be last  
Run run run but you sure cant hide  
Because you loved to be truth  
An eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth  
Run run run but you sure cant hide  
Run run run but you sure cant hide hidehide  
  
What are you to me
