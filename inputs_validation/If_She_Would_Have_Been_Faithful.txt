I was thinking about her visiting the past  
Reconstructing details with old photographs  
I was studying the faces with an objective point of view  
Suddenly remembering doesnt haunt me  
Ill follow the sun  
And now the time has come and so my love I must go  
And though I lose a friend in the end you will know oh  
One day youll find that I have gone  
But tomorrow might rain so Ill follow the sun  
All the time you couldnt tell me that one day Id be glad  
That something that I thought was love was misinterpreted  
  
But they were doing me a favor a blessing in disguise  
If she wouldve been faithful if she could have been true  
Then I wouldve been cheated I would never know real love  
I wouldve missed out on you  
I watch you sleeping your body touching me  
Theres no doubt about it this is where I want to be  
You know its so ironic I had to lose to win  
I want to thank her if she wouldve been faithful  
If she could have been true  
Then I wouldve been cheated I would never know real love  
I wouldve missed out on you  
Its a paradox full of contradiction how I got from there to here  
It defies a logical explanation  
If she wouldve been faithful if she could have been true  
Then I wouldve been cheated I would never know real love  
I wouldve missed out on you  
If she wouldve been faithful if she could have been true  
Then I wouldve been cheated I would never know real love  
I wouldve missed out on you
