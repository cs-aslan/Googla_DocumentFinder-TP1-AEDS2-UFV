He showed me there was more to me  
When I thought I had nothing else to give  
God knows he wasnt perfect  
Ah but then again nobody is  
He always told me the truth  
No matter how hard it was to hear  
When he said I believe in you  
It was music to my ears  
Oh each words like a note like a beautiful tune  
The kind that inspires and helps me get through  
Ah if I said I cant hes say You can  
He was my toughest critic ah my biggest fan  
Now hes gone to a distant shore  
And I cant hear the music anymore  
Sometimes late at night  
I forget that hes not lyin next to me  
He may be out of sight  
But out of mine is something he wont ever be  
Things that he said to me  
Are still ringing out loud and clear  
When he said I love you baby  
That was music to my ears  
Oh each words like a note like a beautiful tune  
The kind that inspires and helps me get through  
Ah if I said I cant hes say You can  
He was my toughest critic ah my biggest fan  
Now hes gone to a distant shore  
And I cant hear the music anymore  
I cant hear the music
