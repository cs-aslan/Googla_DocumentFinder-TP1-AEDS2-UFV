the perils of rock n roll decadence  
  
I know this chick she lives down on Melrose  
She aint satisfied without some pain  
Friday night is goin up inside heragain  
Well crack the whip  
Cause that bitch is just insane  
Im serious  
  
Shes pretty tied up hangin upside down  
Shes pretty tied up an you can ride her  
Shes pretty tied up hangin upside down  
I cant tell you shes the right one  
Oh no oh no oh no  
  
Once there was this rock n roll band  
Rollin on the streets  
Time went by and it became a joke  
We just needed more and more fulfilling uhhuh  
Time went by and it all went up in smoke  
But check it out  
  
Shes pretty tied up hangin upside down  
Shes pretty tied up an you can ride her  
Shes pretty tied up hangin upside down  
Ohh I cant tell you shes the right one  
Oh no oh no oh no  
  
Once you made that money it costs more now  
It might cost a lot more than youd think  
I just found a million dollars  
that someone forgot  
Its days like this that push me oer the brinks  
Cool and stressing  
pronounced cool ranch dresing  
  
Shes pretty tied up hangin upside down  
Shes pretty tied up an you can ride her  
Shes pretty tied up hangin upside down  
And I cant tell you shes the right one  
Oh shes the right one etc  
  
but I can tell you a thing or two  
bout somethin else  
If you really want to knowknow what Im sayin
