Are Sambora  
  
When I look at you  
Youre beautiful  
There comes a time in someones life  
When you find things that matter  
And every time we touch  
The love runs deep  
We realize its our to keep  
And thats all that really matters  
Youll always be my sweet addiction  
In this life my saving grace  
Youre all that really matters  
You know its true  
Aint no me without you  
When youre in the dark  
Baby dont despair  
Im just a spark away  
I will be there  
And thats all that matters  
Youll always be my sweet addiction  
In this life my saving grace  
Youre all that really matters  
You know its true  
Aint no me without you  
Well share our lives together  
Yes our flame burns on forever  
And at the final curtain call  
We can say we did it all  
Solo  
Youll always be my sweet addiction  
In this life my saving grace  
Youre all that really matters  
You know its true  
Aint no me without you  
And when we turns to dust  
And we fly away  
Therell be a light stil burning bright  
And thats all that really matters
