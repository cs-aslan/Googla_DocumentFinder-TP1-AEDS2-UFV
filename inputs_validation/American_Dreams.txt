I used to see you on every tv  
Your smiling face looked back at me  
I used to see you on every tv  
Your smiling face looked back at me  
  
Then they caught you with the girl next door  
Peoples money piled on the floor  
Accusations that you try to deny  
Revelations and rumours begin to fly  
  
Now you think about reaching out  
Try to get some help from above  
Now you think about reaching out  
Try to get some help from above  
  
Reporters crowd around your house  
Going through your garbage like a pack of hounds  
Speculating what they may find out  
It dont matter now youre all washed up  
  
You wake up in the middle of the night  
Your sheets are wet and your face is white  
You tried to make a good thing last  
How could something so good go bad so fast  
  
American dream American dream  
American dream American dream  
  
Dont know when things went wrong  
Might have been when you were young and strong X 2
