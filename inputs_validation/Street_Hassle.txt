Waltzing Matilda whipped out her wallet  
The sexy boy smiled in dismay  
She took out four twenties cause she liked round figures  
Everybodys a queen for a day  
Oh babe Im on fire and you know how I admire your  
Body why dont we slip away  
Although Im sure youre certain its a rarity me flirtin  
Shalalala this way  
  
Oh shalalalala shalalalala  
Hey baby come on lets slip away  
  
Luscious and gorgeous oh what a hunk of muscle  
Call out the national guard  
She creamed in her jeans as he picked up her means  
From off of the formica topped bar  
And cascading slowly he lifted her wholly  
And boldly out of this world  
And despite peoples derision  
Proved to be more than diversion  
Shalalala later on  
  
And then shalalalala he entered her slowly  
And showed her where he was coming from  
And then shalalalala he made love to her gently  
It was like shed never ever come  
And then shalalalala shalalalala  
When the sun rose and he made to leave  
You know shalalalala shalalalala  
Neither one regretted a thing  
  
Street hassle  
Hey that cunts not breathing  
I think shes had too much  
Of something or other hey man you know what I mean  
I dont mean to scare you  
But youre the one who came here  
And youre the one whos gotta take her when you leave  
Im not being smart  
Or trying to be cold on my part  
And Im not gonna wear my heart on my sleeve  
But you know people get all emotional  
And sometimes man they just dont act rational  
They think theyre just on TV  
  
Shalalala man  
Why dont you just slip
