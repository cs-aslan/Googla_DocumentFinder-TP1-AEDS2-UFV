Ill be your dream Ill be your wish Ill be your fantasy  
Ill be your hope Ill be your love be everything that you need  
I love you more with every breath truly madly deeply do  
I will be strong I will be faithful cause Im counting on a new beginning  
A reason for living A deeper meaning  
  
I want to stand with you on a mountain  
I want to bathe with you in the sea  
I want to lay like this forever  
Until the sky falls down on me  
  
And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky  
Ill make a wish send it to heaven then make you want to cry  
The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty  
That were surrounded by the comfort and protection of  
The highest power in lonely hours the tears devour you  
  
I want to stand with you on a mountain  
I want to bathe with you in the sea  
I want to lay like this forever  
Until the sky falls down on me  
  
Oh can you see it baby  
You dont have to close your eyes  
Cause its standing right before you  
All that you need will surely come  
  
Ill be your dream Ill be your wish Ill be your fantasy  
Ill be your hope Ill be your love be everything that you need  
Ill love you more with every breath truly madly deeply do  
  
I want to stand with you on a mountain  
I want to bathe with you in the sea  
I want to lay like this forever  
Until the sky falls down on me  
  
I want to stand with you on a mountain  
I want to bathe with you in the sea  
I want to live like this forever  
Until the sky falls down on me
