The sky has fallen on my yesterday  
I watch my moon and blue sun  slip away  
Everybodys asking questions  
Everybodys wanting more  
Every time I catch myself I fall  
  
And its why you ask me  
And its why i dont know  
And i try to pull myself togehter  
I dont want to go home   
  
The little girl has lost her way today  
The tables turning on the game she plays  
Everybodys asking questions  
Everybodys wanting more  
Every time I catch myself I fall  
  
And its why you ask me  
And its why I dont know  
And I try to pull myself together  
I dont want to go home  
  
Every time I catch myself I fall  
  
And its why you ask me  
And its why I dont know  
And I try to pull myself together  
I dont want to go home  
  
And its why you ask me  
And its why I dont know  
And I try to pull myself together  
I dont want to go home  
  
Every time I catch myself I slip away fall
