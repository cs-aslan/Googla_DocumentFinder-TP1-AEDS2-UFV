Cant run fast enough  
Cant hide I cant fly  
Im struggling with the limits of this ordinary life  
  
Im just a  
Just a  
Just a first try  
  
Cant hear what you say  
Cant see by the light  
Im struggling with the limits of this ordinary life  
  
Im just a  
Just a  
Just a first try  
  
Cant say what I mean  
Cant love from the heart  
Cant trust in the mercy and the goodness in the world  
Cant learn to accept that its alright  
To struggle with the limits of this ordinary life  
  
Cant be  
Just a  
Just a first try  
Cant be  
Just a  
Just a first try  
Just a  
Just a  
Just a first try
