Baby can we kick it tonight  
Maybe if you let a playa hit tonight  
I may say  
If lickin it right  
You crazy  
I aint wit it tonight  
But if your kitten is tight  
I just might baby

Six months later when we going strong  
Who would have thought weakened baby girl clickin like a metronon  
Now I was wrong when I said I was gon hit it and quit it  
cause baby girl got me fiendin and I got to admit it  
You think I mean it  
I love the way she do her thang  
Keep me comin back to her like a boomerang  
She blew my brain lookin at me evil eyes gleamin  
Shes a I see love demon that be drinkin my semen  
And its a to fight say we inceprable  
She nothin nice and I refuse to let it go  
She quick to loc up the daily green bud smoker  
Deep throater never toker taste like mocha  
A little vicious mairtricious five foot six  
But Ima ruggish hoodlum so we a good mix  
I dont need no plantless little angel in my world  
You got to be a little scandless to be daddys girl  
With that cinnamon skin that only guys create  
My mom ethatuated by a lie  
They say Im down with massagining  
But I cant deny I love my mahogony
