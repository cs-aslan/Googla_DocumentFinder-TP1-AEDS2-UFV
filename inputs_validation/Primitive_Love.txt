Primitive love I want what it used to be  
Primitive love no more in love its all a hustle  
Whats done is done now its my turn to have some fun  
Youre much too sly dont give me alibis  
I dont wanna know I dont want to know  
Primitive love  
I want what it used to be I want it  
Primitive love primitive love  
I want what it used to be  
I want what it used to be  
Primitive love I want I need primitive love  
Dont have to arrange I dont want your money  
I dont have to think right now youve got me at the brink  
This is goodbye for all the times I cried  
Dont want no more dont want no more  
Primitive love  
I want what it used to be I want it  
Primitive love primitive love  
I want what it used to be  
I want what it used to be  
Primitive love I want I need primitive love  
Is it right or is it wrong  
Primitive drums call me backward into stone  
Pack up and leave Im not yours to deceive  
Dont want you no more dont want you no more  
Primitive love  
I want what it used to be I want it  
Primitive love primitive love  
I want what it used to be  
I want what it used to be  
Primitive love I want I need primitive love  
Primitive love primitive love primitive love
