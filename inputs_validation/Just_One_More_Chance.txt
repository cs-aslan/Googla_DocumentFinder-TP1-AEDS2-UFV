Just one more chance  
To prove its you alone I care for  
Each night I say a little prayer for  
Just one more chance  
Just one more night  
To taste the kisses that enchant me  
Id want no others if youd grant me  
Just one more chance  
Ive learned the meaning of repentance  
Now youre the jury at my trial  
I know that I should serve my sentence  
Still Ill hoping all the while  
Youll give me  
Just one more word  
I said that I was glad to start out  
But now Im back to cry my heart out  
For just one more chance  
Ive learned the meaning of repentance  
Now youre the jury at my trial  
I know that I should serve my sentence  
Still Ill hoping all the while  
Youll give me  
Just one more word  
I said that I was glad to start out  
But now Im back to cry my heart out  
For just one more chance
