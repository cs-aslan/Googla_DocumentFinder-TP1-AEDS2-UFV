Morning this morning the curtains are shut  
Ill ring you in the morning but the phones been cut  
Can you hear me Ive been calling all day  
Can you hear me  
  
The radio reporter said the lines all dead  
He told me that I oughta write a letter instead  
Can you hear Ive been calling all day  
Can you hear me  
  
Chorus  
Id wish theyd fix the wires cause my baby wont know  
That Im leaving in the morning and Im ready to go  
Can you hear me  
Can you hear me at all  
Gotta get the operator make a telephone call  
  
And if I write a letter it wont get there on time  
Ill only reach you baby on the telephone line  
Can you hear me  
Ive been calling all day  
Can you hear me  
My cars already and my bags are all packed  
Im late already and I wont be back  
Can you hear me  
Ive been calling all day  
Can you hear me  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh can you hear me
