Ring ring goes your telephone  
You act like you aint at home  
You shut me out but it turns me on  
Red lipstick black dresses  
A look that I should not mess with  
It makes us boys go crazy for you  
  
So fascinated  
Im anticipating the touch  
That may never come  
  
Chorus  
In the rain  
In the sun  
Everybody needs someone  
They can dream of all night long  
All the pain  
And the ways  
That youre driving me insane  
Its no mystery why youre ruling me  
  
We first met in the lunch room  
My ocular nerve went pop zoom  
I never observed such a beautiful face  
Sweet lady dont play me  
If I am a knob dont fade me  
You cant win the game if you pass the ace  
  
Im so frustrated  
This loves belated methinks  
Lets get it to go  
  
Chorus  
  
Im not kidding anymore  
This love hurts thats for sure  
I feel you I see you  
I need you  
  
Chorus  
  
Its no mystery why youre ruling me
