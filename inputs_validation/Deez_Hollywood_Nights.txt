Chorus x2  
Those Hollywood nights  
They drive me crazy  
Those Hollywood nights  
They drive me crazy  
  
Snoop Dogg  
Huh its like that that there  
They love it when I let down my hair  
From Jessica Alba to Jessica Simpson  
Even Jessica Biel wanna know how I feel  
So I let em all come to my back table  
Roll up and lick the paper if they able  
Bottles of everything models and everything  
Everything goes and yes I mean everything  
Cocaine castles I aint sniffin  
But baby that plate in that one movie is trippin  
So I invite her over to my party  
Blonde hair long legs a real live Barbie  
No autographs I aint signin now  
Act like you been around a boss bitch settle down  
My life is like one big highlight  
Welcome to the motherfuckin Hollywood night life  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Snoop Dogg  
Every night Im in the limo Excursion  
With some whites some asians and persians  
They flirtin and Im certain they suckin  
One night with the Dogg and its curtains  
She say she wanna be an actress  
So I pointed to these nuts and then I yelled action  
Take one take two now cut  
Now turn around and let the homie Damani fuck  
Huh yeah here we go again  
I gotta go behind the club just to get in  
They say Im just too much commotion  
All the yellin and screamin and pushin oh yes I got em open  
Im in the back of the club gettin a backrub  
Smokin with one of the Marleys One Love  
Im higher than gas refusin to pass  
Hollywood Night School my nigga join my class cmon  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Snoop Dogg  
Meet me at the Roosevelt bass cabana room  
Im on Sunset where you at at The House of Blues  
I just stepped in for a quick cameo  
Me and Leonardo DiCaprio  
He keep a bad hoe I keep a bad hoe  
He slide me new hoes everywhere we go  
Oh the life night after night flight after flight  
Yes these Hollywood nights  
Will have a nigga burnt out some hoes turned out  
You know its pimpin when you see the Dogg permed out  
Cameras flashin police passin  
Every little model wanna give me some action  
So I let em kick it then I let em lick it  
Get some menage durin every visit  
I wouldnt leave it even if they paid me  
The LB raised me and Hollywood is crazy
