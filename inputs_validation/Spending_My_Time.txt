Whats the time  
Seems its already morning  
I see the sky its so beautiful and blue  
The TVs on  
But the only thing showing is a picture of you  
  
Oh I get up and make myself some coffee  
I try to read a bit but the storys too thin  
Then I thank the Lord above  
That youre not there to see me  
In this shape Im in  
  
Spending my time  
Watching the days go by  
Feeling so small  
I stare at the wall  
Hoping that you think of me too  
Im spending my time  
  
I try to call but I dont know what to tell you  
I leave a kiss on your answering machine  
Oh help me please  
Is there someone who can make me  
Wake up from this dream  
  
Spending my time  
Watching the days go by  
Feeling so small  
I stare at the wall  
Hoping that you are missing me too  
  
Im spending my time  
Watching the sun go down  
I fall asleep to the sound  
Of tears of a clown  
A prayer gone blind  
  
Im spending my time  
  
My friends keep telling me  
Hey life will go on  
Time will make sure will get over you  
This silly game of love you play you win only to lose  
  
Spending my time  
Watching the days go by  
Feeling so small  
I stare at the wall  
Hoping that you are missing me too  
  
Im spending my time  
Watching the sun go down  
I fall asleep to the sound  
Of tears of a clown  
A prayer gone blind  
Im spending my time
