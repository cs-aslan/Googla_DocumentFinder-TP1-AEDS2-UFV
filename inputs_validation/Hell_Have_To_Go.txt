Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone  
Lets pretend that were together all alone  
Ill tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low  
And you can tell your friend there with you hell have to go  
  
Whisper to me tell me do you love me true  
Or is he holding you the way I do  
Though love is blind make up your mind Ive got to know  
Should I hang up or will you tell him hell have to go  
  
You cant say the words I want to hear  
While youre with another man  
If you want me answer yes or no  
Darling I will understand  
  
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone  
Lets pretend that were together all alone  
Ill tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low  
And you can tell your friend there with you hell have to go
