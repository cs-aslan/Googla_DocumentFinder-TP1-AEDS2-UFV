When I was a little girl I had a ragdoll  
The only doll Ive ever owned  
Now I love you just the way I love that ragdoll  
But only now the love has grown  
  
And it gets stronger everyway  
And It gets deeper let me say  
And It gets higher day by day  
corus  
Ah do I love you my oh my  
River deep  Mountain High  
Yeah Yeah Yeah  
And If I lost you would I cry  
Oh Baby  
Baby Baby Baby  
  
When you where a young boy did you have a puppy  
That always followed you around  
Well Im gonna be as faithful as that puppy  
No Ill never let you down  
And it goes on and on like a river flows  
And it gets sweeter heaven knows  
And it gets sweeter baby as it grows  
  
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring  
And I love you baby like a robin loves to sing  
Oh I love you baby like a school boy loves his pie  
Oh I love you honey rivers deep mountains high  
  
corus
