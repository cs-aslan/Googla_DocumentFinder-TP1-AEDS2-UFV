But over in a land thats in my back yard  
Theres a people who succeed they dont try hard  
  
Well they found a way to live with ease  
By eating from the bush instead of the trees  
  
Apple bush apple tree  
Path to eternity  
Find you a path and you follow the call  
  
Apple bush apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Cut you a path with a chance you may fall  
  
Well over in a corner standing there  
Telling my house that they havent a single care  
  
But my house does not listen worry its got a path of its own  
Yet the bush and a tree never leave it alone  
  
Apple Bush apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Find you a path and you buy with a call  
  
Apple bush apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Cut you a path with a chance you may fall  
  
Someday like my house youre going to chose too  
If you cut this new path well the old one will do  
and you live with the people who live with ease  
The red apple bush the blue apple tree
