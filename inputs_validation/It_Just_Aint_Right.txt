Damn its been  
Something  
Like three years since we came to amends  
Goodness I  
  
Didnt realize  
Its been that long  
But anyways  
So good to  
  
Hear that you  
Moved on and found somebody new  
So have I  
Still baby  
Something is wrong  
  
You dont have  
To answer this  
If its too personal  
Dont worry bout it  
  
Do your thoughts  
Of me ever  
Become sexual  
Do I ever cross your mind  
  
Ever reminisce of us  
On the bathroom floor  
Or the counter maybe in the tub or even on the sink  
cause lately whats been happening  
  
Is When Im with my girl I call your name  
And it just aint right  
That Ill be sexin her and I I call your name  
And it just aint right  
  
Girl it aint no little thing that I I call your name  
And it just aint right  
Do you ever do the same cause I I call your name  
And it just aint right  
  
Needless to  
Say to you  
Me and my girl are almost through  
Seems that she  
  
Thinks that Im not over us  
Thats crazy aint it  
But anyway  
Just called to see  
  
If you was experiencin the same as me  
Cause if so  
We got some things to discuss  
  
You dont have  
To answer this  
If its too personal  
If its too personal  
  
Do your thoughts  
Of me ever  
Become sexual  
Do I ever  
  
Ever reminisce of us  
On the bathroom floor  
Or the counter maybe in the tub or even on the sink  
Cause lately whats been happening  
  
And When Im with my girl I call your name  
And it just aint right  
That Ill be sexin her and I I call your name  
And it just aint right

And it just aint right  
Do you ever do the same I call your name
