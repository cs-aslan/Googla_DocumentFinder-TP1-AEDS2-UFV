Ive got this phosphorescent portrait of gentle Jesus meek and mild  
Ive got this harlot that Im stuck with carrying another mans child  
The solitary star announcing vacancy burnt out as we arrived  
Theyd throw us back across the border if they knew that we survived  
  
And they were surprised to see us  
So they greeted us with palms  
They asked for ammunition acts of contrition and small alms  
I might recite a small prayer  
  
If I ever said them  
I lay down on an iron frame  
Found myself in bedlam  
I wish that I could take something for drowning out the noise  
  
Wailing echoes down the corridors  
Ive got this imaginary radio and Im punching up the dial  
Ive got the AC trained on the TV so it wont blow up in my eye  
And everything that I thought fanciful and mocked as too extreme  
  
Must be family entertainment here in the strange land of my dreams  
Now Im practicing my likeness of St Francis of Assisi  
For if I hold my hand outstretched  
A little bird comes to me  
  
I might recite a small prayer  
If I ever said them  
I lay down on an iron frame  
Found myself in bedlam  
  
Escaping from the fingers that were stretching through the bars  
Wailing echoes down the corridors  
The player piano picks out Life Goes On  
Ring tone rang out Jerusalem  
  
And in this pit of sadness  
Where the rank of wretched plunge  
Weve buried all the innocents  
Now we must bury revenge  
  
Theyve got this scared and decorated girl strapped to the steel trunk of a
mustang  
And then they drove her down a cypress grove where traitors hang and stars
still spangle  
They dangled flags and other rags along a colored thread of twine  
And then they dragged that bruised and purple heart along the road to
Palestine  
  
Someone went off muttering he mentioned thirty pieces  
Easter saw a slaughtering each wrapped in bloodstained fleeces  
Then my thoughts returned to vengeance but I put up no resistance  
Though I seemed a long way from my home  
  
It really was no distance  
And I might recite a small prayer  
If I ever said them  
I lay down on an iron frame  
  
Found myself in bedlam  
Bowing like an actor acknowledging applause  
Playing the Crusader who was conquering the Moors  
And he knew the consequences but he wont accept the cause  
Wailing echoes down the corridors
