verse  
do you make the most of your five senses  
Or is your life like Old Mother Hubbards shelf  
Well mark this on your slate  
Life is not an empty plate  
Thats if you appreciate yourself  
refrain  
Evry time youre near a rose  
Arent you glad youve got a nose  
And if the dawn is fresh with dew  
Arent you glad youre you  
When a meadowlark appears  
Arent you glad youve got two ears  
And if your heart is singing too  
Arent you glad youre you  
You can see a summer sky  
Or touch a friendly hand  
Or taste an apple pie  
Pardon the grammar but aint life grand  
And when you wake up each morn  
Arent you glad that you were born  
Think what youve got the whole day through  
Arent you glad youre you
