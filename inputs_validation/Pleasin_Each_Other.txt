You remind me you remind me  
That its a trick to know you  
I dont even know  
How I fel in love with you  
Was it your eyes or was it your clothes  
Was the way you greeted me when the sun rolls the sun rolls  
I was lonely when I first called you  
We were kids just foolin with lovin  
You took me in and you didnt even know me or my games  
Chorus 3 times I was out on the road acting a lady  
I was with him for one night for some love and a song  
Then you came along you dont care about money  
You dont care about time  
And ourlove just keeps rolling rolling along  
Say hey dont you worry  
Cause we can get along  
If were pleasin each other  
Pleasineach other pleasin each other  
Cant be wrong
