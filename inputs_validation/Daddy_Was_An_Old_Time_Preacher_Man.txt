Dolly Parton  
Daddy was an old time preacher man  
He preacher the word of God throughout the land  
He preached so plain a child could understand  
Yes Daddy was an old time preacher man  
He told the people of he need to pray  
He talked about Gods wrath and judgement day  
He preached about the great eternity  
He preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat  
Yes Daddy was an old time preacher man  
Aunt Leanona would get up to testify  
And wed sing In The Sweet By And By  
The wed sing Im On My Way To Canaan Land  
Yes Daddy was an old time preacher man  
Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks  
Folks came from all around to hear him preach  
Daddy said if one is saved its worth it all  
But the aisles were always filled at altar calls  
Yes Daddy was an old time preacher man  
Daddy worked for God but asked for no pay  
For he believed that God provides a way  
We never had a lot but we got by  
Guess its cause the Lord was on Daddys side  
Yes Daddy was an old time preacher man
