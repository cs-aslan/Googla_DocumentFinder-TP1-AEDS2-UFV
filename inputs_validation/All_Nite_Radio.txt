So youve run outa numbers  
And youve run outa lovers  
They wont deliver that pizza  
  
Youre hungry under the covers  
Youre all alone in the moonlight  
Got to get ready for daylight  
  
All night all night  
Listening to the all night radio  
  
You could have been sleepin  
You could have done anythin  
But everbodys singin  
Good morin  
  
All night all night  
Listening to the all night  
All night radio
