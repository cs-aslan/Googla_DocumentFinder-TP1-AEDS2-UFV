Well I ride on a mailtrain baby cant buy a thrill  
Well Ive been up all night baby leanin on the window sill  
Well if I die on top of the hill  
And if I dont make it you know my baby will  
Dont the moon look good mama shinin through the trees  
Dont the brakeman look good mama flagging down the Double E  
Dont the sun look good goin down over the sea  
Dont my gal look fine when shes comin after me  
Now the wintertime is coming the windows are filled with frost  
I want to tell everybody but I could not get across  
Well I wanna be your lover baby I dont wanna be your boss  
Dont say I never warned you when your train gets lost
