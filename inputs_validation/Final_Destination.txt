I escaped my final moment  
But its turning back at me  
On every corner I can feel it waiting  
Just a moment no awareness  
I could easily slip away  
And then Ill be gone forever  
  
Im searching  
Im fighting for a way to get through  
To turn it away  
  
Its waiting always trying  
I feel the hands of fate theyre suffocating  
Tell me whats the reason  
Is it all inside my head  
Cant take it no more  
  
All around me I see danger  
And its closing in on me  
Every second I can hear it breathing  
I cant stand the fear inside me  
Cause its leading me astray  
And it will be my ending  
  
Im searching  
Im fighting for a way to get through  
To turn it away  
  
Its waiting always trying  
I feel the hands of fate theyre suffocating  
Tell me whats the reason  
Is it all inside my head  
Cant take it no more  
  
But no one faced whats coming my way  
And I will let my fear fade away  
Whatever may be Ill have to find out  
  
Its waiting always trying  
I feel the hands of fate theyre suffocating  
Tell me whats the reason  
Is it all inside my head  
Cant take it no more
