I dont care if the rain dont shine  
Oh I dont care if the sun dont fall  
You are the one in a million child  
And you knew that I would call  
Thoughts of you alone with me  
I cant slow them down  
But I cant sleep at night  
Because youre not around  
I cant wait  
Seven days is a long time  
To be waiting for you girl  
I cant wait  
Seven days is just too long  
To be without you girl  
Ive tried every kind of distraction  
But nothing will ease this pain  
There is only one solution girl  
So why do you make me wait  
Got to say I didnt think  
That I could read your mind  
But I cant sleep at night  
cause baby youre on mine  
I cant wait  
Seven days is a long time  
Oh I miss you girl  
I cant wait  
Seven days is just too long  
I cant wait  
Seven days is a long time  
To be without you  
I cant wait  
Seven days is just too long  
Just too long
