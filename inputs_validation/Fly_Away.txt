Dont be afraid to fly  
Spread your wings  
Open up the door  
So much more outside  
  
Dont be afraid to fly  
Come spread your wings  
And just fly  
Fly fly just fly just fly  
Dont be afraid  
Dont let your spirit die  
She said  
  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
  
Dont be afraid to fly  
Dont be afraid to just fly  
You youve become a butterfly  
Dont be afraid to just fly
