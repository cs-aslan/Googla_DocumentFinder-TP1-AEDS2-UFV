with Pearl Bailey  
  
Hey Pearl whats bugging you girl  
Too much knowledge Frank too much knowledge  
Explain it to me  
Well it was down at school at the age of six  
One of the real quiz kids  
Yeah  so did reason and lightning touch  
Usual thought  
As time went on I studied lots of oh the other things  
Uh huh like a  
No most of them didnt hurt much  
Well Ive had other teachers  
Well I got my diploma I was real real smart  
In a pretty frame huh  
Of my knowledge there was no doubt  
Thats pretty obvious  
Yeah but lately Ive had the same like in your words too  
It wasnt even a thought let me tell you what I found out now  
Look at the size of my ears pour it on  
You know it started with a man  
Uh huh  
And the man he was grand  
Aint that the truth  
He had a lie that would make a bird sing  
This kid really came on I can see that  
Cause you were much too smart to be afraid at the start  
Frank a little learnin is a dangerous thing  
Well Id like to hear some more  
First he only wanted two  
To  
Then he changed it to few  
Oh you mean loot  
I even loaned that man my watch and my ring  
Oh you lost your head Pearl completely  
Cause you were hip to the fact that he would pay you right back  
Yep a little learning is a dangerous thing  
Uh huh Yes with his sweetheart his so discreet heart  
Oh Frank he had me doing things that I shouldnt do  
That cad aint no denying so sense in trying  
Let me tell you it is just as bad My educations been like some book  
Bet you had an encyclopedia  
Yet now I know the score at last
