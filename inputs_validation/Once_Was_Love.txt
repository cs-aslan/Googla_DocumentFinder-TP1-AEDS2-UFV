Dont delay something tells me I gotta go away  
Maybe its the way we always stay when our hearts have gone  
We cant hold us anymore no weve got to fold  
Down to the floor yes I know its cold but baby our hearts have gone  
  
Just because there once was love  
Dont mean a thing dont mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
Dont mean a thing dont mean a thing  
  
Just because there once was love  
Dont mean a thing dont mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
  
I gotta see if Im filled up when its only me  
Its not your fault but you just cant be here  
Now that my heart has gone now that my heart has gone  
Now that my heart has gone  
  
Just because there once was love  
Dont mean a thing dont mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
Dont mean a thing dont mean a thing  
  
Just because there once was love  
Dont mean a thing dont mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
  
Everyone is hurting now and everything is burning down  
But I can build back my new town today  
  
Just because there once was love  
Dont mean a thing dont mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
Dont mean a thing dont mean a thing  
  
Just because there once was love  
Dont mean a thing dont mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
  
There once was love there once was love  
There once was love there once was love  
There once was love there once was love  
There once was love there once was love
