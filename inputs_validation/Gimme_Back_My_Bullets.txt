Life is so strange when its changin yes indeed  
Well Ive seen the hard times and the pressures been on me  
But I keep on workin like the workin man do  
And Ive got my act together gonna walk all over you  
  
Chorus  
Gimme back my bullets  
Put em back where they belong  
Aint foolin around cause I done had my fun  
Aint gonna see no more damage done  
Gimme back my bullets  
  
Sweet talkin people done ran me out of town  
And I drank enough whiskey to float a battleship around  
But Im leavin this game one step ahead of you  
And you will not hear me cry cause I do not sing the blues  
  
Chorus  
Gimme back gimme back my bullets  
Oh put em backwhere they belong  
  
Been up and down since I turned seventeen  
Well Ive been on top and then it seems I lost my dream  
But I got it back Im feelin better everyday  
Tell all those pencil pushers better get out of my way  
  
Chorus  
Gimme back gimme back my bullets  
Oh put em back where they belong  
Gimme back my bullets
