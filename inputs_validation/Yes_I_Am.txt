I resent you calling  
I resent your voice  
I resent that I  
Dont have a choice  
  
Anywhere I go  
You are always there  
Outside the car  
Or in my hair  
  
I think Ive been here before  
Yes Ive been here before  
The last time you locked  
All the doors  
  
And I resent you calling  
I resent your voice  
I resent that I  
Dont have a choice  
  
And yes I am  
Yes I am  
  
I think Ive told you once  
I think I needed advice  
You were such a help  
Thats very nice  
  
I think Ive been here before  
Yes Ive been here before  
But this time I kick  
Down your door  
  
Yes I am  
Yes I am
