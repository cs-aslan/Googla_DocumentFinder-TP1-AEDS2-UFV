From the moment of our inception  
Yeah we were destined  
To be together together  
Two planets on a cosmic collision  
Yeah were on a mission  
To last forever  
  
Chorus  
And so gravity took hold  
And its never letting me go  
Like a tractor beam  
To infinity lost sense of all control  
  
And our love is written in the stars  
Already written in the stars  
If Im from Venus youre from Mars  
Our love is written in the stars  
  
Uh oh eh eh  
Eh uh oh  
  
I see your name spelled out in the sky  
Lighting the night like a constellation  
Now lets be touch go for a ride  
The speed of light a supernova sensation  
  
Chorus  
And so gravity took hold  
And its never letting me go  
Like a tractor beam  
To infinity lost sense of all control  
  
And our love is written in the stars  
Already written in the stars  
If Im from Venus youre from Mars  
Our love is written in the stars  
  
Uh oh eh eh eh uh oh  
Its written in the stars oh  
Eh eh yeah yeah eh eh  
  
I need your forcefields  
I gotta keep it real  
To keep me from burning burning oh  
Dont want to drift away  
Floating in outer space  
Theres no way Im returning oh  
  
And our love is written in the stars  
Already written in the stars  
If Im from Venus youre from Mars  
Our love is written in the stars  
  
And our love is written in the stars  
Already written in the stars  
If Im from Venus youre from Mars  
Our love is written in the stars  
  
Oh oh eh eh eh Its written in the stars  
Oh oh eh eh its written in the stars
