No I cant take it no longer Im goin out of my mind  
Baby since you been goner you know I cry all the time  
Im gonna crawl right back to you on my knees  
Cryin take me back please baby please please please  
I cant take it no longer I got to be in your arms  
You know it really is a wonder I aint in the funny farm  
Cause the sun aint shinin and its nine eight degrees  
But Im shiverin and shakin and bout to freeze  
I cant take it no longer I cant take it no longer  
  
Steel  
  
I aint gonna pay no attention to my pride  
Cause without your sweet love I get to be tired  
I cant take it no longer Im goin out of my mind  
Baby since you been goner you know I cry all the time  
Im gonna crawl right back to you on my knees  
Cryin take me back please baby please please please  
I cant take it no longer I cant take it no longer  
I cant take it no longer I cant take it no longer
