Ive been thinking reminiscing  
bout the days when we were wishing  
We could fly and touch the sky  
  
Laughing meeting under cover  
Running hiding from your mother  
If we tried we could do anything  
  
And when the DJ came to town  
People came from all around  
Baby l still recall those things  
And ooh Im missing you now  
Im missing you now  
  
And you turned my world around  
When you burned this disco down  
Whyd you leave to find yourself  
I cant dance with noone else  
And still theres memories of this town  
When you burned this disco down  
  
Its been ten years now this Sunday  
Since you left or was it Monday  
Time can fly when youre still in love  
  
And now I boogie in my dreams  
To ole freak or dancing queen  
Baby I still recall those things  
And ooh Im missing you now  
Im missing you now  
  
And you turned my world around  
When you burned this disco down  
Whyd you leave to find yourself  
I cant dance with noone else  
And still theres memories of this town  
When you burned this disco down  
  
And oh now the dance has died for sure  
Since your love aint here no more  
Still l wonder where you are  
Ill always wonder where you are  
  
And you turned my world around  
When you burned this disco down  
Whyd you leave to find yourself  
I cant dance with noone else  
And still theres memories of this town  
When you burned this disco down
