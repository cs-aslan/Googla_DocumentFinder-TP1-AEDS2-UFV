The Indians send signals  
From the rocks above the pass  
The cowboys take positions  
In the bushes and the grass  
  
The squaw is with the corporal  
She is tied against the tree  
She doesnt mind the language  
Its the beating she dont need  
  
She lets loose all the horses  
When the corporal is asleep  
And he wakes to find the fires dead  
And arrows in his hat  
  
And davy crockett rides around  
And says its cool for cats  
The sweeneys doing ninety  
Cause theyve got the word to go  
  
They get a gang of villains  
In a shed up at heathrow  
Theyre counting out the fivers  
When the handcuffs lock again  
  
In and out of wandsworth  
With the numbers on their names  
Its funny how their missus  
Always look the bleeding same  
  
And meanwhile at the station  
Theres a couple of likely lads  
Who swear like hows your father  
And theyre very cool for cats  
Theyre cool for cats  
  
To change the mood a little  
Ive been posing down the pub  
On seeing my reflection  
Im looking slightly rough  
  
I fancy this I fancy that  
I want to be so flash  
I give a little muscle  
And I spend a little cash  
  
But all I get is bitter and a nasty little rash  
And by the time Im sober  
Ive forgotten what Ive had  
And everybody tells me that its cool to be a cat  
Cool for cats  
  
Shake up at the disco  
And I think Ive got a pull  
I ask her lots of questions  
And she hangs on to the wall  
  
I kiss her for the first time  
And then I take her home  
Im invited in for coffee  
And I give the dog a bone  
  
She likes to go to discos  
But shes never on her own  
I said Ill see you later  
And I give her some old chat  
  
But its not like that on the TV  
When its cool for cats  
Its cool for cats
