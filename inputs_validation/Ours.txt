Elevator buttons and morning air  
Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs  
If you were here wed laugh about their vacant stares  
But right now  
My time is theirs  
  
Seems like theres always  
Someone who disapproves  
Theyll judge it like they know about me and you  
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do  
The jurys out  
And my choice is you  
  
So dont you worry your pretty little mind  
People throw rocks at things that shine  
And life makes love look hard  
The stakes are high  
The waters rough  
But this love is ours  
  
You never know what people have up their sleeves  
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me  
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles  
But I dont care  
Cause right now youre mine  
And you say  
  
So dont you worry your pretty little mind  
People throw rocks at things that shine  
And life makes love look hard  
The stakes are high  
The waters rough  
But this love is ours  
  
And its not theirs to speculate  
If its wrong and  
Your hands are tough but they are where  
My belong in  
Ill fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you  
  
Cause I love the gap between your teeth  
And I love the riddles that you speak  
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored  
Cause my heart is yours  
  
So dont you worry your pretty little mind  
People throw rocks at things that shine  
And life makes love look hard  
  
And dont you worry your pretty little mind  
People throw rocks at things that shine  
But they cant take whats ours  
They cant take whats ours  
The stakes are high  
The waters rough  
But this love is ours
