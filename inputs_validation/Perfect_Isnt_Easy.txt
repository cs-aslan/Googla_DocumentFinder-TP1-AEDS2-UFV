Girl weve got work to do  
Pass me the paint and glue  
Perfect isnt easy but its me  
When one knows the world is watching  
One does what one must  
Some minor adjustments darling  
Not for my vanity but for humanity  
Each little step a pose  
See how the breeding shows  
Sometimes its too much for even me  
When all of the world says yes  
Then who am I to say no  
Dont ask a mutt to strut like a showgirl  
No girl you need a pro  
Not a flea or a flaw take a peek at that paw  
La dada dee dee da  
Perfection becomes me nest ce pas  
Unrivaled unruffled Im beauty unleashed  
Yeah  
Jaws drop hearts stop so classic and classy  
Were not talkin Lassie  
La ah ooh aroo  
Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff  
Ruffruffruffruffruffruffruffarow  
Though many covet my bone and bowl  
Theyre barkin up the wrong tree  
You pretty pups all over the city  
I have your hearts and you have my pity  
Pretty is nice but still its just pretty  
Perfect my dear is me
