Monday Tuesday three days and more  
Pretty soon you dont know anymore  
Friday the sixth day Saturday seems late  
Dont know how much longer I can wait  
  
Ooh could ya wait til I get home  
Ooh we need to be alone  
N I dont wanna lose  
My love on the telephone  
  
You make me nervous cause the lines engaged  
I cant believe we let it get to this stage  
Sittin here waitin for you to give me a sign  
You know I got my heart on the line  
  
Ooh I know that I was wrong  
Ooh Ive been away too long  
I cant stand to lose  
My love on the telephone  
  
Hello operator  
You know that Ive been waitin on this call  
I said hey operator  
If youre givin me a bad time  
Im gonna tear this phone right off the wall
