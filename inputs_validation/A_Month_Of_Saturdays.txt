Five oclock Friday  
All my work is done  
I can hardly wait  
Lets take the server  
Lets sling it around  
Lets make it taste so sweet  
  
I wanna take all the Saturdays  
I wanna stay up late  
I wanna stomp my feet on the ground  
I wanna celebrate  
  
A month of Saturdays Saturdays  
A month of Saturday Saturdays ah  
  
Im tired of waiting for the weekend to begin Sunday Monday Tuesday  
Im tired of punching in Wednesday Thursday  
Give me a holiday that never ends Friday Saturday  
Give me a weekend weekend weekend  
Give me a weekend weekend  
  
A month of Saturdays Saturdays  
Im talkin Saturday Saturdays ah  
  
Shout  
  
Give me a weekend weekend weekend
