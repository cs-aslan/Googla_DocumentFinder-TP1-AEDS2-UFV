Im sipping pink Lucozade  
Were blazing on that new found haze  
Im seeing in the blacks and grays  
Im hoping that the basket sways  
Left to right sit and talk shit all night  
Does that make it right for smoke  
Maybe or am I just seeing shit  
Seeing the pain inside in this house of fear  
  
You dont even wanna know about the things I hear  
Quick fix headlines shine bright youre the fuckin deal  
Im just wishing its ambition that got you your position  
Youll be fishing for far too long  
Youre the bad guy in this movie  
And I aint wrong I dont breathe the pollution  
And the only solution is making shit confusing  
  
Aint about whos winning or losing  
Its bout the path youre choosing  
Time heals pain and promotes selfsoothing  
When the scars are gone you cant see bruising  
Wanna take these watches chains and gold rings  
Im getting caught up in the feelings that they bring  
A lack of sanity losing touch with reality  
Smoking too much its starting to fog up my clarity  
Traveling in the day but youre still looking far to me  
  
Bullseye you the dot to me  
Emotions splattered same pattern cant even begin to spot em  
Im sad about shit that never happened  
No lies in my eyes nothing but truth will leave my mouth  
Im tryna fuckin scream but the words wont come out  
Im tryna fuckin scream but the words wont come out  
  
Shes older I told her we aint meant to be  
It takes two not three but Im here anyway I hope hes leaving soon  
Started not to see the elephant in this room disguise is your perfume  
But the smell of it consumes it takes all my mind  
You can search the world but you will never find  
I see everything youve done to me be there you run to me  
I dont need to pace I dont need the stamina  
If this shit was it girl I probably woulda ran from ya  
Kept runnin outwit cause you cunnin  
That outfit cause you stunnin begging cause Im losing mage  
Got me feeling some type of way I cant explain  
The fuck is going on I think I got it wrong  
When I told you I was over you  under me
