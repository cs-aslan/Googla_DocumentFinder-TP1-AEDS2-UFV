If I Should Return  
With My Body On My Shield  
Tell My Son I Chose To Die Than Yield  
Though My Life May Soon Be Gone  
I Hope Youll Carry On  
Remember Me As One Who Would Not Kneel  
  
Fight With Blood  
Fight With Steel  
Die With Honor  
Never Yield  
Fearless Hearts  
Filled With Pride  
Into Glory We Shall Ride  
Into Glory We Shall Ride  
  
I am Driven On In The Face Of All Despair  
Trust In Steel You Will Find Me There  
A Sinners Fate Awaits Me  
But My Vision Guides Me On  
I Will Not Stray  
From The Path Im Set Upon  
  
Ill Fight With Blood  
Fight With Steel  
Die With Honor  
Never Yield  
Fearless Hearts  
Filled With Pride  
Into Glory We Shall Ride  
Into Glory We Shall Ride  
  
If I Do Not Return  
Bring My Body On My Shield  
Tell My Son I Chose To Die  
I Chose To Die Than Yield  
  
Fight With Blood  
Fight With Steel  
Die With Honor  
Never Yield  
Fearless Hearts  
Filled With Pride  
Into Glory We Shall Ride  
  
Fight With Blood  
Fight With Steel  
Die With Honor  
Never Yield  
Fearless Hearts  
Filled With Pride  
Into Glory We Shall Ride  
  
Fight With Blood  
Fight With Steel  
Die With Honor  
Never Yield  
Fearless Hearts  
Filled With Pride  
Into Glory We Shall Ride  
Ill Die Fighting With My Brothers Side By Side
