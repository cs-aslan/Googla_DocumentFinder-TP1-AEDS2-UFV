Wishes bounce me weightless  
The infrared scope of pointlessness  
The bulls are sedated and this fights fixed  
  
Dont feel bad for the suicidal cats  
Gotta kill themselves nine times before they get it right  
The PA system keeps my hard heart beating tonight  
  
Oh hell yes  
Im a nervous wreck  
Oh hell yes  
The drugs just make me reset  
  
Chorus  
Knock once for the Father  
Twice for the Son  
Three times for the Holy Ghost  
  
Come on in the waters warm  
Come on like I sugared you but with a kick in the head  
Like putting wings on lead  
Your eyes are black in my starlight  
Im the last of my kind  
And as always Im not addicted to you  
  
Follow the disorganized religion of my head  
And well never get through customs  
Lets just take off again instead  
  
Got my degree in the gutter  
My heart broken in the dorms of the Ivy League  
  
Oh hell yes  
Im a nervous wreck  
Oh hell yes  
The drugs just make me reset  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Im a nervous wreck Repeat x3  
Im a nnnervous wreck  
Im a nervous wreck  
Im a nervous wreck  
Oh hell yes  
The drugs just make me reset  
  
Chorus  
  
Three times  
Three times for the Holy Ghost  
Three times  
Three times for the Holy Ghost
