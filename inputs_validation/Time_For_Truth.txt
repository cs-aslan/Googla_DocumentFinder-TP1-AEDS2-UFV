Whatcha trying to say that havent tried to say before  
Youre just another red balloon with a lot of hot gas  
Why dont you fuck off  
And you think youve got it worked out  
And you think youve got it made  
And you trying to play the hero  
But you never walk home in the dark  
  
I think its time for truth  
And the truth is youve lost uncle Jimmy  
Admit your failure and decline with honor while you can  
And you think youve got it sussed out  
And you think that were brain washed  
And youre trying for a police state  
So you can rule our body and minds  
  
What ever happened to the great empire  
You bastards have turned it into manure  
Time for the young to stick together now  
  
I bet you sleep at night with silk sheets and a clean mind  
While killers roam the streets in numbers dressed in blue  
  
And youre trying to hide it from us  
But you know what I mean  
Bring forward those six pigs  
We want to see them swing sod high
