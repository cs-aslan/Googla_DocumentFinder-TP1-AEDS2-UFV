Feel like Im Big Meech  
When I be cashing out  
Holding my bottles up  
Champaign splashing out  
We all got rooms nobody crash the couch  
More Ks at the crib than a Kardashian house  
No Brian Pumper jewels just large links  
A lot of ice in em Im talking large drinks  
Lets see what the Audemar thinks  
My necklace make chicks Nicki Minaj blink  
There are no challengers F what the Dodge think  
Im riding in the my garage stinks  
Cocunut Ciroc cocoloso  
Pretty boy swag never coke my nose though  
Got your baby momma eating off a lead plates  
It mean the World to her to me its just a cheap date  
Plenty fish in the sea and I keep bait  
Youre a broke rollerblader cheapskate  
My jeep plate say Tune in to the game  
Competition killer funerals the name  
Listen up son Im immune to all the lame  
If I fathered your style put a Jr to your name  
I searched the whole planet theres no comp on Earth  
Sky blue Js Jordans look like I stomped a smurf  
  
I said life is but a dream  
Aint always what it seems  
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream  
Raise your glass now lets toast to when we didnt have  
Hustle plus muscle equal success I did the math  
I see haters in passing yeah they round  
I be on the way up they be on the way down  
Now I can sit and talk sht like Skip Bayless  
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless  
Wont be on Craigslist lifestyle Alist  
On my way to Vegas I part playlist  
Yeah its just another page in my success story  
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me  
My only job consistent and persistent  
I go so hard my assistants need assistance  
Im living mine hands on get the feel of it  
Lifes a btch you might wanna get familair with  
  
Verse From Fabolous Bring Death To Em  
This the flow that put haters on their deathbed  
And make the chicks blow the whistle give me rev head  
Somebody call 911 like clef said  
Fore my mans n em black out Meth Red  
The newspaper say young rapper left dead  
The only suspect they have is young funeral  
And when you see him  
He might be on his goony proud  
So you put him up in the air George Clooney style  
Slow motion for me so just slim juvenile  
Dont sht move a dude cant move his bowels  
Catch it like Larry Fitzgerald  
Kurt Warner bullets coming out the 5ths bureau  
Baby Imma make it my shts thorough  
You shootin blanks your shts durrough  
The competi cant hold hold me  
But first lay in a box and cross your hands for me  
Fan base killer blame your loss of fans on me  
I triple what you sees like Im Ross man homie Triple C  
Dudes get to New York like losos dead Tony  
You pick the place everybody cross the land for me  
Keep it real I cant endorse or stand phoneys  
Less we arm wrestle dont force my hand homie  
These YSLs cost a grand only  
My white girl bought that Porsche Cayenne for me  
Sweet sweet like Georgia peaches  
School of heart I get brain from gorgeous teachers  
Funeral in the house no mortgage either  
Any competition he see the boy just ethers  
I cant feel my face this that Boston George reefer  
You lie if you say I aint hotter than August weether  
I mean weather  
You cant see me I mean ever  
Ever ever Andre 3 G  
This is me G Gucci print GG  
Clean ice neck full of frozen Fiji  
Been in the game long as Mario Luigi  
No Juvenile Wayne Turk or BG  
Im still Hot Boyz but its stutter gang jack  
You bang right the first time they dont bang back  
Yous cant ball like me they quickly meer in HORSE  
I bring death to em no hearing loss  
Nice  
End
