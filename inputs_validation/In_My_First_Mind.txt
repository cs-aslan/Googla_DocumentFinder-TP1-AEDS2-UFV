Singing a song of love  
Growing each day  
Knowing how its been  
Living for today  
I wanted to love you babe  
I swear I do know how  
To go back is pointless  
Understand this now  
Our time it hasnt been too long  
It all seems to drift away  
No more the past  
Its the future  
That Im living for today  
And if its not getting you  
Where ever you need to go  
Theres still a place in my heart  
If you did not know this is so  
In my first mind  
You are so fine  
All the good things you do  
Are in my own time  
In my second mind  
I can see you grow  
Feel you flow  
It moves my soul yeah
