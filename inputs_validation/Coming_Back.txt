Written By Cohen Performed In Night Magic  
  
Angels You cant do this  
You must do what  
We must do what must be done  
  
Judy I hear my baby calling  
He is asking to be born  
I see the curtains parting  
That our kisses have outworn  
  
Angels Kisses all outworn  
  
Judy Ill raise a tent of shelter  
Now though every thread is torn  
  
Angels Every thread is torn  
  
Judy I take my life from realms of light  
And hang it on a thorn  
  
Angels Hanging on a thorn  
  
Judy I hear the children calling  
Asking to be born  
I see the curtains parting  
And my life upon a thorn  
  
The stars have lost their fire  
And the moon has lost her voice  
And Im coming back to find you  
I have made the human choice  
  
Angels Youve made your choice  
The world you choose  
Garlands of planets and starlight  
Now you lose  
  
Judy Hes the only one who knows me  
Hes the riddle of my life  
And theyll never tell the story  
Of the husband and the wife  
  
Angels The world she chooses she loses  
  
Judy Hes the stone that broke my heart  
The foundation of my home   
  
Angels This we must do  
  
Judy Hes the sweetness of the sweetness  
Of the sweetness honeycomb  
  
Angels We must do what we must do  
  
Judy And hes welcome to his glory  
And hes buried in my life  
And theyll never tell the story  
Of the husband and the wife  
  
Angels She takes her life from realms of light  
  
Valkyries She hangs it on a thorn  
  
Angels She disobeys the law  
  
Valkyries The law is broken  
You must get them  
  
Angels Get him  
  
Valkyries Get them  
  
Messenger  
Listen  
Messenger  
Do what must be done  
And our will be done  
Will be done
