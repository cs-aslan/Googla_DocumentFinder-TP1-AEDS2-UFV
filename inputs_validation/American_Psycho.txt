Whoaoh whoaoh  
OhOhOh  
whoa  
Go  
  
Inside a Wall Street mind a psycho lurks  
Lines of cocaine cut in Hell  
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck  
Compulsively youll die  
I hate people  
  
Whoaoh whoaoh OhOhOh whoaoh  
Struggling to breathe go  
  
The sweet asphyxiation and dismemberment  
Sex puts me in the mood to make you die  
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck  
Look into sick eyes  
I hate people  
  
Whoaoh whoaoh OhOhOh whoaoh  
Struggling to breathe  
  
Go  
A machine of penalty  
Go  
The sweet insanity  
Go  
Fade to black tranquility  
  
Go  
Youre looking through the eyes of a psycho whoaoh  
An American Psycho whoaoh  
An American Psycho whoaoh  
An American Psycho  
  
Psycho  
Inside a Wall Street mind a psycho lurks  
Lines of cocaine cut in Hell  
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck  
Compulsively youll die I hate people  
  
Whoaoh whoaoh OhOhOh whoaoh  
Struggling to breathe  
  
Go  
A machine of penalty  
Go  
The sweet insanity  
Go  
Fade to black tranquility  
Go  
Youre looking through the eyes of a psycho whoaoh  
An American Psycho whoaoh
