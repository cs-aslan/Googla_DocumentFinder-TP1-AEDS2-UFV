Here I go again  
Driving to the edge of town  
Need to be alone when Im thinking  
With no one else around  
Ive always been a dreamer  
And from here I dream a lot  
And now I see the end of Camelot  
  
Chorus  
If anyone could have a change of heart  
Maybe you could change your mind  
But if youre giving up  If youre letting go  
Dont let me be the last to know  
  
Here I go again  
Walking down the same old streets  
I dont want to see anybody  
I want to be discreet  
  
Im a firm believer  
And I once believed in you  
But now I cant believe all the things  
Youre putting me through  
  
Chorus  
  
Im not thinking straight  Im not feeling great  
Im not sleeping too well  
Im not doing what I know I can  I cant help myself  
Only time will tell  
  
Chorus
