Sometimes things get in the way  
My thoughts I cannot convey  
Its all pointing straight at you  
We hate loving everyday  
Our lives twirled in every way  
I give it all back to you  
  
I cant help this going down  
  
I cant take this  
All my life is wreckless  
All our lives our dangerous  
But we fake our way through  
Thats what we do  
  
Sometimes things dont go away  
In turn you just run away  
Its all coming back for you  
Betrayed life is in decay  
Your thoughts you cannot obey  
Right now what cha gonna do  
  
I cant help this going down  
  
I cant take this  
All my life is wreckless  
All our lives our dangerous  
But we fake our way through  
Thats what we do  
  
We do we do we do we do  
We do we do we do we do we do  
  
I hear the calling of the helpless stranger  
Hes all alone and no one hears his anger  
I feel his pain every time Im here with you  
With you  
All the heartache and the fucked up insults  
I find you begging on your knees I figured  
This is how its supposed to be with you  
With you  
  
I cant wait for your life to be broken down  
I gave you hate  
  
Ah  
  
I cant take this  
All my life is wreckless  
All our lives our dangerous  
But we fake our way through  
Thats what we do  
I cant take this  
All my life is wreckless  
All our lives our dangerous  
But we fake our way through  
  
Thats what we do
