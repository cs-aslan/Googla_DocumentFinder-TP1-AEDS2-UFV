A girl to drive a car to love  
The music rocks me down the motorway  
My whores got wings were taking off  
And I cant stop this flight of speed today  
  
Its a lovedrive on wheels of fire  
A lovedrive just one desire love  
You drive me crazy babe  
  
Its a lovedrive on wheels of fire  
A lovedrive just one desire love  
You drive me crazy babe  
  
The city lights of London town  
Are far away my hand is on her wing on her wing  
I stop the car and she gets down  
Id like to show why Scorpions got a sting  
  
Its a lovedrive on wheels of fire  
A lovedrive just one desire love  
Sweet love you drive me crazy babe  
  
Its a lovedrive on wheels of fire  
A lovedrive just one desire love  
Sweet love you drive me crazy babe  
  
Its a lovedrive on wheels of fire  
A lovedrive just one desire love  
You drive me crazy babe  
  
Its a lovedrive on wheels of fire  
A lovedrive just one desire love  
Sweet love you drive me crazy babe  
  
You drive me crazy babe  
You drive me crazy babe  
You drive me crazy babe  
You drive me crazy baby  
  
Its a lovedrive
