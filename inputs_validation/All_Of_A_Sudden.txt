We were fools you and I  
Now we know it  
We stood still as the days moved along  
Love was ours but our eyes didnt show it  
Suddenly we can see we were wrong  
  
All of a sudden this worlds yours and mine  
All of a sudden water tastes like wine  
Now every moment there are songs to sing  
All of a sudden everything  
  
Lets not talk of all the times weve been lonely  
But let us speak of the times we will know  
From today I will live for you only  
Wish Id said all these things long ago  
  
All of a sudden this worlds yours and mine  
All of a sudden water tastes like wine  
Now every moment there are songs to sing  
All of a sudden everything  
  
La la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la
