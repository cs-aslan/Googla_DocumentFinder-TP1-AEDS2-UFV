We broke up  
Yeah its tough  
Most guys wouldve been crushed  
Wastin their time  
Wonderin where they went wrong  
No way not me  
Hey Im doing just fine  
Im not afraid to move on  
  
Its easy going out on a Friday night  
Easy every time I see her out  
I can smile live it up  
The way a single guy does  
But what she what she dont know  
Is how hard it is to make it look so  
Easy  
  
The truth is  
That I miss lyin in those arms of his  
But I dont ever let it show  
I laugh and I act like  
Im having the time of my life  
As far as he knows  
  
Its easy goin out on a Friday night  
Easy every time I see him out  
I can smile live it up  
Like a single girl does  
But what he what he dont know  
Is how hard it is to make it look so  
Easy  
Oh its easy  
  
Oh its easy goin out on a Friday night  
Oh its easy every time I see him out  
I can smile live it up  
Forget about the way it was  
But what she  
Oh what he dont know  
What she dont know  
Is how hard it is to make it look so  
Easy  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh and its so easy its so easy  
Yeah ooh ooh
