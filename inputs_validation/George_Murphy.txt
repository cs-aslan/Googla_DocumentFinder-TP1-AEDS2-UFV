During the last election we had a good deal of fun back east following your
senatorial contest out here Im from Massachusetts and I feel that we have a
certain right to gloat over the other states because Massachusetts is after
all the only state with three senators Anyway heres a salute to your new
junior senator  
  
Hollywoods often tried to mix  
Show business with politics  
From Helen Gahagan  
To Ronald Reagan  
But Mr Murphy is the star  
Whos done the best by far  
  
Oh gee its great  
At last weve got a senator who can really sing and dance  
We cant expect America to win against its foes  
With no one in the Senate who can really tap his toes  
  
The movies that youve seen  
On your television screen  
Show his legislative talents at a glance  
Should Americans pick crops George says No  
cause no one but a Mexican would stoop so low  
And after all even in Egypt the pharaohs  
Had to import Hebrew braceros  
  
Think of all the musicals we have in store  
Imagine Broadway Melody of Nineteen EightyFour  
Yes now that hes a Senator hes really got the chance  
To give the public a song and dance
