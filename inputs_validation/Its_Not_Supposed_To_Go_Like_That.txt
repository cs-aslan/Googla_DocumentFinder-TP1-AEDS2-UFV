Tommy found his daddys gun  
And Joey had never seen one  
Real cowboy all dressed up  
As he held it in his hand  
Said You be good and Ill be bad  
Then he pulled the trigger back  
Stopped little Tommy in his tracks  
And said Get up man  
People came from miles to say goodbye  
To the Wilsons youngest son  
His innocent life had just begun  
  
Chorus  
Its not supposed to go like that  
Its not intended to end that way  
Life is a journey constantly turning  
Down an unknown path  
But its not supposed to go like that  
  
Jimmy had his daddys car  
And the keys to Jennys heart  
A fifth of whiskey on the floorboard  
Almost gone  
Havin the time of their life  
Had only one thing on their mind  
Never saw the flashin lights  
Or the train comin on  
Now theres a wreath and two small crosses  
On the right side of the road  
Reminders of a love that wont grow  
  
Chorus  
  
I wonder if guardian angels cry  
When they see it all played out  
And as they stand with their hands tied  
Oh do they cry out loud  
  
Its not suppose to go like that  
No its not supposed to go like that  
No its not supposed to go like that  
No its not supposed to go like that  
No its not supposed its not supposed to go like that  
No no no its not supposed to go like that
