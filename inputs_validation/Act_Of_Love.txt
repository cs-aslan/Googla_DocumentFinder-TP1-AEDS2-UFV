The fruit of love was in the future  
Around the corner and over the hill  
The act of love was slowly pounding  
Slowly pounding  
Slowly pounding  
  
The holy war was slowly building  
Heroes leaving for the great crusade  
Seek reward in the ever after  
Ever after  
Ever after  
  
Dont want to have to lose you baby  
Dont want to have to take you back  
You know Ill never lose you baby  
Abuse you baby  
Use you baby  
  
You know Ill always help you baby  
But I just cant do that  
I know I said Id help you baby  
Heres my wallet  
Call me sometime  
  
Act of love  
Act of love  
Act of love  
Act of love  
  
The fruit of love was in the future  
Around the corner and over the hill  
The act of love was slowly pounding  
Slowly pounding  
Slowly pounding  
  
Act of love  
Act of love  
Act of love  
Act of love
