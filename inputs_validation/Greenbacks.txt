As I was walking down the street last night  
A pretty little girl came into sight  
I bowed and smiled and asked her name  
She said Hold it bud I dont play that game  
I reached in my pocket and to her big surprise  
There was Lincoln staring her dead in the eyes  
On a greenback greenback dollar bill  
Just a little piece of paper coated with chlorophyll  
She looked at me with that familiar desire  
Her eyes lit up like they were on fire  
She said My names Flo and youre on the right track  
But look here daddy I wear furs on my back  
So if you want to have fun in this mans land  
Let Lincoln and Jackson start shaking hands  
On a greenback greenback dollar bill  
Just a little piece of paper coated with chlorophyll  
I didnt know what I was getting into  
But I popped Lincoln and Jackson too  
I didnt mind seeing them fade out of sight  
I just knew Id have some fun last night  
Whenever you in town and looking for a thrill  
If Lincoln cant get it Jackson sure will  
On a greenback greenback dollar bill  
Just a little piece of paper coated with chlorophyll  
We went to a nightspot where the lights were low  
Dined and danced and I was ready to go  
I got out of my seat and when Flo arose  
She said Hold on daddy while I powder my nose  
I sat back down with a smiling face  
While she went down to the powder place  
With my greenback greenback dollar bill  
Just a little piece of paper coated with chlorophyll  
The music stopped and the lights came on  
I looked around and saw I was all alone  
I didnt know how long Flo had been gone  
But a nose powder sure didnt take that long  
I left the place with tears in my eyes  
As I waved Lincoln and Jackson a last goodbye  
On a greenback greenback dollar bill  
Just a little piece of paper coated with chlorophyll
