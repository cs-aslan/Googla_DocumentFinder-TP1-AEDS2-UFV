I kicked out of the surf  
And stuck my board in the sand  
And then up in my Woody  
To a hamburger stand  
And when I got back  
My nine five board was gone  
  
She said yeah she said  
Finders keepers  
Finders keepers  
Losers weepers  
Losers weepers  
Finders keepers  
Finders keepers  
Finders keepers  
Losers weepers  
  
I saw a Hodaddy  
Paddlin out by the pier  
Well he musta got my board  
Cause mine isnt here  
But I know how to fix him  
Ill just raise that meatball flag  
  
He said yeah he said  
Finders keepers  
Finders keepers  
Losers weepers  
Losers weepers  
Finders keepers  
Finders keepers  
Finders keepers  
Losers weepers  
  
He took off on a swell  
When he saw the flag  
Hes just a crazy Hodaddy  
Pullin some kind of gag  
He went over the falls  
And now my boards  
Coming back to me  
  
I said yes I said  
Finders keepers  
Finders keepers  
Losers weepers  
Losers weepers  
Finders keepers  
Finders keepers  
Finders keepers  
Losers weepers  
  
Thatll teach him to mess with my board  
Next pass next time
