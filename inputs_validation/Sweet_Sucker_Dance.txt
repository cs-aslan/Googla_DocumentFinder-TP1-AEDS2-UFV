I almost closed the door  
Cancelled on everything we opened up for  
Tonight the shadows had their say  
Their sad notions of the way  
Things really are  
Damn these blues  
Theyd turn my heart against you  
Since I was fool enough  
To find romance  
Im trying to convince myself  
This is just a dance  
  
We move in measures  
Through loves changing faces  
Needy and nonchalant  
Greedy and gracious  
Through petty dismissals  
And grand embraces  
Like it was only a dance  
  
We are survivors  
Some get broken  
Some get mended  
Some cant surrender  
Theyre too well defended  
Some get lucky  
Some are blessed  
And some pretend  
This is only a dance  
  
Were dancing fools  
You and me  
Tonight its a dance of insecurity  
Its my solo  
While youre away  
Shadows have the saddest thing to say  
  
Love  
We cant live without it  
Why do we go out and get it  
Just to turn around and doubt it  
LIke were scared to care  
Its hard to talk about it  
Awits only a dance  
Tonight the shadows had their say  
Theres a sucker born a day  
I heard them say  
Born to lose  
Am I a sucker to love you  
  
Youre such a sweet love  
Youre a proud man  
Youre a treasure  
Time passes gracefully  
Living can be such a pleasure  
You make it easy to take it in measures  
Like it was only a dance  
  
Were dancing fools  
You and me  
Tonight its a dance of insecurity  
Its my solo  
Blue way  
And shadows have the saddest things to say  
  
We are survivors  
Some get broken  
Some get mended  
Some cant surrender  
Theyre too well defended  
Some get lucky  
Some are blessed  
And some pretend  
Its only a dance
