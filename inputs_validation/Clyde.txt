Clyde plays electric bass plays it with finesse and grace  
Set on the porch aint got no shoes pickin the bass and singin the blues  
  
Misery loves company this old dog sings harmony  
Tambourine tied to his tail you can hear him moan you can hear him wail yeah  
  
Jodie baby she got the dollar down the road you can hear her holler  
Get up Clyde we got things to do that old dogs singin the blues  
  
He dont move he dont flinch Clyde he dont move an inch  
Set on the porch aint got no shoes pickin the bass and singin the blues  
  
Clyde played electric bass
