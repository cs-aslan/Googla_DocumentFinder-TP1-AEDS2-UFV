I get my kicks from watching people  
Running too and fro  
And if you ask them where theyre going  
Half of the dont know  
Theyre the ones who think Im crazy  
But they dont realize  
  
Chorus  
That Im just groovin groovin  
Grooving out on life  
Im just groovin ooh grovin  
Grovin till I die  
  
I see a river flowing by me  
Heading for the sea  
I get a feeling deep inside me  
Its so good to be free  
Ive got sunshine in the daytime  
And moonlight every night  
And Im just groovin  
  
Middle eight  
  
I see a river flowing by me  
Heading for the sea  
I get a feeling deep inside me  
Its so good to be free  
Ive got sunshine in the daytime  
And moonlight every night  
And Im just groovin  
  
Chorus  
  
That Im just groovin groovin  
Grooving out on life  
Im just groovin ooh grovin  
Groovin till I die
