Ive been contemplating suicide  
But it really doesnt suit my style  
So I think Ill just act bored instead  
And contain the blood I wouldve shed  
  
She makes me feel so ill at ease  
My heart is really on its knees  
But I keep a poker face so well  
That even mother couldnt tell  
But my babys so vain  
She is almost a mirror  
And the sound of her name  
Sends a nervous shiver down my spine  
Down my spine  
  
I keep her photograph against my heart  
For in my life she plays the starring part  
Our love could hold off cigarettes  
Theres no room for cheap regrets  
  
She makes me feel so ill at ease  
My heart is really on its knees  
But I keep a poker face so well  
That even mother couldnt tell  
But my babys so vain  
She is almost a mirror  
And the sound of her name  
Sends a nervous shiver down my spine  
Down my spine  
Down my spine  
Down my spine  
Down my spine
