Tell me  
Just one more time the reasons why you must leave  
Tell me once more why youre sure you dont need me  
Tell me again but dont think that youll convince me  
  
Now youve said  
Before falling in love again youd rather be dead  
Cause when someone breaks your heart you cry your eyes red  
But theres nothing so hard about the life that youve led  
  
As far as I can see  
Theres no reason for goodbyes  
Youre just running scared  
And thats something I wont buy  
  
So you lose  
I wont let you go with nothing to show but more blues  
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news  
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you
