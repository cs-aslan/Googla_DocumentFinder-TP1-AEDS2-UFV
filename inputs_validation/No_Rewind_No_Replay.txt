Its 2am were lying in bed  
Stillness all around theres not a sound except in my  
Head  
Of happy songs children laughing  
Kids celebrating youth like it never would end  
  
Not long ago they sat on our knees  
We drew cartoons flew to the moon trimmed Christmas  
Trees  
But time has flown look how theyve grown  
Soon shell be you and soon hell be like me  
  
Theres no rewinding no replay  
The chance you lose today will be gone when its gone  
Well never be quite as strong nor as young as this again  
Make them last make these moments last right now  
  
But time has flown look how theyve grown  
Well never be quite as strong nor as young as this again  
Make them last make these moments last right now
