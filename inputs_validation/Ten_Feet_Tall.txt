Happy Im floating  
Around on my feet now  
You make me go dizzy  
Im weak at the knees  
I feel like Im walking  
Round ten feet tall  
  
Well you say Im faking  
And I say dont worry  
The way that I bubble  
Theres something in the make  
I feel like Im walking  
Round ten feet tall  
  
Right the chemistry is right  
This boy has reached his height  
The feeling just goes on and on  
From strength to strength  
Im ten feet long  
  
I feel like Im walking  
Round ten feet tall
