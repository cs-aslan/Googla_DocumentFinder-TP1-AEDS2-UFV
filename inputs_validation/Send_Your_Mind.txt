While youre out there on the highway  
While youre driving roll on by  
Going south between the bridges  
While the river running dry  
And if you cant come home  
Please send your mind  
  
Well now youre talking  
Where are you going  
On the train that just rolls  
Across the nation past the station  
And the night is as black as coal  
And if you cant come home  
Please send your mind  
  
Are you healing on your heartbeat  
Are you heading between the sheet  
And the signs from the lamppost  
On the corner of the street  
And if you cant come home  
Please send your mind  
  
Send your mind please little darling  
Little darling send your mind  
Send a little money too  
Little darling send your mind  
Im coming home
