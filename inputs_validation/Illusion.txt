In a forest known as heartbreak  
In a clearing in the wood  
Cross a pathway called confusion  
Toward the garden of delight  
  
Youll reach the river of desire  
And meekly try and cross it  
While the valley of love  
Keeps avoiding you  
Because its only an illusion  
Only an illusion  
  
Upon the hill of high ideals  
You begin to wonder if its real  
You are reaching sleeps oasis  
You begin to wonder how you feel  
  
But it happens so quickly  
It doesnt fit into your scenes  
Tossin and turnin  
The star of so many scenes  
Its only an illusion  
Its only an illusion
