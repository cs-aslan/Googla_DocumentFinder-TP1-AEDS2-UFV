When I was young Id listen to the radio  
Waitin for my favorite songs  
When they played Id sing along it made me smile  
  
Those were such happy times and not so long ago  
How I wondered where theyd gone  
But theyre back again just like a long lost friend  
All the songs I loved so well  
  
Every shalalala  
Every woowoo still shines  
Every shingalingaling that theyre startin to sings so fine  
  
When they get to the part  
Where hes breakin her heart  
It can really make me cry just like before  
Its yesterday once more  
  
Lookin back on how it was in years gone by  
And the good times that I had  
Makes today seem rather sad so much has changed  
  
It was songs of love that I would sing to then  
And Id memorize each word  
Those old melodies still sound so good to me  
As they melt the years away  
  
Every shalalala  
Every woowoo still shines  
All the oldies but goodies  
Every shingalingaling that theyre startin to sings so fine  
  
All my best memories come back clearly to me  
Some can even make me cry just like before  
Its yesterday once more  
  
Every shalalala  
Every woowoo still shines  
Every shingalingaling that theyre startin to sings so fine  
  
Every shalalala  
Every woowoo still shines  
Every shingalingaling that theyre startin to sings so fine
