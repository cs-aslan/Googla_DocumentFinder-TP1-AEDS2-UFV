Teenage cutie dont say maybe you just gotta kiss me tonight  
Teenage baby dont refuse me you just gotta hug me tonight  
You gotta tickle my chin run your fingers through my hair  
You gotta sit real close whisper in my ear  
You gotta say you care you be my gal

So teenage cutie say you love me please dont tease me  
And well rock and roll the rest of the night

So teenage cutie say you love me please dont tease me  
And well rock and roll the rest of the night  
Well teenage cutie teenage cutie teenage cutie
