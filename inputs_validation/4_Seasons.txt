How will I stand the summer  
When spring was such a bummer  
How will I weather my winter  
When my fall was such a ballbuster  
  
Its spring and therell be no spring fling  
When my winter was what a winner  
And I am taking a fall  
Cause if I aint got you I got nothing at all  
  
How will I stand the summer  
When the spring just made me dumber  
How will I fare my fall  
Will I lose my mind in the wintertime  
  
Its spring and Im a spring dingaling  
Its summer and Im just a little dumber  
And I am taking a fall  
Cause if I aint got you I got nothing at all  
Through the 4 seasons  
Im searching for reasons  
Im not gonna take the spring  
  
Cause the spring dont mean a thing  
Im not gonna take the winter  
My winter is a splinter  
Im not gonna take the summer  
  
Summer is such a bummer  
But I am taking the fall  
Cause if I aint got you I got nothing at all  
Through the 4 seasons  
  
Im searching for reasons  
Vivaldi The 4 Seasons  
It seems to me to be a theme of love  
With no variations of aggravations  
  
Spring summer winter and fall  
Spring summer winter and fall  
Spring summer winter and fall  
If I aint got you I got nothing at all
