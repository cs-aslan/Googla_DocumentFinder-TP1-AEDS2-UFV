I reckon Heaven is a place  
Where time is nonexistent yeah  
And the things that are important yeah  
Dont take any time at all  
An awful lot like like outer space  
Where everything is weightless yeah  
Even heavy things are weightless yeah  
Dont take up any space at all  
Right on right on  
Oh yeah its so clear  
All the bad things are gone  
All the good things are here  
Right on right on  
Oh yeah its so clear  
All the bad things are gone  
All the good things are here  
Almost exactly like this place  
Where people talk forever yeah  
And its always stormy weather yeah  
Stormy weathers the best kind  
Right on right on  
Oh yeah its so clear  
All the bad things are gone  
All the good things are here  
All the bad things are gone  
All the good things are here  
I reckon Heaven is a place  
Where everything is weightless yeah  
Even heavy things are weightless yeah  
Up there well never find it all
