Theyre trying hard to put me in my place  
And that is why I gotta keep running  
The futures mine and its no disgrace  
Cause in the end the past means nothing  
  
You tell me Im free then you tie me down  
And from my chains I think its a pity  
What did it cost you to wear my crown  
You dont like it so why dont you admit it  
  
Dyou feel a little down today  
Bet you aint got much to say  
Youre gonna miss me when Im not there  
And you know I dont care you know I dont care  
  
As we beg and steal and borrow  
Life is hit and miss and this  
I Hope I Think I Know  
And if I ever hear the names you call  
  
If I stumble catch me when I fall  
cause baby after all youll never forget my name
