If your mind is in the darkness could you know  
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow  
Will you show me someone who may treat me kind  
Or is this world I live in just a frame of mind  
  
And as soon as you discover where youre goin  
Can I walk along the way along the way  
Im lonesome and I need somebody knowin  
Just a few nice words to get me through the day  
  
If your mind is in the darkness could you know  
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow  
And will you show me someone who may treat me kind  
Or is this world just a frame of mind  
  
If youre living in Chicago its your home  
If youre living in Chicago youre alone  
  
If youre living in Chicago its your home  
If youre living in Chicago youre alone  
  
If youre living in Chicago youre alone Repeat x4  
If youre living in Chicago its your home
