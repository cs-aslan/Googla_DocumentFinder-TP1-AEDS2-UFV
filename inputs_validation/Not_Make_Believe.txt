Isnt just that we cause each other such pain  
Everywhere we go now at home or at play  
It hurts my self esteem it hurts my everything  
I am reeling Oh it hurts my feelings  
Sometimes it was heavenly Sometimes it was heavenly  
Sometimes it was too heavy Sometimes it was too heavy  
Sometimes its just too much for me Sometimes its just too much for me  
Well I want to run away Oh well I want to run away  
  
Then there are the things cast this doubt away  
Those things that made me stay for so long  
Not make believe then Im not make believe now  
Not make believe then Im not make believe now  
I didnt understand then but I understand now  
  
It was the best of times it was the worst of times  
And they both rushed by like a thief in the night  
Taking no prisoners just like the first time  
Adventures in paradise  
Just like the first time  
  
Then there are the things cast this doubt away  
Those things that made me stay for so long  
Not make believe then Im not make believe now  
Not make believe then Im not make believe now  
I didnt understand then but I understand now  
  
Then there are the things cast this doubt away  
Those things that made me stay for so long  
Not make believe then Im not make believe now  
Its not make believe then Im not make believe now  
I didnt understand then but I understand now
