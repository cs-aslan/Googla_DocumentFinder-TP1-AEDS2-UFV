Theres a plane goin down the runway  
Believe I better go with with it  
Theres a train goin by the highway  
Believe I better roll with it  
  
I dont know whats got into me  
All I know is Ive got to be free  
Take off all these chains that bind me  
Once Im gone youll never find me  
  
Did she love you  
Mmmm Hmmm  
Did she need you  
Mmmm Hmmm  
  
Did she please you  
Mmmm Hmmm  
Did she leave you  
Mmmm Hmmm  
  
Iiii Iiii Iiii Iiii  
Iiii Iiii Iiii Iiii
