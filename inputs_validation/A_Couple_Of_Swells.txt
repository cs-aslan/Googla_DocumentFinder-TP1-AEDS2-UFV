Were a couple of swells  
We stop at the best hotels  
But we prefer the country far away from the city smells  
Were a couple of sports  
The pride of the tennis courts  
In June July and August we look cute when were dressed in shorts  
The Vanderbilts have asked us up for tea  
We dont know how to get there no siree  
No siree  
  
We would drive up the Avenue but we havent got the price  
We would skate up the Avenue but there isnt any ice  
We would ride on a bicycle but we havent got a bike  
So well walk up the Avenue  
Yes well walk up the Avenue  
And to walk up the Avenues what we like  
  
Wall Street bankers are we  
With plenty of currency  
Wed open up the safe but we forgot where we put the key  
Were the favorite lads  
Of girls in the picture ads  
Wed like to tell you who we kissed last night but we cant be cads  
The Vanderbilts are waiting at the club  
But how are we to get there thats the rub  
Thats the rub  
  
We would sail up the Avenue but we havent got a yacht  
We would drive up the Avenue but the horse we had was shot  
We would ride on a trolley car but we havent got the fare  
So well walk up the Avenue  
Yes well walk up the Avenue  
Yes well walk up the Avenue till were there  
  
We would swim up the Avenue but we havent any lake  
So well walk up the Avenue  
Yes well walk up the Avenue  
Yes a walk up the Avenues what well take
