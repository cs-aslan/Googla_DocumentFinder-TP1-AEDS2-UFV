Thats right  
  
Well the dogs are barkin and Im out rockin  
Nobody home to throw them a bone  
I was thinkin just the other day  
Yeah on my way back to USA  
Oh junk mail and bills in a letter box  
Out on the line are my dirty socks  
Had to jump the fence and break my lock  
Yeah  
  
Oh my God Im back in FLA  
I got so much to do but Im only here for a day  
Wish I could pay for it while Im in it  
Seems like Im there only for a minute  
Me and the bank own a house down in FLA  
Aw yeah  
  
What in the world am I gonna do  
Clock on the wall says a quarter to two  
Well the boys are on the bus and theyre waitin on me  
I got soap in my eyes and I cant see  
Telephones ringin babys on the line  
Tired of being here doin my time  
Gotta hit the road runnin gotta get goodnight  
Yeah  
  
Oh my God Im back in FLA  
I got so much to do but Im only here for a day  
Wish I could pay for it while Im in it

Me and the bank own a house down in FLA  
  
Thats right  
  
Oh wish I could pay for it while Im in it
