Theres a voice cryin out in the wilderness  
All your trails have not been in vain  
And youre doin the best you know how to do  
Gaining strength in the things that remain  
  
Youre part of the plan  
For a new kind of man to come through  
  
Theres an angel thats watching right over you  
All your trials have not been in vain  
Wont you lift your head up to the starry night  
Finding strength in the things that remain  
  
Youre part of the plan  
For a new kind of man to come through  
  
When a man comes through  
He must do what hes supposed to do  
When a man comes through  
He cant do what everyone expects him  
  
Wont you lift your head up to the mountain top  
All your trials have not been in vain  
Theres a light that keeps shining up ahead of you  
Every step of the way that you take  
  
Its part of the plan  
For a new kind of man  
Its part of the plan  
For a new kind of man to come through  
Its part of the plan  
For a new kind of man  
New kind of man  
New kind of man
