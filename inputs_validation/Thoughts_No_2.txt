Sometimes I feel  
I live like a prisoner  
But I dont know  
If this really is pressure  
Surprise you win  
Im lost as screamers roll in  
Sometimes I feel  
Like leaving this room Im in  
  
Faded film people dropping words  
About the real things to say  
 Not Someone pulls me deeper as in CD booklet  
And tells me who I will be if I stay  
A clever machine writes pretty words  
For pretty boys  
To sing to us all  
Were all so grateful  
  
My face you cry  
And I show my darker side  
The night is yours  
And I just switch off and hide  
Cafe and sin  
The wines not to my liking  
My face you cry  
Oh my didnt I say come in  
  
Frown  in my eyes showing nothing  
But surprise about you  
And what are you thinking  
About my life and her drinking to you too  
A dying nonhuman writes unkind words  
For unkind friends  
And as for the tears theyll never show  
Asylum people calling on my door  
From day to day  
The image must fall  
Ive had my time
