I never wanted anything like this  
Youre right beside me dont know who I missed  
Send me a smile I know youll do your best  
Your hearts a suspect are we faking this  
All I can say its a big surprise  
Watching those colors change inside your eyes  
Blue to gray yeah  
  
I turn away  
All it does is turn you on  
All it does is turn you on  
  
Baby this night was all a dream  
Maybe daylight wont ask me questions  
Maybe this night was all a dream  
A dangerous connection  
What a dangerous connection  
What a dangerous connection  
  
You seem to find a way to tear apart  
Every discussion leaves new battle scars  
When it hurts to love you  
I just numb the pain  
But Im having trouble feeling anything  
And you want for answers  
And I cant reply  
Take my advances  
Is my way to try  
You again yeah  
  
I turn away  
All it does is turn you on  
All it does is turn me on  
  
Baby this night was all a dream  
Maybe daylight wont ask me questions  
Maybe this night was all for me  
A dangerous connection  
  
Maybe this night was all a dream  
Maybe daylight wont ask me questions  
Maybe this night was all for me  
A dangerous connection  
  
Maybe this night was all a dream  
Maybe daylight wont ask us questions  
Maybe this night was all for me  
Oh maybe everything is a dangerous connection  
Dangerous connection
