It coulda been me but it was you  
Who went and bit off a little bit more than he could chew  
You said that you had it made but you been had  
The woman no good no how thinkin maybe the blood is bad  
  
Bad baaad blood bloood  
The woman was born to lie  
Makes promises she cant keep  
With the wink on an eye  
  
Bad baaad blood bloood  
Brother youve been deceived  
Its bound to change you mind  
About all you believe  
  
From where I stand it looks mighty strange  
How you let a woman like that treat you like small change  
I dont understand what youre lookin to find  
The only thing bad blood do is mess up a good mans mind  
  
Hear me talkin now  
  
Bad baaad blood bloood  
The bitch is in her smile  
The lie is on her lips  
Such an evil child  
  
Bad baaad blood bloood  
Is takin you for a ride  
The only thing good about bad blood  
Is lettin it slide  
  
Dooron dooron di di dit dit ronron  
Dooron dooron di di dit dit ronron  
Dooron dooron di di dit dit ronron  
Bad blood talkin bout bad blood  
  
Dooron dooron di di dit dit ronron  
Dooron dooron di di dit dit ronron  
Dooron dooron di di dit dit ronron  
Bad blood  
Here we go  
  
Bad baaad blood bloood  
The bitch is in her smile  
The lie is on her lips  
Such an evil child  
  
Bad baaad blood bloood  
Is takin you for a ride  
The only thing good about bad blood  
Is lettin it slide  
  
The only thing good about bad blood  
Is lettin it slide
