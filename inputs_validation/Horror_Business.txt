Too much horror business  
Driving late at night  
Psycho 78  
My bathroom is new  
  
You you dont go in the bathroom with me  
Psycho 78

All this horror business  
My mirrors are black  
  
You dont go in the bathroom with me  
With you  
Ill put a knife right in you  
Im warning you  
Ill put a knife right in you  
Im warning you  
Ill put a knife right in you
