Up on the Blue Ridge Mountains there Ill take my stand  
Up on the Blue Ridge Mountains there Ill take my stand  
A rifle on my shoulder six shooter in my hand  
Oh Lord I been all around this world  
  
Lulu my Lulu come and open the door  
Lulu my Lulu come and open the door  
Before I have to walk in with my old fortyfour  
Oh Lord I been all around this world  
  
Mama and Papa little sister makes three  
Mama and Papa little sister makes three  
Theyre comin in the mornin thats the last youll see of me  
Oh Lord I been all around this world  
  
Hang me oh hang me so Ill be dead and gone  
Hang me oh hang me so Ill be dead and gone  
I wouldnt mind your hangin boys but you wait in jail so long  
Oh Lord I been all around this world  
  
Up on the Blue Ridge Mountains there Ill take my stand  
Up on the Blue Ridge Mountains there Ill take my stand  
A rifle on my shoulder six shooter in my hand  
Oh Lord I been all around this world
