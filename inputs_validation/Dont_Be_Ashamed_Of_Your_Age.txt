Dont be ashamed of your age  
Dont let the years get you down  
That old gang you knew they still think of you  
As all rounder in your old hometown  
Dont mind the gray in your hair  
Just think of all the fun you had puttin it there  
And as for that old book of time boy you never skipped a page  
So dont be ashamed of your age  
Brother dont be ashamed of your age  
And now listen Mr Smith and Mr Brown  
Dont let the years get you down  
Cause life aint begun until youre forty son  
Thats when you really start to go uptown  
And dont wish that you were a lad  
While boy youve lost the old girls theyve ever had  
And whats more youve graduated from that old sucker stage  
So dont be ashamed of your age  
Brother dont be ashamed of your age
