Verse 1  
Im a princess cut from marble smoother than a storm  
And the scars that mark my body theyre silver and gold  
My blood is a flood of rubies precious stones  
It keeps my veins hot the fires find a home in me  
I move through town Im quiet like a fire  
And my necklace is of rope i tie it and untie it  
  
PreChorus  
And now people talk to me but nothing ever hits home  
So people talk to me and all the voices just burn holes  
Im done with it ooh  
  
Chorus  
This is the start of how it all ends  
They used to shout my name now they whisper it  
Im speeding up and this is the  
Red orange yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
Were at the start the colors disappear  
I never watch the stars theres so much down here  
So I just try to keep up with them  
Red orange yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
  
Verse 2  
I dream all year but theyre not the same kinds  
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time  
  
PreChorus  
And now people talk to me Im slipping out of reach now  
People talk to me and all their faces blur  
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison  
And Im locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me  
Im done with it ooh  
  
Chorus  
This is the start of how it all ends  
They used to shout my name now they whisper it  
Im speeding up and this is the  
Red orange yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
Were at the start the colors disappear  
I never watch the stars theres so much down here  
So I just try to keep up with them  
Red orange yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
  
Outro  
And this is the red orange yellow flicker beat  
Sparking up my heart  
And this is the red orange yellow flicker beatbeatbeatbeat
