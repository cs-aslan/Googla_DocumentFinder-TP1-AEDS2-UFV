Diamoexplainnds hang around my neck the crib is all finished  
No love for these bitches I said this year its all business  
It is a shame that a couple of em are off limits  
No offence to my nigga its just the industry is small  
We all lust for the same women  
You know the ones we saw before we came in it  
I know he aint trippin  
I know I got a couple things that lil wayne dipped in  
Aint ashamed to admit it I be the same with it  
This shit is all about hits and misses  
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up  
Dont let them fuck your life up  
  
Half a mill to perform I cant let them fuck that shit up  
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when its lit up  
Jim moore got me dressing like a leading man  
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand  
Young frank suits cut right always  
Just got a couple warhols for my hallways  
New verses crush the hood like Im driving into something  
Bitches on the kid like Im iverson of something  
Like a sixer since I sold 680 in my first  
Drizzy drake the only one that got the gift without the curse  
Swag
