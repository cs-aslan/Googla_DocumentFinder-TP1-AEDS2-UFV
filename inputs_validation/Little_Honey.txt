Little honey wont you come over here  
Little honey we gotta get something clear  
Little honey I promise I wont get mad  
If you tell me about a boyfriend that you had  
Who lied last night Who made you mad  
Left you cryin by the side of the road  
Left you cryin to hitchhike home alone  
All alone  
Little honey are you goin out tonight  
Little honey I dont want to start a fight  
Little honey if you dont answer me soon  
Youll come home tomorrow to an empty room  
With a light left on the door open wide  
Window broken and pictures smashed  
Window broken and our bed covered in trash  
All with trash I aint lookin for fight  
Little honey are you goin out tonight  
Little honey wont you please come over here  
Little honey wont you please bring me a beer  
Little honey I promise I wont get mad  
If you tell me about a boyfriend that you had  
Cause you know I care but what can I do  
Sit here waitin by the side of the road  
Sit here waitin till you come home alone  
All alone I aint lookin for fight  
Little honey are you goin out tonight  
Cause you know I care but what can I do  
Sit here waitin by the side of the road  
Sit here waitin till you come home alone  
All alone I aint lookin for fight  
Ooh little honey are you goin out tonight  
Honey honey honey  
Honey honey honey
