Such a hot crush  
Makes your face blush  
But try to take your time  
  
Cause every goose chase  
Makes your heart race  
And you wonder why  
  
So wait for the home run  
Youll find the right one  
And youll figure this all out  
  
Life is a mind game  
Love is a blind date  
And its making your heart pound  
  
Hey Anna its just a boy you wont understand if you try  
So hey Anna smile when hes holding your hand tonight  
Hey Anna remember when youre wishing away your life  
Hey hey Anna everything is going to turn out just fine  
  
Every mindset  
Isnt so bad  
If you look outside  
  
Cause all the suns say  
That its a new day  
And you were so alive  
  
So wait for the home run  
Youll find the right one  
And youll figure this all out  
  
Life is a mind game  
Love is a blind date  
And its making your heart pound
