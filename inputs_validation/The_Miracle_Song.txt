  
All my life  
Ive been a kind of lonely man  
Searching high and low  
Looking for my way  
Then all at once  
I saw you right in front of me  
I knew right then and there  
My lonely days were through  
Youre just a rose  
That shimmers in the sun  
And now I know  
My life has just begun  
You are the sweetest thing  
That could ever ever be  
And youre a miracle to me  
You fill my life  
With tenderness and harmony  
I never thought  
That Id be laughing once again  
You fill the room  
With something warm and wonderful  
I cant imagine life  
Without your precious love  
Youre just a rose  
That shimmers in the sun  
And now I know  
My life has just begun  
You are the sweetest thing  
That could ever ever be  
And youre a miracle to me  
Rivers bend rivers flow  
Till the end of time  
They keep flowing  
Through eternity  
Take me there  
Sail away  
Take me to the sea  
Youre a river that flows inside of me  
Youre just a rose  
That shimmers in the sun  
And now I know  
My life has just begun  
You are the sweetest thing  
That I could ever ever see  
And youre a miracle to me
