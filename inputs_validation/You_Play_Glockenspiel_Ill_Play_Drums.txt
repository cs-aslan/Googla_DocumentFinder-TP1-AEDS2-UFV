Theres a boy with a brace across his teeth  
White socks tattooed underneath  
Bus tickets chitched up in his palm  
Stood there hes spinning a yarn  
Theres a girl with a plastic pair of shoes  
Two eyes permanently bruised  
Cant find the time to be alarmed  
Just stood spinning a yarn  
Just take your time  
Itll work out fine  
Itll do no harm  
To spin your yarn  
You do English  
Ill do sums  
You break fingers  
Ill break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And Ill play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And Ill play drums  
My name is Derek from the den  
I deal in shillings and in pence  
Ill get you any deal you like  
Ten sweets for a mountain bike you like  
My name is Mandy from the yard  
I deal in crazy tarot cards  
Ill tell you what the future brings  
One cat and a dog that sings  
You do English  
Ill do sums  
You break fingers  
Ill break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And Ill play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And Ill play drums  
Just take your time  
Itll work out fine  
Itll do no harm  
To spin your yarn  
You do English  
Ill do sums  
You break fingers  
Ill break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And Ill play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And Ill play drums
