You call me the mean man  
You point your finger at me  
Having problems with authority  
In every major city  
  
And its so easy for you  
The majority the majority  
And theres no peace for you  
The majority  
  
Your white housewives  
And your moneysucking friends  
Dont need you to be Ill be me to the end  
  
And its so easy for you  
The majority the majority  
And theres no peace for you  
  
You got to think about your children  
Fuck bureaucracy  
Take the weight off your shoulders  
Were not the public enemy  
Cant you see cant you see  
  
You call me the mean man  
I say you call me the mean man  
  
And its so easy for you  
The majority the majority  
And theres no peace for you  
  
Your white housewives  
And your moneysucking friends  
Dont need your to be  
Cause Ill be me to the end  
  
Got to think about the children  
Think think about the children  
  
You got to think about the children
