Youre now aware of your situation  
You wasted time with contemplation  
Instead of trying to be so cool my friend  
Understand this way youll never win  
  
You say its darkest just before the dawn  
You get discouraged if it takes too long  
Common sense will tell you right from wrong  
My advice is that you carry on  
  
Dont get me wrong theres more to life than gold  
There are fortunes here that cant be bought or sold  
Cause your diamonds lie within your soul  
You cant count your cash 6 feet under stiff and cold  
  
Somebodys watchin somebodys watchin you  
Somebodys watchin yes I know its true  
Somebodys watchin somebodys watchin you  
Somebodys watchin saw ya saw ya saw ya
