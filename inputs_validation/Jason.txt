This aint for the quarterback  
Who lives upstairs in our house  
And this aint for the princess  
Whos sleepin down the hall  
  
This aint for the other one  
Who looks just like her mama  
And this aint for the baby  
Whos the cutest one of all  
  
Jason this is my love for you  
Written down a thousand times  
Jason like the teacher makes you do  
When youre bad and outta line  
  
Im so glad youre mine  
  
It hurts me when they tease you  
Cause your minds a little slower  
Id like to take the sadness  
And turn them into joy  
  
I watch you so hard to do  
What usually comes easy  
After all to me  
Youre such a special little boy  
  
Jason this is my love for you  
Written written down a thousand times  
Jason like the teacher makes you do  
When youre bad and outta line  
  
Im so glad youre mine  
  
Jason Jason
