Come to mama cause you know  
Ba ba ba ba ba  
In the middle of the night  
When the last sheep jumps through my head  
Why shut out the light  
When I know Im gonna wake up again  
In crumpled sheets  
There is no silhouette  
To the sight of me  
Its much to cold in this bed  
  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
  
Ba ba ba ba ba  
I turn on my side  
And I can hear myself breathe  
Its pretty quiet outside  
I miss the sound of you next to me  
When you talk in your sleep  
And you mention my name  
I close my eyes to remember  
But its just not the same  
  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh Ooh I miss him  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh in the middle of the night  
I miss my baby  
  
Cant pet your head all with the covers to your chin  
And watch you kick them off again  
Cant watch you sleep in the light  
From the slit in the door  
And what I cant have  
It makes me want it even more  
It makes me want it even more  
Ba ba ba ba  
  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh in the middle of the night  
I miss my baby in the broad daylight  
Oooooohhhh oh I miss you  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh oh I miss you miss you  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh in the middle of the night  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh gonna kiss you  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh in the broad daylight  
I miss my baby
