When the weather is fine  
And the clouds have gone by  
I go up in the air  
Waving people goodbye  
In my flying machine  
I go up  
I go down  
I go round and round  
Round and round and round  
People on the ground  
Have gathered all around to admire  
Theres a feeling inside me  
That gives me the urge to go higher  
But I know what goes up  
Will eventually fall  
So I wont take no chances  
While Im having a ball  
In my flying machine  
I go up  
I go down  
I go round and round  
And round and round  
I can race with the birds  
I can fight with the wind  
I can fly on my head  
I can dance in a spin
