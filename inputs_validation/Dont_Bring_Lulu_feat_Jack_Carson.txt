Your presence is requested wrote little Johnny White  
But with is invitation there is a stipulation  
When you attend this party youll be treated right but  
Theres a wild and wooly woman you boys cant invite now  
Chorus  
You can bring Pearl shes a darn nice girl but dont bring Lulu  
You can bring Rose with the turned up nose but dont bring Lulu  
Lulu always wants to do what we boys dont want her to  
When she struts her stuff around London bridge is falling down  
You can bring cake or Porterhouse steak but dont bring Lulu  
Lulu gets blue and she goes cuckoo like the clock on the shelf  
Shes the kind of smartie who breaks up every party  
Hullabaloo loo dont bring Lulu Ill bring her myself  
  
We all went to the party real hitoned affair  
Then along came Lulu wild as any Zulu  
She started into Charleston and how the boys did stare but  
When she did the hulahula then she got the air now  
Chorus  
You can bring Pearl shes a darn nice girl but dont bring Lulu  
You can bring Rose with the turned up nose but dont bring Lulu  
Lulu always wants to do what we boys dont want her to  
When she struts her stuff around London bridge is falling down  
You can bring cake or Porterhouse steak but dont bring Lulu  
Lulu gets blue and she goes cuckoo like the clock on the shelf  
Shes the kind of smartie who breaks up every party  
Hullabaloo loo dont bring Lulu Ill bring her myself
