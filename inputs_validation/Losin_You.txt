Well I told you once and I told you twice and I aint gonna tended to you no

You dont do nothin that I tell you anyway  
  
And now youre tellin me to walk out your door  
  
Aint no denyin you been lyin aint no mistakin my heart is breakin  
  
Aint do much choosin that Im losin losin you  
  
 guitar   
  
I finally find out the way you are and its so hard for me to take  
  
I cant understand your feelins I wish I had known before it was too late  
  
Aint no denyin  
  
 guitar   
  
Aint no denyin  
  
Aint no denyin
