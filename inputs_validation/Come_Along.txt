Come along come along theres a full moon shining bright  
Come along come along were gonna hit St Louis tonight  
Spend your money looking at the chorus line  
Spend your money win it on the number 9  
Take your sweetheart even though shes never been  
If shes worried tell her that you always win  
Come along come along theres a full moon shining bright  
Come along come along youre gonna win a fortune tonight  
  
Hear the whistle lady lucks about to go  
Is she smiling maybe yes or maybe no  
Nows the time when nights are filled with sweet romance  
Dont be bashful step on up and take a chance  
Come along come along theres a full moon shining bright  
Come along come along were gonna hit St Louis tonight  
  
Come along come along were gonna win a fortune tonight
