Four cards down and two more still to drop  
And when it does I pack up and hit the road

I remember we couldnt pay the bill they got hot  
And beat us down in the fuckin parking lot  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
Tall Jess Jump Steady and Nate the Mack  
Tagged ICP by the train tracks  
And it was on the dawn of a new day  
Magical carpets screaming down the freeway  
Violent J  
Walked in a gypsys tent with a food stamp  
And walked out with a magical lamp yeah  
I met Milenko he gave me 3 wishes  
That night I fucked 3 fat bitches  
Shaggy 2 Dope

Ill rip your face off and wipe my ass with it  
When the genie says on with the show  
Hokus pokus jokers Great Milenko
