A well I bless my soul  
Whats wrong with me  
Im itching like a man on a fuzzy tree  
My friends say Im acting wild as a bug  
  
Chorus  
Im in love  
Im all shook up  
  
My hands are shaky and my knees are weak  
I cant seem to stand on my own two feet  
Who do you thank when you have such luck  
  
Chorus  
Im in love  
Im all shook up  
  
Please dont ask me whats on my mind  
Im a little mixed up but Im feeling fine  
When Im near that girl that I love best  
My heart beats so it scares me to death  
  
She touched my hand what a chill I got  
Her lips are like a volcano thats hot  
Im proud to say shes my buttercup  
  
Im in love  
Im all shook up  
Mm mm oh oh yeah yeah  
  
My tongue get tied when I try to speak  
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree  
Theres only one cure for this body of mine  
Thats to have the girl that I love so fine
