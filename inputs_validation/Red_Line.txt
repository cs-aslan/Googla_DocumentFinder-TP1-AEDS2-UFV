All alone again the phone forgot to ring  
Even if it did I doubt it would be for me  
Bedside table photographs of you half smoked cigarettes  
Remember something too good to be true  
And you called me and told me you were home  
Watching movies with your friends  
While I sit by the phone I guess Ill have another cigarette  
I guess Ill write another song  
If I could be anything Id be an aeroplane and then Id fly so far away  
500 miles so that you could look at me that way  
The ceiling is so lonely when its all that you can see  
Lying here on my back thinking of your smile  
And the next time youll show it to me  
I cant help being jealous of your room when youre in it all alone  
And I cant help being jealous of your friends when youre having fun  
And Im stuck here at home  
I took the el today and everything reminded me of you  
And I remember how you sat on the stairs  
Eating popsicles that turned your lips blue  
I knew it then I know it now  
My favorite dream has come true  
I love you so much and Ill never meet another like you
