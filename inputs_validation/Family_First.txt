Oh yeah  
Nothings better than family  
For the ones who love you so  
Be a shoulder to cry on when you are in need  
They will never leave you alone  
When your friends bring you down  
And they drag you through the dirt  
And nobody is around  
They will carry you through the hurt  
  
Just remember that family comes first  
Where you gonna run to when no one is around  
Do you think how dare they will love you  
When your face is on the ground face is on the ground  
When you feel your strength is almost gone  
And When your heart is getting weak getting weak  
And you dont think you can keep holding on  
And they stand for your feet just remember  
Family comes first  
  
I can see you crying someone broke your heart  
Instead of being with those who love you  
You spend time apart its because you think  
They wont understand  
The pain youre going through So you dont reach out your  
Hand for them til theyll pull and reach for you  
  
Just remember that family comes first  
Where you gonna run to when no one is around  
Do you think how dare they will love you  
When your face is on the ground face is on the ground  
When you feel your strength is almost gone  
And When your heart is getting weak getting weak  
And you dont think you can keep holding on  
And they stand for your feet just remember  
Family comes first  
  
Dont you be ashamed of your family put you into this earth  
And thats what its worth unconditionally sometimes you may  
Disagree and wont see eye to eye  
Dont you run away they will be right by your side  
Oh oh  
  
Where you gonna run to when no one is around  
Do you think how dare they will love you  
When your face is on the ground face is on the ground  
When you feel your strength is almost gone  
And When your heart is getting weak getting weak  
And you dont think you can keep holding on  
And they stand for your feet just remember  
Family comes first  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Comes first
