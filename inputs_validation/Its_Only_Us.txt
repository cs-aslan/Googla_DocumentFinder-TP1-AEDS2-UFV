And they want us to grow up  
We dont want to get a job  
We all need a decent rock  
Where its all kicking off  
  
Baby its alright baby its alright  
You dont need to call it off  
Baby its alright baby its alright  
Its only us  
  
We just stopped for cheaper thrills  
Since the price went up on pills  
From StokeonTrent to Beverley hills  
  
We know its all kicking off  
Baby its alright baby its alright  
You dont need to call it off  
Baby its alright baby its alright  
Its only us  
Its only us  
  
Baby its alright baby its alright  
You dont need to call it off  
Baby its alright baby its alright  
Its only us  
Its only us
