Ive seen the way he cast his spell  
Hes gonna hurt you I can tell  
Just to prove that he can be your lover  
Hes gonna turn on that charm  
Tonight hell wrap you in his arms  
Tomrrow he will leave you for another  
  
Pretty is as pretty does  
Thats how it is and always was  
Pretty words are all hes givin you  
And when he whispers int he dark  
Watch out hes gonna break your heart  
Cause pretty words wont make your dreams come true  
Theyre just pretty words  
Just pretty words  
  
In the morning you will find  
That you were just the next in line  
theres nothing I can do thats gonna stop you  
Before you go just let me say  
Id never treat your love that way  
Ill be here long after hes forgot you  
  
Pretty is as pretty does  
Thats how it is and always was  
Pretty words are all hes givin you  
And when he whispers int he dark  
Watch out hes gonna break your heart  
Cause pretty words wont make your dreams come true  
Theyre just pretty words  
Just pretty words
