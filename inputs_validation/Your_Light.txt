When youre feeling lost and blue  
When there is no love for you  
Youll find him and its all right  
Its all right its all right  
When youre feeling down and low  
When youve got no place to go  
And when no one smiles hello  
Hes by your side you know  
When youre getting deaf and blind  
When you drag one leg behind  
And when youre finally gonna  
Lose your mind  
Its all right its all right  
Its all right  
Cause he is by your side  
Cause he will be your guide  
Cause he will be your light  
And youre not alone youre not alone  
Youre not alone youre not alone
