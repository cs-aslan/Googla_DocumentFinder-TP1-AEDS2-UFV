Baby Lets Rock  
  
baby im the greatest thing youve got  
in a good way i suppose  
exactly where you are is where im not  
so from a lead balloon inside your room  
ill drop sparks  
you can kick you can cry you can fuss  
but lets rock  
  
baby is there time for loves  
so go and grab your brand new shoes  
ive taken care of everything  
and when i cant cant you know im tying knots  
baby lets rock  
  
baby im the greatest thing youve got  
my rings are to set the stone  
but every single wish is still a lie  
so in my time machine  
ill adjust the scenes  
turn back your clocks  
you can bitch you can cry you can moan  
but lets rock  
  
baby theres no time for loves  
so go and grab your brand new shoes  
ive taken care of everything  
and when i cant you know i wont abuse  
baby lets rock  
lets rock  
lets rock  
lets rock  
lets rock  
  
i dream about you every night  
and when i do youre holding me tight  
id love somebody like you in my life  
in my life  
  
baby im the greatest thing youve got  
in a good way i should hope  
in a good way i suppose  
  
baby im the greatest thing youve got  
baby im the greatest thing youve got  
ive taken care of everything  
ive even gone and changed all the locks  
baby lets rock  
lets rock
