At any gambling casino  
From monte carlo to reno  
They tell you that a beginner  
Comes out a winner  
  
Beginner fishing for flounder  
Will catch a 17 pounder  
Thats what I always heard  
And thought absurd  
But now I believe every word  
  
For Ive got beginners luck  
The first time that Im in love  
Im in love with you  
Gosh Im lucky  
  
Ive got beginners luck  
There never was such a smile  
Or such eyes of blue  
Gosh Im fortunate  
  
The thing weve begun  
Is much more than a pastime  
For this time is the one  
Where the first time is the last time  
  
Ive got beginners luck  
Lucky through and through  
Cause the first time that Im in love  
Im in love with you  
  
Bridge  
  
The thing weve begun  
Is much more than a pastime  
For this time is the one  
Where the first time is the last time  
  
Ive got beginners luck  
Lucky through and through  
Cause the first time that Im in love  
Yes the first time that Im in love  
Oh the first time that Im in love  
Im in love with you  
Im in love with you  
Im in love with you  
Im in love with you
