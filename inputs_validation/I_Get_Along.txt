Feeling like Im stuck in a hole  
Body and soul  
While youre out of control  
Now I know why you had to go  
Well I think we both know  
Why it had to be so  
Ive been trying not to cry  
When Im in the public eye  
Stuck here with the shame  
And taking  
My share of the blame  
While making  
Sudden plans that dont include you  
  
Chorus  
I get along get along  
Without you very well  
I get along very well  
  
Now I know youd much rather be  
With rock royalty  
Instead of someone like me  
The big boys are back and we need them you said  
Think it was something youd read  
And it stuck in your head  
Even though I dont suppose  
Thats as far as it goes  
Youve go quite an appetite  
For being wronged and in the right  
Well from now on it wont affect me  
  
Chorus  
  
The morning after the night before  
Id been alerted  
To your lies  
I phoned you up  
Your calls were all diverted  
Took a long time to track you down  
Even then you were defiant  
Its not what you think it is you said  
And proceeded to deny it  
  
So I lost my patience at last  
And it happened so fast  
You belong in the past  
Ive been trying not to cry  
When Im in the public eye  
Stuck here with the shame  
And taking  
My share of the blame  
While making  
Sudden plans that dont include you  
  
Chorus
