There aint nothing in the bottom of your glass  
For a broken heart  
You were doing pretty good till she came  
And tore your world apart  
She found a little younger model  
You ran straight for the bottle  
There aint nothing in the bottom of your glass  
For a broken heart  
  
Do you find yourself tossin and a turnin  
In the middle of the night  
With a cigarette burning  
Staying up until the broad daylight  
Well you gotta be going crazy  
With another man lovin on your baby  
There aint nothing in the middle of the night  
For a broken heart  
  
Chorus  
There aint never been a cure for the lowdown blues  
When a woman puts on a pair of walking shoes  
You ought to know by now  
Theres nothing son that you can do  
For a broken heart  
  
Aint nothing when the morning finally comes  
Gonna change a thing  
A little hair of the dog aint gonna hurt you  
Have yourself a drink  
She found another lover  
I sure feel for you brother  
Aint nothing in the whole wide world for a broken heart  
  
Chorus
