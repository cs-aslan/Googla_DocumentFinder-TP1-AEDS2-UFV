Hello and welcome my friend  
Its good to see you again  
Do you know anything new  
Tell me is this really you  
Hey whats the story in LA  
I havent been there today  
Its time we went for a ride  
Come on and step right inside  
  
Too many people have waited  
Too many problems created  
Too many jitterbugs not enough jive  
Im tired of sitting here waiting  
We should be out there creating  
Its times like this that Im glad Im alive  
  
Darkness our sole destination  
Daylight our only intention  
White lightning brightens the sky  
Cant tell were flying so high  
Rest now and dont be afraid  
Cant you see weve got it made  
Just cause Im not going far  
That doesnt mean that we cant reach the stars  
  
Too many people have waited  
Too many problems created  
Too many jitterbugs not enough jive  
Im tired of sitting here waiting  
We should be out there creating  
Its times like this that Im glad Im alive  
  
Too many people have waited

Sad story that look in your eyes  
Break out before its too late  
Now come and lay down by my side  
Let all the thoughts slip away  
  
Too many people have waited  
Too many problems created  
Too many jitterbugs not enough jive  
Im tired of sitting here waiting  
We should be out there creating  
Its times like this that Im glad Im alive  
Im alive  
Alive
