Into the abyss Ill fallthe eye of Horus  
Into the eyes of the nightwatching me go  
Green is the cats eye that glowsin this temple  
Enter the risen Osirisrisen again  
  
Chorus  
Tell me why I had to be a power slave  
I dont want to die Im a god why cant I live on  
When the Life Giver dies all around is laid to waste  
And in my last hour  
Im a slave to the power of death  
  
When I was living this liefear was my game  
People would worship and falldrop to their knees  
So bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed me  
For he is a man and a godand he will die too  
  
Chorus  
  
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins  
Silent the terror that reignedmarbled in stone  
Shell of a man God preserveda thousand ages  
But open the gates of my hellI will strike from the grave  
  
Chorus
