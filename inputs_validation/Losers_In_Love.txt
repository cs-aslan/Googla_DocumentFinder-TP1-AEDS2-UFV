Losers  losers  losers  losers  
  
The moment I saw your face  
Your eyes swept me away  
The moment I heard your voice  
I knew wed touch someday  
But were losers in love  
Afraid of what we feel  
Please dont turn away  
Just because Im beeing real  
Cause Ive been through this before  
And I dont want to be a loser in love  
  
Loser  loser  
I dont want to be  
Loser  loser  
  
I know its not my time so Ill be on my way  
Ill never forget your smile  
And I wont forget this day  
Cause were losers in love  
In a time of empty dreams  
Just two losers in love  
Afraid of what we feel  
Please dont turn me away  
Cause I dont want to be losers in love
