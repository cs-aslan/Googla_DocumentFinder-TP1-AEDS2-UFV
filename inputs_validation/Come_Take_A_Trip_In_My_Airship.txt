And she spread her wings and she flew  
Yup the nation was flying now  
Taken to the air in few hours time you could fly over  
All those trails blazed by the pioneers  
  
Phonographs were playing the hit songs of the day  
Alexanders ragtime band  
My mother was a lady and heres a song my mama sing  
Back about 1910 or 1915  
  
Come take a trip in my airship  
Come take a trip round the stars  
Come take a sail around Venus  
Come take a sail around Mars  
  
No one to watch while were kissin  
No one to see while we spoon  
Come take a trip in my airship  
Well visit the man in the moon
