You thought shed cared for you and so you acted smart  
Go on and break your crazy heart  
You lived on promises I knew would fall apart go on and break your crazy heart  
You never would admit you were mistaken  
You didnt even know the chances you were taken  
I knew you couldnt meant Ive told you from the start  
Go on and break your crazy heart  
 piano  guitar   
I knew youll wake up and find her missin  
I tried my best to warn you but you wouldnt listen  
You told me I was wrong you thought that you were smart  
Go on and break your crazy heart
