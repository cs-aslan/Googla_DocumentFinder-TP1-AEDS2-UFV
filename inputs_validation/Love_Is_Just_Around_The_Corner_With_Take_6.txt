Oh my love is just around the corner  
Any cozy little corner  
Love is just around the corner  
When Im around you  
  
And Im a sentimental mourner  
And I couldnt be forlorner  
When you keep me in the corner  
Just waiting for you  
  
Now Venus de Milo was noted for her charm  
But strictly between us  
Youre cuter than Venus  
And whats more youve got arms  
  
So lets go cuddle in a corner  
Any cozy little corner  
Love is just around the corner  
When Im around you  
  
Now Venus de Milo was noted for her charm  
But strictly between us  
Youre cuter than Venus  
And whats more youve got arms  
  
So lets go cuddle in a corner  
Any cozy little corner  
Love is just around the corner  
When Im around you  
When Im around you when Im around you
