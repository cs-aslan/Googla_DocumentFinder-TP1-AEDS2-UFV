Swing To The Right Lyrics  
Swing to the right  
Try to face the fact that I aint that young no more  
Hairs short again and a suit is in  
  
Better brush up on how to tie a Windsor knot  
Swing to the right  
Credits hard to find and a dollar doesnt go so far  
Whats more important when the count comes in  
  
A sellout whos alive or a corpse that cant be bought  
Stop the hand of time  
Think I see a sign  
Tables turning round  
  
Hear a different sound  
Stop the hands of time  
Looking out for mine  
Swing to the right  
  
Dont want to hear what the povertous expect from me  
Let em eat cake if they feel that way  
I gotta work why should I have to pay for that  
And I dont want to be left holding the bag for them  
  
Scuze me for living but I have to say  
Ive got some worries of my own like staying fat
