Shes a little lost girl in her own little world  
She looks so happy but she seems so sad  
Ah ah oh yea oh oh oh yea  
Shes a little lost girl in her own little world  
Id like to help her Id like to try  
Ah ah oh yea oh oh oh yea  
  
She talks to birds she talks to angels  
She talks to trees she talks to bees  
She dont talk to me  
Talks to the rainbows and to the seas  
She talks to the trees  
She dont talk to me  
Dont talk to me  
  
You know she drives me outta my mind  
You know she drives me outta my head  
  
She talks to birds  
Shes a little lost girl in her own little world  
She looks so happy but she seems so sad  
Ah ah oh yea oh oh oh yea  
Shes a little lost girl in her own little world  
Id like to help her Id like to try  
Ah ah oh yea oh oh oh yea  
  
She talks to birds she talks to angels  
She talks to trees she talks to bees  
She dont talk to me  
Talks to the rainbows and to the seas  
She talks to trees  
She dont talk to me  
Dont talk to me  
She dont talk to me  
Dont talk to me  
She dont talk to me  
Dont talk to me  
She dont talk to me  
Dont talk to me
