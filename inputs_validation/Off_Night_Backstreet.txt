Maybe Im just kidding myself when I say I love you  
I dont know  
Loving without trusting  
You get frostbite and sunstroke  
I wish I felt nothing  
You pimp laughing and strutting her to my chartered seat  
Your old off night back street  
  
Its been stinger to stinger darling  
Its been heart to heart  
You still keep me from finishing  
Any new love I start  
Now shes moved in with you  
Shes keeping your house neat  
And your sheets sweet  
And Im your off night back street  
  
I can feel your fingers  
Feeling my face  
There are some lines you put there  
And some you erase  
Maybe Im just dramatizing  
I dont care  
Its home it can be heaven  
When we play fair  
But these sentimental journeys  
Late at night  
High in some back room youre calling me  
To be your off night back street  
  
You give me such pleasure  
You bring me such pain  
Who left her long black hair  
In our bathtub drain
