Down by the sea  
I found your hidden treasure  
Just you and me  
We overdosed on pleasure  
  
Yonnies in the wind  
Were ruggin up for winter  
Putting out the bins  
In cold and windy weather  
  
Down by the docks  
Live all the silent seaships  
Crates are stored on blocks  
Where now only the rats live  
  
Sail me down the river  
Till we reach the shore  
Diving into the center  
Eating out the core  
  
Down on the beach  
Saluting Captain Benbow  
Always out of reach  
Its quiet when the tides low  
  
Climbing up the cliffs  
You can see for miles far  
The boat that ran adrift  
Is sitting on the sandbar  
  
Laughing at the waves  
That storm the river mouth  
The ice is on the move now  
Creeping north and south  
  
Down by the sea  
I found your hidden treasure  
Just you and me  
We overdosed on pleasure  
  
Listen to your heart  
Screamin at the sky  
Cant you feel it tremble  
Dont you wonder why
