Hey hey hey  
La la la la la  
Hey hey hey  
La la la la la  
  
You come from here  
I come from there  
  
You rock out in your room  
I rock a world premiere  
  
Were more alike than  
Anybody could ever tell  
Ever tell  
  
Friday were cool  
Monday were freaks  
  
Sometimes we rule  
Sometimes we cant even speak  
  
But we can kick it up and  
Let loose and lol lol  
  
It may seem cliche  
For me to wanna say  
That youre not alone  
  
And you can call me uncool  
But its a simple fact  
I got your back  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Cause were one and the same  
Were something more than ordinary  
One and the same  
I think were almost legendary  
You and me the perfect team  
Chasing down the dream  
Were one and the same  
Hey hey hey  
Lalalalala  
  
Im kind of like you  
Youre kind of like me  
  
We write the same song  
In a different key  
  
Its got a rhythm  
You and me  
Can get along  
Get along  
  
And it may seem cliche  
For me to wanna say  
That youre not alone  
  
And you can call me uncool  
But its a simple fact  
I still got your back  
  
Cause were one and the same  
Were anything but ordinary  
One and the same  
I think were almost legendary  
You and me the perfect team  
Shaking up the scene  
Were one and the same  
  
Cause were one and the same  
Were anything but ordinary  
One and the same  
Were something more than momentary  
  
Cause were one  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Cause were one  
I think were almost legendary  
Were anything but ordinary  
You and me the perfect team  
Chasing down the dream  
Oh you and me the perfect team  
Shaking up the scene  
Were one and the same  
  
Hey hey hey  
La la la la la
