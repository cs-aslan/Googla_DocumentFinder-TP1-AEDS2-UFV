There you stood on the edge of your feather  
Expecting to fly  
While I laughed I wondered whether  
I could wave goodbye  
Knowin that youd gone  
By the summer it was healing  
We had said goodbye  
All the years wed spent with feeling  
Ended with a cry  
Babe ended with a cry  
Babe ended with a cry  
  
I tried so hard to stand  
As I stumbled and fell to the ground  
So hard to laugh as I fumbled  
And reached for the love I found  
Knowin it was gone  
If I never lived without you  
Now you know Id die  
If I never said I loved you  
Now you know Id try  
Babe now you know Id try  
Babe now you know Id try  
Babe
