So now love is gone  
And I cant go on  
Love is gone  
I want to say now its just too late  
Waited far too long  
  
Shoulda told you then I knew  
Shoulda told you right from the start yeah  
But the words didnt come out right  
So Ill tell you straight from my heart  
  
You meant more to me  
Then I let you see  
You held on somehow  
All your tenderness and your sweet caress  
I miss you now  
  
But a head strong stubborn man  
Only works it out the best he can  
Valentines he never sent  
Theres not enough time hes a working man  
  
Chorus  
Cant stop falling  
Heartaches calling  
Finds you after the fall  
Saints or sinners  
Take no prisoners  
Whats left after you fall  
No not much no  
  
I said love is gone  
I cant go on  
Now love is gone  
I want to say but its just too late  
Waited far too long  
  
Shoulda told you then I knew  
Shoulda told you right from the start yeah  
But the words didnt come out right  
So Ill tell you straight from my heart  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh no not much  
After the fall  
After you fall  
After you fall
