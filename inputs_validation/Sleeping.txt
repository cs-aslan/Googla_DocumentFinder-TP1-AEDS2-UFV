I toss and turn Im turning around but I cannot sleep  
Im hypnotized Im paralyzed by a different beat  
I hear your voice getting louder now yet so out of reach  
But Im mistaken its only the echo of you  
  
And Im not sleeping now that youre gone  
I cant help feeling I did you wrong  
And the night goes on and on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on  
  
A crowded bar the mating game so Im out of place  
Its so bizarre she coming onto me but I see your face  
The DJ plays familiar songs and it takes me back  
But Im mistaken its only the echo of you  
  
And Im not sleeping now that youre gone  
I cant help feeling I did you wrong  
And I need healing its been so long  
And the night goes on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on  
  
I hear your voice I hear your voice calling  
I hear your voice on and on and on and on  
  
I toss and turn Im turning around but I just cant sleep  
Im hypnotized Im paralyzed  
  
And Im not sleeping now that youre gone  
I hear your voice calling  
And I cant help feeling I did you wrong  
I hear your voice calling  
And I need healing its been so long  
I hear your voice calling  
And I m not sleeping now that youre gone  
I hear your voice calling  
  
I cant help feeling I did you wrong  
I hear your voice calling  
And I need healing its been so long  
I hear your voice calling  
And I m not sleeping now that youre gone  
I hear your voice calling  
I cant help feeling I did you wrong  
I hear your voice calling
