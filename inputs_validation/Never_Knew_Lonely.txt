No other lover ever really cared  
When Ive reached out for you youve always been there  
Now Im so far away and baby Im scared  
I never knew lonely til you  
  
You are my rock and the strength I need  
To keep me sane in this life that I lead  
Now Im not with you and my broken heart bleeds  
I never knew lonely til you  
  
I never knew lonely could be so blue  
I never knew lonely could tear you in two  
I never loved someone like I love you  
I never knew lonely til you  
  
I cant make up for the times Ive been gone  
But Ill prove I love you in the words of this song  
Back in your arms girl its where I belong  
I never knew lonely til you  
  
I never knew lonely could be so blue  
I never knew lonely could tear you in two  
I never loved someone like I love you  
I never knew lonely til you
