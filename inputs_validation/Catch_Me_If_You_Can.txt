White sands swollen glands  
Paris Tokyo New New New York MMMMexico  
Stay plastic woo ooh  
Stay tragic woo ooh  
Proclamation of emancipation  
Oh dear lord let me into heaven for just an afternoon  
  
Oh Sam I a  
I cant go to sleep without Ambien  
Seem so happy call me mister goodbye  
Say catch me if you can catch me if you can  
  
Lets talk about the scene for a minute  
I know we aint been seen in a minute  
We left before a minute now we all love in it  
Baby boy if you got the big dreams gonna get it  
Never been the type in tight jeans I wont fit in  
When I see them scene girls that they all gonna get in  
And Im living clean now while you all walk in it  
Notice me but I dont give a damn if you all dont get it
