When I was young  
I fell in love  
She was a goddess  
With a world inside of her mind  
When she moved on  
Something went wrong  
She took my power  
And the love I had inside  
Now that I found you  
I dont know how to  
  
If I could fall  
In love again  
Id fall in love with you  
  
If I could change  
A grain of sand  
Into a pearl I would  
  
I pray in time  
Ill come to find  
Away to break through  
And save this heart of mine  
Youve waited long  
If you cant hold on  
I wouldnt blame you  
I dont think Id be that strong  
What am I to do  
If I cant have you  
  
If I could fall  
In love again  
Id fall in love with you  
  
If I could change  
A grain of sand  
Into a pearl I would  
  
You love me so  
Even though I dont know  
How do you deal  
With a man like me  
  
If I could fall  
In love again  
Id fall in love with you  
  
If I could change  
A grain of sand  
Into a pearl I would  
I would I would I would
