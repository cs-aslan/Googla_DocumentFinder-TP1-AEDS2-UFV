I aint gonna call Hank Williams Jr Jr anymore  
Even though I know what all his daddy done before  
Hank weighs close to two hundred pounds and he stands about six foot four  
And its hard to call Hank Williams Jr Jr anymore  
Just a little bit of Waylon sure goes a long way  
But old Tex Ritter rode his horse and that was hell to pay  
Willie said dont nobody lay a hand on the bay  
Jimmie Rodgers is the only reason that Im standin here today  
And I aint gonna call Hank Williams  
 guitar   
Hank sang it all right from the heart took the whole world by surprise  
Stood right next to Elvis in Memphis and looked him straight in the eyes  
Ten years later young Bocephus busted through the door  
And I just cant call Hank Williams Jr Jr anymore  
I aint gonna call Hank Williams  
Ten years later young Bocephus
