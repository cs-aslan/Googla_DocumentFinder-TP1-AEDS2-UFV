I never ever thought Id live away  
From everyone I love and say goodbye  
Now Im the princess of a downtown train  
Where everybody here they know my game  
But when I walk down the street I hear them say  
There she goes that crazy girl  
She thinks shes something in this world  
  
So Ima close my ears and dream  
Cause life is never really what it seems  
In every mystery theres a truth  
You know Im tellin Im tellin you  
  
No matter lightning or thunder  
Buckets of rainwater  
You cant flood this town  
  
In a world unknown  
Youve gotta hold your own  
You cant stop me  
Youre never ever gonna stop me now  
  
On every street there is a memory  
A time and place where we can never be again  
Street lights glow green red and yellow too  
Do you let signs tell you what to do  
Yeah when you say stop  
Be sure that Ill say go  
To the stars in the land  
  
Fire cant burn these hands  
But I just close my eyes and dream  
You cant deny me my astronomy  
  
In every mystery theres a truth  
You know Im tellin Im tellin you  
  
No matter lightning or thunder  
Buckets of rainwater  
You cant flood this town  
  
In a world unknown  
Youve gotta hold your own  
And you cant stop me  
Youre never ever ever gonna stop me now  
  
Go ahead and dont believe  
Cause everyone needs a way to dream  
And love and you cant stop me  
No you cant stop me  
  
No matter lightning or thunder  
Buckets of rainwater  
You cant flood this town  
  
In a world unknown  
Youve gotta hold your own  
And you cant stop me  
Youre never ever ever gonna stop me  
  
No matter lightning or thunder  
Buckets of rainwater  
You cant flood this town  
  
In a world unknown  
Youve gotta hold your own
