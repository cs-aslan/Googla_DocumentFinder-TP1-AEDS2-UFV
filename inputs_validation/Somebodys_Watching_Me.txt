Whos watching  
Tell me whos watching  
Whos watching me  
  
Im just an average man  
With an average life  
I work from nine to five  
Hey hey Ill pay the price  
  
All I want is to be left alone  
In my average home  
But why do I always feel like  
Im in the twilight zone  
And  
  
I always feel like  
Somebodys watching me  
And I have no privacy  
I always feel like  
Somebodys watching me  
Tell me is it just a dream  
  
When I come home at night  
I bold the door real tight  
People call me on the phone  
Im trying to avoid  
But can people on TV see me  
Or am I just paranoid  
  
When Im in the shower  
Im afraid to wash my hair  
Cause I might open my eyes  
And find someone standing there  
  
People say Im crazy  
Just a little touched  
But maybe showers remind me  
Of Psycho too much  
Thats why  
  
I always feel like  
Somebodys watching me  
And I have no privacy  
I always feel like  
Somebodys watching me  
Whos playing tricks on me  
  
Whos watching me  
I dont know anymore  
Are the neighbors watching me  
Well is the mail man watching me  
Tell me whos watching  
And I dont feel safe anymore  
Oh what a mess  
I wonder whos watching me now  
Who  
The IRS  
  
I always feel like  
Somebodys watching me  
And I have no privacy  
I always feel like  
Somebodys watching me  
Tell me is it just a dream  
  
I always feel like  
Somebodys watching me  
And I have no privacy  
I always feel like  
Somebodys watching me  
Whos playing tricks on me  
  
I always feel like  
Somebodys watching me  
I always feel like  
Somebodys watching me  
Tell me who can it be  
  
I always feel like  
Somebodys watching me  
I always feel like  
Somebodys watching me  
Whos playing tricks on me  
  
I always feel like  
Somebodys watching me  
Can I have my privacy
