Everybody thinks Ive got it all  
Nobody really does do they  
Ive got more than I desire more than I ever dreamed but  
Theres always a price you pay  
Its been an amazing road  
Ive been blessed I know  
At the end of the day I go home alone  
  
Chorus  
I still hope some day Ill have a wife and kids  
Smiling faces running to the door when I walk in  
Saying daddys home you were gone too long  
Whatd ya bring me swing me let me show you what I did  
I still dream about that look on a womans face  
That says I love you through the good the bad the sunshine or the rain  
Sometimes I wish I had someone to share my life with  
Maybe Ill have a wife and kids  
Maybe someday  
  
Maybe I could have a son  
Play football in the back yard  
Or take my daughter fishing  
And when she turned fifteen  
Teach her how to drive a car  
When I grow old and theyve all left home  
I wanna lay beside my wife  
Talk about the old times remember all the good times  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes I wish I had someone to share my life with  
Maybe Ill have a wife and kids  
Someday  
  
Ill have a wife and kids  
Maybe someday
