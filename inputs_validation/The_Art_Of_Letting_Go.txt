Here we go again  
Round and round again  
Gettin nowhere fast  
Its the same old thing  
  
One more final scene  
Never meant to last  
Wholl be the first one whos leaving  
Wholl be the last one to cry  
  
Something just keeps me believing  
In our love tonight  
  
Chorus  
I cant seem to say goodbye  
Though Ive tried a million times  
The more I learn the less I know  
About the art of letting go  
  
So we take our time  
And we make our moves  
Oh so carefully  
Old ways seem so safe  
Habits hard to break  
When youre here with me  
  
I dont know how hard to hold you  
No easy way to be free  
Something just keeps me believing  
That were meant to be  
  
Chorus  
  
For we all feel  
And we all know  
Its not easy  
Letting go  
  
Chorus  
  
We got beyond letting go  
We got beyond letting go  
You gotta let go  
You gotta let go  
Yeah yeah
