Lifes been good  
Lifes been bad  
Now I know  
What I had  
Has taken its toll on me  
  
Yes we give  
And we take  
What we get  
Is what we make  
Believe that dreams come true  
  
Life is crazy  
Were not fools no no  
  
The price is high  
When you keep the score  
Take your souls  
And your goals  
To the top  
  
Together we stand  
We wont take no more  
Cause were winners  
And winners take all  
  
Together we stand  
We wont take no more  
Cause were winners  
And winners take all  
  
We have loved  
Burned by fate  
But for once  
Set the record straight  
Time does heal all wounds  
  
You have laughed  
We have cried  
Paid our dues  
Yes were turned the tide  
Mistakes are far and few  
  
We need no guidance  
Our aim is true  
  
Down the road  
There were many tolls  
But we know  
Cause weve grown  
What we need  
  
Together we stand  
We wont take no more  
Cause were winners  
And winners take all  
  
Together we stand  
We wont take no more  
Cause were winners  
And winners take all  
  
The price is high  
When you keep the score  
Take your souls  
And your goals  
To the top  
  
Together we stand  
We wont take no more  
Cause were winners  
And winners take all  
  
Together we stand  
We wont take no more  
Cause were winners  
And winners take all
