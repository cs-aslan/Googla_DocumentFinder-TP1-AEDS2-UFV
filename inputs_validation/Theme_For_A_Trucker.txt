So youre a trucker  
Hard driver  
Mr king of the road  
Feelin lonely  
Drinkin coffee  
She had only ever known  
Drove a lot today  
Was it yesterday  
Just a memory you know  
You cant dilute it  
Or see to it  
Roll through it  
You head home  
There is a motel with a vacancy  
There is no possibility  
You could drive yourself to ever be  
The man you once were

Drove a lot today  
Was it yesterday  
Its just a memory you know  
You cant see through an old tune  
Roll through it  
And head home  
There is a motel with a vacancy  
There is no possibility  
But you could drive yourself to ever be
