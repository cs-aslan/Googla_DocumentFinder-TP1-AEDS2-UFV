Every time I think of you  
My heart starts movin like a freight train  
And having you is tearing me apart  
I dont really need the pain no  
  
Sometimes I feel like leavin for good  
But Im a fool who wouldnt leave you  
Even if I could  
  
Chorus  
Cant hold on cant let go  
Cant hold on cant let go  
Cant hold on cant let go  
I cant hold on I cant let go  
  
Every time you touch me well you know  
I feel the blood rushing through my veins  
Girl you mean so much to me thats the reason  
Why youre driving me insane  
  
Oh every night Im losin too much sleep  
I cant give up cause now Im in too deep with you  
  
Chorus  
  
I cant live with you I cant live without you  
I still dont know just what Im going to do about you  
Heart to heart Id never run away  
Its time to part but I cant say goodbye  
  
I love you so muchcant hold on  
Need you so muchcant let go  
But youre tearing me apartcant hold on  
Ohcant let gocant let go  
Cant hold oncant let go  
Cant let gooh no no
