The time is now to take my wares to the street  
And I know how the streets been good to me  
Maybe its the sign of a wise man  
Maybe its the sign of a fool  
Maybe its the night for a rendezvous with a woman like you  
  
Its gone too far Ill take my life into the streets  
I feel the need and I cant stop myself  
Maybe its time to be a strong man  
Maybe its time to be cool  
Maybe Ill take to the boulevard  
Where theres nothing I wont do  
  
Can you tell me where my heart is  
When Im looking for love in the midnight  
Theres a burning in my body  
And Im looking for love in the midnight  
  
Better hold on tight Im a ravenous man  
Ill tell you anything to make you think Im alright  
You know the moonlight brings out the devil in me  
For tomorrow Ill regret it in the daylight  
  
Can you tell me where my heart is  
When Im looking for love in the midnight  
Wont you tell me where my heart is  
When Im looking for love  
  
Better hold on tight Im a ravenous man  
Ill tell you anything to make you think Im alright  
You know the moonlight brings out the devil in me  
For tomorrow Ill regret it in the daylight  
  
Can you tell me where my heart is  
When Im looking for love in the midnight  
Theres a burning in my body  
And Im looking for love in the midnight  
Wont you tell me where my heart is  
When Im looking for love
