In the big city where the lights are low  
Cold dirty ground where the rivers dont flow  
Nothings gonna change so throw it all away  
In the big city where the kids will come cheap  
And monsters prowl and never sleep  
Dont cross the road if you havent got the time of day  
Well I lost my girl waitin for the train from Ride  
I know shes out there somewhere  
Selling all we got but I dont mind  
In the big city you can walk a thin line  
And your mother wont know that you do a bit of crime  
Your fathers on the dole and he really hasnt got the time  
In the big city where its hard to see the sky  
Black earth trembles when the trains go by  
Bums on the corner tell you gently crawl up and die  
Well I lost my girl and I missed my train to Ride  
And Im stuck here sellin papers  
And spittin on the ground when you walk by  
Break  
In the big city you can dance all night  
Only if youre clean and the lads are not uptight  
Or you may as well forget it until the broad daylight  
In the big city where the suits dont look you in the eye  
Learn how to laugh youll be plannin when to die  
Dont expect favours when the cars go passing by  
I lost my girl waitin for the train from Ride  
Well I dont mind matching colours or parkin peoples cars  
And telling little lies if thats alright  
In the big city in the big city in the big city  
In the big city in the big city in the big city
