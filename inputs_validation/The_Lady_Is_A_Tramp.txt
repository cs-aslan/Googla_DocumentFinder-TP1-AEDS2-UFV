She gets too hungry for dinner at eight  
She loves the theater but doesnt come late  
Shed never bother with people shed hate  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
Doesnt like crap games with barons and earls  
Wont go to Harlem in ermine and pearls  
Wont dish the dirt with the rest of those girls  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
She loves the free fresh wind in her hair  
Life without care  
Shes broke but its ok  
She hates California its cold and its damp  
Thats why the lady is a tramp  
Doesnt like dice games with sharpies and frauds  
Wont go to Harlem in Lincolns or Fords  
Wont dish the dirt with the rest of those broads  
Thats why the lady is a tramp
