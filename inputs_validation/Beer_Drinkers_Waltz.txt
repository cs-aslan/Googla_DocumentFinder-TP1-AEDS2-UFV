Chorus  
The band played and everyone talked  
Through the plain old Beer Drinkers Waltz  
  
Well they sweated and swore and they spit on the floor  
Where the cigarette butts were all thrown  
They wrote on the wall and hid out from the law  
And the whole gang was drunk drivin home  
  
Chorus  
  
Some little snuff queen who was barely sixteen  
Played an out of tune Yamaha guitar  
Some old boy named Wink who brought his own drinks  
Had his fiddle stoled out of his car  
  
Chorus  
  
The man tendin bar told the boy on guitar  
He was adrinkin a little too much  
They announced on the mic that they left on the lights  
In a dark blue Chevrolet truck  
  
Chorus  
  
Well somewhere in the heavens theres a sevenoseven  
And theyre aservin champagne in first class  
Somewhere upstairs a child says its prayers  
Oh but downstairs theyre havin a blast  
  
Chorus
