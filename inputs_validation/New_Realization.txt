The time has come to reach a new realization tween me and you  
Time to clear the rumors sensations and things that just are untrue  
Well I thought I heard you behind me  
With a knife straight for my back  
Its quite clear that Im back in the swing of living  
Although I might not be on the right track  
  
Oh thought I might drown but its hard to be givin  
Downtowns wheres youll find me do some and got a hand  
Although I never listen girl I damn well understand  
And you think Im so damn feeble  
I cant see through your lies youre just a crock of shit  
With a pretty smile and I refuse to compromise  
  
Oh dont give me such a heavy heavy heavy load  
  
You may hold some vision of truth if truth can found in a lie  
Maybe some grain of inspiration for song thats deep inside  
  
Oh tears running down your face  
Just screaming look me in the eye  
Well Im licking straight at your twisted face  
And its enough to make me cry  
  
Oh I payed the price of loving you  
In more ways than one  
Wrapped around your finger but I think my time has come  
But I never can be too sure cause I like to have a little fun  
  
Oh what fun it would be to blow my mind and fall into the sun  
A mind is a precious thing to taste
