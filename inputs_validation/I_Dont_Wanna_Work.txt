Well I give it little care  
Does anybody out there even know  
Im in here  
I just keep my movement going  
Somewhere  
Like playing in the background baby  
Like playing in the background baby  
  
I play the game  
You play the way that most men would choose  
Im surprised at you  
Way back in the middle of a broken down love affair  
You and I found each other  
And we fell in love  
I aint never met a man and woman get along better  
Than you and I when get together  
Still I say  
I dont wanna work that hard  
  
I dont wanna work that hard  
Dont wanna work that hard  
I dont wanna work that hard  
Dont wanna work that hard  
I dont wanna work that hard  
Not if it makes me cry  
No no  
  
See the lady walking down the street  
Shes got on high heel shoes  
And her hair full of curlers  
Shes got stiletto nails  
And some black mascara  
Shes got a push up and a pick up  
I tell you that girls working overtime  
  
I dont wanna work that hard  
I dont wanna work that hard  
I dont wanna work that hard  
Dont wanna work that hard  
I dont wanna work that hard  
Not if it makes me cry  
No no no no no no  
I dont wanna work  
I dont wanna work that hard  
I dont wanna work it if makes me cry  
  
Spent last night  
Talking to myself in bed  
Wondering why I do this over  
Over and over again  
I dont know  
I I I I dont wanna work that hard  
I dont wanna work that hard  
Not when it makes me cry  
  
I dont wanna work that hard  
I dont wanna work not that hard  
I dont wanna work it it makes me cry  
I dont wanna work that hard  
I dont wanna work not that hard  
I dont wanna work if it makes me cry
