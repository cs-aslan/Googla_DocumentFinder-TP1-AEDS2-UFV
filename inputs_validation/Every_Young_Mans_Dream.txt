She was my guiding light  
She was my day and night  
I hung on every word no matter wrong or right  
She could raise me up to heights Ive never seen  
  
And the coming of age is every young mans dream  
Oh oh shes every young mans dream  
Oh oh shes every young mans dream  
  
She was the first for me  
She wet my thirst for me  
If I was feeling down  
She was a nurse for me  
She could take me up to heights Ive never been  
And the coming of age is every young mans dream  
  
Oh oh shes every young mans dream  
Oh oh shes every young mans dream  
Oh oh shes every young mans dream  
Oh oh shes every young mans dream  
  
Oh tu es toujours dans mon coeur  
I like to raise my glass  
I like to praise the past  
Some things go on forever  
Some things never last  
She could raise me up  
She was my fantasy  
And the coming of age is every young mans dream  
  
Oh oh shes every young mans dream  
Oh oh shes every young mans dream  
Oh eres siempre en mi mente  
  
She was my guiding light  
She was my day and night  
I hung on every word no matter wrong or right  
She could raise me up to heights Ive never seen  
And the coming of age is every young mans dream  
  
Oh oh shes every young mans dream  
Oh oh shes every young mans dream  
Oh oh shes every young mans dream  
Oh oh shes every young mans dream
