Whos got the stuff that made the Wild West wild  
Who pleases evry woman man and child  
Who does his best to give the customers a thrill  
Who  
Colonel Bufflo Bill  
  
Whos got the show that gets the most applause  
Five hundred Indians and fifty squaws  
Ten feature acts and theres the special feature still  
Who  
Colonel Bufflo Bill  
  
Did you ever see a cowboy rope a steer  
No we havent  
Or an Indian with feathers throw a spear  
No we havent  
Or a marksman shoot an earring from an ear  
No we havent  
Did you ever see a hold up  
No sir  
Then gather closer  
And let me give you some of the atmosphere  
  
The hour is midnight and all is still  
We see the stagecoach climbing up a hill  
Going along a mountain trail carrying passengers and mail  
Never suspecting danger as they roll along  
The watchful driver is in his seat  
His trusty rifle lying at his feet  
Some of the passengers inside seem to be dozing as they ride  
Never suspecting there is something really wrong  
  
Suddenly theres a shout  
What is it all about  
What is it all about you ask Its Indians  
Indians  
Indians  
Indians  
Very notable cut your throatable Indians  
Indians  
  
Just when theyve taken evryone by force  
Who makes an entrance on a big white horse  
Who starts a shootin till theres no one left to kill  
Genral Grant  
No Colonel Bufflo Bill  
  
Certainly this is quite a thrill better than all the vaudeville  
Let us be on the go and see the show with Bufflo Bill
