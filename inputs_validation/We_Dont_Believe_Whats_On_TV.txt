Verse 1  
We dont believe whats on TV  
Because its what we want to see  
And what we want we know we cant believe  
We have all learned to kill our dreams  
  
PreChorus  
I need to know  
That when I fail youll still be here  
Cause if you stick around Ill sing you pretty sounds  
And well make money selling your hair  
  
Chorus  
I dont care whats in your hair  
I just wanna know whats on your mind  
I used to say I wanna die before Im old  
But because of you I might think twice  
  
Verse 2  
Alright second verse  
What if my dream does not happen  
Would I just change what Ive told my friends  
Dont want to know who I would be  
When I wake up from a dreamers sleep  
  
PreChorus  
  
Chorus x2
