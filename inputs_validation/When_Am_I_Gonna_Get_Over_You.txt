You told me on the day that you left me  
To take real good care of myself  
But its so hard to do  
If I cant have you here to hold me  
When I want nobody else  
  
Chorus  
When am I going to get over you  
And stop living in the past  
When am I going to get over you  
  
When my pour heart beats its last  
Soon youll wake me and youll say Ive been dreaming  
Ill just have to wait til then  
Till my time here is done  
And the Angels come to take me  
Then Ill be with you again  
  
Chorus  
  
Someday I may love again  
But youll be with me here and there  
  
Chorus  
  
When my pour heart beats its last  
You told me on the day that you left me
