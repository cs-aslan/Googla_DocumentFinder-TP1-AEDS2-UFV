If you were king  
If you were king youd set me free  
But Id be too dumb  
Well Id be too dumb to ever leave  
  
Sometimes it is good  
Sometimes its as bad as it could be  
And sometimes its lost  
And sometimes its right in front of me  
  
I love it I hate it I feel like a whore  
I give it I take it I come back for more  
I build it I break it I even the score  
  
I thank you for the war  
I thank you for the Hollywood ending  
Give thanks for it all  
Cause lifes not as easy as it seems  
  
Sometimes its a rose  
And sometimes the smell is sobering  
Sometimes its a mouse  
And sometimes the sound is deafening  
  
Well I love it I hate it I feel like a whore  
I give it I take it I come back for more  
I build it I break it I even the score  
  
It feels like it beats you up  
It feels like it knocks you out  
It feels like a kiss on the mouth  
  
It feels like the saddest song  
Nothing can stop us now  
Feels like a kiss on the mouth  
  
Well I love it I hate it I feel like a whore  
I give it I take it I come back for more  
I build it I break it I even the score  
I love it I hate it I feel like a whore  
I give it I take it I come back for more  
I build it I break it I even the score  
I love it I hate it I feel like a whore  
  
It feels like it beats you up  
It feels like it knocks you out  
It feels like a kiss on the mouth  
  
It feels like the saddest song  
Nothing can stop us now  
Feels like a kiss on the mouth  
  
A kiss on the mouth  
  
A kiss on the mouth  
  
On the mouth
