Leaving town I found a flower that I could deserve  
Someone moves and someones bound to get their feelings hurt  
Im loving you youre out of range  
Wanted you youre out of range  
As I walked out into a world I feel a sudden chill  
I was bleeding put it good onto a daffodil  
Loving you youre out of range  
Wanted to youre out of range  
  
I dont want too much more than  
Than to be reborn  
In the morning  
Reborn so I can feel you  
The thorns are blooming with ya  
I feel you  
  
I have your number and I dialed it up a hundred times  
Barely there your voice is crackin up across state lines  
Loving you youre out of range  
Wanted you youre out of range  
Skies of ecstacy were breaking well I do believe  
The tears of God were falling down upon my swollen cheeks  
Loving you youre out of range  
Wanted you youre out of range  
I dont want too much more than  
Than to be reborn  
In the morning  
Reborn so I can feel you  
The thorns are blooming with ya  
I feel you  
I know it hurts when its taken away  
I tell you that I could be living  
Today with you or without you ok  
Washed by the rain and its all gonna change  
I dont want too much more than  
Than to be reborn  
In the morning  
Reborn so I can feel you  
The thorns are blooming with ya  
I feel you  
No sir not too much more than  
Than to be reborn  
In the morning  
Reborn so I can feel you  
The thorns are blooming with ya  
I feel you
