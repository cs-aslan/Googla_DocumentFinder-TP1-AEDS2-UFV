Babys got a brand new hairdo but doesnt she look so nice  
She said everything that she cares to shes saying it not once but twice  
She said it doesnt matter unless I say it matters  
Well I dont care about all that modern jazz  
The girl that used to have it and the girl I still have  
Shes the girl that used to have it and the girl I still have  
Babys got a brand new hairdo and doesnt she look so fine  
She said everything that she used to  
Except shes picking your heart not mine  
She said it doesnt matter unless I say it matters  
  
I dont care about all that modern jazz  
The girl that used to have it and girl I still have  
Shes the girl that used to have it and the girl I still have  
Babys got a brand new hairdo and doesnt she look so good  
She looks like Billy Boy Arnold said I wish you would  
I wish you would  
Babys got a brand new hairdo I wonder whats left inside  
She used to  at med school before she learned how to be snide  
She walks in the place and everybody scatters  
I dont care about all the modern girls  
Shes the girl that I used to have and the girl I still have  
She the she the
