Am I waking to this magic  
Am I seeing all is human  
Human after all  
  
I want to be inside your heart  
Are you ready  
I want to love forever  
Are you thinking  
I want to be inside your heart  
What Im thinking  
I want to know youre with me  
  
Highways stairways many ways  
To be open tonight  
High time look inside  
Your life I am waiting  
  
I am waiting are you ready  
I am waiting can you hear me  
Can you hear me  
  
It happened in the water  
The heaven will fall  
The break in the water  
The secret birth  
  
Said she loves me I believe her  
Waited lifetimes say this to you  
  
I want to be inside your heart  
Are you ready  
I want to love forever  
Are you thinking  
I want to be inside your heart  
What Im thinking  
I want to know youre with me  
  
Highways stairways many ways to be open tonight  
High time look inside  
Your life I am waiting  
Say you need me Im yours  
Say you need me just because  
Its our freedom  
Its our freedom hear me now  
We are made to be here now  
Well be waiting for the word  
As the healing of the world  
Make the promises to be true  
All my life my world is you  
  
I am waiting are you ready  
Are you ready  
I am waiting Can you hear me  
Can you hear me
