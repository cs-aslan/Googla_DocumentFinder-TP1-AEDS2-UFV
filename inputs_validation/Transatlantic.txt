3000 miles across the sea are you waiting there for me  
Im stuck here in this state so I must communicate  
Dont know just where you are just know that youre too far  
Theres only one thing I can do  
  
Chorus  
Gonna send my love to you Transatlantic  
Beam my message through  
Gonna find your frequency Transatlantic  
Send it ESP  
  
through the static in the air I will transmit that I care  
Do you read me loud and clear yes thats my heartbeat that you hear  
No phone no radio the telegrams too slow  
Im going crazy without you  
  
Gonna send my love to you Transatlantic  
Beam my message through  
Gonna find your frequency Transatlantic  
Send it ESP  
  
SOS in distress  
Close my eyes for your reply  
Do you read me  
Will you reach me  
  
Transistor tube and microchip  
Wont bring me closer to your lips  
Send a kiss out through the night  
Like a laser beam of light  
No underwater train no supersonic rain  
Is fast enough to get to you  
  
Gonna send my love to you Transatlantic  
Beam my message through  
Gonna find your frequency Transatlantic  
  
Will you  
Will you read me  
Send my love Transatlantic  
I want to know  
Do you read me
