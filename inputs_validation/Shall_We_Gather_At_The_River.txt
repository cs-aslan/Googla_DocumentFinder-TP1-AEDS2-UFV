Shall we gather at the river  
Where bright angels feet have trod  
With its crystal tides forever  
Flowing by the throne of God  
  
Yes well gather at that river  
The beautiful the beautiful river  
Gather with the saints at that river  
That flows by the throne of God  
  
When we reach that shining river  
Well lay every burden down  
Then grace our spirits will deliver  
And will receive our robe and crown  
  
Yes well gather at that river  
The beautiful the beautiful river  
Gather with the saints at that river  
That flows by the throne of God  
  
Soon well reach that silver river  
Soon our pilgrimage will cease  
Soon our happy hearts will quiver  
With the melody of peace  
  
Yes well gather at that river  
The beautiful the beautiful river  
Gather with the saints at that river  
That flows by the throne of God  
  
Oh yes well gather at that river  
That flows by the throne of God  
That flows by the throne of God
