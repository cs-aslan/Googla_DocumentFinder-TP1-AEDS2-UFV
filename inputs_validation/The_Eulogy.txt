If you could see them  
The bullet riddle brothers you thought were brave  
The thugs the gangstas  
If you could hear them right now as they knock on heavens door  
They would tell you straight up  
Stop the sht  
The shootin the bangin  
Too many tears  
Too many wakes  
Too many twentyfive to lifes  
And wake up  
Theyre up there right now talkin to you in tongues of fire  
For the love of life  
Stop it  
Yo if you dont stop Im gonna get you before you get yourself
