Now everybodys got a crazy notion of their own  
Some like to mix up with a crowd some like to be alone  
Its no one elses business as far as I can see  
But every time that I go out the people stare at me  
  
With my little ukulele in my hand of course the people do not understand  
Some say why dont you be a scout why dont you read a book  
But I get lots more pleasure when Im playing with my uke  
  
Of course I take no notice you can tell  
For mothers sound advice will always stand  
She said My boy do what I say and youll never go astray  
If you keep your ukulele in your hand yes son  
Keep your ukulele in your hand   
  
While walking down the prom last night as peaceful as can be  
When some young girl said what about a stroll down by the sea  
She said her name was Jane and that shed just come for the day  
She looked so young and harmless that I couldnt turn away  
  
So with my little ukulele in my hand I took a stroll with Jane along the
sand  
We walked along for miles without a single care or frown  
But when we reached the sand hills she said Come on lets sit down  
I felt so shy and bashful sitting there cause the things I said she didnt
understand  
She said Your love just turns me dizzy come along big boy get busy  
But I kept my ukulele in my hand yes sir I kept my ukulele in my hand  
  
Made up my mind that Id get wed some eighteen months ago  
I also bought a book about the things you want to know  
But just about a week ago I got a awful fright  
I had to get dressed quickly in the middle of the night  
  
And with my little ukulele in my hand I ran along the road for Dr Brand  
It didnt take him long to get his little bag of tools  
I held his hat and coat and let him have my book of rules  
Out of the bedroom door he looked and smiled  
  
He said Come inside and see your wife and child  
My heart it jumped with joy I could see it was a boy  
For he had a ukulele in his hand oh baby  
He had a ukulele in his hand
