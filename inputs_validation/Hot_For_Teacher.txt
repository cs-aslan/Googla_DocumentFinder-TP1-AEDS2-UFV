Oh wow man  
Wait a second man Whaddaya think the teachers gonna look like this year  
My butt man  
TTTeacher stop that screaming teacher dont you see  
Dont want to be no uptown fool  
Maybe I should go to hell but Im doin well  
Teacher needs to see me after school  
  
Chorus  
I think of all the education that I missed  
But then my homework was never quite like this  
Got it bad got it bad got it bad  
Im hot for teacher  
I got it bad so bad  
Im hot for teacher  
  
Hey I heard you missed us were back  
I brought my pencil  
Gimme something to write on man  
I heard about your lessons but lessons are so cold  
I know about this school  
Little girl from cherry lane how can you be so bold  
How did you know that golden rule  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh man I think the clock is slow  
I dont feel tardy  
Class dismissed
