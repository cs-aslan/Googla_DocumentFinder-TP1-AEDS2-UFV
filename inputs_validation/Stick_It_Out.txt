Trust to your instincts  
If its safely restrained  
Lightning reactions  
Must be carefully trained  
  
Heat of the moment  
Curse of the young  
Spit out your anger  
Dont swallow your tongue  
  
Stick it out  
  
Dont swallow the poison  
Spit it out  
Dont swallow your pride  
Stick it out  
Dont swallow your anger  
Spit it out  
Dont swallow the lies  
  
Natural reflex  
Pendulum swing  
You might be too dizzy  
To do the right thing  
  
Trial under fire  
Ultimate proof  
Moment of crisis  
Dont swallow the truth  
  
Stick it out  
  
Each time we bathe our reactions  
In artificial light  
Each time we alter the focus  
To make the wrong moves seem right  
  
You get so used to deception  
You make yourself a nervous wreck  
You get so used to surrender  
Running back to cover your neck  
  
Stick it out
