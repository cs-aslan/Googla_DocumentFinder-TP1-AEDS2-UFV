If I had a dollar  
For every time  
You broke my heart  
Messed up my mind  
  
Well Id be the richest man  
Id be the richest man  
 In the world  
  
If bad times paid interest  
Id have you to thank  
Id be driving a new car  
Have money in the bank  
  
Id be the richest man  
Id be the richest man  
 In the world  
  
Baby Money cant buy love  
The kind I dream of is so hard to find  
For a good womans touch in the morning when I rise  
Well baby Id give up every single dime  
  
Money cant buy love  
The kind I dream of is so hard to find  
For a good womans touch in the mrning when I rise  
Baby Id give up every single dime  
  
If teardrops were diamonds from the African mines  
If heartaches were silver  
My whole life would shine  
And Id be the richest man  
Id be the richest man  
 In the world  
  
Baby
