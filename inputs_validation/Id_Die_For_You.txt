If you could see inside my heart  
Then you d understand  
Id never mean to hurt you  
Baby Im not that kind of man  
  
I might not say Im sorry  
Yeah I might talk tough sometimes  
And I might forget the little things  
Or keep you hanging on the line  
  
In a world that dont know Romeo and Juliet  
Boy meets girl and promises we cant forget  
We are cast from Edens gate with no regrets  
Into the fire we cry  
  
Chorus  
Id die for you  
Id cry for you  
Id do anything  
Id lie for you  
You know its true  
Baby Id die for you  
Id die for you  
Id cry for you  
If it came right down to me and you  
You know its true Baby Id die for you  
  
I might not be a savior  
And Ill never be a king  
I might not send you roses  
Or buy you diamond rings  
  
But if I could see inside you  
Maybe Id know just who we are  
Cause our love is like a hunger  
Without it we would starve  
  
In a world that dont know Romeo and Juliet  
Boy meets girl and promises we cant forget  
We are cast from Edens gate with no regrets  
Into the fire we cry  
  
Chorus
