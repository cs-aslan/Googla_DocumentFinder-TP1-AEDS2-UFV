Its good to know  
Ill have your love which ever way the wind blows  
A guiding light  
That will shine on though the darkest night  
When the world seems like its full of strangers  
And I feel as if Ive lost my way  
You lift me up on the wings of love  
Taking me higher still with every touch  
Whenever Im weak honey  
You take me there again  
On the wings of love  
Its all I need  
When you hold me and whisper tenderly  
That Im the one youll love forever  
What else could I want  
Even life where we all go through changes  
And when the dreams I have been swept away  
You lift me up on the wings of love  
Taking me higher still with every touch  
Whenever Im weak honey  
You take me there again  
On the wings of love  
Oh  
Im flying high  
Its all I need when you hold me close and you whisper tenderly  
On the wings on Love  
Higher still with ever touch  
Whenever Im weak honey  
You take me there again  
On the wings of love  
Oh  
You lift me up on the wings of love on the Wings of Love  
Higher still with every turn Higher still with every turn  
Whenever Im weak honey  
You take me there again  
On the wings of love  
On the wings of Love
