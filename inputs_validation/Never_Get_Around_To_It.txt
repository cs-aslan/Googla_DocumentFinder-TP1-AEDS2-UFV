STILL GOT YOUR PICTURE UP ON THE WALL  
I CANT TAKE EM DOWN  
I KEEP EXPECTING YOU TO CALL  
BUT YOU DONT MAKE A SOUND  
TIME AINT SUPPOSED TO PASS THIS SLOW  
I SHOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN YOU LONG AGO  
I JUST NEVER GET AROUND TO GETTING OVER YOU  
  
IM TIRED OF PUTTING IT OFF TILL TOMORROW  
SHOULDVE DONE IT YESTERDAY  
NO GAIN IN DROWNING IN MY SORROW  
AND JUST WASTING AWAY  
JUST WHEN I THINK I GOT IT MADE  
YOU NEVER FAIL TO GET IN THE WAY  
I JUST NEVER GET AROUND TO GETTING OVER YOU  
  
BRIDGE  
IF I COULD JUST CONVINCE MYSELF  
TO OPEN MY EYES AND SEE  
YOURE NOT THE ONE FOR ME  
THEN I COULD START ALL OVER  
AND GET ON WITH MY LIFE  
AND BE FREE FROM YOUR MEMORY  
I COULD BE FREE  
  
YOU SEE YOURE STILL HERE AFTER ALL THIS TIME  
AND I CANT ERASE YOU FROM MY MIND  
I JUST NEVER GET AROUND  
NEVER GET AROUND BABY  
NEVER GET AROUND TO GETTING OVER YOU
