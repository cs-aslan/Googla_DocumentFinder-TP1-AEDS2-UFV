Shoot bang no rhyme should I know why  
Im in love with you  
Shoot back just a fight should I justify  
Out of the blue  
  
Im the Rubberbandman with the rubberman touch  
Out of the blue love is such  
Rubberband man with the rubberband pack  
Youre the one youll get me back on track  
  
Shoot bang no rhyme should I know why  
Im in love with you  
Shoot back just a fight should I justify  
Out of the blue  
  
Everybody told me what they shouldnt do

Shoot back just a fight should I justify  
Out of the blue

Hoping when I see you Im back on by  
The Rubberbandman doin fine  
  
Shoot bang no rhyme should I know why

Shoot back just a fight should I justify
