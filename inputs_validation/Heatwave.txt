She likes it hot  
She likes a tan  
She steals my infra red when Im gone  
Oh no can it be  
Were heading for a heatwave  
  
Her legs are brown  
A trace of rust  
Shes in love with a mkii deluxe  
Oh no can it be were heading for a heatwave  
  
Her hair is bleached like its been boiled  
She browns herself in a sea of olive oil  
And I come around and shes relaxing  
In the conservatory
