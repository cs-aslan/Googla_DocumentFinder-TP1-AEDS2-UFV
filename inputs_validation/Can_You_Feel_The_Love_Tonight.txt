Theres a calm surrender  
To the rush of day  
When the heat of the rolling world  
Can be turned away  
An enchanted moment  
And it sees me through  
Its enough for this restless warrior  
Just to be with you  
  
And can you feel the love tonight  
It is where we are  
Its enough for this wideeyed wanderer  
That we got this far  
  
Can you feel the love tonight  
How its laid to rest  
Its enough to make kings and vagabonds  
Believe the very best  
  
Theres a time for everyone  
If they only learn  
That the twisting kaleidoscope  
Moves us all in turn  
Theres a rhyme and reason  
To the wild outdoors  
When the heart of this starcrossed voyager  
Beats in time with yours  
  
And can you feel the love tonight  
It is where we are  
Its enough for this wideeyed wanderer  
That we got this far  
Can you feel the love tonight
