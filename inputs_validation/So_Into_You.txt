When you walked into the room  
There was voodoo in the vibes  
I was captured by your style  
But I could not catch your eyes  
Now I stand here helplessly  
Hoping youll get into me  
  
I am so into you  
I cant think of nothing else  
I am so into you  
I cant think of nothing else  
Thinking how its going to be  
Whenever you get into me  
  
Its gonna be good dont you know  
From your head to your toe  
Gonna love you all over  
Over and over  
I am so into you  
Me into you you into me me into you  
  
I am so into you  
I cant get to nothing else  
I am so into you  
I cant get to nothing else  
Thinking how its going to be  
Whenever you get into me  
  
Cmon baby drivin me crazy  
Im so into you  
Love all the things you do
