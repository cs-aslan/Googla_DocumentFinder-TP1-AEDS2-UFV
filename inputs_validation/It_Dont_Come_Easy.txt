it dont come easy you know it dont come easy  
it dont come easy you know it dont come easy  
Got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues  
And you know it dont come easy  
You dont have to shout or leap about  
You can even play them easy  
Forget about the past and all your sorrow  
The future wont last  
It will soon be your tomorrow  
I dont ask for much I only want your trust  
And you know it dont come easy  
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time  
And you know it dont come easy  
Open up your heart lets come together  
Use a little luck and we will make it work out better  
Got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues  
And you know it dont come easy  
You dont have to shout or leap about  
You can even play them easy  
Please remember peace is how we make it  
Here within your reach is your freedom to take it  
I dont ask for much I only want your trust  
And you know it dont come easy  
de de de growing all the time  
And you know it dont come easy  
thank you
