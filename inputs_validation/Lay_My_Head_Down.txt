Oh the partys kicked up a few notches  
Look at us getting loose  
She leans back against the wall and she watches tugging her collar like it
might be a noose  
And everyones tied to their thing  
To their past or their drink or the date that they bring  
I just get tired all of sudden taking it in  
And I want to lay my head down on you  
Because youre the only solid thing in this room  
A room full of changes strangers illusion confusion  
I speak from my heart but Im not really sure if its true  
I wanna lay my head down on you  
Oh they say dont waste too much time planning  
Or youll get rug ripped out  
And the only way youll be satisfied  
Is learning to live without  
But some plan for the kingdom of heaven  
And some take their chances and bet lucky seven  
I dont know what to believe I just show up and breathe anymore  
And I wanna lay my head down on you  
Because youre the only solid thing in this room  
A room full of dressers professors lookers hookers  
If I dont get out Ill do something I dont wanna do  
And I wanna lay my head down on you  
Was it so long ago  
That we sat and talked in your car  
Your things were all packed  
And the place you were headed not really that far  
Years later I think  
That I would have been much more alive  
To have taken you up on your offer and taken that drive  
Oh well everything thats come before us leads us to where we are now  
And thats simple I know so why cant I let go of the feeling  
That Im lost somehow  
Im just a ghost looking in  
Out of my own life just visiting  
In search of a body to have and to hold and to keep and to sleep  
I wanna lay my head down on you  
Because youre the only solid thing in this room  
A room full of missed chance slow dance cold fate heartache  
I showed up for a party and saw my life story full view  
And I wanna lay my head down on you
