No one can hurt you now  
In this haven safe and sound  
No one can save you now  
From this grace you are drowning in  
Just hold your breath on your way down  
  
This fortress of tears  
Ive built from my fears for you  
This fortress wont fall  
Ive built it strong for you  
  
No one can free you now  
From the chains around your heart  
Dont be afraid now  
Just dive in this emptiness  
And hold your breath on your way down  
  
This fortress of tears  
Ive built from my fears for you  
This fortress wont fall  
Ive built it strong for you  
  
No one can hurt you now  
In this haven safe and sound  
Just hold your breath on your way down  
  
This fortress of tears  
Ive built from my fears for you  
This fortress wont fall  
Ive built it strong for you  
  
This fortress of tears  
Ive built from my fears for you  
This fortress wont fall  
Ive built it strong for you
