Wait in line  
Till your time  
Ticking clock  
Everyone stop  
  
Everyones saying different things to me  
Different things to me  
Everyones saying different things to me  
Different things to me  
  
Whoa  
Do you believe  
In what you see  
There doesnt seem to be anybody else who agrees with me  
  
Do you believe  
In what you see  
Motionless wheel  
Nothing is real  
Wasting my time  
In the waiting line  
Do you believe in  
What you see  
  
Nine to five  
Living lies  
Everyday  
Stealing time  
Everyones taking everything they can  
Everything they can  
Everyones taking everything they can  
Everything they can  
  
Whoa  
Do you believe  
In what you feel  
It doesnt seem to be anybody else who agrees with me  
  
Do you believe  
In what you see  
Motionless wheel  
Nothing is real  
Wasting my time  
In the waiting line  
Do you believe  
In what you see  
  
Ah and Ill shout and Ill scream  
But Id rather not have seen  
And Ill hide away for another day  
  
Do you believe  
In what you see  
Motionless wheel  
Nothing is real  
Wasting my time  
In the waiting line  
Do you believe  
In what you see  
  
Everyones saying different things to me  
Different things to me  
Different things to me  
Different things to me  
Different things to me  
Everyones taking everything they can  
Everything they can
