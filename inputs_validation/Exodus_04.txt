With you these streets are heaven  
Now home feel so foreign  
They told me I was mistaken infatuated  
And I was afraid to trust my hunches  
Now I am ready  
  
Daddy dont be mad that Im leaving  
Please let me worry about me  
Mama dont you worry about me  
This is my story  
  
Through mountains high and valleys low  
The ocean through the desert snow  
Well say goodbye to the friends we know  
This is our Exodus 04  
  
Through traffic jams in Tokyo  
New music on the radio  
Well say goodbye to the world we know  
This is our Exodus 04  
  
Landscapes keep changing  
History teaches something  
I know I could be mistaken but my heart has spoken  
I cannot redirect my feelings  
The waves have parted  
  
Daddy dont be mad that Im leaving  
Please let me worry about me  
Mama dont you worry about me  
This is my story  
  
Through mountains high and valleys low  
The ocean through the desert snow  
Well say goodbye to the friends we know  
This is our Exodus 04  
  
Through traffic jams in Tokyo  
New music on the radio  
Well say goodbye to the world we know  
This is our Exodus 04  
  
Im listening to a music never ending  
My baby dont you know Ill never let you down  
Youve opened me to so many different endings  
But baby I know that youll always be around  
  
Through mountains high and valleys low  
The ocean through the desert snow  
Well say goodbye to the friends we know  
This is our Exodus 04  
  
Through traffic jams in Tokyo  
New music on the radio  
Well say goodbye to the world we know  
This is our Exodus 04
