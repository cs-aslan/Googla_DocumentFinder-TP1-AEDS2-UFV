Fun Zone doesnt really have any lyrics  
People occasionally say yeah and other similar phrases  
But its generally just music  
  
In the movie  
It played in the background  
When Stanley rode out in the miniature fire engine  
At the beginning of an episode of Stanley Spadowskis Clubhouse  
  
The song is approximately  
1 minute and 45 seconds long  
But it did not play in its entirety in the movie
