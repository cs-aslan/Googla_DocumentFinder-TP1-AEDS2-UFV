Theres a new sensation a fabulous creation  
A danceable solution to teenage revolution  
Do the strand love when you feel love  
Its the new way thats why we say  
Do the strand  
Do it on the tables Quaglinos place or Mabels  
Slow and gentle sentimental  
All styles served here Louis seize he prefers  
Laissezfaire le Strand  
Tired of the tango fed up with Fandango  
Dance on moonbeams slide on rainbows  
In furs or blue jeans you know what i mean  
Do the strand  
  
Were playing our tune by the pale moon  
Were incognito down the Lido  
And we like the strand  
Had your fill of quadrilles the madison and cheap thrills  
Bored with the beguine the samba isnt your scene  
If you feel blue look through whos who  
See La Goulue and Nijinsky  
Do the strandsky  
Weary of the waltz mashed potato schmaltz  
The Sphinx and Mona Lisa Lolita and Guernica  
Rhododendron is a nice flower  
Evergreen it lasts forever  
But it cant beat the strand power  
Do the strand
