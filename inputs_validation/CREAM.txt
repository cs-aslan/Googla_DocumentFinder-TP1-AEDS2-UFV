I grew up on the crime side the New York Times side  
Staying alive was no jive  
At second hands moms bounced on old men  
So then we moved to Shaolin land  
A young youth yo rockin the gold tooth Lo goose  
Only way I begin to gee off was drug loot  
And lets start it like this son rollin with this one  
And that one pullin out gats for fun  
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend  
Started smokin woolies at sixteen  
And running up in gates and doing hits for high stakes  
Making my way on fire escapes  
No question I would speed for cracks and weed  
The combination made my eyes bleed  
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all  
Sticking up white boys in ball courts  
My life got no better same damn Lo sweater  
Times is ruff and tuff like leather  
Figured out I went the wrong route  
So I got with a sick ass click and went all out  
Catchin keys from across seas  
Rollin in MPVs every week we made forty Gs  
Yo nigga respect mine or anger the tech nine  
ChchickPOW Wu from the gate now

Its been twentytwo long hard years of still strugglin  
Survival got me buggin but Im alive on arrival  
I peep at the shape of the streets  
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep  
A man with a dream with plans to make CREAM  
Which failed I went to jail at the age of 15  
A young buck sellin drugs and such who never had much  
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not could not  
The court played me short now I face incarceration  
Pacin going up states my destination  
Handcuffed in back of a bus forty of us  
Life as a shorty shouldnt be so ruff  
But as the world turns I learned life is hell  
Living in the world no different from a cell  
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin chase sellin base  
Smokin bones in the staircase  
Though I dont know why I chose to smoke sess  
I guess thats the time when Im not depressed  
But Im still depressed and I ask whats it worth  
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth  
Who explained working hard may help you maintain  
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain  
We got stickup kids corrupt cops and crack rocks  
And stray shots all on the block that stays hot  
Leave it up to me while I be living proof  
To kick the truth to the young black youth  
But shortys running wild smokin sess drinkin beer  
And aint trying to hear what Im kickin in his ear  
Neglected but now but yo it gots to be accepted  
That what That life is hectic
