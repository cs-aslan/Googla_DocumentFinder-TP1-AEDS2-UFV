You left me hanging from a thread we once swung from together  
I licked my wounds but I cant ever see them getting better  
Somethings gotta change  
Things cannot stay the same  
  
Her hair was pressed against her face  
Her eyes were red with anger  
Enraged by things unsaid and empty beds and bad behavior  
Somethings gotta change  
It must be rearranged oh  
  
Im sorry  
I did not mean to hurt my little girl  
Its beyond me  
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world  
So goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight  
Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight  
Hope that things work out all right yeah whoa whoa  
  
The room was silent as we all tried so hard to remember  
The way it feels to be alive  
The day that he first met her  
Somethings gotta change  
Things cannot stay the same  
  
You make me think of someone wonderful but I cant place her  
I wake up every morning wishing one more time to face her  
Somethings gotta change  
It must be rearranged oh  
  
Im sorry  
I did not mean to hurt my little girl  
Its beyond me  
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world  
So goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight  
Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight  
Hope that things work out all right  
  
So much to love  
So much to learn  
But I wont be there to teach you oh  
I know I can be close  
But I try my best to reach you  
  
Im so sorry  
I did not mean to hurt my little girl  
Its beyond me  
I cannot carry the weight of a heavy world  
So goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight  
Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight  
Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight  
Hope that things work out all right yeah whoa oh yeah
