Im Marcus Licinius Crassus  
No rich man could ever surpass us  
Wanted people to say I was brave  
But I lost my first fight and hid in a cave  
Living there could be a paupers nightmare  
But if youre rich like me then you dont care  
I called my slave to the cave to ask it  
To cook a feast and lower in a basket  
  
Those Romans think theyre minted  
But they aint rich like me  
You cant call yourself loaded  
Till you can buy an army  
Ran Rome with Pompey and Caesar  
Theyre more famous than me  
But Im the worlds richest geezer  
Theres noone richer than me  
Im minted  
  
I back General Sulla  
Everyday my wallet got fuller  
Took the land off enemies to flog it  
Used the cash to fill my pocket  
If I heard of a house on fire  
Id rush over and be a quick cash buyer  
My fireman would then douse the flames boom  
Another big house to my name  
  
Those Romans think theyre minted  
But they aint rich like me  
You cant call yourself loaded  
Till you can buy an army  
Ran Rome with Pompey and Caesar  
Theyre more famous than me  
But Im the worlds richest geezer  
Theres noone richer than me  
Im minted  
  
I bought an army for fighting Spartacus  
At the start my men lost heartacus  
I killed on in ten in a killing spree  
So they were more scared of me than the enemy  
Smashed the slaves it got real gory  
But then Pompey stole my glory  
To show it was me that crushed the horde  
Nailed up the slaves like on a billboard  
Theyre splinted  
  
Not enough to be a politician  
Wanted triumph took my army on a mission  
Got owned by the Parthian Persians  
They killed me but youll hear two versions  
The famous ones quite hard to follow  
They gave me boiling gold to swallow  
But the true way they made me pay  
They used my head as a prop in a play  
Embarrasing  
  
Those Romans think theyre minted  
But they aint rich like me  
You cant call yourself loaded  
Till you can buy an army  
Ran Rome with Pompey and Caesar  
Theyre more famous than me  
But Im the worlds richest geezer  
Theres noone richer than me
