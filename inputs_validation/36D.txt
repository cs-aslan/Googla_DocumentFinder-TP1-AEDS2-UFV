Close your legs open your mind  
Leave those compliments well behind  
Dig a little deeper into yourself  
And you may find  
  
Come over here just sit right down  
Neednt comb your hair neednt pout or frown  
I hear youve turned our young men  
Into dribbling clowns  
  
36D so what D so what  
Is that all that youve got  
36D so what D so what  
Is that all that youve got  
  
Make their day and go ahead  
Remove your clothes lie on their bed  
Just a last gasp chance or an outside bet  
To the easily led  
  
And before you do just what you do  
Here one thought for you to chew  
The men who run the business that you sell  
They screw you too  
  
36D so what D so what  
Is that all that youve got  
36D so what D so what  
Is that all that youve got  
  
Youre just another 365 night stand  
But youre so handy youre so handy  
You cheapen and you nasty every woman in this land  
But youre so handy youre so handy  
  
Your pictures hanging pretty on the squaddies walls  
Youre Stevens Andys youre Ians youre Pauls  
Your bodys through of fondly in the rugby mauls  
But you want more  
  
36D so what D so what  
Is that all that youve got  
  
36D so what D so what  
Is that all that youve got  
  
36D so what D so what  
Is that all that youve got  
  
36D so what D so what  
Is that all that youve got
