I know you dont love me no more  
No more ah no more  
I dont wanna be hurt any anymore no no more  
Aint no use in me cryin now  
Everything I did you put me down  
I dont want you no more baby  
Aint no use in you hangin round  
  
I know you dont want me no more  
No more ah no more  
And with someone else  
Lovin you more lovin you more  
Aint no use in me cryin now  
If werent for you I wont be down  
Cause you dont want me no more baby  
Aint no use in you hangin round  
  
I know you dont love me no more  
No more no no more  
I dont wanna be hurt any anymore anymore  
I have loved so hard everything I did was no joy  
Since I cant love you right baby  
I dont have to love you at all  
  
I know you dont love me no more  
No more ah no more  
I dont wanna be hurt any anymore anymore  
I have loved so hard everything I did was no joy
