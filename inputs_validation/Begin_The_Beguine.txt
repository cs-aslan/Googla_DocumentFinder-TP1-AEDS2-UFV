When they begin the beguine  
It brings back the sound of music so tender  
It brings back the night of tropical splendor  
It brings back a memory evergreen  
  
Im with you once more under the stars  
And down by the shore an orchestras playin  
Even the palms seems to be swayin  
When they begin the beguine  
  
To live it again is past all endeavor  
Except when that tune clutches my heart  
And there we are swearin to love forever  
And promising never never to part  
  
What moments divine what raptures serene  
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted  
Now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted  
I know but too well what they mean  
  
So dont let them begin the beguine  
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember  
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember  
When they begin the beguine  
  
Oh yes let them begin the beguine make them play  
Till the stars that were there before return above you  
Till you whisper to me once more Darling I love you  
And we suddenly know what heaven were in  
When they begin the beguine  
When they begin the beguine
