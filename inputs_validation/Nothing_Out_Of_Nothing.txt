Left my home and family by the ocean  
Out on my own to seek my fortune  
But there is no work to occupy these young hands  
So look out boy youre heading for the mainland  
  
Chorus  
What do you do You cant make nothing out of nothing  
Everybody needs a start  
What do you do You cant make nothing our of nothing  
In my country back is heart  
  
Well I was born on a StJohns street  
Where all my hopes could meet with defeat  
I hide my fear in higher education  
Now I am so smart I could rule this contentnation  
  
Chorus  
  
Now Im alone but Im working everyday  
Im getting stoned and Im blowing all my pay  
Just to survive Ill do whatever I can  
Now Im alive but how can I be a real man  
  
Chorus
