Bobby band arockin  
And the bobby soxers doing the twist  
Its a bobby soxer beat  
And you can rock it any way you wish  
Work out bobby soxer you can  
Wiggle like a whimsical fish  
Go go bobby soxer  
Go go bobby soxer  
Go go bobby soxer  
Go go bobby soxer  
When the weekend comes  
Youll be right back rockin some more  
Bobby soxer dancin  
But she keeps peepin on the stand  
Bobby soxers got a crush  
On a beatle in the bobby band  
Love bug sure gonna bite her  
If the beatle even wave his hand  
Twist on bobby soxer  
But dont forget the bobby rule  
Its getting late bobby soxer  
And the teacher teachin you in school  
And tomorrow morning bobby soxer  
Youll be back in school
