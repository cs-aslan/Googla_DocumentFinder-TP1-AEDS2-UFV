Weve come to bring you home  
Havent we Cassiel  
  
To cast aside your loss and all of your sadness  
And shuffle off that mortal coil and mortal madness  
For were here to pick you up and bring you home  
Arent we Cassiel  
  
Its a place where you did not belong  
Where time itself was mad and far too strong  
Where life leapt up laughing and hit you hear on and hurt you  
Didnt it hurt you Cassiel  
  
While time outran you and trouble flew toward you  
And you were there to greet it  
Werent you foolish Cassiel  
  
But here we are weve come to call you home  
And here youll stay never more to stray  
Where you can kick off your boots of clay  
Cant you Cassiel  
  
For death and you did recklessly collide  
And time ran out of you and you ran out of time  
Didnt you Cassiel  
  
And all the clocks in all the world  
May this once just skip a beat in memory of you  
But then again those damn clocks they probably wont  
Will they Cassiel  
  
One moment you are there  
Then strangely you are gone  
But on behalf of us all here  
Were glad to have you home  
Arent we dear Cassiel
