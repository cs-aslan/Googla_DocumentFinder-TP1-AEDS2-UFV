Bye bye bye  
Im doing this tonight  
Youre probably gonna start a fight  
I know this cant be right  
Hey baby come on  
I loved you endlessly  
When you werent there for me  
So now its time to leave and make it alone  
  
I know that I cant take no more  
It aint no lie  
I want to see you out that door  
Baby bye bye bye  
  
Chorus  
Bye bye Dont want to be a fool for you  
Just another player in your game for two  
You may hate me but it aint no lie  
Baby bye bye bye  
Bye bye  
Dont want to make it tough  
I just want to tell you that Ive had enough  
It might sound crazy but it aint no lie  
Baby bye bye bye  
  
You just hit me with the truth  
Now girl youre more than welcome to  
So give me one good reason  
Baby come on  
Ive lived for you and me  
And now I really come to see  
That life would be much better once youre gone  
  
I know that I cant take no more  
Aint no lie  
I want to see you out that door  
Baby bye bye bye  
  
Chorus  
  
Im givng up I know for sure  
dont want to be the reason for your love no more  
Bye bye  
Im checking out Im signing off  
Dont want to be the loser and Ive had enough  
  
Dont want to be your fool in this game for two  
So Im leaving you behind  
Bye bye bye  
I dont want to make it tough  
Make it tough  
But Ive had enough  
Bye bye  
And it aint no lie  
  
Chorus
