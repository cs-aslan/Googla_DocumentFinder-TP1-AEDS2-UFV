I love to see your moves  
Its so devine you dance  
I love to see your moves  
Its so devine you dance  
When youre struttin your legs  
Aint no gravity on this planet  
When youre struttin your legs  
Aint no gravity anymore  
And I walkwalkwalk like an astronaut  
With your Monroesmile on the screen of my eyes  
And every giant step I take  
Melts the snow on the roof of the world  
And the stars like burning wheels roll by  
Burning wheels roll by  
Im the blossoms scent  
Since you stick in my soul like a flower  
Im a blossoms scent  
Since youre comin on down like a shower  
And my heart is a golden bell  
I cant keep it from tolling  
Yes my heart is a golden bell  
And I cant control it anymore
