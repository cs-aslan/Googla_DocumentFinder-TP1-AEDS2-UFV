Born under the wrong sign  
Trouble is my middle name  
Born under the wrong sign  
Every day turns out the same  
But its so hard to see the light  
When youre born under the wrong sign  
Wrong sign  
Wrong sign  
Cast outa the wrong mold  
Sorry is no way that I feel  
Cast outa the wrong mold  
Singin my blues is for real  
But its so hard to see the light  
When youre born under the wrong sign  
  
Born under the wrong sign  
Trouble is my middle name  
Born under the wrong  
Every day turns out the same  
But its so hard to see the light  
When youre born under the wrong sign  
Wrong sign  
Wrong sign
