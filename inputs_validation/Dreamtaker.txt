Oooohhhh ooohhhh  
  
I used to go out of my mind tryna re define the real meaning of love  
I lost my dignity forgot about me I was so lost in us  
I had to take on cause you had me stuck in the middle of nowhere  
And my faith it would shake I know youre trying your best to take me  
  
Chorus dream taker wont you leave me alone  
Been standing in the way for far too long  
Dream maker now its taking your place  
Im no longer asleep my heart is finally awake  
So goodbye good day farewell its okay  
Dream taker wont you leave me alone  
Cant wait til youre gone havent dreamt in so long  
  
You used to be the man of my dreams only now it seems you were just a
nightmare  
But this little light of mine told me open my eyes theres more than darkness
out there  
Im not gonna run from ya  
Imma walk from ya  
Im not afraid of ya  
Ive escaped from ya  
And my faith is in place  
In the night I no longer see your face  
  
Chorus  
Dream taker wont you leave me alone  
Been standing in my way for far too long  
Dream maker now its taking your place  
Im no longer asleep my heart is finally awake  
So goodbye good day farewell its okay  
Dream taker wont you leave me alone  
Cant wait til youre gone havent dreamt in so long  
  
Ooohhhhhhhhhh From ashes to ashes and dust to us  
Ooohhhh Im not gonna run from ya  
Imma walk from ya Im not afraid of ya  
Ive escaped from ya  
Im not gonna run from ya  
Imma walk from ya  
Im not afraid of ya  
Ive escaped from ya yeahhh  
  
Chorus Dream taker wont you leave me alone  
Been standing in my way for far too long  
Dream maker now its taking your place  
Im no longer asleep my heart is finally awake  
So goodbye good day farewell its okay  
Dream taker wont you leave me alone  
Cant wait til youre gone havent dreamt in so long  
Cant wait til youre gone havent dreamt in so long  
Cant wait til youre gone havent dreamt in so long
