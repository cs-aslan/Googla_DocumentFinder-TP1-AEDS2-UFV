And another one bites the dust  
But why can I not conquer love  
And I mightve got to be with one  
Why not fight this war without weapons  
And I want it and I wanted it bad  
But there were so many red flags  
Now another one bites the dust  
And lets be clear I trust no one  
  
You did not break me  
Im still fighting for peace  
  
Well Ive got thick skin and an elastic heart  
But your blade it might be too sharp  
Im like a rubber band until you pull too hard  
But I may snap when I move close  
But you wont see me move no more  
Cause Ive got an elastic heart  
Ive got an elastic heart  
Yeah Ive got an elastic heart  
  
And I will stay up through the night  
Lets be clear I wont close my eyes  
And I know that I can survive  
I walked through fire to save my life  
And I want it I want my life so bad  
And Im doing everything I can  
Then another one bites the dust  
Its hard to lose a chosen one  
  
You did not break me You did not break me no no  
Im still fighting for peace  
  
Well Ive got thick skin and an elastic heart  
But your blade it might be too sharp  
Im like a rubber band until you pull too hard  
But I may snap when I move close  
But you wont see me move no more  
Cause Ive got an elastic heart  
  
Well Ive got thick skin and an elastic heart  
But your blade it might be too sharp  
Im like a rubber band until you pull too hard  
But I may snap when I move close  
But you wont see me move no more  
Cause Ive got an elastic heart  
  
Well Ive got thick skin and an elastic heart  
But your blade it might be too sharp  
Im like a rubber band until you pull too hard  
But I may snap when I move close  
But you wont see me move no more  
Cause Ive got an elastic heart
