In the greenhouse  
Among the flowers  
You would linger linger there for hours  
Thats where I saw your face  
Your body dressed in lace  
Your secret hiding place  
In the greenhouse  
What were you thinking  
Was this the jungle  
I felt the good earth I felt the good earth rumble  
Thats where I saw your face  
Your body dressed in lace  
Your secret hiding place  
In the greenhouse  
Thats where I saw your face  
Your body dressed in lace  
Your secret hiding place  
In the greenhouse  
You were smiling  
The heat was rising  
The bloodred roses hypnotizing  
In the greenhouse  
You were waiting  
And the perfume was suffocating  
Thats where I saw your face  
Your body dressed in lace  
Your secret hiding place  
In the greenhouse
