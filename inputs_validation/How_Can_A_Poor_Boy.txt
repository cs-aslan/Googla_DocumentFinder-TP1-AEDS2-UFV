Had my congregation had my flock  
When I was a shepherd of men  
Chased the wild goose chased the pot of gold  
Chased the rainbows end  
  
How can a poor boy deliver this message to you  
How can a poor boy You dont believe anything thats true  
  
Had my rise had my downfall  
Now Im gonna rise up again  
Had my degrees my initiations  
Not speaking to the profane  
  
How can a poor boy get this message to you  
How can a poor boy when you dont believe a thing thats true  
  
Ive been anointed been appointed  
Even been magnified  
Spied a chapel all of gold  
The priest was laying down with the swine  
  
How can a poor boy get a little message to you  
How can a poor boy when you dont believe anything is true  
How can a poor boy get this message through to you  
How can a poor boy when you dont believe a single thing is true  
  
Watch the illusion of false security  
Play of the shadows that move  
Tell me what evil lurks in the hearts of men  
Only the shadow knows  
  
How can a poor boy get this message to you  
How can a poor boy when you dont believe a thing thats true for you  
When you dont believe a thing nothing thats true for you  
How can a poor boy ever get next to you
