Here I walk here I walk  
Looking for an angels wings in the den of the hawk  
  
Here I am here I am  
With a choice between an also ran and a sunbed tan  
  
And you thought youd found your own little look  
How I misjudged how I mistook  
And you thought youd found the style of your hair  
I guess tonight Ill take Ill take these troubles to  
the rocking chair  
  
So Ill take these highheeled shoes  
And yes Ill take these traditional views  
Ill take this deep despair  
Of a 30 year old square to the rocking chair  
  
Here I sit here I sit  
Looking for a warming smile in a house of cold wit  
Here I stand here I stand  
Torn between the balding drunk and no mans land  
  
And theyll tell you when youve reached your peak  
Where the wolfwhistle rung theres a deafening shriek  
Blowing kisses into thin air  
I guess tonight Ill take Ill take these troubles to  
The rocking chair  
  
So Ill take this awkward stance  
And Ill take this sexless dance  
Ill take this deep despair of a 30 year old square  
To the rocking chair  
  
Am I skinny A shade too fat  
Mmm my friend the cat knows all about that  
Am I happy  
Here I sit here I sit  
Just a little sad  
Looking for a warming smile in a house of cold wit  
Mmm my friend the cat knows all about that  
Am I skinny  
Here I walk here I walk  
A shade too fat  
Looking for an angels wings in the den of the hawk  
My friend the cat knows all about that
