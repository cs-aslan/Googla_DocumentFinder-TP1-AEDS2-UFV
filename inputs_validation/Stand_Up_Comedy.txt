Love love love love love  
Love love love love love  
  
I got stand up and tale a step  
You and I have been asleep for hours  
I got to stand up  
The wire is stretched in between our two towers  
Stand up in this dizzy world  
Where a lovesick eye can steal the view  
Im gonna fall down if I cant stand up  
For your love  
  
Love love love love love  
Stand up this is comedy  
The DNA lottery may have left you smart  
But can you stand up to beauty dictator of the heart  
I can stand up for hope faith love  
But while Im getting over certainty  
Stop helping God across the road like a little old lady  
Out from under your beds  
Cmon ye people  
Stand up for your love  
Love love love love love  
  
I gotta stand up to ego bet my egos not really the enemy  
Its like a small child crossing an eight lane highway  
On a voyage of discovery  
Stand up to rock stars Napolean is high heels  
Josephine be careful of small men with big ideas  
Out form under your beds  
Cmon ye people  
Stand up for your love  
Love love love love love  
  
God is love  
And love is evolutions very best day  
Soul rockin people moving on  
Soul rockin people on and on  
Cmon ye people  
Were made of stars  
Cmon ye people  
Stand up then sit down for your love  
  
Love love love love love  
Love love love love love
