Hail to the shaman and his cardboard drum and the riffraff  
Dancing in the sun  
I sing for thee  
Praise to the ugly and the dispossessed and the genius born of  
The vipers nest  
You have set me free  
Hey you cranks and you clowns with your heads hanging down  
I bring good tidings to you  
For all the talent that he has Jehovah dont play jazz like the devil do  
See the rose sprung from the heap of dung  
The shafthorse hot and heavy hung shamelessly  
Check the star dust oozing in the mud on it pilgrimage to flesh and blood  
Now aint that you and me  
Hey you Shakespeares in rags little heretics and hags  
To thine own self be true  
Well he may be beautiful and king but Jehovah he dont swing like the devil  
Birdman Birdman whats the word man  
Into the night we go  
Billie Billie knock me silly  
Sing to me soft and low  
Save me from losing my soul to a heaven as cold as ice  
Id sooner be a free man in hell than a prisoner in paradise  
So I toot my toot for the man with roots  
Hey fifer on the Eflat flute play on play on  
All you sinners and you infidels you you artful madmen bound for hell  
Come sing along  
Come on you pottytrained saints spouting isms and aints  
Dig the poetry my man  
Well all deference to his throne  
Gabriel he dont play no saxophone like Coltrane can  
Now save me from losing my soul to a heaven as cold as ice  
Id sooner be a free man in hell than a prisoner in paradise  
Id sooner catch fire than kill my desire  
Hail to the shaman and his cardboard drum and the riffraff  
Dancing in the sun  
I sing for you  
For all the talent he has Jehovah dont play jazz like the devil do  
Yeah the devil do  
Must admit he do  
Ah da devil do  
Birdman Birdman whats the word man  
Into the night we go  
Billie Billie knock me silly  
Sing to me soft and low  
Foll all the talent that he has Jehovah dont play no jazz
