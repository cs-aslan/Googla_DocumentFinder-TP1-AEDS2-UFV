Theres a silence in the city  
Theres nobody around  
And everyone that we knew  
Moved to higher ground  
  
Theres a shadow hanging overhead  
It lingers there alone  
Changing all we ever knew  
The changes start to show  
  
Theres a sorrow about to fall  
Theres a sorrow about to fall  
  
Theres a new sound in the wires  
And ears are to the ground  
And everything that once was ours  
Has slowly turned around  
  
Something happened to the seasons  
Started falling with the rain  
And something changed forever  
We gotta find a way  
  
Theres a sorrow about to fall  
Theres a sorrow about to fall  
  
Theres people in the photographs  
But they all had to run  
They went away to somewhere  
Beyond the setting sun  
  
Theres a sorrow about to fall  
Theres a sorrow about to fall  
  
Theres a sorrow about to fall  
Theres a sorrow about to fall  
  
Sorrow about to fall fall fall fall  
Sorrow about to fall  
Sorrow about to fall  
Sorrow about to fall
