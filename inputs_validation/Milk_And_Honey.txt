Gold and silver is the autumn  
Soft and tender are her skies  
Yes and no are the answers  
Written in my true loves eyes  
  
Autumns leaving and winter is coming  
I think that Ill be moving along  
Ive got to leave her and find another  
Ive got to sing my hearts true song  
  
Round and round the burning circle  
All the seasons one two and three  
Autumn leaves and then the winter  
Spring is born and wanders free  
  
Gold and silver bounds my heart on  
All too soon they fade and die  
And then Id know  
Thered be no others  
Milk and honey  
Where they lie
