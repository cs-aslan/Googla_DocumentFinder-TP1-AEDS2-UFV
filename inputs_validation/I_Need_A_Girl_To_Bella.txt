Chorus  
I need a girl wholl ride for me Keep her self real fly  
Damn near die for me Stand by my side  
Gon call for me Stand up and cry  
Pay my bail for me make sales for me  
Have a baby with This is what shell do  
Lie to industry Be my baby momma too  
Someone wholl never leave And always be true  
How I wish my wife could be you  
  
Loon  
I need a girl thatll ride for me  
Situation get real bitchll die for me  
Even step in the courtroom and lie for me  
Im talkin about right hand in the sky for me  
  
Do twentyfive for me nigga steal a pound for me  
Shorty probably blow a nigga to the sky for me  
And go and sit in a chair thatll fry for me  
And lord know if I die she gon cry for me  
  
Never say bye to me  
I cant deny shorty love is official  
Even though love aint the issue  
Shorty still smuggle the pistol  
  
Packin a gat then hug you and kiss you  
Show you love when other niggas that diss you  
You on the real  
Thats the type chick a nigga need  
  
The type smoke all a niggas weed  
And still move at a niggas speed  
Never a victim of a niggas greed  
Especially if she runnin round with a niggas seed  
  
Chorus  
  
P Diddy  
I had a girl that woulda died for me  
Didnt appreciate her so I made her cry for me  
Everyday she had tears in her eyes for me  
I caught a case shorty took the whole ride for me Thank you  
  
At first we were friends then became lovers  
You was more than my girl we was like brothers  
On late nights we would play fight under covers  
Now you gone cant love you like I really want to  
  
But every time I think about your pretty smile  
And we used to drive the whole city wild  
Damn I wish you woulda had my child  
A pretty little girl with Diddy style  
  
Shit is wild  
Now theses days that I reminisce  
About my little mami Ima always miss I miss you  
But long as you happy Ima tell you this  
  
Aint nothin thats broke that we cant fix  
Mamacita  
  
Chorus  
  
Loon  
Now I done seen chicks come and go  
Some in it for the love some want the dough  
But some of them confused and dont really know  
The difference between a woman and a silly ho  
  
But on the low  
Im a tell you how it really be  
Cause I be chillin where the young willies be  
Strip clubs sit buzzed spend twenty Gs  
Shit bugged stick dubs where they titties be  
  
P Diddy  
This nigga Diddy be chillin with the prauda mamis  
Posted up with the chick with the hottest body  
Yo shorty all on me little hot tamale  
But Im ride for you Daddy Then I got you mami  
  
Cause all I want to do is take care of you  
And do things that the playas aint prepared to do  
Like if I rock ice you gon wear it too  
Fuck wit me I have the whole world stare at you  
  
You feel me girl  
  
Chorus
