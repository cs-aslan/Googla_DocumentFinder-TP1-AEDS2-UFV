No one truly has the answers  
Every day I struggle through it once more  
Keep things bottled up never speaking my mind  
Misinterpreted Im doing just fine  
  
Every day I put a brave face on serves me well  
Feeling helpless facing it alone hard to tell  
That I can change who I am how I feel theres no end  
  
I have done what you asked of me  
Leaves me nothing to live for  
  
Coming undone way too high a price I should pay  
You keep your pride while I die inside every day  
No I cant lie anymore wont pretend Ive done all I can  
  
You cant imagine the hell Im going through  
Not asking you to save me  
Im too far from heaven  
  
Nothing you can do to change me  
But accept me as I am
