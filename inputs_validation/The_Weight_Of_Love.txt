Accept me for who I am  
That Im only human  
And there are more important things  
Then what we fight about  
We wont always see eye to eye  
We say hurtful things sometimes  
And it gets hard when you love someone so much  
  
Everybodys got highs and lows  
Its alright  
Its the weight of love  
Highs and lows its alright  
Oh Its the weight of love  
  
Remember our first kiss  
And how we melted in our seats  
There will never be a January  
As warm in Tennessee  
It was an angel in the night  
Nothings ever felt so right  
And even the stars over our backyard  
Dont shine sometimes  
  
Everybodys got highs and lows  
Its alright  
Its the weight of love  
Highs and lows its alright  
Oh Its the weight of love  
  
We will grow old together  
Even for worse or better  
Nothing will ever keep us apart  
  
Everybodys got highs and lows  
Its alright  
Its the weight of love  
Highs and lows its alright  
Oh Its the weight of love
