Springheeled Jim winks an eye  
Hell do hell never be done to  
He takes on whoever flew through  
Well its the normal thing to do  
Aah  
  
Springheeled Jim lives to love  
Now kissing with his mouth full  
And his eyes on some other fool  
So many women  
His head should be spinning  
Ah but no  
Ah but no  
But no  
Ah no  
  
Springheeled Jim slurs the words   
Theres no need to be so knowing  
Take life at five times the  
Average speed like I do  
Until Jim feels the chill  
Oh where did all the time go  
  
Once always in for the kill  
Now its too cold  
And he feels too  
Old  
Too old  
Mmm old  
  
La la la lala la
