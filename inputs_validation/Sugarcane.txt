Verse  
From my head to my toes  
I can hardly believe the things that I read are not  
That its hard fly it in your plane and drive it in your car  
Youre a superstar yes you are  
Signing autographs making people laugh  
Youll go far clever boy  
Girls just wanna be with you lawyers wanna deal with you  
  
Chorus  
Why dont you wake up  
And stop what youre doing right now  
You gotta be true  
You know you dont live forever  
Hey man its gotta be right  
Wake up right now stop what youre doing  
Youve gotta be true  
You know you dont live forever  
Hey man its gotta be right  
  
Verse  
Write a book about your life  
I can hardly believe the things that you need at home  
With your wife you treat it like a game but this made you pretty fame  
With perfect hair and your clothes  
Its just another day in a life of a superstar  
Its gotta be the way its the same no matter who you are  
  
Chorus  
Why dont you wake up  
And stop what youre doing right now  
You gotta be true

Wake up right now stop what youre doing  
Youve gotta be true  
You know you dont live forever  
Hey man its gotta be right

Take care over what you do  
You gotta take care of what you are  
You gotta take care of what youre not  
You gotta take care of what youve got  
  
Chorus  
Why dont you wake up  
And stop what youre doing right now
