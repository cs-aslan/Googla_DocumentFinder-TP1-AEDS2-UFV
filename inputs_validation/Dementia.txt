Dementia youre driving me crazy  
  
This is driving me crazy  
Dementia Dementia Dementia  
Every light in the night flickered in and out  
Every bone in my back shivered up and down  
Keep the pace in case all the magic dies  
Cause this is driving me crazy  
Every voice from my head shouted yes and no  
Every freight train that fought fought to stop and go  
Keep the pace in case all the magic dies  
Cause this is driving me crazy  
Be surprised Im a ghost keeping out of sight  
  
Open up your eyes youre a star in the summer night  
This is love this is war its insanity  
Dementia youre driving me crazy  
Dementia youre driving me crazy  
This is driving me crazy  
Every tear in my eyes dripping wouldnt drop  
Every disc in my spine shook and couldnt stop  
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies  
Cause this is driving me crazy  
Every hand let me go that I try to hold  
Every warm heart it loved left me feeling cold  
Keep the pace just in
