Love can be a many splendored thing  
Cant deny the joy it brings  
A dozen roses diamond rings  
Dreams for sale and fairy tales  
Itll make you hear a symphony  
And you just want the world to see  
But like a drug that makes you blind  
Itll fool ya every time  
  
Chorus  
The trouble with love is  
It can tear you up inside  
Make your heart believe a lie  
Its stronger than your pride  
The trouble with love is  
It doesnt care how fast you fall  
And you cant refuse the call  
See youve got no say at all  
  
Now I was once a fool its true  
I played the game by all the rules  
But now my worlds a deeper blue  
Im sadder but Im wiser too  
I swore Id never love again  
I swore my heart would never mend  
Said love wasnt worth the pain  
But then I hear it call my name  
  
The trouble with love is  
It can tear you up inside  
Make your heart believe a lie  
Its stronger than your pride  
The trouble with love is  
It doesnt care how fast you fall  
And you cant refuse the call  
See youve got no say at all  
  
Every time I turn around  
I think Ive got it all figured out  
My heart keeps callin  
And I keep on fallin  
Over and over again  
The sad story always ends the same  
Me standin in the pourin rain  
It seems no matter what I do  
It tears my heart in two  
  
The trouble with love is  
It can tear you up inside  
Make your heart believe a lie  
Its stronger than your pride  
The trouble with love is  
It doesnt care how fast you fall  
And you cant refuse the call  
See youve got no say at all
