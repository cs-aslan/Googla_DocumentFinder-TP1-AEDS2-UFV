In my life I see where Ive been  
I said that Id never fall again  
Within myself I was wrong  
My searching aint over and over  
I know that  
  
When you love a woman  
You see your world inside her eyes  
When you love a woman  
Well You know shes standing by your side  
A joy that lasts forever  
Theres a band of gold that shines  
Waiting somewhere oh yeah  
  
If I cant believe that someone is true  
To fall in love is so hard to do  
I hope and pray tonight  
Somewhere youre thinking of me girl  
Yes I know I know that  
  
Its enough to make you cry  
When you see her walking by  
And you look into her eyes  
  
When you love a woman  
When you love love love love  
When you love a woman  
You see your world inside her eyes
