Well theres a bridge and theres a river that I still must cross  
As Im going on my journey  
Oh I might be lost  
  
And theres a road I have to follow a place I have to go  
Well noone told me just how to get there  
But when I get there Ill know  
Cause Im taking it  
  
Chorus  
Step by step bit by bit  
Stone by stone yeah brick by brick oh yeah  
Step by step day by day mile by mile ooh ooh ooh  
  
And this old road is rough and ruined  
So many dangers along the way  
So many burdens might fall upon me  
So many troubles that I have to face  
  
Oh but I wont let my spirit fail me  
Oh I wont let my spirit go  
Until I get to my destination  
Im gonna take it slowly cause Im making it mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Say it baby dont give up  
You got to hold on to what you got  
Oh baby dont give up  
You got to keep on moving on dont stop yeah yeah  
I know youre hurting and I know youre blue  
I know youre hurting but dont let the bad things get to you  
  
Chorus  
  
Cmon baby got to keep moving  
Im taking it step by step bit by bit  
Stone by stone yeah stone by stone brick by brick  
Cmon baby  
Step by step keep on moving day by day day by dayee  
Mile by mile by mile by milego your own way  
Cmon baby got to keep moving bit by bit bit by bit bit by bit
