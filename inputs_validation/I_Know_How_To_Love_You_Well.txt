Its been a long time  
Since we walked down that aisle together  
And you became my wife  
And who wouldve thought You would fall for someone just like me  
For the best days of my life  
  
I may not be a poet  
Cause I aint so good on words  
I may not stand before you like a knight  
In shining armor  
I may not be the best of singers  
Theres better guys Ive heard  
But I know how to love I know how to  
Love you well  
  
You got your faults  
And I dont need to tell you Ive got mine  
But I guess they all even out  
Wherever I ride  
The thought of you turns water into wine  
And somehow I lose a crowd  
  
I may not drive a fancy car  
I dont know what its for  
I may not be the one who gets to  
Shower you with diamonds  
I may not be a rich man but you cant  
Call me poor  
Cause I know how to love I know how  
To love you well  
  
And as we skip the light fandango  
From that ole jukebox by the bar  
Now honey dont it make you wonder  
How we ever got this far  
  
I may not be a poet  
Cause I aint got much to say  
I may not stand before you like that  
Knight in shining armor  
I may not be the best of singers  
Honey thats ok  
Cause I know how to love  
I know how to love  
I know how to love you well
