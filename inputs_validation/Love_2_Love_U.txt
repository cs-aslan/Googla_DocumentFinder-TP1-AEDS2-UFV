Britney Spears  
I love to love ya  
  
I cant stop dreaming about you  
Your eyes make me melt away into the day  
One kiss on my neck drives me crazy crazy  
One touch leads you close enough  
For you I crave  
  
Aint got a worry in the world  
Aint got nothin to care about  
When youre around I cant be down  
Aint gotta hold me back from nothing  
Aint got a problem in the sky in the sky  
Aint gotta ever ask me why  
When youre around there aint no doubt  
You aint gotta hold me back just let me  
  
Hook  
Go go  
Watch me get down and  
Go go  
When I come around just let me go  
I love to love ya  
Go go  
Watch me go down and  
Go go  
When I come around just let me go  
I love to love ya  
I just cant help myself yeah  
  
I cant live one day without you  
No stopping the way I feel its so surreal  
Make me go ahh boy I lose it  
I just cant control myself its so intense  
  
Aint got a worry in the world  
Aint got nothin to care about  
When youre around I cant be down  
Aint gotta hold me back from nothin  
Aint got a problem in the sky in the sky  
Aint gotta ever ask me why  
  
When youre around there aint no doubt  
You aint gotta hold me back just let me  
  
Hook  
Go go  
Watch me get down and  
Go go  
When I come around just let me go  
I love to love ya  
Go go  
Watch me go down and  
Go go  
When I come around just let me go  
I love to love ya  
  
I wanna hold you wherever you are  
There aint no time thats wrong  
Aint no place thats too far  
Not a care in the world  
Just for you just for me  
Where a boy loves a girl and that girl  
That girl is me  
  
Aint got a worry in the world  
Aint got nothin to care about  
When youre around I cant be down  
Aint gotta hold me back from nothin  
Aint got a problem in the sky in the sky  
Aint gotta ever ask me why  
When youre around there aint no doubt  
You aint gotta hold me back just let me  
  
Hook  
Go go  
Watch me get down and  
Go go  
When I come around just let me go  
I love to love ya  
Go go  
Watch me go down and  
Go go  
When I come around just let me go  
I love to love ya
