We stumble in a tangled web  
Decaying friendships almost died  
And hide behind a mask of lies  
We twist and turn and we avoid  
All hope and salvage now devoid  
I see the truth behind your eyes  
So take all this noise to your brain  
And send it back again  
Ill bare the cost shed my skin call  
You up and then  
Ill say the words out loud  
  
You could resurrect a thousand  
Words to deceive me more and more  
A thousand words will give the  
Reasons why I dont need you  
Anymore  
  
Time manipulates your heart  
Preconceptions torn apart  
Begin to doubt my state of mind  
But I wont go down on what I said  
I wont retract convictions read  
I may perplex but Im not blind  
So take all this noise to your brain  
Send it back again  
Ill bear the cost shed my skin  
Call you up and then  
Ill say the words out loud  
  
You could resurrect a thousand  
Words to deceive me more and more  
A thousand words will give the  
Reasons why I dont need  
You anymore  
  
Ill say the words out loud Ill say  
A thousand words or more  
Manipulation Fabricaton  
Conversation Annihalation  
Ill say a thousand words or more  
Domination Frustration Elevation  
Procreation  
Ill say a thousand words our more  
  
You could resurrect a thousand  
Words to deceive me more and more  
A thousand words will give the  
Reasons why I dont need you anymore
