We all lern to box from the Midget Club  
Where we punch with love and did somebody good  
Its good to see you to see you nice  
If you do me one well well do you twice  
Were twice as likely were twice as right  
Right  
Right on right on  
Right  
Right on right on  
We all learnt to wash at the scrubbers club  
Where we ring out the dirt with a rud a dub dub  
Tell how you think if you think it was good  
Say it loud and clear so its understood  
You take it how you made it like I know you would  
Let it bled let it heal let me sleep its no good so  
Lets ride right on right on  
  
Honey hows your breathing  
If it stops for good well be leaving  
And honey hows your daughter  
Did you teach her what weve taught yer  
And if you didnt well you ought to do it now  
  
Well lets ride on ride on
