Let me rock you in my arms  
Ill hold you safe and small  
A refugee from the Seraphim  
With your rich girl rags and all  
  
Did your dreams die young were they too hard won  
Did you reach too high and fall  
And there is no rest for the ones God blessed  
And He blessed you best of all  
  
Your eyes seem from a different face  
Theyve seen that much that soon  
Your cheeks too cold too pale to shine  
Like an old and waning moon  
  
And there is no peace no true release  
No secret place to crawl  
And there is no rest for the ones God blessed  
And He blessed you best of all  
  
If tears unshed could heal your heart  
If words unsaid could sway  
Watch you melt into the night  
With adieu and rue the day  
  
Did your dreams die young were they too hard won  
Did you reach too high and fall  
And there is no rest for the ones God blessed  
And He blessed you best of all
