Never get angry at stupid people  
Though I go crazy at the dullness of my life  
Sit and I stare through a dusty window  
An empty face stares back at me and cries  
  
My vulnerability rushes up to me  
And Im left here  
The rebel without a cause  
And the deeper I delve into  
The consciousness of me with you  
The harder it gets  
I need to close my eyes  
What hurts me most  
Ill never see your eyes again  
  
Though I get weary doesnt mean that Im unwilling  
My body belies me Im a fertile mind  
And as I grow older the world forgets me  
And talks to me as if Im some kind of child  
  
Their insensitivity washes over me  
Til Im left here  
The rebel without a cause  
The deeper I delve into  
The consciousness of me and you  
The harder it gets  
I need to close my eyes  
  
What hurts me most  
Ill never see your eyes again  
The harder it gets  
I need to close my eyes  
I cant recollect  
Ill never see your eyes again  
I try to forget  
Ill never see your eyes again  
What hurts me most  
Ill never see your eyes again  
  
Dont touch me
