In the timbers to Fennario the wolves are running round  
The winter was so hard and cold froze ten feet neath the ground  
Dont murder me I beg of you dont murder me Please dont murder me  
  
I sat down to my supper twas a bottle of red whisky  
I said my prayers and went to bed thats the last they saw of me  
Dont murder me I beg of you dont murder me Please dont murder me  
  
When I awoke the Dire Wolf six hundred pounds of sin  
Was grinning at my window all I said was Come on in  
Dont murder me I beg of you dont murder me Please dont murder me  
  
The Wolf came in I got my cards we sat down for a game  
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades but the cards were all the same  
Dont murder me I beg of you dont murder me Please dont murder me  
  
In the backwash of Fennario the black and bloody mire  
The Dire Wolf collects his dues while the boys sing round the fire  
Dont murder me I beg of you dont murder me Please dont murder me  
No no no dont murder me I beg of you  
Dont murder me Please dont murder me
