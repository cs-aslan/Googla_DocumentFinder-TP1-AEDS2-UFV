I hoped I wouldnt miss you long  
But I still cant believe youre gone  
And I still miss you just as much as always  
I hoped Id get you off my mind  
Its been a long time but I find  
That I still think of you as much as always  
As much as always as much as always  
Just as much as always  
As much as always just as much as always  
I still miss you still think of you  
Just as much as always as much as always  
Just as much as always  
I still want you still need you  
Just as much as always  
I hoped that Id find someone else  
But theres too much of you still left  
And I still love you  just as much as always  
I hoped that Id forget your touch  
But I still want it just as much  
And I still need it just as much as always  
As much as always as much as always  
Just as much as always  
As much as always just as much as always  
I still miss you still think of you  
Just as much as always  
As much as always just as much as always  
I still love you oh I do love you  
Just as much as always  
As much as always as much as always  
I still love you still want you just as much as always  
As much as always just as much as always  
I still need you still love you  
Just as much as always
