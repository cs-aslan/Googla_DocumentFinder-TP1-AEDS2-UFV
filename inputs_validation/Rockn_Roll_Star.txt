I was just a boy when the river ran dry  
And I can still remember my mama cry  
She said Son leave as fast as you can  
But dont waste your life in this rock n roll band  
I saw the light and left as fast as I could  
I knew deep down it was gonna do me good  
So I threw my Fender in an old friends car  
I knew Id come home a rock nroll star  
  
So we hit the road but the road hit back  
We thought wed take the world with a hit and run attack  
Now Im center stage but it feels bizarre  
Despite new cars and caviar  
  
An overnight success created by the press  
But theyll eat you up if you show them any stress  
So I lick my wounds and I hide my scars  
The whole world thinks Im a rock n roll star  
  
Rock n roll star rock n roll star  
Thats what they call you  
Thats not what you are  
Rock n roll star rock n roll star  
I still wanna be a rock n roll star  
  
So we got a break in our whirlwind tour  
I called home said Im comin home for sure  
Im tired of hurry up make the plane jump in the car  
Im home on loan Im a rock n roll star
