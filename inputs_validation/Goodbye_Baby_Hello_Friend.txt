Ill never write another song  
For someone who just comes along   
The very thought of losing you  
Is too much for me to  
The other day when you got mad  
It made you happy to see me sad  
I wish to tell you its still the same  
Still playing that same old game  
Its goodbye baby hello friend  
Its good to meet you after all this time  
Goodbye baby hello friend  
Its good to see you again repeat  
Those days and nights I lost  
Thinking bout what to do   
When all its really down to baby  
Is saying that were through  
So give your love to the birds  
Speaking of fourletter words  
Do you hear what I say to you  
Im not in love with you  
Goodbye baby hello friend  
Its good to see you again repeat
