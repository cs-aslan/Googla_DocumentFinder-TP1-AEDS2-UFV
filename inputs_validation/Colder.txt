Its getting colder  
Im standing looking down  
Theres not a sound around the town  
Its getting colder  
Colder  
  
I would show everything  
But everything is too extreme  
Well wait and see the entropy  
At the end when we all stop lying but the sky is falling down  
And theres an angel on the ground  
  
Its getting colder  
Im standing looking down  
Theres not a sound around the town  
Its getting colder  
  
The sky is falling down  
And theres an angel on the ground  
Its getting colder  
Im standing looking down  
Theres not a sound around the town  
Its getting colder  
  
The sky is falling down  
And all the people on the ground  
Are getting colder  
Im standing looking down again  
But you cant help me now  
Im getting colder
