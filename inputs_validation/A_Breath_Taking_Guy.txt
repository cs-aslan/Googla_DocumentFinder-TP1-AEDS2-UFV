One night you held me tight  
And whispered in my ear  
All night sweet words  
I never heard  
And I believed every word  
  
Next day you came my way  
Without a word to say you passed me by  
You didnt give an eye  
My darling wont you tell me why  
Youre acting strange toward me  
Why have you changed toward me  
  
Are you just a breathtaking  
First sight soulshaking  
One night lovemaking  
Next day heartbreaking guy  
  
That night your love was true  
The next day we were through  
Your love wont come  
And you were moving on  
And I was left to cry alone  
What have I done to you  
Was it just fun to you  
  
Are you just a breathtaking  
First sight soulshaking  
One night lovemaking  
Next day heartbreaking guy  
  
Breathtaking soul shaking  
Lovemaking heartbreaking guy  
Breathtaking soul shaking  
Lovemaking heartbreaking guy
