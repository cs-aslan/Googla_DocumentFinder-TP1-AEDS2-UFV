Undercover cop car  
Came screeching to a halt  
Body lying on the ground  
Must be someones fault  
Circumstantial evidence  
Seemed to point her way  
Her right to remain silent  
Was all she heard them say  
  
Blue dress blue eyes  
Blonde hair about five foot nine  
Wrong place wrong time  
Wrong face wrong crime  
  
chorus  
Mistaken identity  
Could happen to you or to me  
Mistaken identity  
Mistaken identity  
Could happen to you or to me  
Mistaken identity  
Mistaken identity  
  
i didnt do it no i didnt do it  
No money for a lawyer  
To defend her case  
Standing in the lineup  
Tears rolling down her face  
  
No one cared to listen  
Someone had to take the heat  
Sometimes theres no justice  
When youre a victim of the street  
  
Wrong place wrong time  
Wrong face wrong crime x4  
  
chorus  
Tu ut tu tu tutu ut tut tu tu  
They didnt even say  
Im sorry  
Tried to put her away  
In a hurry  
  
Dont make her pay the price  
Shes not guilty  
guilty  
For someone elses crime  
Set her free  
set her free  
  
I didnt  
I didnt  
I didnt do it no x4  
  
chorus out
