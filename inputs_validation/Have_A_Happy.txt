Now once it was told to me  
Were born with a magic key  
It opens the door to miracles of spring  
  
It takes you to wishing wells  
To ice cream and carousels  
And yet this magic key wont unlock a thing  
  
Unless you have a happy ya have a happy  
Have a happy warm smiling face  
I start believin in believin  
Let your address be sunshine place  
  
Theres love and theres joy Im told  
Much more than your heart can hold  
Its there like the ring you would grab  
On a merrygoround  
  
The world isnt half as gray  
With friends on a rainy day  
But people keep away when you wear a frown  
  
Unless you have a happy ya have a happy  
Have a happy warm smiling face  
I start believin in believin  
Let your address be sunshine place
