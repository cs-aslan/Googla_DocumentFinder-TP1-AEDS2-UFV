The battle recommences  
  
Enjolras  
How do we stand Feuilly Make your report  
  
Feuilly  
Weve guns enough but ammunitions short  
  
Marius  
Let me go into the streets  
There are bodies all around  
Ammunition to be had  
Lots of bullets to be found  
  
Enjolras  
I wont let you go its too much of a chance  
  
Marius  
The same is true for any man here  
  
Valjean  
Let me go Hes no more than a boy  
I am old I have nothing to fear  
  
Gavroche  
You need somebody quicker and I volunteer  
  
Gavroche climbs the barricade  
  
Lesgles  
Come back Gavroche dont you dare  
  
Joly  
Someone pull him down at once  
  
Gavroche  
Look at me Im almost there  
  
Gunshot  
  
Gavroche  
Little people know when  
Little people fight we  
  
Gunshot Gavroche is wounded  
  
May look easy pickings  
But weve got some bite  
  
He is hit again  
  
So never kick a dog  
Because hes just a pup  
Well fight like twenty armies  
And we wont give up  
So youd better run for cover  
When the pup grows  
  
He dies
