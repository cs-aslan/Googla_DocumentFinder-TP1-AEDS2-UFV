Loves a thing that needs wants to thrive on  
Then it grows  
At least thats what Ive been told  
You cant love someone  
If you find that all you get in return  
Is a heart thats cold  
They say you need love to love  
You gotta have love to love  
They all say it works that way  
But if its true  
Why do I love you  
Seems like you keep tryin to break me  
You do things designed just to make me cry  
And Ive heard if warm lips dont touch you  
Love wont grow no matter  
How much you try  
They say you need love to love  
You gotta have love to love  
They all say it works that way  
But if its true  
Why do I love you  
They say you need love to love  
You gotta have love to love  
They all say it works that way  
But if its true  
Why do I love you  
Why do I love you  
Like I do
