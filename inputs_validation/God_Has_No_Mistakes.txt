Why Ive heard people say  
Why is this tree bent  
Why they dont have God enough to know  
Thats the way that it was meant  
  
Why is this little baby born  
All twisted and out of shape  
Were not to question what he does  
Cause God makes no mistakes  
  
Why Ive heard people say  
Why is my child blind  
Why is that old drunk still livin  
When a daddy like mine is dyin  
  
Our blessed father gives us life  
Has the power to take it away  
Theres no reason for what he does  
God makes no mistakes  
  
Why Ive heard people say  
God cannot be alive  
And all the things that people say  
Has to be a lie  
  
When theyre down and out  
And they need a hand and their very souls at stake  
If theyll call on him and just believe  
God makes no mistakes
