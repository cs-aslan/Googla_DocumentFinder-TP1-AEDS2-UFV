Gossip gossip  
Gossip gossip  
  
I heard it in the night  
Words that thoughtless speak  
Like vultures swooping down below  
On the devils radio  
  
I hear it through the day  
Airwaves gettin filled  
With gossip broadcast to and fro  
On the devils radio  
  
Oh yeah gossip  
Gossip oh yeah  
  
Hes in the clubs and bars  
And never turns it down  
Talking about what he dont know  
On the devils radio  
  
Hes in your TV set  
Wont give it a rest  
That soul betraying so and so  
The devils radio  
  
Gossip gossip  
Gossip gossip  
Oh yeah gossip gossip oh yeah  
Gossip oh yeah oh yeah gossip  
  
Its white and black like industrial waste  
Pollution of the highest degree  
You wonder why I dont hang out much  
I wonder how you cant see  
  
Hes in the films and songs  
And on all your magazines  
Its everywhere that you may go  
The devils radio  
  
Oh yeah gossip  
Gossip oh yeah  
  
Runs thick and fast no one really sees  
Quite what bad it can do  
As it shapes you into something cold  
Like an Eskimo igloo  
  
Its all across our lives  
Like a weed its spread  
till nothing else has space to grow  
The devils radio  
  
Can creep up in the dark  
Make us hide behind shades  
And buzzing like a dynamo  
The devils radio  
  
Gossip oh yeah gossip oh yeah  
Gossip gossip gossip gossip  
Oh yeah gossip I heard you on the secret wireless  
Gossip oh yeah You know the devils radio child  
Gossip gossip  
Gossip gossip
