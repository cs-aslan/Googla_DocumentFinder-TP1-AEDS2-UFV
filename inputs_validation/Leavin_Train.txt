When I asked you if everything is alright  
You whisper Dont worry and you shut out the light  
Now black is black in this bed were laying  
And I want to believe the words that youre saying  
  
Chorus  
But your eyes look like a leavin train  
They keep on dragging me down  
Your eyes look like a leavin train  
They keep on draggin  
They keep on draggin  
They keep on draggin me down  
  
Well I did anything just to try to get close to you  
I took it step by step like a mans supposed to  
Tell me now is this my  
Is this my contrition  
To have the love that I longed for fill me with suspicion  
  
Chorus  
  
Now its tellin time oh my little sister  
Now can I believe the words the words of love you whisper  
Is my train in vain has my soul gone to waste  
Am I just a victim of a victim of my lost faith  
  
Chorus
