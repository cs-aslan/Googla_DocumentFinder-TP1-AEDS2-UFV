Theres gonna be some trouble  
A whole house will need rebuilding  
And everyone I love in the house  
Will recline on an analysts couch quite soon  
Your father cracks a joke  
And in the usual way  
Empties the room  
  
Tell all of my friends  
I dont have too many  
Just some raincoated lovers puny brothers  
Dallow Spicer Pinkie Cubitt  
Rush to danger  
Wind up nowhere  
Patric Doonan raised to wait  
Im tired again Ive tried again and  
  
Now my heart is full  
Now my heart is full  
And I just cant explain  
So I wont even try to

Every jammy Stressford poet  
Loafing oafs in allnight chemists  
Loafing oafs in allnight chemists  
Underact express depression  
Ah but Bunnie I loved you  
I was tired again  
Ive tried again and  
  
Now my heart is full  
Now my heart is full  
And I just cant explain  
So I wont even try to  
  
Could you pass by  
Could you pass by  
Could you pass by  
Could you pass by  
Could you pass by  
Oh  
  
Now my heart is full  
Now my heart is full  
And I just cant explain  
So so  
So so so so so
