I know deep inside of me  
Theres a place but its not plain to see  
I belong where no one else can be  
  
Im searching for myself again  
And here Im all alone and when  
I close my eyes no one else can see  
  
I walk alone cant you see  
I dont belong let me be  
Everything I dreamed of being is me  
  
And I got myself to lean on  
Got both my feet on the ground  
  
You dont know me I dont know me  
I cant see you you cant see me  
Close my eyes leave the world behind  
  
So I got no heart got no home  
I got no song where I belong  
I dont worry everythings just fine  
  
I walk alone cant you see  
I dont belong let me be  
Everything I dreamed of being  
  
And I dont belong cant you see  
I walk alone let me be  
Everything I dreamed of being is me  
  
And I got myself to lean on  
I got both my feet on the ground  
  
So I got no heart and I got no home  
And I got no song where I belong  
I dont worry everythings just  
  
I got myself to lean on  
Got both my feet on the ground  
  
And I got myself to lean on  
Got both my feet on the ground  
  
Cause I know deep inside of me  
Theres a place but its not plain to see  
Where I belong where no one else can be  
  
And Im searchin for myself again  
And here Im all alone and when  
I close my eyes and no one else can see
