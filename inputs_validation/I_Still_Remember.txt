So youve gone  
Singing some old love song  
Ive nothing more to lose  
  
Im surrounded  
By old stories  
With nowhere to hide  
  
I could tear  
All your pictures  
I could tear everything  
  
You told me  
Time makes it easy but you  
Never told me time stands still  
  
I cant believe it  
I cant believe how it hurts  
I cant believe it  
I cant believe how love burns away  
  
I remember  
  
I cant sleep  
All your words  
Seem to let me down  
  
Where are you  
Why dont you call  
Its been a long long time  
  
I still remember  
I still remember it all  
I still remember  
I still remember how love burned away  
  
This could be  
My last song  
Everything must end some day
