Rubber duckie swimming in the tub  
You always watch me give my face a rub  
Each evening thats the thing to do  
Were always washing when the day is through  
Ill be happy soaking in the bubbles  
Then I wash my hair  
After Im finished I can say my prayers  
No one likes you when youre looking dirty  
This is surely true  
Oh rubber duckie Im so in love with you  
Rubber duckie we can have such fun  
Splashing in the water when the day is done  
Remember you must always try  
Not to get soap suds going in your eye  
Ill be happy soaking in the bubbles  
Then I wash my hair  
After Im finished I can say my prayers  
No one likes you when youre looking dirty  
This is surely true  
Oh rubber duckie Im so in love with you ohh
