Well the rain was afailin  
And the ground turned to mud  
I was watching all the people  
Running from the flood  
So I starred to payin  
Though I aint no prayin man  
For the lord to come a helpin  
Knowing hed understand  
  
Deliver your children to the good good life  
Giveem peace and shelter and a fork and knife  
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night  
And if a thing goes wrong youd better make it right  
  
Well I had a woman  
She was good and clean  
She spent all day with the washing machine  
But when it come to lovin  
She was never around  
She was out getting dirty  
All over town  
  
Deliver your children to the good good life  
Giveem peace and shelter and a fork and knife  
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night  
And if a thing goes wrong youd better make it right  
  
Well I was low on money  
And my truck broke down  
I was on my way to the lost and found  
So I took it to a dealer  
I said make it run  
Well I aint got no money  
But I got me a gun  
  
I said you robbed me before  
So Im robbing you back  
And if it dont put you straight  
Itll put you on the right track  
Well I aint no devil and I aint no saint  
But I can tell a dealer by the colour of his paint  
  
Deliver your children to the good good life  
Giveem peace and shelter and a fork and knife  
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night  
And if a thing goes wrong youd better make it right  
  
If you want good eggs  
You gotta feed that hen  
And if you wanna hear some more  
Well Ill sing it again
