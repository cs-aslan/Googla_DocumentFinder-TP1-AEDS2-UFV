Lying here awake again  
Minutes before dawn I hear your breathing  
Your heart beat like a song  
Lately Ive been feeling a little less then good but  
Seeing things for the first time like I never could  
  
Ive had my head down against the door  
Trying to get to something I couldnt find before  
That special something that feeds my soul  
Is a rhythm to live by its a rhythm of hope  
  
Something drives us onwards  
Something gives us strength  
What makes our judgment falter is the questions we think  
Who am I to fly so high  
What gives me the right to dream of what could be  
Keep reaching for the light  
  
Ive been standing in front of that door  
Basing my happiness on what I knew before  
Searching for something that moves my soul  
A rhythm to hold to a rhythm to live to  
  
Have you been down like this before  
I guarantee theres something waiting for you just open that door  
A rhythm to live by that moves your soul  
A rhythm that holds you  
A rhythm to live to  
  
And if theres one thing we all need now  
Its a rhythm to live by a rhythm of hope  
  
Lying here awake again
