I get down on my knees everyday and I pray  
These tears Im a cryin are tears of joy cause it wash my sins away  
Im a livin for the Lord and I want everybody to know  
This old worlds just my dressin room and Im a gettin ready to go  
Yeah Im a gettin ready to go to a place called heaven  
Im gonna praise my Saviours name everyday that Im livin  
Glory hallelujah Im not ashamed to let the salvation show  
This old worlds just my dressin room and Im a gettin ready to go  
 piano   
Im gonna walkin there with Jesus and my God  
I wanna know everythingsa gonna be alright when they lay me under to sod  
When he gathers his sheep I wanna be as white as snow  
This old worlds just my dressin room and Im a gettin ready to go  
Yeah Im a gettin ready to go  
This old worlds just my dressin room and Im a gettin ready to go
