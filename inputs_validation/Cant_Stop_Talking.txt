Chorus  
Cant stop talking bout everything Hes done  
Its the best thing happened since the world began  
It didnt come cheap but I got it for free  
Its the hope of glory Christ in me  
  
He helped me to see when my spirit was blind  
Its amazing if you look just what youll find  
Every step I took He took two  
If He did it for me He can do it for you  
  
Do you know Him Yes I do  
Do you know what I say is true  
Do you know Him Yes I do  
If He did it for me He can do it for you
