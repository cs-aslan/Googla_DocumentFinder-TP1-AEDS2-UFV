See the children play  
Listen to the things they say  
Oneonone to one another  
Theyre just having fun  
Finding out it can be done  
They dont separate by cover  
Ooh young hearts  
Facing to feel it so naturally  
And the flower grows from the seed and  
  
Chorus  
Practice makes perfect and we tryin enough  
And were bound to be learning  
The lessons of love  
Coz were never too old and never too young  
To be teaching each other the lessons of love  
  
Got some work to do  
Theres so much we can improve  
Piece by piece we come together yeah  
In the neighborhood  
I know we can make it good  
But weve got to make it better  
  
Oh woh oh inside each of us has a romelody  
But weve got to find our harmony  
  
Practice makes perfect and we tryin rnough  
And weve got to remember  
The lessons of love  
Coz were never too old and never too young  
To be teaching each other the lessons of love  
  
Bridge  
Imagine how this world could be  
If all of us would live in peace  
Nothing good comes easily  
Together starts with you and me  
Yeah oh yeah aha  
Lessons of love  
  
Practice makes perfect and we tryin enough  
And were bound to be learning  
The lessons of love  
Coz were never too old and never too young  
To be teaching each other  
  
Practice makes perfect and we tryin enough  
And weve got to remember  
The lessons of love  
Coz were never too old and never too young  
To be teaching each other the lessons of love  
  
Practice makes perfect try it enough  
oh never too young aha  
And weve got to be learning  
The lessons of love lessons of love  
And were never too old and never too young  
to learn the lessons of love  
To be teaching each other  
The lessons of love  
Oh never too old to learn the lessons of love
