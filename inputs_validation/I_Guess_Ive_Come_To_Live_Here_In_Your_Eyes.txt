I guess Ive come to live here in your eyes  
This must be the place called paradise  
You are so precious to me  
What a special time within our lives  
And I guess Ive come to live here in your eyes  
  
A thousand times I see you  
And a thousand times you take my breath away  
Fears and doubts consume me and Im afraid someone will take it all away  
I hope were here forever but I guess its time that we both realized  
That I guess Ive come to live here in your eyes  
  
I guess Ive come to live here in your eyes  
This must be the place called paradise  
You are so precious to me  
What a special time within our lives  
And I guess Ive come to live here in your eyes  
  
A thousand times I see you  
And a thousand times you take my breath away  
Fears and doubts consume me and Im afraid someone will take it all away  
I hope were here forever but I guess its time that we both realized  
That I guess Ive come to live here in your eyes
