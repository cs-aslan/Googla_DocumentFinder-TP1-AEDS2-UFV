Although the sun has been around for a long time  
Still has the ability to shine  
And although the moon lights up the night  
Sometimes it likes to hang out in the sunshine  
  
And although green grass sometimes turn brown  
Its refreshed when rain drops come falling down  
Creations starts and its renewed  
By a single touch from You  
  
So I depend on You no matter what I do  
I know Youll always come though  
Youll never change the rules  
I can depend on the alwaysness of You  
  
Never change Youll remain  
Faithful through lifes ups and downs still the same  
Everlasting love for me so heavenly  
Thats the alwaysness  
  
The seasons change without a calendar  
And the breezeless know how and when to blow  
Never have to wonder where the water goes  
Cause it flows home to the ocean floor  
  
Everything reacting in common sense  
When placed beneath the of Your omnipotent  
Please wont You show me how I should live  
So glory I can give  
  
Cause I depend on You no matter what I do  
I know Youll always come though  
Youll never changed the rules  
I can depend on the alwaysness of You  
  
Never change Youll remain  
Faithful through lifes ups and downs still the same  
Everlasting love for me so heavenly  
Thats the alwaysness  
  
Never change Youll remain  
Faithful through lifes ups and downs still the same  
Everlasting love for me so heavenly  
Thats the alwaysness  
  
Its so simple when I do things Your way  
So I try everyday sometimes my path can get hard  
Even when I start off with the best of intentions  
I get weak and fall short  
  
And I know when Im down  
Youll be there to lift me up  
Your love will never wait  
  
Never change Youll remain  
Faithful through lifes ups and downs still the same  
Everlasting love for me so heavenly  
Thats the alwaysness  
  
Never change Youll remain  
Faithful through lifes ups and downs still the same  
Everlasting love for me so heavenly  
Thats the alwaysness  
  
The alwaysness of God of God
