I am a mountain I am a tall tree oh  
I am a swift wind sweepin the country  
I am a river down in the valley oh  
I am a vision and I can see clearly  
  
If anybody asks you who I am  
Just stand up tall  
Look em in the face and say  
  
Chorus  
Im that star up in the sky  
Im that mountain peak up high  
Hey I made it mm  
Im the worlds greatest  
And Im that little bit of hope  
When my backs against the ropes  
I can feel it mm  
Im the worlds greatest  
  
I am a giant I am an eagle oh  
I am a lion down in the jungle  
I am a marchin band I am the people oh  
I am a helpin hand I am a hero  
  
If anybody asks you who I am  
Just stand up tall  
Look em in the face and say  
  
Chorus  
  
In the ring of life Ill reign love  
I will reign  
And the world will notice a king  
Oh yeah  
When all is darkest Ill shine a light  
Shine a light  
And use the success you find in me  
Me  
  
Chorus 3x  
  
1Its the greatest  
Can you feel it repeat 10x  
  
While Repeating of 1  
I saw the light  
At the end of a tunnel  
Believe in the pot of gold  
At the end of the rainbow  
And faith was right there  
To pull me through yeah  
Used to be locked doors  
Now I can just walk on through  
Hey uh hey hey hey  
Its the greatest  
Im that star up in the sky  
  
Chorus
