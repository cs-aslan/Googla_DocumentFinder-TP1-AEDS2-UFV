Say youre sorry  
You still care  
She came by my place again  
Cryin about you man  
You should love her  
Twice as much  
I try to remember youre a friend  
But its gettin a little rough  
  
Shes just tired  
Of bein Cinderella  
She cant live that way no more  
She needs a little affection  
A little understanding  
You better be careful Cause the next time she comes to my door  
She wont be a Cinderella no more  
  
A teardrop trembled  
On her face  
Where that smile always was  
It seemed out of place  
And when I held her  
Like a friend  
I could feel a sweet beginning  
But taste a bitter end  
  
Shes just tired  
Of bein Cinderella  
She cant live that way no more  
She needs a little affection  
A little understanding  
You better be careful Cause the next time she comes to my door  
Youll be sorry  
  
Cause it seems like  
Its always something with you  
And everybodys always wrong  
One of these nights  
Youll reach for the pillow she sleeps on  
And shes gonna be gone  
  
Shes just tired  
Of bein Cinderella  
She cant live that way no more  
She needs a little affection  
A little understanding  
You better be careful Cause the next time she comes to my door  
Youll be sorry
