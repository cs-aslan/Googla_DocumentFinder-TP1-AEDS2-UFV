Outside the window the neon flashes  
In the morning light  
Down on the sidewalk theres a woman with a problem  
But she dont know how to fight  
  
Shes destitute and broken down  
She softly whispers is there no one around  
And no one hears the sound  
Her knees give way and hit the ground  
  
This is the toughest street in town  
This is the toughest street in town  
This is the toughest street in town  
This is the toughest  
  
Like a rat in a pack it attacks  
From the back  
Through a crack in a track  
And youre taking smack  
  
And jack has had a hard day  
No one told him it would be like this  
Hes had to score the hard way  
And theres that trick hell always miss  
  
This is the toughest street in town  
This is the toughest  
Its tough stuff  
This is the toughest street around  
This is the toughest  
Dont you do down  
  
No how  
  
Its just another black spot  
Where far too many people have died  
Its just another grave yard  
And theres not too many people left alive  
  
This is the toughest  
Are you tough enough  
This is the toughest  
Are you rough enough  
This is the toughest  
Can you bluff enough  
  
Just a minor misery did me no harm  
But its there as a constant reminder and its there to warn  
The neon is still flashing in the morning light  
Down on the sidewalk that woman was blown away  
Out of sight  
  
All across the city no one gives a damn  
All across the city no one seems to understand  
  
This is the toughest  
This is the toughest street in town  
This is the toughest street around  
This is the toughest  
  
Are you rough enough  
This is the toughest  
If I were you I wouldnt come around here  
This is the toughest  
This is the toughest  
Are you tough enough
