Could you move in slow motion  
Everything goes by so fast  
Just slow down a little  
Save the best part for last  
  
You speak in riddles  
Your intentions turn me on  
Im yours forever  
Will you love me when Im gone  
  
Youre an unfenced fire  
Over walls we travel  
Its you I admire  
My living example  
  
Your eyes are an undiscovered ocean far away  
Any minute now keeping  
Both poets and priests at bay  
Dont get ahead of me  
Could we just this once see eye to eye  
What you offer has me  
Ask me how it feels to vie  
  
Your an unfenced fire  
Over walls we travel  
Its you I admire  
My living example  
  
Its a photograph discovered a decade after  
Its a cannon blast disguised as a firecracker  
Its enough to bring a brick wall to its knees  
And sing please  
  
Could you move in slow motion  
Everything goes by so fast  
Just slow down a little  
Save the best part for last  
  
Youre an unfenced fire  
Over walls weve travel  
Its you I admire  
My living example
