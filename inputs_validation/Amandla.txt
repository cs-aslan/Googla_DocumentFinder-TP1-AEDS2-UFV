Taunting from the hill tops just out of reach  
Smiling pretty smiles telling your white lies  
Stringing me along on your sweet promises  
Humi you sure know how to Tantalize  
  
You give yourself to those who dont deserve you  
You go where you are not supposed to be  
I know someday that I am going to have you  
Someday youll have to give yourself to me  
  
Amandla Amandla dancin in the distance sayin Ill be free  
Amandla Amandla its time to change your partner  
its time to dance with me  
Amandla Amandla youre hanging with the wrong crowd  
You need a change of scene  
Amandla Amandla dont lose all your selfrespect  
You know just what I mean  
  
Standin on Commissioner street in the pouring rain  
Tappin my toe tappin my toe  
This time I was so sure that you would be here  
But once again you decided not to show  
  
Amandla Amandla dancin in the distance sayin Ill be free  
Amandla Amandla its time to change your partner  
its time to dance with me  
Amandla Amandla youre hanging with the wrong crowd  
You need a change of scene  
Amandla Amandla dont lose all your selfrespect  
You know just what I mean  
  
youre running with the fools  
You know Im more your style  
Driving me crazy with that someday smile  
  
Amandla Amandla dancin in the distance sayin Ill be free  
Amandla Amandla its time to change your partner  
its time to dance with me  
Amandla Amandla youre hanging with the wrong crowd  
You need a change of scene  
Amandla Amandla dont lose all your selfrespect  
You know just what I mean  
  
youre hanging with the wrong crowd  
You need a change of scene  
dont you lose your selfrespect  
You know just what I mean  
  
Amandla  
Amandla  
Amandla  
Amandla
