Today Im livin like a rich mans son  
Tomorrow mornin I could be a bum  
It doesnt matter which direction though  
I know a woman in New Mexico  
Chorus  
Worse comes to worst  
Ill get along  
I dont know how but sometimes  
I can be strong  
Oh and if I dont have a car Ill hitch  
I got a thumb and shes a son of a bitch  
I do my writing on my road guitar  
And make a living at a piano bar oh  
Chorus  
Lightning and thunder  
Flashed across the roads we drove upon  
Oh but its clear skies were under  
When I am together when I sing the song  
Chorus  
Oh fun aint easy if it aint free  
Too many people got a hold on me  
But I know something that they dont know  
I know a woman in New Mexico  
Chorus 3x and fade
