Theres a pawnshop on a corner in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania  
And I walk up and down neath the clock  
By the pawnshop on a corner in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania  
But I aint got a thing left to hock  
  
She was peaches she was honey and she cost me all my money  
cause a whirl round the town was her dream was her dream  
Took her dancin took her dinin till her blue eyes were shinin  
With the sights that they never had seen never seen  
If you should run into a goldenhaired angel  
And ask her tonight for a date  
Shell tell you somewhere theres a rich millionaire  
Who is calling again about eight  
  
Theres a pawnshop on a corner in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania  
And Ive just gotta get five or ten five or ten  
From the pawnshop on a corner in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania  
Gotta be with my angel again
