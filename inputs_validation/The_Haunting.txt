The darkness bleeds violent sights  
It purges from within  
Death it holds you in its arms  
And kisses you goodnight  
  
Oh oh oh the darkness comes  
Oh oh oh I feel its bite  
Oh it purges from within  
  
Its over its over  
This haunting its over  
They cut my wrists and watch me bleed  
Inside a dream  
  
Its over its over  
This haunting its over  
They cut my wrists and watch me bleed  
They stop haunting me  
  
The darkness bleeds violent sights  
It purges from within  
Death it holds you in its arms  
And kisses you goodnight  
  
Oh oh oh the darkness comes  
Oh oh oh I feel its bite  
Oh it purges from within  
  
Its over its over  
This haunting its over  
They cut my wrists and watch me bleed  
Inside a dream  
  
Its over its over  
This haunting its over  
They cut my wrists and watch me bleed  
They stop haunting me
