Houses iced in whitewash guard a pale shoreline  
Cornered by the cactus and the pine  
Here I wander where sweet sage and strange herbs grow  
Down a sunbaked crumpled stony road  
  
Dusty wheels leaning rusting in the sun  
Snuff brown walls where Spanish lizards run  
Here Im shadowed by a dragon fig trees fan  
Ringed by ants and musing over man  
  
Ill unwind my old strings while the sun shine down  
Wont climb any high thing while the sun shine  
Formentera Lady sing your song for me  
Formentera Lady sweet lover  
  
Lamplights glows on old guitars the travellers strum  
Incense children dance to an Indian drum  
Here Odysseus charmed for dark Circe fell  
Still her perfume lingers still her spell  
  
Times grey hand wont catch me while the sun shine down  
Untie and unlatch me while the stars shine  
Formentera Lady dance your dance for me  
Formentera Lady dark lover
