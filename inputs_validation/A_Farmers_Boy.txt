Ive gone in for farming I like the life mixed up with sows and rams  
So much time I share with the animals there Im beginning to baa like a
lamb  
The air is so fresh you get quite a thrill  
But some of the milkmaids are much fresher still  
To be a farmers boy down on the farm Cant come to harm down there  
Early to bed makes you feel right as rain  
Before Im asleep I just get up again  
Down at the village inn the daughters so nice my fresh eggs she does enjoy  
For two eggs she lets me give her kisses a few  
For four eggs I can kiss her yes and cuddle her too  
Tonight Im going to find out what a dozen will do  
Oh its grand to be a farmers boy  
To be a farmers boy down on the farm Cant come to harm down there  
Weve got fourteen pigs thats a lot you can tell  
Fourteen thats not counting the farmer as well  
I get ten bob a week and everything found and what have I found oh boy  
One day the farmer said someone my farm tried to rob  
Two prize sheep were stolen twas a very bad job  
Ive just sold two fine sheepskin rugs for twenty five bob  
Oh its grand to be a farmers boy  
To be a farmers boy down on the farm cant come to harm down there  
I milk all the cows and I bob the sheeps wool  
Then play hide and seek with a savage mad bull  
I met a country maid on marketing day with her basket she looked so coy  
She said she was a shepherdess they called her BoPeep  
Shed lost her lambs I said Ill help you find them dont weep  
I know that I found everything excepting her sheep  
Oh its grand to be a farmers boy
