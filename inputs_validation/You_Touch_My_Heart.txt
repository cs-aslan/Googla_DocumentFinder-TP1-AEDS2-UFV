Somehow you reach in and you touch my heart  
Somehow you reach in you touch my soul  
When I look at you I see everything we could be  
  
Eyes wide open looking at me  
What can I offer you that youve never seen  
Just dont be afraid someone is watching  
You will see  
  
Somehow when you smile the day seems brighter  
Somehow when you smile you melt my heart  
When I look at you I see all things we should be  
  
And in your darkest hour hold out your hand for me  
Something will guide you Ill be beside you  
And when its rough out there Im with you everywhere  
I will be right behind you if you should fall  
  
Someday you will find everything you look for  
Someday you will find a love like mine  
When you smile at her you will feel the things you could be  
  
Eyes wide open looking at me  
What can I offer you that youve never seen  
Just dont be afraid someone is watching  
You will see you will see  
  
Somehow you reach in and you touch my heart  
Somehow you reach in you touch my soul  
When I look at you I see everything we could be
