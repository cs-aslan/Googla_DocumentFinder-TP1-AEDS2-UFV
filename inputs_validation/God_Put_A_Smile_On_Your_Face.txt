Where do we go nobody knows  
Ive got to say Im on my way down  
God give me style and give me grace  
God put a smile upon my face  
  
Where do we go to draw the line  
Ive got to say I wasted all your time  
Oh honey honey  
Where do I go to fall from grace  
God put a smile upon your face yeah  
  
And ah when you work it out Im worse than you  
Yeah when you work it out I wanted to  
And ah when you work out where to draw the line  
Your guess is as good as mine  
  
Where do we go nobody knows  
Dont ever say youre on your way down when  
God gave you style and gave you grace  
And put a smile upon your face oh yeah  
  
And ah when you work it out Im worse than you  
Yeah when you work it out I want it to  
And ah when you work out where to draw the line  
Your guess is as good as mine  
  
Its as good as mine Its as good as mine  
Its as good as mine  
  
As good as mine as good as mine  
As good as mine as good as mine  
  
Where do we go nobody knows  
Dont ever say youre on your way down when  
God gave you style and gave you grace  
And put a smile upon your face
