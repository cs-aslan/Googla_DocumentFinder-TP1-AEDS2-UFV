Baby  
Here I am  
Im the man on the scene  
I can give you what you want  
But you got to go home with me  
I forgot some good old lovin  
And I got some in store  
When I get to throwin it on you  
You got to come back for more  
  
Boys and things that come by the dozen  
That aint nothin but drug store lovin  
Pretty little thing let me light your candle  
Cause mama Im sure hard to handle now gets around  
  
Action speaks louder than words  
And Im a man with a great experience  
I know you got you another man  
But I can love you better than him  
Take my hand dont be afraid  
I wanna prove every word I say  
Im advertisin love for free  
So wont you place your ad with me  
  
Boys will come a dime by the dozen  
But that aint nothin but ten cent love  
Pretty little thing let me light your candle  
Cause mama Im sure hard to handle now gets around
