Everybodys talkin bout me  
I dont hear a word theyre sayin  
Only the echoes in my mind  
Everybody stops to starin  
I dont even see their faces  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
Im goin where the sun keeps shinin  
Through the fallin rain  
Going where the weather suits my clothes  
Bankin off the northeast wind  
And sailin on summer breeze  
Skippin over the ocean like a stone  
  
Everybodys talkin bout me  
I dont hear a word theyre sayin  
Only the echoes of my mind  
Everybody stops to starin  
I dont even see their faces  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
I wont let you leave my love behind  
I wont let you leave my love behind  
I wont let you leave my love behind
