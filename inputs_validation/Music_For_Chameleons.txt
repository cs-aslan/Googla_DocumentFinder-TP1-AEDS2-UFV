At 4 oclock we land  
And Ill wave my flag for you  
Interest in heart  
We are not savage  
Like children  
Were people  
What difference I say  
  
Music for chameleons  
Music for chameleons  
  
A dream of siam  
We could leave in the morning  
Old friends and shy  
We need to win  
Like you need to breathe  
Ive an interest in games  
  
Music for chameleons  
Music for chameleons  
  
Gowns for another show  
Maybe noone will come  
  
Here take my arm  
I like the pictures  
And you like ghost stories  
Tomorrow Ill sigh  
  
Music for chameleons  
Music for chameleons
