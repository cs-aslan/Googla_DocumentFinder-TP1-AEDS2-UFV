We live  
We love  
We die  
  
Enrique Iglesias  
She called me up late at night  
We called an innocent crime  
Shes such a good waste of time  
But in the back of my mind  
You know youre all Im thinking of  
You know youre all Im thinking of  
  
Chorus  
I cant catch a single breath baby  
Help me now help me now  
Hurry up its killing me the way I need your mouth to mouth mouth to mouth  
I cant catch a single breath baby  
Help me now help me now  
Hurry up its killing me the way I need your mouth to mouth mouth to mouth  
  
Jennifer Lopez  
Kills me to let it inside  
Feels like the wrong kind of guy  
He falls asleep by my side  
But in the back of my mind  
You know youre all Im thinking of  
You know youre all Im thinking of  
  
Chorus  
I cant catch a single breath baby  
Help me now help me now  
Hurry up its killing me the way I need your mouth to mouth mouth to mouth  
I say you make me feel alive  
I say you bring me back to life  
I cant catch a single breath baby  
Lay me down mouth to mouth  
  
Break  
  
Chorus  
I cant catch a single breath baby  
Help me now help me now  
Hurry up its killing me the way I need your mouth to mouth mouth to mouth  
I say you make me feel alive  
I say you bring me back to life  
I cant catch a single breath baby  
Lay me down mouth to mouth
