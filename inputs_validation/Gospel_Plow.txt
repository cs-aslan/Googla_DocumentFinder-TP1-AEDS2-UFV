Mary wore three links of chain  
Every link was Jesus name  
Keep your hand on that plow hold on  
Oh Lord Oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on  
  
Mary Mark Luke and John  
All these prophets are dead and gone  
Keep your hand on that plow hold on  
Oh Lord Oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on  
  
Well Ive never been to heaven  
But Ive been told streets up there  
Are lined with gold  
Keep your hand on that plow hold on  
Oh Lord Oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on  
Oh Lord Oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on  
Oh Lord Oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on
