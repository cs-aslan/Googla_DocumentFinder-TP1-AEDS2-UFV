Ive been a roaming romeo  
My juliets have been many  
But now my roaming days have gone  
Too many irons in the fire  
Is worse than not having any  
Ive had my share and from now on  
  
Im putting all my eggs in one basket  
Im betting evrything Ive got on you  
  
Im giving all my love to one baby  
Heaven help me if my baby dont come through  
  
Ive got a great big amount  
Saved up in my love account  
Honey  
And Ive decided  
Love divided  
In two  
Wont do  
  
So  
Im putting all my eggs in one basket  
Im betting everything Ive got on you

Heaven help me if my baby dont come through  
  
Ive tried to love more than one  
Finding it just cant be done  
Honey  
Theres one I lie to  
When I try to  
Be true  
To two  
  
So  
Im putting all my eggs in one basket  
Im betting everything Ive got on you
