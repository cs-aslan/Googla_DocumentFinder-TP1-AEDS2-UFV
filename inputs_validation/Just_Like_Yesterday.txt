Just like yesterday  
You come upon my mind and take it away  
Just like at the time  
The things we did made our hearts skip away  
Down on my knees I prayed  
Kind woman dont go astray  
When it seems at times  
Ive got my mind and heart all straight away  
Just when youve become  
A memory of the past and fade away  
I see your face and think of all  
Of all that we had  
With of the things that you brought me  
Now was it so bad  
Makes me wonder  
Just like yesterday  
You come upon my mind and take it away
