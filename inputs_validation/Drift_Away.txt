Day after day Im more confused  
Yet I look for the light in the pouring rain  
You know thats a game that I hate to lose  
Im feelin the strain aint it a shame  
  
Oh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away  
Oh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away  
wont you take me away  
  
Beginning to think that Im wastin time  
I dont understand the things I do  
The world outside looks so unkind  
Im countin on you to carry me through  
  
And when my mind is free  
You know a melody can move me  
And when Im feelin blue  
The guitars comin through to soothe me  
Thanks for the joy that youve given me  
I want you to know I believe in your song  
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony  
You help me along makin me strong
