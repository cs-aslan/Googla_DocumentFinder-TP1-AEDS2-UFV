Dr Heckyll works late at the laboratory  
Where things are not as they seem  
Dr Heckyll wishes nothing more desperately  
Than to fulfill all of his dreams  
Letting loose with a scream in the dead of night  
As hes breaking new ground  
  
Trying his best to unlock all the secrets  
But hes not sure what hes found  
Dr Heckyll is his own little guinea pig  
Cause they all think hes mad  
Sets his sights on the search of a lifetime  
And hes never never sad  
  
Whoa oh its off to work he goes  
In the name of science and all its wonders  
This is the story of Dr Heckyll and Mr Jive  
They are a person who feels good to be alive  
This is the story of Dr Heckyll and Mr Jive  
Believes the underdog will eventually survive  
  
Not long now till the ultimate experiment  
Hes breaking all the rules  
He wants to cure all matter of imbalance  
In this world of fools  
He locks the door and he looks around nervously  
He knows theres no one there  
He drinks it down and waits for some reaction  
To all his work and care  
  
Hey hey he fumbles for what to say  
He loves the world except for all the people  
This is the story of Dr Heckyll and Mr Jive  
They are a person who feels good to be alive  
This is the story of Dr Heckyll and Mr Jive  
Believes the underdog will eventually survive  
  
Whoa oh its out at night he goes  
He slips easily into conversation  
Hey hey hes cool in every way  
Sometimes he loves to sing that old black magic  
  
This is the story of Dr Heckyll and Mr Jive  
They are a person who feels good to be alive  
This is the story of Dr Heckyll and Mr Jive  
Believes the underdog will eventually survive  
This is the story of Dr Heckyll and Mr Jive  
They are a person who feels good to be alive
