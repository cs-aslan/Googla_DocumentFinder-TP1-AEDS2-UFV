Its not like we did something wrong  
We just burned down the church  
While the choir within sang religious songs  
And its not like we thought we was right  
We just played with the wheels of a passenger train  
That cracked on the tracks one night  
Its not like we aint on the ball  
We just talk to our shrinks  
Huh they talk to their shrinks  
No wonder were up the wall  
Were not stupid or dumb  
Were the lunatic fringe who rusted the hinge  
On Uncle Sams daughters and sons  
Good old boys and girls  
Congregating waiting in another world  
With roller coaster brains  
Imagine playing with trains  
Good old boys and girls  
Congregating waiting in some other world  
Were all crazy were all crazy were all crazy  
Lizzy Borden took an axe and gave her mother forty whacks  
And dont think were trying to be bad  
All the innocent crime seemed alright at the time  
Not necessarily mad not necessarily mad  
We watch every day for the bus  
And the driver would say  
Thats where lunatics stay  
I wonder if hes talking about us  
Its not like were vicious or gone  
We just dug up the graves where your relatives lay  
In old forest lawn  
And its not like we dont know the score  
Were the fragile elite they dragged off the street  
I guess they just couldnt take us no more  
Good old boys and girls  
Congregating waiting in another world  
With roller coaster brains  
Imagine digging up graves  
Good old boys and girls  
Congregating waiting in some other world  
Were all crazy were all crazy were all crazy were all crazy  
Were all crazy were all crazy were all crazy were all crazy  
Were all crazy
