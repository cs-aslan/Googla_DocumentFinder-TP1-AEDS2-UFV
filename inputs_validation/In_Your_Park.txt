In the night there is  
A gentle voice of silence  
So low and quiet  
Shell catch me cause Ive been longing  
  
I want to walk in your park  
cause Im alone  
I want to walk in your heart  
Where are you I dont know  
  
I look around and see  
The sunshine in the morning  
Shadows in the night  
Like angels by your side in the alley  
  
On my journey I change the time  
Leave everything behind me  
Shadows in the night  
Like angels by your side in the alley  
  
I want to walk in your park  
cause Im alone  
I want to walk in your heart  
Where are you I dont know  
  
Let me walk let me walk in your heart
