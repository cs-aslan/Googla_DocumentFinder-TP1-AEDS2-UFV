I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I said I dont know what I did  
But I know I gotta move  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I cant wait here forever  
I got too much here to lose  
  
An now youre blowin smoke  
I think youre one big joke  
MeI gotta lot to learn  
An Im still waitin for the heads to turn  
You say I walk a line  
Fuck they move it every time  
You walk a mile in my shoes  
And then you tell me bout singin the blues  
You get what you pay for  
An freedoms real high priced  
An while your rippin off children  
Somebodys fuckin your wife  
Its never made a difference  
Its only how you survive  
  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I said I dont know what I did  
But I know I gotta move  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I cant wait here forever  
I got too much here to lose  
An now you ask me why  
I said its do or die  
Ill stick it right in your face  
And then Ill put you in your motherfuckin place  
And youyou can suck my ass  
An I think its so low class  
MeIm just so concerned  
Im still waitin for your ass to burn  
Ooooh you want a confrontation  
Ill give you every fuckin chance  
With your verbal masturbation  
MeI just like to dance  
Hows that for provocation  
Im just makin a stance  
An Im tired of the frustration  
Of livin inside of your lies  
And Im wired on indignation  
I said somebodys got to die  
  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I said I dont know what I did  
But I know I gotta move  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
I cant stay here forever  
I got too much here to lose  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
Listen motherfucker  
Youre about to pay your dues  
I got the shotgun blues  
Shotgun blues  
If youre goin up against me  
Then you know youre gonna lose  
I know  
I know theres ways that we can find  
I know  
I know  
  
You think anyone with an IQ over fifteen  
Would believe your shitfuckhead  
Nothin but a fuckin pussy
