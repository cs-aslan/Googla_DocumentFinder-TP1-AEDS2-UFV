Shes fuddled my fancy shes muddled me good  
Ive taken to drinking and given up food  
Im buying an island somewhere in the sun  
Ill hide from the natives live only on rum  
  
Im selling my memoirs Im writing it down  
If no one will pay me Ill burn down the town  
Ill rent out an aircraft and print on the sky  
If God likes my story then maybe hell buy  
  
Im buying a ticket for places unknown  
Its only a oneway Im not coming home  
Shes swallowed my secret and taken my name  
To follow my footsteps and knobble me lame
