Ooh yeah yeah  
Ive been walking around inside a haze  
Between the lines of reason  
Hiding from the ghost of yesterday  
Feels like Im barely breathing  
I I wanna feel the rain again  
I I wanna feel the water on my skin  
And let it all just wash away in a downpour  
I wanna feel the rain feel the rain  
Ive been losing days  
The shades pulled down  
I still cant face the sun  
But I Im going crazy  
I cant stay here  
Ive gone completely numb  
I just wanna need someone  
I I wanna feel the rain again  
I I wanna feel the water on my skin  
And let it all just wash away in a downpour  
I wanna feel the rain feel the rain  
Oh no I thought you were the only one  
But now I think I was wrong  
Cause life goes on  
Ive been walking around inside a haze  
I I wanna feel the rain again  
I I wanna feel the water on my skin  
And let it all just wash away in a downpour  
I wanna feel the rain  
I I wanna feel the rain again  
I I wanna feel the water on my skin  
And let it all just wash away in a downpour  
I wanna feel the downpour I wanna feel the rain  
In a downpour feel the rain  
Feel the rain oh oh  
I wanna feel the rain
