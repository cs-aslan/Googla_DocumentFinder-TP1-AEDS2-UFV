Out in the garden  
Theres half of a heaven  
And were only bluffing  
Were not ones for busting through walls  
  
But theyve told us  
Unless we can prove  
That were doing it  
We cant have it all  
  
Hes gonna wangle  
A way to get out of it  
Shes an excuse  
And a witness wholl talk when hes called  
  
But theyve told us  
Unless we can prove  
That were doing it  
We cant have it all  
We cant have it all  
  
I caught a glimpse of a god all shining and bright  
  
Suddenly my feet are feet of mud  
It all goes slomo  
I dont know why Im crying  
Am I suspended in Gaffa  
Not until Im ready for you  
Not until Im ready for you  
Can I have it all  
  
I try to get nearer  
But as it gets clearer  
Theres something appears in the way  
Its a plank in me eye  
  
With a camel  
Whos trying to get through it  
Am I doing it  
Can I have it all now  
  
I pull out the plank and say  
Thank you for yanking me back to the fact that theres always something to
distract  
  
But sometimes its hard  
To know if Im doing it right  
Can I have it all  
Can I have it all now  
We cant have it all  
  
We all have a dreammaybe  
  
Suddenly my feet are feet of mud  
It all goes slomo  
I dont know why Im crying  
Am I suspended in Gaffa  
Not until Im ready for you  
Not until Im ready for you  
Can I have it all  
  
I wont open boxes  
That I am told not to  
Im not a Pandora  
Im much more like  
That girl in the mirror between you and me  
She dont stand a chance of getting anywhere at all  
Not anywhere at all  
No not a thing  
She cant have it all  
  
Mother where are the angels Im scared of the changes  
  
Suddenly my feet are feet of mud  
It all goes slomo  
I dont know why Im crying  
Am I suspended in Gaffa  
Not until Im ready for you  
Not until Im ready for you  
Can I have it all
