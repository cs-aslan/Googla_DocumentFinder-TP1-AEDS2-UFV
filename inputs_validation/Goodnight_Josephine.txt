I remember a girl on her cellphone  
Surrounded by her friends  
Eyes flickering shes trying  
To smother a smile in her hands  
Is it someone for us  
Someone more worryfree  
Someone who can say  
Leave the worrying about him to me Josephine  
I remember you there in the last rays  
Of light at diplomacys end  
Eyes flickering youre crying  
But isnt this when the crimes begin  
When the people you want to dont  
The people who do you  
Dont believe you Josephine  
I remember you there at the table  
Surrounded by all the days plans  
Eyes flickering youre trying  
To let a coffee cup warm your hands  
Maybe were born lost  
Born to persevere  
Honey Id walk into your painting  
Until Id reappeared  
A speck of comettail dust  
A bluegreen northern light  
Flickering just in your eyes deepest ravines  
Goodnight goodnight Josephine  
Goodnight goodnight Josephine  
Goodnight goodnight Josephine  
Goodnight goodnight  
Goodnight goodnight goodnight  
Goodnight goodnight goodnight  
Goodnight goodnight goodnight  
Josephine Josephine Josephine Josephine
