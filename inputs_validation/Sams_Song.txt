Heres a happy tune youll love to croon  
They call it Sams song  
Its catchy as can be the melody  
They call it Sams song  
Nothing on your mind  
And then youll find youre humming Sams Song  
Why it makes you grin  
Gets under your skin as only a song can do  
  
People that you meet out on the street  
All whistling Sams Song  
Everyone you see will soon agree that its a grand song  
So forget your troubles and wear a smile  
Youll find you never go wrong  
If you learn to croon this happy tune  
They call it Sams song  
  
And now another treatment of this  
Classic American Theme  
Brought to you by Mr Gary Crosby  
  
Heres a happy tune  
Thatll bring you a smile all the while  
When you croon it youre really in style  
And the title is Sams Song  
Its catchy as can be  
With a sly little beat  
And the melody sweet keeps you tapping your feet  
And the title is Sams Song  
  
Nothing on your mind  
But the news of the day  
And the bills you must pay keep your hair turning gray  
But youre still humming Sams Song  
Are you alright  
Hows your brace  
Why it makes you grin  
Gets under your skin as only a song can do  
  
People that you meet  
Hello Joe what you know  
And remind me to Moe tell him business is slow  
But Im whistling  
Sams Song  
Everyone you see  
Has a story to tell or a gimmick to sell  
But agree that its swell  
And its really  
A grand song  
  
So forget your troubles and wear a smile  
Youll find you never go wrong  
If you learn to croon  
Like a lark in the park  
Who is making his mark serenading the dark  
With a chorus of Sams song  
  
If you learn to croon the happy tune  
They call it Sams song
