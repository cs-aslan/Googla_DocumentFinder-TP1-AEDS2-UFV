Hey What chu tryin to do  
Why you tryin to see through me baby  
Its way too hazy  
Hey Im still feelin the same  
So dont go tryin to change me baby  
You cant save me  
So many people try to bring me down  
They wouldnt last a second in my town  
  
Chorus  
Hey Ive always been a blues man  
Hey I little rhythm and blues man  
Dont try walkin inside my shoes  
Unless youre puttin up somethin to lose  
I said Hey Ive always been a blues man  
Hey a little rhythm and blues man  
Dont try walkin inside my shoes tonight  
  
You stem so far from the truth  
You hide inside all your talkin papers  
Flashin statements  
You never put your money down  
And watched a big wheel go around and take it  
And in remake it  
All you do is follow me around  
Then you go ahead and ride it down  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont try walkin inside my shoes  
Unless youre puttin up somethin to lose  
I said dont try walkin inside my shoes baby baby  
I said Hey Ive always been a blues man  
Hey a little rhythm and blues man  
Dont try walkin inside my shoes  
Unless your puttin up somethin to lose  
I said Hey Ive always been a blues man  
Hey A little rhythm and blues man  
Dont try walkin inside my shoes  
Unless your unless your unless your  
Hey Ive always been a blues man  
Hey A little rhythm and blues man  
Dont try walkin inside my shoes tonight
