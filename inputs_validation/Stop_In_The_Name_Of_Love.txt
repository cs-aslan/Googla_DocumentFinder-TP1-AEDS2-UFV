Stop In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
  
Baby baby Im aware of where you go  
Each time you leave my door  
I watch you walk down the street  
Knowing your other love youll meet  
This time before you run to her  
Leaving me alone and hurt  
Think it over After Ive been good to you  
Think it over After Ive been sweet to you  
  
Stop In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Think it over  
Think it over  
  
Ive known of your your secluded nights  
Ive even seen her maybe once or twice  
But is her sweet expression  
Worth more than my love and affection  
But this time before you leave my arms  
And rush off to her charms  
Think it over Havent I been good to you  
Think it over Havent I been sweet to you  
  
Stop In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop In The Name of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Think it over  
Think it over  
  
Ive tried so hard hard to be patient  
Hoping youll stop this infatuation  
But each time you are together  
Im so afraid Ill be losing you forever  
  
Stop In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart
