Mammas little boy has fallen down  
Mammas little boy has hit the ground  
Now hes gone Ian is gone  
His time is done  
The weight of a dream  
Can take you down  
White white ashes building crashes down  
So well pretend its all well conceived  
Build solid as steel stuff we believe  
Now hes gone Ion is gone  
His time is done  
The weight of a dream  
Can bring you down  
The weight of a dream  
Can bring you down  
White white ashes building crashes down  
White white ashes building crashes down  
Mammas little boy doing good  
Mammas little boy did all he could  
Now hes gone Ion is gone time is done  
The weight of a dream  
Can bring you down  
The weight of a dream  
Can bring you down  
White white ashes building crashes down  
White white ashes building crashes down
