Rodney Crowell  
This morning is Monday where are you now  
Teasin my memory teaching me how to lay low  
When I dont want to  
Well love is elusive this I know now  
Its making me crazy leaving me out  
In the open when I dont want to  
The moments of pleasures Never do last  
Are gone like a suitcase full of your past  
Long gone and in a hurry  
Baby I cant go through this again  
I dont need to go down more then Ive already been  
Just like a wild fire youre running all over town  
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now  
The second street beggars alone in their life  
Drunk on a sidewalk to hide from the night  
Like I am Theyre just like I am  
Baby I cant go through this again  
I dont need to go down more then Ive already been  
Just like a wild fire youre running all over town  
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now  
Just like a wild fire Youre running all over town  
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah I should be ashes by now
