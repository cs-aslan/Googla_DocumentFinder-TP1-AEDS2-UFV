In the night when a mist of sleep surrounds me  
You come to me and hold me tight winding your body all around me  
And everywhere you touch I feel that my love for you is much too real  
Oh its the same damn thing wanting you in my dreams  
Its the same damn thing wanting you in my dreams  
Sleepwalkin  I know every move you make and every word I say  
Keep it comin comin  comin on stronger this time Im going all the way  
Is this moment just a fantasy or a vision of what will be  
Oh its the same damn thing wanting you in my dreams  
Every night the same thing wanting you in my dreams  
Dreams fade away  
I better find you in my days or Im losin you to the nights  
Its the same thing  every night  
Its the same thing  oh youre so right  
Its the same thing  wanting you  
Instrumental break  
And tonight evenings shadows are sure to find me  
On my nightwatch waiting for the warmth of you beside me  
And every second that youre here I feel this dream is real  
And its the same damn thing its the same thing  
Its the same damn thing wanting you in my dreams dreams
