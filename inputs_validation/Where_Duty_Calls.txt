In a room in Lebanon  
They silently slept  
They were dreaming crazy dreams  
In foreign alphabet  
Lucky young boys  
Cross on the main  
The driver was approaching  
The American zone  
The waving of hands  
The tiniest train  
They never dreamed  
Theyd never wake again  
  
Voice of the Swarm  
We follow we fall  
Some kneel for priests  
Some wail at walls  
Flag on a match head  
God or the law  
And theyll all go together  
Where duty calls  
  
United children  
Child of Iran  
Parallel prayers  
Baseball Koran  
Ill protect Mama  
Ill lie awake  
Ill die for Allah  
In a holy war  
Ill be a ranger  
Ill guard the streams  
Ill be a soldier  
A sleeping Marine  
  
Refrain  
  
In the heart of the ancient  
Ali smiles  
In the soul of the desert  
The sun blooms  
Awake  
Into the glare of all out little wars  
Who pray to return to salute  
The coming and dying of the moon  
Oh sleeping sun  
  
Assassin in prayer  
Laid a compass deep  
Exploding dawn  
And himself as well  
Their eyes for his eyes  
Their breath for his breath  
All to his end  
  
And a room in Lebanon  
Dust of scenes  
Erase and blend  
May the blanket of Kings  
Cover them and him  
  
Forgive them Father  
They know not what they do  
From the vast portals  
Of their consciousness  
Theyre calling to you
