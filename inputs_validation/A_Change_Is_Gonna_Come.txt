I was born by the river in a little tent  
Oh and like that river Ive been running ever since  
Its been a long long time coming  
But I know a change is gonna come  
Oh yes it is  
  
Its been too hard living and Im affraid to die  
I dont know whats up there beyond the sky  
Its been a long long time coming  
But I know a change is gonna come  
Oh yes it is  
  
I go to the movies and I go around in town  
Everybody there keeps telling me dont hang around  
Its been a long a long time coming  
But I know a change is gonna come  
Oh yes it is  
  
Then I go to my brother  
And I say Brother please  
But he just winds up knocking me  
Back down on my knees  
  
Sometimes I thought I wouldnt last for long  
But now I think Im able to carry on  
Its been a long long time coming  
But I know a change is gonna come  
Oh yes it is
