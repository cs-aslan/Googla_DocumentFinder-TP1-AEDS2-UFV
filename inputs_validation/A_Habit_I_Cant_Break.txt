Loving you isnt good for me you keep my tears flowing  
If I loved you I couldnt stay gone so theres no use in going  
Loving you is a habit I cant break  
I havent found a way yet but Ive been tryin  
To stop loving you but I cant wait theres no use a lyin  
Loving you is a habit I cant break  
Loving you is a habit I cant break  
Ive been loving you much too long now to change the way I feel  
So I might as well get used to these heartaches  
Loving you is a habit I cant break  
 piano   
A habit I cant break  
Loving you is a habit I cant break  
Loving you is a habit I cant break
