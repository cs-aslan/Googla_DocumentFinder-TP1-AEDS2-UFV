You asked me if Ive met your baby  
I have to say its been some time now  
But it seems like yesterday  
He was mine for awhile  
We had good times  
We went in style  
But now hes yours  
Treat him kind  
Yes I remember well when he was mine  
  
You say he means the world to you  
Yes I can tell  
Youll make each other happy I wish you well  
He was mine for awhile  
We had good times  
We went in style  
But now hes yours  
Treat him kind  
Yes I remember well when he was mine  
  
He was mine  
He was mine
