I dont mind  
If you steal my last dime  
Just leave me anytime  
And Ill get get along fine  
I dont really know why  
But I know Ill get by  
If I dont Ill die tryin  
  
If it rains again  
Im gonna fly to the sun  
Cause nothing gets done  
Just sitting sitting around  
Look at the way its been  
Just waitin and wonderin  
Ive just got to keep trying  
  
Looking for gold in the sky  
Gets kinda rough  
Maybe Im to blame  
Cause I didint look hard enough  
But I still get the feeling  
That it shouldnt be so tough  
  
So I wont mind I I wont mind  
I wont mind I I wont mind  
  
So I wont mind  
I No I wont mind  
I wont mind I said I wont mind
