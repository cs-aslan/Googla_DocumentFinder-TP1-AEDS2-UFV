Hey there you lady in tears  
Do you think that they care if theyre real woman  
They just take it as part of the deal  
Lost in your men and the games you play  
Trying to prove that youre better woman  
But you neednt get heavy with them  
Like it or not we were built tough  
Because were woman  
  
No we never die for long  
While weve got that little life  
To live for where its hid inside  
No we never die for long  
Oh Woman two in one  
  
Theres room for a life in your womb woman  
Inside of you can be two woman  
Theres room for a life in your womb woman  
Mama woman aha  
  
Night after night in the quiet house  
Plaiting her hair by the fire woman  
With no lover to free her desire  
How long do you think she can stick it out  
How long do you think before shell go out woman  
Hey Get up on your feet and go get it now  
Like it or not we keep bouncing back  
Because were woman  
  
No we never die for long  
While weve got that little life  
To live for where its hid inside  
Oh Woman two in one  
  
Theres room for a life in your womb woman  
Inside of you can be two woman  
Theres room for a life in your womb woman  
Mama woman aha  
  
Amamawomamamawomanaha

Oh mamawoman twoinaone aha  
Oh two in one aha  
Oh woman Woman Woman Woman  
Theres room for a life in your womb  
Theres room for a life in your womb  
Two in one aha

Room for a life in your womb
