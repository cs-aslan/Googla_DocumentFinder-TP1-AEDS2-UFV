When I was a young boy  
Said put away those young boy ways  
Now that Im getting older so much older  
I long all those young boy days  
With a girl like you  
With a girl like you  
Lord knows there are things we can do baby  
Just me and you  
Come on and make it a  
  
Hurt so good  
Come on baby make it hurt so good  
Sometimes love dont feel like it should  
You make it hurt so good  
  
You dont have to be so exciting  
Just trying to give myself a little bit of fun yeah  
You always look so inviting  
You aint as green as you are young  
Hey baby its you  
Come on girl now its you  
Sink your teeth right through my bones baby  
Lets see what we can do  
Come on and make it a  
  
Hurt so good  
Come on baby make it hurt so good  
Sometimes love dont feel like it should  
You make it hurt so good  
  
I aint talking no big deals  
I aint made no plans myself  
I aint talking no high heels  
Maybe we could walking around all day long  
Walking around all day long  
  
Hurt so good  
Come on baby make it hurt so good  
Sometimes love dont feel like it should  
You make it hurt so good  
Hurt so good  
Come on baby make it hurt so good  
Sometimes love dont feel like it should  
You make it hurt so good  
  
Hey hey
