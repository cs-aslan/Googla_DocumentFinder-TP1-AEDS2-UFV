Somebody lookin for the answer  
Somebody dyin to cut a deal  
Somebody got a cure to cancer  
Somebody drunk behind the wheel  
But me Im just tryin to find my little Suzie  
  
Somebody bustin illegal aliens  
Somebody burnin Hollywood  
Somebody tryin to shoot the president  
Someone abused and misunderstood  
But me Im just holding up a sign for little Suzie  
  
Somebody reachin out for Jesus  
Somebody lookin for a sign  
Somebody said they spotted Elvis  
He was healin the sick and leadin the blind  
But me Im just tryin to make some time for my little Suzie  
Yeah me Im sneakin up behind dont you hear me say  
  
I wont surrender I will survive so help me Jesus  
Well be together until the end of all space and time  
  
Everybodys got an infomercial  
Everybodys psychic on the phone  
Somebody had a sex change reversal  
Somebody thinks nobody knows  
Somebody cryin out for justice  
Somebody shootin someones kid  
Somebody caught the perpetrator  
Somebody swears they never did  
But me Im just makin time for my little Suzie  
Yeah me Im playin my guitar for my little Suzie  
  
The world is gonna turn from here until doomsday  
But I dont give a damn long as Ive got little Suzie  
  
I wont surrender I will survive so help me Jesus  
Well be together until the end of all space and time  
  
Somebodys awaiting execution  
Somebodys dyin to pull the switch  
Somebody cries another martyr  
Somebody screams fry the son of a bitch  
But me Im just spending time with little Suzie  
Yeah me Im playing my guitar for little Suzie  
Oh me Im safe in the arms of little Suzie
