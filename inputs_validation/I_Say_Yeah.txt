When I ask questions dont tell no lies  
Just look me in the eyes  
Dont say no and dont say maybe  
And dont ask me why  
Just say yeah yes yes is what to say  
Just say yeah yes and go along your way ooh baby now  
  
When you need me well Ill come running  
And thats the way to be  
Just call on me when you want some loving  
And Ill give it all for free  
Ill say yeah yes yes is what to say  
Ill say yeah yes and well go along a way ooh baby now  
  
Well we dont need no shove  
Cause I just fall in love with you child  
Well we dont need no push  
Cause we just dig the rush with you
