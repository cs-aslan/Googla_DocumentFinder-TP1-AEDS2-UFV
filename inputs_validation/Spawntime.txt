He loves his mother  
And from one side  
The fish gives to her himself  
It sheds its skin in front of empty testicles  
The old skin falls on the floor  
He loves his sister  
And from the back  
Eats its way through to the mouth  
The gills bloody still from sucking  
At the red large eyes  
Spawntime  
It is spawntime  
He loves the dog  
Oh god from above  
The fish now kisses with the tongue  
Spits dead milk into your face  
You dont dare to touch him  
Spawntime  
Everywhere fishmilk  
It is spawntime  
The mother was taken by the sea  
Spawntime  
The sisters dont have time  
Spawntime  
The dog stands waving at the shore  
Spawntime  
The fish needs his lonelyness  
Spawntime
