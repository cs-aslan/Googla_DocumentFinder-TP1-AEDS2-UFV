I been workin the whole day long  
On these railroad ties singin a sad sad song  
Down the track is a bad way to live  
The boss mans whip is all hes got to give  
And late at night in the twilight of the South  
They put you in a cell and let the bulldogs out  
The old cat down the way  
Well hes singin out the blues  
Cause hes got no one back home  
Oh somebody sighed  
Next day comes they send you back out on the track  
All that sweat be drippin down off your back  
Everybodys singin a workin mans song  
Hopin they dont have to feel the whip on their bone  
The water boy slowly works his way around  
A bucket full of swamp water weighin him down  
Old Squezer Walker just fell out on the ground  
And theyre draggin his body away  
Oh my my my  
  
Well theres talk around camp  
That theres gonna be a fight  
Old Razor Face and Willie Black  
The meanest dudes in sight  
Ones got a razor and the others got a knife  
But only ones gonna walk out alive  
  
Oh baby mama get me out of here  
Cant stand no more  
This place is gonna be the death of me  
Believe to my soul that I gotta be free  
Theres only one way that its every gonna be  
Thats when the angels come and take me away  
Well now  
  
Oh baby mama get me out of here  
Cant stand no more  
This place is gonna be the death of me  
Believe to my soul that I gotta be free  
Theres only one way that its every gonna be  
Thats when the angels come and take me away  
Well now
