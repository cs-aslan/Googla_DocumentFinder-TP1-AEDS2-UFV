I walked through the door with you the air was cold  
But something about it felt like home somehow  
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house  
And you still got it in your drawer even now  
  
Oh your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze  
Were singing in the car getting lost upstate  
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place  
And I can picture it after all these days  
  
And I know its long gone  
And that magics not here no more  
And I might be okay  
But Im not fine at all  
  
Cause there we are again on that little town street  
You almost ran the red cause you were looking over me  
Wind in my hair I was there I remember it all too well  
  
Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red  
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed  
Your mothers telling stories about you on the tee ball team  
You tell me about your past thinking your future was me  
  
And I know its long gone  
And theres nothing else I could do  
And I forget about you long enough  
To forget why I needed to  
  
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night  
Were dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light  
Down the stairs I was there I remember it all too well  
  
And maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much  
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up  
Running scared I was there I remember it all too well  
  
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise  
So casually cruel in the name of being honest  
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here  
Cause I remember it all all all too well  
  
Time wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it  
Id like to be my old self again but Im still trying to find it  
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own  
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone  
  
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week  
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me  
You cant get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah  
  
Cause there we are again when I loved you so  
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known  
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well  
  
Wind in my hair you were there you remember it all  
Down the stairs you were there you remember it all  
It was rare I was there I remember it all to well
