Every time my ship comes in  
A hurricane blows it out again  
Stormy weather seems to hang around my door  
My sweet bird of paradise  
Flew the coop on me last night  
Oh and every time it rains lord dont it pour  
  
I got a letter from the I Are S  
They said son youre in a hell of a mess  
Our computer shows you owe tenthousand more  
That machines made a bad mistake  
cause thats more than this poor boy makes  
Oh and every time it rains lord dont it pour  
  
Every time it rains I just wash my car  
The whole neighbourhood goes  
Swimmin in my front yard  
Well my motherinlaw says shes  
Stayin three weeks more  
Oh and every time it rains lord dont it pour  
  
Just got my car out of the shop  
Two blocks down the street it stopped  
I went to use the telephone at the grocery store  
I walked back to my chevrolet  
But they towed that sucker away  
Oh and every time it rains lord dont it pour  
  
Every time it rains I just wash my car  
The whole neighbourhood goes  
Swimmin in my front yard  
Well my motherinlaw says shes  
Stayin three weeks more  
Oh and every time it rains lord dont it pour  
Well every time it rains lord dont it pour
