As Im leaving a change come on my eyes  
These streets persuading me with mumbled strange goodbyes  
Through the water through the ring  To the soul of everything  
Throw my heart out on the stones and Im almost gone  
  
Theres no meaning in clothes and coffee cups  
Cheap hotel furniture where silence never stops  
Through the water through the ring  To the sould of everything  
Cry my eyes out to the winds and Im almost gone  
  
Almost gone  
And Im dreaming just staring at the walls  
At cars all frozen now and street light waterfalls  
Through the water through the ring  To the soul of everything  
  
Throw my heart out on the stone and Im almost gone  
Through the water through the ring  To the soul of everything  
Wash my heart out on the stones  and Im almost gone  
Almost gone
