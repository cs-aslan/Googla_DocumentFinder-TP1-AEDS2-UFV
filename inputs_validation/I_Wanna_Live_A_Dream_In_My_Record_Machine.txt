Help me defy the light the shining on me  
To get back what theyve taken from me  
With a little fire where its cold  
  
Show me the path that leads to all the glory  
The words that tell a sacred story  
With a little fire where its cold  
  
I wanna live in a dream in my record machine  
I wanna picture the world and everyone inside my mouth  
Cos all the money I waste is it a matter of taste  
I wanna picture the world and you cant make me spit it out  
  
Take me back from the darkness where they  
Sent me give hope to places to where they cant be  
With a little fire where its cold  
  
I wanna live in a dream in my record machine  
I wanna picture the world n everyone inside my mouth  
Cos all the money I waste is it a matter of taste  
I wanna picture the world and you cant make me spit it out  
  
You cant give me a reason I want me want to shine  
You cant give me the feelings cos theyre already mine  
You get one in a million and if the sun wont rise  
On my soul then Ill go
