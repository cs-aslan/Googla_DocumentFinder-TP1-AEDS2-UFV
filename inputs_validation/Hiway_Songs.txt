When I walk the hill so high  
Around the town where I was born  
New York seems so far away  
Though I was there just yesterday  
I have played on my guitar  
In coffeehouses hall and bars  
Everyone that I call friend  
Knows they will not be forgot  
Trains and planes and rented cars  
Singers saints and other starts  
I suspect them every one  
Theyll never change its too much fun  
Just for now Id like to rest  
In the shade of a maple tree  
To the blue Canadian sky  
Ill say a prayer for the world out there  
When I stand on my own sod  
It feels so good to be home by God  
The winter wind has turned my head  
But I always came up warm somehow  
Bottles beads and cigarettes  
And lovers that I aint found yet  
Pickin with a friend till dawn  
And singing all of those hiway songs  
Just for now Id like to rest  
In the shade of a maple tree  
To the blue Canadian sky  
Ill say a prayer for the world out there  
When I walk the hill so high  
Around the town where I was born  
New York seems so far away  
Though I was there just yesterday  
I would travel all my life  
If loneliness was not the price  
While headin north across that lines  
The only time Im flyin
