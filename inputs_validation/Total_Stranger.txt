Is anybody out there  
Theres no knock on my door  
No one comes anymore  
To this island  
Trapped on memory lane  
Caught in yesturdays rain  
In the silence  
I have looked in your eye  
Calling your name outloud  
But you look right through me  
Like a ghost in a crowd  
Just like a total stranger  
Behind those walls of stone  
Ive been a missing person  
Location unknown  
Living like a total stranger  
A nowhere man  
You see I couldnt get a listed number  
Living in a now mans land  
Well did you take me for dead  
Did you know I still bled  
With desire  
Hey Im talking to you  
But the words dont come through  
On this wire  
Im a voice in the dark  
Crying out to the ghost  
So I reach out my hand  
Like a man overboard  
Just like a total stranger  
Behind those walls of stone  
Ive been a missing person  
Location unknown  
Living like a total stranger  
A nowhere man  
You see I couldnt get a listed number  
Living in a no mans land  
Im a voice in the dark  
Crying out to the ghost  
So I reach out my hand  
Like a man overboard  
Just like a total stranger  
Behind those walls of stone  
Ive been a missing person  
Location unknown  
Living like a total stranger  
Does anybody understand  
You see I couldnt get a listed number  
Living in a no mans land  
Is anybody out there  
Is anybody out there  
Is anybody out there
