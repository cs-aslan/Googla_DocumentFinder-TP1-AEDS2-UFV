Dont hesitate there is no time like now  
For you to break the habits of a lifetime  
Babe get on your pony and ride  
Make no mistake were gonna cry at your funeral  
Tbone steak french fries for heavens sake  
Your bellys bigger than your eyes  
All you could eat for a dollar and a dream  
And the drinks are on the house at the funeral parlor  
If you dont know whats good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey  
wake up time to fly  
Sugar kiss sugar kicks like a mule  
Aint that the truth and youre a strawberry fool  
Look at your hips look at the cream in your coffee  
You could whip it or we could cry at your funeral  
If you dont know whats good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey  
Well if you dont know whats good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey hey hey  
Well if you dont know whats good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey  
If you dont know whats good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey  
If you dont know  
If you dont know  
Whats good  
If you dont know
