Lil Wayne  
Okay Im talkin about a  
Good girl gone bad  
Crooked world wrong path  
Right Mom wrong Dad  
I sing this song mad but not mad enough to shoot you  
But it just eats me up like some bbq from Luthers  
In the mornin with the roosters  
On the corner with the boosters  
And shes the freshcut and theyre on her like sutures  
And I wanna talk to her  
But her Mama has to school her  
I wanna see her better  
Shes the weather of my future  
I dont wanna see another hurricane  
Baby you can kill the pain  
If you just let me explain  
Trust me I know what Im sayin  
You will end up on the track of an oncoming train  
Stuck in the passenger seat  
Travlin through the fast lane  
  
Bun B  
Well once upon a time there was a Mom and a Dad  
Who on the outside had everything people wished they had  
A beautiful daughter two story house two car garage  
And a white picket fence wrapped around the front yard  
See Daddy was a doctor  
And Mommy was a banker  
Mommys job got outsourced  
So now Mommys dranker  
Daddy had a malpractice suit  
Now hes a snorter  
And all this shits takin place  
Right in front of their daughter  
She says Daddy whats wrong  
But hes just too high  
Mommy what we gon do  
She just get drunk and cry  
Caught in the middle of two wrongs tryin to do right  
Lookin for answers alone in the darkness of night  
Shit anit right Lil girl gone some where out there stranded cant nobody
find her and they dont understand it she was raise hood cant blame her
parents lost in the sauce not the why that they planed it
