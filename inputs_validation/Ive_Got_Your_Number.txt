So many signs  
So many ways  
Its a living thing  
No need to rush  
The buzz will last for days  
  
When you discover  
Im just a man  
Take it girl  
Or leave it  
Dont be reading out the label on the can  
  
I got your number  
I got your number  
I got your number  
  
Ill be your lover  
Ill be your friend  
Ill be your friend  
And your brother in love  
But thats where the story ends  
  
If you say jump  
Ill do it with affection  
But dont get pissed  
If I dont move  
Too fast in your direction  
  
I got your number  
I got your number  
I got your number  
  
Its that same old nonsense  
That same old look  
But now Im turning back  
And I can read you like a book  
It all means nothing  
Nothing at all  
Its the same old business  
Man it drives me up the wall  
  
You made the potion too strong  
I feel Im going soft  
Ive been that way far too long  
You see now its wearing off  
  
So many times  
So many days  
Its a spiritual thing  
That loving touch  
I thought youd be amazed  
  
I like the distance  
I like the space  
The moneys good  
The rent is cheap  
And I can read suspicion on your face  
  
I got your number  
I got your number  
I got your number
