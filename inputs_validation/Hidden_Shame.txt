Im sorry to say that you dont know me  
Im sad in ways you never understood  
Each time I try to tell the ugly truth you always let it pass you by  
You said I d never tell you a lie just because I could  
Did you really think I was a bad man  
You always said that that should be my middle name  
But you dont know the half of it you dont know how that name fits  
You dont know my hidden shame  
Hidden shame shame shame  
That I cant get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity  
Till you know my hidden shame you really dont know me  
Well theres a different kind of prison  
And it dont even have to look much like a cell  
Its already on your mind boy we can see it in your eyes  
So heres the bars and walls as well  
Well you know Im never coming home babe  
You said youd stand by me until I cleared my name  
Sure its easy to be strong when you know the charge is wrong  
But the days and weeks get long  
When youve got a hidden shame  
Hidden shame shame shame  
That I cant get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity  
Till you know my hidden shame you really dont know me  
I had a friend when I was just a boy  
We were like brothers we would run and hide  
And we went walking on a high hillside  
And I really dont know how it happened  
He turned to me and had this strange look in his eye  
And not a single word was spoken  
I must have pushed him but I dont remember why  
And all at once he lay there broken  
And I walked down without him and I didnt even sigh  
Hidden shame shame shame  
That I cant get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity  
Till you know my hidden shame you really dont know me  
They say you always hurt the one you love  
And Im not saying if I did or if I didnt  
But like my shame that kind of love is always hidden  
They locked me up here for the ideas in my head  
They never got me for the thing I really did  
Hidden shame shame shame  
That I cant get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity  
Till you know my hidden shame you really dont know me  
You really dont know me you really dont know me
