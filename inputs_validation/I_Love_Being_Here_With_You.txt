What you mean wanna know how I feel about you baby  
Be poetic about it alright  
  
I love the east I love the west  
And north and south theyre both the best  
But Ill only go there as a guest  
Cause I love being here with you  
  
I love the sea I love the shore  
I love the rocks but what is more  
With you theyd never be a bore  
Cause I love being here with you  
  
Singin in the shower laughin by the hour  
Life is such a breezy game  
Love all kinds of weather as long were together  
I love to hear you say my name  
  
I like good wine and fine cuisine  
And candle light I like the scene  
But baby if you know what I mean  
Cause I love being here with you  
I love being here with you  
  
I like a dance by Fred Astaire  
And Brandos eyes Yul Brynners hair  
But I think to tell yous only fair  
That I love being here with you  
  
And Cary Grant oh dodahday  
His utter charm takes me away  
But dont get me wrong how do you say  
I love being here with you  
  
Oh Basies bands aswingin I like Ella singin  
Cause theres something else you know  
They know how to say it they know how to play it  
They wind it up and let it go  
  
I love the thrill of New York shows  
Id love to Durantes nose  
But Id like to say before I close yeah yeah  
I just love baby I love well I love being here with you
