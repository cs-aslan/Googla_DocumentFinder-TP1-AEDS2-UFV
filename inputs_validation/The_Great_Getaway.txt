As we kicked around downtown waiting for the sun to rise  
we watched the clouds  
take the shape of a chevrolet  
and the way that Im feeling is the color of my lovers eyes  
she caught me lookin the other way  
thinkin finally of our better days  
  
As she climbs her way  
up to the top of me  
we look down on everyone  
and we proclaim that we  
dont know how long well be  
as we kiss the world goodbye  
kiss the world goodbye  
and well be gone  
into the sky and out of our minds  
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time  
wish us luck  
  
Trippin on a flat tire  
dial up the triple A  
time is running out for our escape  
so much for that chevrolet  
eyes shut tight as we venture to another place  
as we listen to the music play  
I cant remember what I had to say  
  
As she climbs her way  
up to the top of me  
we look down on everyone  
and we proclaim that we  
dont know how long well be  
as we kiss the world goodbye  
kiss the world goodbye  
and well be gone  
into the sky and out of our minds  
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time  
wish us luck  
  
As she climbs her way  
up to the top of me  
we look down on everyone  
and we proclaim that we  
dont know how long well be  
as we kiss the world goodbye  
kiss the world goodbye  
kiss the world goodbye  
0and well be gone  
into the sky and out of our minds  
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time  
wish us luck
