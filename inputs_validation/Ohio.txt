it was a day like this and my house burnt down  
and the walls were thin and they crashed to the ground  
it was a day like this and my life unwound  
you couldve struck me a line and thats okay now  
we could always put it together again  
you couldve told me a lie and a lie so thin so thin  
now everythings clear  
day after day and the life goes on  
and I try to see the good in everyone  
if I ever find myself here again  
Ill give everything
