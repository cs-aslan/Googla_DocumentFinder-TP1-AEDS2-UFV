One thing that I must have missed  
When I first met you  
Is that you only meant to love me  
Until you found someone new  
I guess I should have seen  
That you had one foot out the door  
Now I dont go down Rampart Street no more  
  
Back in the beginning  
You could look me in the eye  
Do you really think  
That I am just some stupid guy  
Cause now you tell your story  
As you stare down at the floor  
Cause I dont go down Rampart Street no more  
  
I dont wanna go back there  
You wont put your hooks in me  
Im all alone tonight  
But Ill be alright  
  
You used to get excited  
Every time Id come around  
You couldnt wait to sample  
What Id brought you from downtown  
Up to your apartment  
Id be knocking on your door  
I dont go down Rampart Street no more  
No I dont go down Rampart Street no more
