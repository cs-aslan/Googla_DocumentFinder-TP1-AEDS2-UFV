Johnny Marks  
  
Rocking around the Christmas tree  
At the Christmas party hop  
Mistletoe hung where you can see  
Every couple tries to stop  
Rocking around the Christmas tree  
Let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later well have some pumpkin pie  
And well do some caroling  
  
You will get a sentimental  
Feeling when you hear  
Voices singing lets be jolly  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Rocking around the Christmas tree  
Have a happy holiday  
Everyone dancing merrily  
In the new oldfashioned way
