If you ever leave me Ill be sadand blue  
Dont you ever leave me Im so in love with you  
The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely  
If they knew that I lost my one and only  
Theyd be sad if youre bad to me  
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin  
If they heard from the breeze that you left me crying  
Theyd be sad dont be bad to me  
But I know you wont leave me cause you told me so  
And Ive no intention of letting you go  
Just as long as you let me know you wont be bad to me  
So the birds in the sky wont be sad and lonely  
Cause they know I got my one and only  
Theyd be glad that youre not bad to me  
But I know you wont leave me cause you told me so  
And Ive no intention of letting you go  
Just as long as you let me know you wont be bad to me  
So the birds in the sky wont be sad and lonely  
 Cos they know I got my one and only  
Theyd be glad that youre not bad to me  
Theyd be glas that youre not bad to me to me to me
