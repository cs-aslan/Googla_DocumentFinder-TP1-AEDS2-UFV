She got the long blond hair  
Got the red sports car  
And you know shes got the  
Top laid back  
She got the movie star smile  
Got the sun kissed tan  
Santa Barbara in summer  
Yeah she feels like that  
  
Hey shes like a canyon drive  
In a midnight sky  
Those eyes are deep enough  
To get lost  
Her legs are palm tree tall  
The way she walks  
Like the heat on a runway  
When the cameras go off  
  
Shes small town from the country  
She aint big time but she could be  
  
Chorus  
Hey Hollywood never looked this good  
Bright as the big screen burns  
Hey I bet drivin down sunset  
Theyre lookin for a face like hers  
Yeah Ive been all around this world  
And shed be California  
If California was a girl  
  
Shes like a red red wine  
Like a righteous wave  
Shes a day at the beach in Corona del Mar  
Shes never been out there  
Felt the bright spot light  
But she could have her own star  
On that dreamers boulevard  
  
Ive driven down that coastline  
And Ive stood there under that big sign  
  
Chorus  
  
Id chase that wild sunset  
Id be gone on my way  
Way out west  
Yeah Ive been all around this town  
  
Hey Hollywood never looked this good  
Bright as the big screen  
  
Chorus  
  
Now shed be California  
Hey California  
  
She got the long blonde hair  
Got the red sports car  
And you know shes got the  
Top laid back  
She got the movie star smile  
Got the sun kissed tan  
Santa Barbara in summer  
Yeah she feels like that  
  
Yeah shed be California  
Hey Hollywood
