You dont dress up in satin  
You dont wear diamond rings  
But Im satisfied with you  
You look just like an angel but you havent got wings  
But Im satisfied with you  
  
Id rather have you just the way that you are  
Than change you for somebody new  
Maybe I could do better if I reached for a star  
But Im satisfied with you  
  
Youre not made out of candy  
But youre as sweet as you can be  
So Im satisfied with you  
I just cant see no reason why you bother with me  
But Im satisfied with you  
  
I often wonder if its all a mistake  
Its hard to believe that its true  
But If Im only dreaming I sure dont want to wake  
Cause Im satisfied with you  
Im satisfied with you
