Cool as the water melting from the winter snows  
You are the island Ive been looking for  
I dont know where you come from  
But I can feel you comin on  
Youre a storm inside my soul  
Thats ragin out of control  
  
Chorus  
Call the wind out  
Call out the thunder  
Oh lightning only you can will the weather  
I said come on  
Wont ya come on  
Lightning youre mine  
  
Tonight tonight  
You caught me while I was sleepin  
Restin from a heavy run  
I saw you in your evening gown  
You were lighting up the sky  
No matter what tomorrow brings  
Lightning your mine tonight  
Woah lightning your mine tonight  
  
Crack the horizon  
Only you can split the night  
Then comes your mother cloud to take you away  
Another wind will dry me  
And the sun will make me warm  
But to me my life will always be  
The calm before the storm  
  
ChorusRepeat x2
