Big sky big sky holding up the sun  
Big sky big sky holding up the moon  
Big sky holding down the sea  
But it cant hold us down anymore  
  
Big sky holding up the stars  
Big sky holding Venus and Mars  
Big sky catch you in a jar  
But it cant hold us down anymore  
  
Big sky big enormous place  
Big wind blow all over the place  
Big storm wrecking havoc and waste  
But it cant hold us down anymore  
  
Ooohhh big goals big ambitious goals  
Big talk talking till I fold  
Big wind talking through torrential love  
But it cant hold us down anymore  
  
Big sin big sin big original sin  
Paradise where Ive never been  
Big snake break the skin  
But you cant hold us down anymore  
  
A big house holds a family  
A big room it holds you and me  
Its a big mess and baby makes three  
But you cant hold us down anymore  
  
Big news theyre out of their heads  
Bigbigbig news lets fuck them instead  
Theres a big joke did they think we were monks  
But they cant hold us down anymore  
  
A big doll big enormous eyes  
Big love holds you in a vise  
A big man who cut them down to size  
They cant hold us down anymore  
  
Big sky big sky holding up the sun  
Big sky holding holding up the moon  
Big sky holding down the sea  
But it cant hold us down anymore  
  
Oh big doll big enormous eyes  
Big love holds you in a vise  
A big man who cut them down to size ah  
They cant hold us down anymore  
  
Oh oh big sky  
Big sky  
Big sky  
Ah they cant hold us down anymore
