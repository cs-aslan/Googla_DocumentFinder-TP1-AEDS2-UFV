Chorus  
Here we go vertigo  
Video vertigo  
Test for echo  
Here we go in slomo  
Video vertigo  
Test for echo  
  
Some kind of trouble on the sensory screen  
Camera curves over cavedin cop cars  
Bleachercreatures wouldbe desperados  
Clutch at plausible deniability  
Dont touch that dial  
Were in denial  
Until the showcase trial on TV  
  
Some kind of pictures on the sense oclock news  
Miles of yellow tape silhouetted chalk lines  
Toughtalking hood boys in proteam logo knockoffs  
Conform to uniforms of some corporate entity  
Dont change that station  
Its Gangster Nation  
Now crimes in syndication on TV  
  
Chorus  
  
Some kind of drama live on satellite  
Hidden camera coverage from the crime scene to the courtroom  
Nailbiting hood boys in borrowed ties and jackets  
Clutching at the straws of respectability  
Cant do the time  
Dont do the crime  
And wind up in the perp walk on TV
