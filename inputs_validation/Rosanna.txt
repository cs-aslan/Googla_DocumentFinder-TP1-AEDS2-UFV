All I want to do when I wake up in the morning is see your eyes  
Rosanna Rosanna  
I never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me Rosanna  
All I want to do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight  
Rosanna Rosanna  
  
I didnt know you were looking for more than I could ever be  
Not quite a year since she went away Rosanna  
Now shes gone and I have to say  
  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
  
I can see your face still shining through the window on the other side  
Rosanna Rosanna  
I didnt know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad Rosanna  
All I want to tell you is now youll never ever have to compromise  
Rosanna Rosanna  
  
I never thought that losing you could ever hurt so bad  
Not quite a year since she went away Rosanna  
Now shes gone and I have to say  
  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
  
Not quite a year since she went away  
Who is it Rosanna  
Now shes gone and I have to say  
  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna
