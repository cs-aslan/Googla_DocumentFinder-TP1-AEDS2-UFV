The golden light above you shows me where youre from  
The magic in your eye bewitches all you gaze upon  
You stand up on your hill behop all around you  
They wonder where youre from oh yeah  
They wonder where I found you  
  
Oh my love its a long way  
Where youre from its a long way  
  
I tried to understand you I tried to love you right  
The way you smile and touch me always sets my heart alight  
Your lips are like a fire burning through my soul  
And people ask me where youre from  
They really wanna know  
  
Oh my soul its a long way  
Where youre from its a long way  
  
Magic woman wreckin up my soul  
Things you tell me have never been told  
Magic woman I dont know  
Electric before me I love you so I love you so  
  
Youre racing like a fireball dancing like a ghost  
Youre Gemini and I dont know which one I like the most  
My head is getting broken and my mind is getting bust  
But now Im coming with you down the road of golden dust  
  
Oh my love its a long way  
Where youre from its a long way  
  
The golden light above you show me where youre from  
The magic in your eye bewitches all you gaze upon  
You stand up on your hill behop all around you  
They wonder where youre from oh yeah  
They wonder where I found you  
  
Oh my love its a long way  
Where youre from its a long way
