Keep smiling keep smiling keep smiling keep right on smiling  
I know sometimes your whole world seems blue  
Seems like the whole weight of the world is resting on you  
But remember when you hang your head its hard to see the sun  
Theres a brighter day yes it is just ask and I sure will come  
But youve got to keep keep smiling well ooh yeah  
keep smiling keep on keep on keep on keep on  
keep smiling ooh ha dont you ever stop smiling  
Oh dont you ever stop no no no oh when youve got to keep on stepping
on  
You know that youve got to be strong and understand the facts of life  
You wont get no place until you make some sacrifice  
Try to make it a little easy when youre doing it on your own  
Once you think youve got everything the next day its all gone  
But you got to keep keep smiling well well well well keep smiling  
Oh I know its hard I know its hard but youve to keep keep smiling
