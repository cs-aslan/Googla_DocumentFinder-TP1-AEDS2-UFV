Once I found the perfect love  
And you showed me everything there was  
to know of love  
Time will not betray the truth  
And for all the years weve shared  
I celebrate with you  
For you  
  
Un giorno tincontrai  
And me  
Pensai Adesso lei  
Will be  
Dallora insieme noi  
  
Forever  
You are all I know of love  
How could I ask for more  
Youre everything Im dreaming of  
Youre all I need from love  
And every star above  
Spells out your name  
I swear Ill always feel the same  
Youre all I want  
  
From love  
All I want from love  
Dimmi  
Che per leternita  
Like a memory  
Mi terrai ad abitare nei pensieri tuoi  
Con te  
You are my only heart  
In te  
I loved you from the start  
Noi due  
Together not apart  
  
Forever  
You are all I know of love  
How could I ask for more  
Youre everything Im dreaming of  
Youre all I need from love  
And every star above  
Spells out your name  
I swear Ill always feel the same  
Youre all Want  
  
From love  
  
Youre all I want from love  
  
Pensami  
I think of him  
Percheio sogno te  
Youll be with me  
Due cuori e un anima  
My love flows free through you  
E liberi  
I live my whole life  
Ill live my life  
  
To be with you  
Youll always be the one who taught me  
Everything my heart knows to be sure  
My heart knows you  
Youre all I know of love  
How could I ask for more  
Youre everything Im dreaming of  
Youre all I need from love  
  
And every star above  
Every star above  
  
Spells out your name  
I swear Ill always feel the same  
Youre all I want  
  
From love  
Youre all I want from love  
  
Youre all I know of love
