Harry made a bareback rider proud and free upon a horse  
And a fine coal miner for the NCB that was  
A fallen angel and Jesus on the cross  
A skating ballerina you should have seen her do the skaters waltz  
Some people have got to paint and draw  
Harry had to work in clay and stone  
Like the waves coming to the shore  
It was in his blood and in his bones  
  
Ignored by all the trendy boys in London and in Leeds  
He might as well have been making toys or strings of beads  
He could not be in the gallery  
And then you get an artist says he doesnt want to paint at all  
He takes an empty canvas and sticks it on the wall  
The birds of a feather all the phonies and all of the fakes  
  
While the dealers they get together  
And they decide who gets the breaks  
And whos going to be in the gallery  
No lies he wouldnt compromise  
No junk no bits of string  
  
And all the lies we subsidize  
That just dont mean a thing  
Ive got to say he passed away in obscurity  
And now all the vultures are coming down from the tree  
So hes going to be in the gallery
