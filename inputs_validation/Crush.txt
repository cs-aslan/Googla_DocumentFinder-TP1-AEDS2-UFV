I guess I shouldve known  
It wasnt gonna end okay  
Youre such a trouble maker  
But I like you just that way  
  
A bomb tick ticking with me  
The one Id best to blame  
Just like I cant tell  
And Im ready to blow  
I sat around a lot and thought  
About the world without you  
And no matter what you think  
Everything is not about you  
You think Im still hung up on you  
But baby its not true  
  
Now look at me  
Your memoriesre turning to dust  
Theres only one explanation  
I wasnt really in love  
I wasnt really in love  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush  
Sparks fly when we touch  
It was never enough  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush  
Yeah  
  
You found one the things you need  
Theres nothing left to lose  
The things I never wanna be  
I owe it all to you  
You just cant help yourself  
Its what you do  
Cause this is real life  
Not your show  
  
Now look at me  
The memories turn to dust  
Theres only one explanation  
I wasnt really in love  
I wasnt really in love  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush  
Sparks fly when we touched  
It was never enough  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush  
Yeah  
  
Youll be fine  
Just find another girl  
To kick around  
Wont be long  
Until they all know what  
I figured out  
  
Now look at me  
Memories turn to dust  
Theres only one explanation  
I wasnt really in love  
I wasnt really in love  
It was just a crush  
It just was a crush  
Sparks fly when we touched  
It was never enough  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush It was just a crush  
Yeah  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush  
Yeah
