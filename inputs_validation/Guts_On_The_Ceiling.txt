Oh youll never guess whats up  
My mucking head blew up  
My chins in an old mans backyard  
I gotta sneak threw his yard  
To find the fothermucker  
And hes gotta pitbull dog  
And its sitting on my chin like a frog on a log  
I throw a bone to try to distract  
cause Im wanting my chinnychinchin back  
Ill never be one to boast  
But theres my tongue hanging off the lightpost  
cause my head exploded  
And my brains unloaded  
All over this beautiful city  
Teeth and bones to the nitty gritty  
Theres my eyeball stuck to the wall  
Right next to my splattered jaw  
I dont dig this game  
Chasing my brains all through the sewer drains  
My heads all over the block  
cause I done went lunaticktock ticktock  
Come on dawg whats wrong with my head  
It blew apart but I still aint dead  
I get no respect  
I got nothing but guts hanging off my neck  
But Ill still chilling  
Even with my blood and guts all over the ceiling  
Im chillin Im illin  
With my guts all over the ceiling  
Chorus X4 Im chillin Im illin  
With my guts all over the ceiling  
Oh youll never guess whats up  
My mucking back blew up  
If you come across a spine  
Best believe its mine  
Oh forget about my tongue  
cause vato cant breathe without no lungs  
I lost both of mine  
Now thats an item that I wouldnt mind to find  
But forget about dat  
cause Im roaming the streets with a splattered back  
Im trying to rap to this freak  
But she can see my ribs all in the street  
Then the chitchat went dead  
She noticed that I aint got no head  
Shhh I think I hear my heart  
But damn it got hit by a Smark bus  
And landed in Pontiac  
So I tell my mellow to send it back  
Come on wined and my back blow up  
Look for my guts look for my guts  
I gotta call from Nate the Mack  
Says he might of found part of my back  
Then bring it on over ace  
I got slabs all over the place  
But Im still chillin  
Even with my blood and guts all over the ceiling  
Chorus X4  
Youll never guess whats up  
Ahh Im down on my luck  
Got no head  
Said I got no head  
Southwest ghetto zone  
It done fried my brain  
Chorus until fade
