Im in Outland  
Sex tension  
She whispers things I need  
Look in her heart  
Slow motion  
Ive been expecting you  
Im in Outland  
Ill do anything  
Im in Outland  
Storm my heart  
Tear me up if you like  
Come closer  
Say nothing  
Ive got something for you  
I shape sound  
I shape time  
Ill shape your world for you  
Im in Outland  
Ill do anything  
Im in Outland  
Emotion  
Dark whispers in my head  
Got the sex scream  
On new film  
Ive got the friend I need  
Dont play safe  
Dont play clean  
Dont play if you cant lose  
Im in Outland  
Ill do anything
