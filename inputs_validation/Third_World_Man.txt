Johnnys playroom  
Is a bunker filled with sand  
Hes become a third world man  
Smoky Sunday  
Hes been mobilized since dawn  
Now hes crouching on the lawn  
Hes a third world man  
  
Soon youll throw down your disguise  
Well see behind those bright eyes  
By and by  
When the sidewalks are safe  
For the little guy  
  
I saw the fireworks  
I believed that I was dreaming  
Till the neighbors came out screaming  
Hes a third world man  
  
Soon youll throw down your disguise  
Well see behind those bright eyes  
By and by  
When the sidewalks are safe  
For the little guys  
  
When hes crying out  
I just sing that Ghana Rondo  
E lera del terzo mondo  
Hes a third world man
