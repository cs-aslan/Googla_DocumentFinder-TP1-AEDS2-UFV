Shes closing all the shades  
She finds the daylight just a little frightening  
She pulls the pedals overhead each day  
But shes opening her business is blooming nightly  
And every time it does it gets me hazy  
The color of her head changing every day  
A little breath of wind and I just go crazy  
The greening of Americas progressing smoothly  
Cuz shes choosing me  
Its later then I said  
And all the worlds a shade of black and purple  
Everybody else has gone to bed  
But when she makes me happy I just fly in circles  
And every time she does I just get teary  
The color of head changing everyday  
A little puff of wind and shes always near me  
The greening of America is progressing nicely  
Its all right with me  
Ba ba ba ba na na na na na Etc  
If theres another life and if get to chose Id like  
To be a daisy  
Ill stay up waiting for my dusky wife  
To open and get high with just my jasmine baby  
And every time she does it gets me crazy  
The color of her head changing every day  
A little breath of wind and I just get crazy  
The greening of Americas progressing nicely  
Its all right with meevery time she  
She does just get teary  
The color of her head changing every day  
A little breath of wind and shes always near me  
The greening of Americas progressing smoothly  
Cuz shes choosing me
