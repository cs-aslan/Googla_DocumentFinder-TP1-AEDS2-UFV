Gullivers gone to the final command of his master  
His watery eyes had washed all the hills with his laughter  
And the seasons can change all the light from the grey to the dim  
But the light in his eyes will see no more bright  
As the sheep that he locked in the pen  
  
Theres four feet of ground in front of the barn  
Thats sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm  
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare  
Gullivers gone but his memory lies there  
  
By passing the doors of his life was a stage I remember  
And in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger  
For sentiment touched him as Cyclamen holds him  
And later men came from the town  
Who said clear the child this wont take a while  
And Gullivers gone with the dawn
