That feeling that doesnt go away just did  
And I walked a thousand miles to prove it  
And Im caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts  
The color of my blood is all I see on the rocks  
As you sail from me  
  
Alarms will ring for eternity  
The waves will break every chain on me  
My bones will bleach  
My flesh will flee  
So help my lifeless frame to breathe  
  
And God knows Im not dying but I breathe now  
And God knows its the only way to heal now  
With all the blood I lost with you  
It drowns the love I thought I knew  
  
The lost dreams are buried in my sleep for him  
And this was the ecstasy of a love forgotten  
And Im thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets  
And my blood is all I see  
As you steal my soul from me  
  
Alarms will ring for eternity  
The waves will break every chain on me  
  
And God knows Im not dying but I breathe now  
And God knows its the only way to heal now  
With all the blood I lost with you  
It drowns the love I thought I knew  
  
And God knows Im not dying but I breathe now  
And God knows its the only way to heal now  
With all the blood I lost with you  
It drowns the love I thought I knew  
  
And God knows Im not dying but I breathe now  
And God knows its the only way to heal now  
With all the blood I lost with you  
It drowns the love I thought I knew
