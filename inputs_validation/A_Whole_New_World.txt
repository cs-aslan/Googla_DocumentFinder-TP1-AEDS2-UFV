I can show you the world  
Shining shimmering splendid  
Tell me princess now when did  
You last let your heart decide  
  
I can open your eyes  
Take you wonder by wonder  
Over sideways and under  
On a magic carpet ride  
  
A whole new world  
A new fantastic point of view  
No one to tell us no  
Or where to go  
Or say were only dreaming  
  
A whole new world  
A dazzling place I never knew  
But when Im way up here  
Its crystal clear  
That now Im in a whole new world with you  
  
Now Im in a whole new world with you  
  
Unbelievable sights  
Indescribable feeling  
Soaring tumbling freewheeling  
Through an endless diamond sky  
  
A whole new world
