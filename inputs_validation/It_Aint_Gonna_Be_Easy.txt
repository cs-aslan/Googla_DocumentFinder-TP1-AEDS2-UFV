It aint gonna be easy from now on  
Youve been messing around while Ive been gone  
But sometimes telling the truth can be unkind  
Folks who suffer guilt can be so blind  
  
It aint gonna be easy I can tell  
Just how empty Im feeling you know damn well  
Im telling you it aint gonna be easy from the start  
Look out honey youre playing with my heart  
  
It aint gonna be easy thats for sure  
Changing things back the way they were before  
Once youve lifted the lid on such pain  
It aint easy to put it back again  
  
It aint gonna be easy to forget  
Youve been seeing a man that I aint met  
Im telling you that it aint gonna be easy from the start  
Look out baby youre playing with my heart  
  
It aint gonna be so easy this time around  
Turning back the clock on whats gone down  
Oh there comes a time when you need to make a stand  
You gotta play your cards or fold a losing hand  
  
And it aint gonna be easy thats no lie  
But if youre willing to try it so am I  
It aint gonna be so easy from the start  
You better look out darling youre playing with my heart
