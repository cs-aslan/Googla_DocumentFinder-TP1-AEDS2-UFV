Woke up late again this morning  
Cause I was late again last night  
In the mood that I was born in  
And my skin was feelin tight  
I took a short cut to the city  
Had myself a drink or two  
I got over feeling shaky  
But Im still not over you  
  
Chorus  
God I might as well forget you  
You aint never comin true  
Seems like ever since I met you  
Ive been gettin over you  
  
I dont crave no conversation  
I dont need no sympathy  
All I want is my old lady  
That old lady wantin me  
So take me any way you want me  
Ill take you any way I can  
I dont want your sack of candy  
Just some sweetness now and then  
  
Chorus  
I got to get myself together  
With someone who wants some too  
Maybe I can learn to love her  
While Im agettin over you
