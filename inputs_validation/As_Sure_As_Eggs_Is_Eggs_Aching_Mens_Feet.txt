Cant you feel our souls ignite  
Shedding ever changing colours in the darkness of the fading night  
Like the river joins the ocean as the germ in a seed grows  
We have finally been freed to get back home  
  
Theres an angel standing in the sun and hes crying with a loud voice  
This is the supper of the mighty one  
Lord of Lords  
King of Kings  
Has returned to lead his children home  
To take them to the new Jerusalem
