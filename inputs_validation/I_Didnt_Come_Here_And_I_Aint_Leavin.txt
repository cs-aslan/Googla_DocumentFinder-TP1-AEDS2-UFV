I built a big pile of peanut shells on the sawdust floor  
I winked at every pretty girl comin in and out the door  
Yellin Hey bartender how bout two more  
  
Bottle by bottle Im clearin off that shelf  
And I feel so good that Im not quite myself  
Now theyre tellin me that I gotta find someplace else  
Well guess what  
  
I didnt come here and I aint leavin  
Ive been thrown into better places than this  
I didnt come here and I aint leavin  
If you wanna pucker up I got just the place for you to kiss  
  
Well I spent my dollar and drank up my last dime  
Now theyre actin like havin fun is some kind of crime  
If itll make you feel better mister Ill tell you one more time  
  
I didnt come here and I aint leavin  
Ive been thrown into better places than this  
I didnt come here and I aint leavin  
Why dont you pucker up I got just the place for you to kiss  
  
Now you can call me a taxi  
And you can call me a cab  
I know youre gonna call me something  
When I cant pay this tab  
  
I didnt come here and I aint leavin  
Ive been thrown into better places than this  
I didnt come here and I aint leavin  
If you wanna pucker up I got just the place for you to kiss  
Why dont you pucker up I got just the place for you to kiss
