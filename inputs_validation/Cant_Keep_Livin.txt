To go and get that bread nigga heard what I said nigga  
Been misled for a long time waited in a long line  
Finally Im here now this rap game is mine

But I stay to my lonely and didnt show it  
So when I killed you and your homies you wouldnt know it  
Cristal I let you po it while I fuck with the Hennessey  
All this time Im the nigga that you pretend to be  
Tables done turned now Im like remember me  
The same lil nigga you overcharged for a ki  
Times hard on a G you was larger than me  
Young but I aint dumb you aint smarter than me  
Give niggaz a inch and they takin the whole mile
