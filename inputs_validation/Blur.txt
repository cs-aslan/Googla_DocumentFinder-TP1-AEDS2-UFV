Did you ever get the feeling that you were all alone  
And no one ever knew you and you never had a home  
And the lights and the colors do their best to distract you  
Fuck you I dont even know why I like you  
Its all a blur x2  
Like a pictureits all a blur  
You dont know what youre missing  
You dont know what youre missing  
Ive been trying so hard just to keep away  
And now look where I am standing at today  
Trying so hard to walk away  
But its impossible to watch you fade away  
Did you ever stop believing after all was said and done  
When you turned to your friends but they were long gone  
And the sky and the snapshots remind you  
I trust you and Im always going to miss you  
Its all a blur its all a blur  
Like a picture  
Reminds me who you were  
Repeat Chorus  
Every time I see you look at me  
I see those distant eyes and your looks are fading  
Every time youre next to me  
I want to talk and feel and act like we used to  
Cause everybody knows and everybody cares  
Until theyre walking in my shoes  
And now I know  
Its you that I cannot lose  
Its all a blur  
And I owe you  
You can take it all  
When I call pick up the phone like you used to  
Its all a blur  
Like a picture  
Its all a blur  
Youre just a blur  
Ive been trying so hard just to keep away  
And now look where I am standing at today  
Trying so hard to walk away  
But its impossible to watch you fade away  
Trying dying so hard  
Ive been denying that Im not scarred  
Ive been crying lying so far  
But its impossible to fill this space  
Impossible to take your place  
Impossible to watch you fade away  
Watch you fade away x3
