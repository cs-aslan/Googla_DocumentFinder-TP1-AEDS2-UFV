You didnt think about anyone else  
You didnt think about any of us  
When you left that place  
You didnt wanna go anywhere else  
Nothing could satisfy you to you left  
So you went away  
Where you go  
Where are you now  
I ask about  
So many of my friends  
Oh about their ends  
What about us  
Ill reach us to dust  
On the floor again  
I thought we were on an end  
  
You really put me in a quite a position  
You got me struggling as a musician  
With the song  
You like to write about all of your problems  
The Songs because you think it was often  
But youre wrong  
Why did you go  
Why did you unknown  
Maybe my question is  
Why must I come to this  
You talk about being strong yeah  
How I wanna be you and your melody  
  
Tryin to learn about something important  
You keep taking onf space youre annoying  
But our love is so  
Yeah you already know  
Youre tryin to teach me that new is a living  
Youre tryin to teach me way to forgiving  
Make it hard  
Youre such a bad bad boy  
I love you anyway  
No matter what what they say  
You were not approved  
But you are on the moon  
I care about at this terms out  
Its just more than I  
Heaven know how to fight  
I guess Im  
Tell me I have to tell me I have to  
I know you couldnt  
I said I know you could  
Where are you now  
I ask about
