Sometimes late  
When things are real  
And the people share the gift of gab  
Between themselves  
  
Some are quick  
To take the bait  
And the catch the perfect prize  
That waits among the shells  
  
But Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man  
That he didnt didnt already have  
And Cause never was the reason for the evening  
Or the tropic of Sir Galahad  
  
So please  
Believe in me  
When I say Im spinning round round round round  
Smoke glass staind bright colors  
Image going down down down down  
Soapsud green like bubbles  
  
Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man  
That he didnt didnt already have  
And Cause never was the reason for the evening  
Or the tropic of Sir Galahad  
  
So please  
Believe in me  
When I say Im spinning round round round round  
Smoke glass staind bright colors  
Image going down down down down  
Soapsud green like bubbles  
  
No Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man  
That he didnt didnt already have  
And Cause never was the reason for the evening  
Or the tropic of Sir Galahad  
  
So please believe in me
