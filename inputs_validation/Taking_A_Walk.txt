A man came to our house  
I believe it was yesterday  
I would have invited him in  
But I didnt have a lot to say  
His anticipation of me opening the door  
Outweighed my apprehension as it never had before  
And drove my concentration  
Right through that hardwood floor  
Oh uhhuh  
  
Chorus  
Im taking a walk  
Im going outside  
Im taking a walk  
Im just gettin back  
  
Theres a girl in the white house  
I dont even know her name  
Her disheveled appearance  
Speaks volumes of shame  
Its an embarrassing situation  
But a situation just the same  
The way she walks on others  
And never takes the blame  
Upsets my constitution  
Beyond its motor frame  
Oh uhhuh  
  
Chorus  
  
Found a carton departed  
Of my worn out overalls  
From a girl in Cedar Rapids  
Now residing in Idaho Falls  
I wish you couldve been there  
When she opened up the door  
And looked me in the face  
Like she never did before  
I felt about as welcome  
As a WalMart superstore  
Oh uhhuh  
  
Im taking walk Taking a walk  
Im going outside Going outside  
Im taking a walk Taking a walk  
I dont need a ride Just getting by  
Im watching the birds Taking a walk  
Flying so high Going outside
