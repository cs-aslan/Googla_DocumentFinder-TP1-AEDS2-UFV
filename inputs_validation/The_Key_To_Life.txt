Id love to hear my daddy play once again  
All the songs that he taught me when I was a kid  
John Henry Ol Shep and Faded Love  
I Fall To Pieces and On The Wings Of A Dove  
  
Just a few chords on the banjo that was all he knew  
But in the eyes of a child man his fingers flew  
I practiced and I practiced til I got it right  
Packed up everything and just took off one night  
  
I made it from the beer joints to the Opry stage  
He said the only difference is what youre gettin paid  
He didnt care that everybody knew my name  
He said its all for nothin if you dont stay the same  
  
But when he died the preacher cried and said hes the lucky one  
Hes walkin hand in hand in hand with Gods only son  
My faith and common sense tell me the preachers right  
But Id love to hear the banjo ring for me tonight  
  
And I will honor my father with these words I write down  
As long as I remember him hell always be around  
And the pain of losin him cuts like a Randall knife  
I learned a few chords on the banjo as the key to life  
  
And the pain of losin him cuts like a Randall knife  
I learned a few chords on the banjo as the key to life
