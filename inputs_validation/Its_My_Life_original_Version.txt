I gotta reputation  
People know who I am  
Rules are made to be broken  
Cant kill what you dont understand  
I see you runnin scared  
I never knew you cared  
Go and hide yourself in the sand  
Been to hell and back  
I survived and thats a fact  
Chorus  
Its my life  
And Ill do what I wanna  
Do what I wanna  
Do what I like  
Its my life  
And Ill do what I wanna  
Do what I wanna  do  
My New Years resolution  
Is a always the same  
Gonna do what I like  
Were gonna do what I want  
Cause its just my way  
Yeah  
I dont live for tomorrow  
Cause at the end of the day  
Gonna shout it from the roof  
Betta face up to the truth  
ChorusRepeat twice  
Ooh yeah  
Break  
Dont need a invitation  
I dont play hardtoget  
No  
Well Im fame they claim  
I cant be tamed  
Ya know it doesnt matter  
I swear if I like  
I wear what I want  
Chorus Repeat five times
