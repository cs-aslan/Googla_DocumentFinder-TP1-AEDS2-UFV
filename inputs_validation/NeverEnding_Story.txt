Armies have conquered  
And fallen in the end  
Kingdoms have risen  
Then buried by sand  
The earth is our mother  
She gives and she takes  
She puts us to sleep and  
In her light well awake  
Well all be forgotten  
Theres no endless fame  
But everything we do  
Its never in vain  
  
Were part of a story  
Part of a tale  
Were all on this journey  
No ones to stay  
Where is it going  
What is the way  
  
Forests and deserts  
Rivers blue seas  
Mountains and valleys  
Nothing here stays  
While we think we witness  
Were part of the scene  
This neverending story  
Where will it lead to  
The earth is our mother  
She gives and she takes  
But she is also a part  
A part of the tale  
  
Were part of a story  
Part of a tale  
Were all on this journey  
No ones to stay  
Where is it going  
What is the way  
  
Were part of a story  
Part of a tale  
Sometimes beautiful  
Sometimes insane  
No one remembers how it began  
  
Were part of a story  
Part of a tale  
Were all on this journey  
No ones to stay  
Where is it going  
What is the way  
  
Were part of a story  
Part of a tale  
Sometimes beautiful  
Sometimes insane  
No one remembers how it began
