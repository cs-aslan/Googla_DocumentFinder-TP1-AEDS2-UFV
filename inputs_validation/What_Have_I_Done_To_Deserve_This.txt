You always wanted a lover I only wanted a job  
Ive always worked for a living  
How am I gonna get through  
How am I gonna get through  
  
Now youve left me with nothing  
Cant take it  
How am I gonna get through  
How am I gonna get through  
  
I brought you drinks I brought you flowers  
I read your books and talked for hours evry day  
So many drinks such pretty flowrs so tell me  
What have I what have I what have I done to deserve this  
What have I what have I what have I done to deserve this  
  
What have I what have I what have I  
Since you went away  
Ive been hanging around  
Ive been wondering why  
Im feeling down  
You went away  
It should make me feel better  
But I dont know

You always wanted a lover I only wanted a job  
Now I can do what I want to forever  
How am I gonna get through  
How am I gonna get through  
  
At night the people come and go they talk to fast and walk to slow  
Chasing time from hour to hour I pour the drinks and crush the flowers  
What have I what have I what have I done to deserve this  
What have I what have I what have I done to deserve this  
  
What have I what have I what have I done to deserve this  
How Im gonna get through how Im gonna get through
