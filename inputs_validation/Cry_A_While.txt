Well I had to go down and see a guy named Mr Goldsmith  
A nasty dirty doublecrossin backstabbin phony I didnt want to have to
be dealin with  
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile  
Well I cried for you  now its your turn to cry awhile  
  
I dont carry dead weight  Im no flash in the pan  
All right Ill set you straight cant you see Im a union man  
Im lettin the cat out of the cage Im keeping a low profile  
Well I cried for you  now its your turn you can cry awhile  
  
Feel like a fighting rooster  feel better than I ever felt  
But the Pennsylvania lines in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to
melt  
I went to the church house every day I go an extra mile  
Well I cried for you  now its your turn you can cry awhile  
  
Last night cross the alley there was a pounding on the walls  
It must have been Don Pasquale makin a two am booty call  
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style  
Well I cried for you  now its your turn to cry awhile  
  
Im on the fringes of the night fighting back tears that I cant control  
Some people they aint human they got no heart or soul  
Well Im crying to The Lord  Im tryin to be meek and mild  
Yes I cried for you  now its your turn you can cry awhile  
  
Well theres preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs  
Im longin for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs  
Im gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey  Ill die before I turn senile  
Well I cried for you  now its your turn you can cry awhile  
  
Well you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way  
I always said youd be sorry and today could be the day  
I might need a good lawyer could be your funeral my trial  
Well I cried for you now its your turn you can cry awhile
