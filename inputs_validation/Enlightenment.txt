Chop that wood  
Carry water  
Whats the sound of one hand clapping  
Enlightenment dont know what it is  
  
Every second every minute  
It keeps changing to something different  
Enlightenment dont know what it is  
Enlightenment dont know what it is  
It says its non attachment  
Non attachment Non attachment  
  
Im in the here and now and Im meditating  
And still Im suffering but thats my problem  
Enlightenment dont know what it is  
  
Wake up  
  
Enlightenment says the world is nothing  
Nothing but a dream everythings an illusion  
And nothing is real  
  
Good or bad baby  
You can change it anyway you want  
You can rearrange it  
Enlightenment dont know what it is  
Chop that wood and carry water  
Whats the sound of one hand clapping  
Enlightenment dont you know what it is  
  
All around baby you can see  
Youre making your own reality everyday because  
Enlightenment dont know what it is  
  
One more time  
  
Enlightenment Dont you know what it is  
Its up to you  
Enlightenment Dont know what it is  
Its up to you everyday  
Enlightenment dont know what it is  
Its always up to you  
Enlightenment dont know what it is  
Its up to you the way you think
