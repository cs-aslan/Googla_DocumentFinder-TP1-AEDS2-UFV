Fire the sun is well asleep  
Moon is high above  
Fire grows from the east  
How is this  
Hate so deep  
Lead us all so blindly killing killing  
Fools we are  
If hates the gate to peace  
This is the last stop  
For raining tears  
War  
The only way to peace  
I dont fall for that  
Raining tears  
Youre righteous so righteous  
Youre always so right  
Go ahead and dream  
Go ahead believe that you are the chosen one  
Raining tears  
Oh no  
Gracious even God  
Bloodied the cross  
Your sins are washed enough  
Mothers cry  
Is hate so deep  
Must a babys bones  
This hungry fire feed  
As smoke clouds roll in  
The symphony of death  
This is the last stop  
Scream  
Right is wrong now  
Shut up you big lie  
This black and white lie  
You comb your hair to hide  
Your lying eyes  
Youre righteous so righteous  
Youre always so right  
But why your lie  
Go ahead and dream  
Go ahead believe that you are the chosen one  
This is the last stop  
Here theres more than is showing up  
Hope that we can break it down  
Its not so black and white  
Youre righteous  
Youre righteous  
Youre righteous  
Youre always so right  
There you are nailing a good tree  
Then say forgive me forgive me  
Why  
Raining tears  
This is the last stop  
Here there is more than is showing up  
Hope that we can break it down  
Its not so black and white
