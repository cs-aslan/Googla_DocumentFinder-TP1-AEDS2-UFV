I have a private hell  
Of excellent quality  
Ive dwelt there for years  
Playing with my fears  
  
Its tastefull luxurious  
And full of sexuality  
And though they are tears  
I control them with my gears  
  
Well all in all  
I must tell you  
Well I must tell you  
Im so proud of my private hell  
  
Anger and greed brew  
And then they stamped  
Till I can transmute  
Them into more loot  
  
Its tasteful luxurious  
And full of sexuality  
And though they are tears  
I control them with my gears  
  
Well all in all  
I must tell you  
Well I must tell you  
Im so proud of my private hell  
  
Well all in all  
I must tell you  
Well I must tell you  
Im so proud of my private hell
