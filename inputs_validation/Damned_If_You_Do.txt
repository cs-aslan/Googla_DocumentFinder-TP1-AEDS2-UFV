Im gonna sign my name to full confession  
It seems the woman I loved last night  
Belongs to another man  
  
Theyd like to take you home  
Theyd like to purr and tease you  
But Im a passionate man  
And I couldnt leave her alone  
  
Cause you are damned if you do  
Damned if you dont  
Damned if you will  
Damned if you wont  
  
Sometimes they look so good  
But dont you let em deceive you  
Cause then you find out that they got  
Some kind of a venomous mind  
  
And the thing thats worse  
Is that it all seems worth it  
Im still a passionate man  
And she wouldnt leave me alone  
  
If you think that being a stud is easy  
Well now dont ask me boys  
I wouldnt know Im a little slow  
  
And you are damned if you do  
And damned if you dont  
Youre damned if you will  
And you are damned if you wont  
  
If you think that being a stud is easy  
Well now dont ask me boys  
I wouldnt know Im a little slow  
  
Gonna sign my name to full confession  
It seems the woman I loved last night  
Belongs to another man

Theyd like to purr and tease you  
And Im a passionate man  
And I couldnt leave her alone  
  
Cause you are damned if you do  
Damned if you dont  
Damned if you will  
Damned if you wont  
  
Damned if you do  
Damned if you dont  
Damned if you will  
And damned if you wont ooh  
  
Ill be damned
