Im goin tell you about my buddy  
But Im not goin reveal his name  
Cause its his life to live and hes livin it  
Claim it to fame or a game of shame  
  
To each his own let nim live it  
But there are those who may not agree  
But I goin tell you about my buddy  
Evry thing like he told it to me  
  
A womans the most peculiar creature  
And so few has missed his hand  
And out of all the ones that hes been with  
You know not one wouldnt take him again  
  
Before you really know a sensuous woman  
You have to be with her when shes alone  
She could say no and then want you to leave her  
And call you right back home after youre gone  
  
You never can tell until after youve tried her  
And then you might still be way off the track  
Because its the red and the white and the yellow  
Has exactly whats packed in the black  
  
One was a coed from Pennsylvania  
One from Toronto who dug him the most  
One was a rich widow in Houston  
And one was a freak from the western coast  
  
One was a teacher out of Chicago  
And one had plans to become a nun  
And one was the last one I thought hed cling to  
But she was tahe one who gave him a son  
  
So people Ill tell you bout my buddy  
And like I say I just cant reveal his name  
Its his life and hes gonna live it  
Claim it to fame or game or shame  
  
Claim it fame or game or shame  
Just a game or fame or shame  
Fame or game or shame  
Fame or game or shame  
Fame or game or shame  
Claim it fame or game or shame
