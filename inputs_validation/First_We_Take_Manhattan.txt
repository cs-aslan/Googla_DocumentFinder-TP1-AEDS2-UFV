They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom  
For trying to change the system from within  
Im coming now Im coming to reward them  
First we take Manhattan then we take Berlin  
Im guided by a signal in the heavens  
Im guided by this birthmark on my skin  
Im guided by the beauty of our weapons  
First we take Manhattan then we take Berlin  
Id really like to live beside you baby  
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes  
But you see that line there moving through the station  
I told you I told you I told you I was one of those  
You loved me as a loser but now your worried that I just might win  
You know the way to stop me but you dont have the discipline  
How many nights I prayed for this to let my work begin  
  
Chorus  
First we take Manhattan then we take Berlin  
I dont like your fashion business mister  
I dont like these drugs that keep you thin  
I dont like what happened to your sister  
First we take Manhattan then we take Berlin  
  
And I thank you for those items that you sent me  
The monkey and the plywood violin  
I practiced every night and now Im ready  
First we take Manhattan then we take Berlin  
Remember me I used to live for music  
Remember me I brought your groceries in  
Its Fathers Day and everybodys wounded  
First we take Manhattan then we take Berlin
