Llooking for something  
  
Trying to be something good trying to be something  
Looking through the world with those big black eyes  
Where did you run to baby  
Where did you hide  
All around I see great big falling stars  
People outside the windows in great big jars  
 Close my eyes  
Those are my eyes you walk with  
That I cant see  
Being a king I guess its all fine and well  
Youre the star I guess its just as well  
Even when I have something to do with this world  
 Baby  
Havent found a place for you  
  
When you die you aint gonna have any place to go  
Your brand new sports car not one day run you down  
Did you ever face the facts
