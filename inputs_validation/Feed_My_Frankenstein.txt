Yes yes I know your hungry  
Ah and here comes dinner  
  
Feed my Frankenstein  
  
Well I aint evil  
Im just good lookin  
Start a little fire  
And baby start cookin  
Im a hungry man  
But I dont want pizza  
Ill blow down your house  
And then Im gonna eat ya  
Bring you to a simmer  
Right on time  
Run my greasy fingers  
Up your greasy spine  
  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Meet my libido  
Hes a psycho  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Hungry for love and its feeding time  
  
You dont want to talk  
So baby shut up  
And let me drink the wine from your fur tea cup  
Velcro candy sticky sweet  
Make my tattoos melt in the heat  
Well I aint no veggie  
Like my flesh on the bone  
Alive and lickin on your ice cream cone  
  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Meet my libido  
Hes a psycho  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Hungry for love and its feeding time  
Baby whoawhoa oh yeah  
Feed my Frankensteieiein  
Baby Chow Down  
Feed my Frankensteieiein  
  
Hes a psycho  
  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Meet my libido  
Hes a psycho  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Hungry for love and its lunch time  
Baby whoawhoa oh yeah  
Feed my Frankensteieiein  
Whoawhoa Baby Chow Down  
Feed my Frankensteieiein  
  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Meet my libido

Feed my Frankenstein  
Hungry for love and its feeding time  
Baby whoawhoa oh yeah
