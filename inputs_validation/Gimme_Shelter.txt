GIMME SHELTER  
WRITERS MICK JAGGER KEITH RICHARDS  
Oh a storm is threatening My very life today If I dont get some shelter Oh
yeah Im gonna fade away War children its just a shot away Its just a
shot away War children its just a shot away Its just a shot away Ooh see
the fire is sweeping Our very street today Burns like a red coal carpet Mad
bull lost its way War children its just a shot away Its just a shot away
War children its just a shot away Its just a shot away Rape murder Its
just a shot away 2x Rape murder Its just a shot away 2x Rape murder
Its just a shot away 2x The floods is threatening My very life today Give
give shelter Or Im gonna fade away War children its just a shot away Its
just a shot away 4x I tell you love sister its just a kiss away Its just
a kiss away 4x Kiss away kiss away
