Dear sweet filthy world my wife or whoever reads this  
I think that Ive lived too long  
With all of my promise unfulfilled  
But there is a veil drawn over all of that  
  
I know youll probably say spare us the melodrama  
I dont know how he chose the pills or the stupid revolver  
Im out of luck  
Im not that strong  
My hands your neck  
I might have wrung  
  
Dont try to find me  
Im not worth anything anymore  
I am not leaving you with all of your problems  
The biggest one is me  
  
Life is dark  
Cold as the sea  
Embrace me in my anguish  
Put seaweed in my hair and vow that you wont cry because  
Ive gone  
I cant go on I cant go on I cant go on  
I must close now
