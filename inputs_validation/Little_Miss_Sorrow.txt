She had those magic eyes you could see from miles around  
She wore her summer dresses bright  
Quite like the sky  
She always came in colors  
All smiles in daffodils  
She let her hair down in the breeze  
  
But every little thing has changed today little Miss Sorrow  
Every little thing turned pale and faded little Miss Sorrow  
The sunlight doesnt show  
Although the colors go  
Out through the window  
  
She used to go out dancing  
Cool silver fingernails  
I used to watch her from the bar  
Following her car  
She always came in colors  
She always kept control  
She painted yesterday in gold  
  
But every little thing turned grey today little Miss Sorrow  
Every little thing turned pale and faded little Miss Sorrow  
The sunlight doesnt show  
All the colors go  
Even the rainbow  
  
Allow me to introduce myself  
Im just a local boy  
She was my little Miss Joy  
I want to call her name  
My life wont be the same  
Dear God  
  
Every little thing has changed today little Miss Sorrow  
Every little thing turned pale and faded little Miss Sorrow  
Yes every little thing turned grey today little Miss Sorrow  
The weakling plays the strong  
The bird forgot the song  
Whats going on  
Whats going on  
Tell me whats going on  
Whats going on  
Whats going on  
Tell me whats going on
