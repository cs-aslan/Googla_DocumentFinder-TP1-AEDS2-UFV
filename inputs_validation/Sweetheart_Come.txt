Come over here babe  
It aint that bad  
I dont claim to understand  
The troubles that youve had  
But the dogs you say they fed you to  
Lay their muzzles in your lap  
And the lions that they led you to  
Lie down and take a nap  
The ones you fear are wind and air  
And I love you without measure  
It seems we can be happy now  
Be it better late than never  
  
Sweetheart come  
Sweetheart come  
Sweetheart come  
Sweetheart come to me  
  
The burdens that you carry now  
Are not of your creation  
So lets not weep for their evil deeds  
But for their lack of imagination  
Todays the time for courage babe  
Tomorrow can be for forgiving  
And if he touches you again with his stupid hands  
His life wont be worth living  
  
Sweetheart come  
Sweetheart come  
Sweetheart come  
Sweetheart come to me  
  
Walk with me now under the stars  
For its a clear and easy pleasure  
And be happy in my company  
For I love you without measure  
Walk with me now under the stars  
Its a safe and easy pleasure  
It seems we can be happy now  
Its late but it aint never  
Its late but it aint never  
Its late but it aint never
