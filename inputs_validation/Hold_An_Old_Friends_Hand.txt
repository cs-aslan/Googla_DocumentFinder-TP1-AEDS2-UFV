Another year and Im still here  
The grass just will not grow on this old hill  
Still I just cant let it go  
I dont believe its cause Im cold  
Or partial to the crazy life Im caught in  
Sometimes I fell the hand of time  
Moving like its body was broke  
And its then I miss your sighs  
And the tender words you spoke  
  
Hey thats okay  come on around and get yourself together  
Wont you come on around and hold an old friends hand  
Babe I promise not to throw you  
You dont have to stay I just want to hold you  
Wont you come on around  
And hold an old friends hand  
  
Another year is dead and gone  
The sun dont want to shine on this old hill  
Or anything thats mine  
I dont believe it hurts to grow  
Even when the crop you sow is a failure  
Sometimes I wish I had no pride  
Id go off and sell my soul  
But how do you say goodbye  
To the only truth youve known  
  
Hey thats okay  come on around and get yourself together  
Wont you come on around and hold an old friends hand  
Baby baby I promise not to throw you  
You dont have to stay I just want to hold you  
Wont you come on around  
And hold an old friends hand  
  
Oh babe honey everybody makes mistakes  
We feel a lot of life that way  
Dont you think by now I know that  
Look whats brought us both back  
Now  while the leaves still dance on the wind  
While the moon and the clouds come spinning  
Will you whisper my name again  
Again and again and again  
  
Hey thats okay  come on around and get yourself together  
Wont you come on around and hold an old friends hand  
Around and around with you Ive been  
Flat on the ground and up again  
Nobody know for sure just when  
Everything changes
