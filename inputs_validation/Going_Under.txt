Sun is rising on the water  
Light is dancing again  
Lets go under where the sun beams  
Lets go under my friend  
  
Are we sleeping  
Are we dreaming  
Are we dancing again  
Is it heaven  
Crack it open  
And well slide down  
Its stream  
  
We can hold on Im sure  
To the seas foaming mane  
It will serve us  
Well surface  
And well plunge back again  
  
Sun is rising on the water  
Light is dancing like a flame  
Theres no burning where the sun beams  
Oh its such a lovely game  
  
Does the sea dream Im sure  
We are here we attend  
We are bells on the shore  
Where the tolling suspends  
  
Who will decide the shape of things  
The shift of being  
Who will perceive  
When life is new  
Shall we divide and become another  
Who is due for gift upon gift  
Who will decide  
Shall we swim over and over  
The curve of a wing  
Its destination ever changing  
  
Sun is rising on the water  
Light is dancing like a flame  
Lets go waltzing on the water  
Lets go under again  
  
Lets go under  
Going under
