Verse 1  
Magpies on fire  
Making love like little whirls on out the porch can lead to medicine  
Oh well Im game for anything at all  
Scarecrows are liars  
Spins the yarn and no one ever checks it out to see if it was real  
Sold you the moon and now its time to fall  
All along its like a bird who trapped alone inside a cage love  
  
Hook  
What more do you want  
How much more can you take  
I love my mistakes  
Ive been here before  
  
Bridge  
All in all its just the call of something wild beyond your room  
Theres a changing of the major chord  
Your minor thread will do love  
  
Verse 2  
My gun misfired shot myself instead  
I guess I always knew Id be the one to lose  
Light screen door slams time to make a move  
  
Hook  
  
Bridge  
All along its like a bird who trapped alone inside a cage love  
A bird whos born to live at half your age girl  
A bird who never really had a say  
  
Hook  
All along its like a bird whos now been freed from someones cage
