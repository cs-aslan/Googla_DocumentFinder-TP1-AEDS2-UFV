Here I am  
Alone and I dont understand  
Exactly how it all began  
The dream just walked away  
  
Im holding on  
When all but the passions gone  
  
And from the start  
Maybe I was tryin too hard  
Its crazy coz its breakin my heart  
Things can fall apart but I know  
That I dont want you to go  
  
And heroes die  
When they ignore the cause inside  
But they learn from whats left behind  
And fight for something else  
  
And so it goes  
That we have both learned how to grow  
  
And from the start  
Maybe we were tryin too hard  
Its crazy coz its breakin our heart  
Things can fall apart but I know  
That I dont want you to go  
  
Bridge  
Oh its just too much  
Takin all the whole world all by myself  
But its not enough  
Unless I stop trusting somebody else  
Somebody else  
And love again  
  
Instrumental Interlude  
  
And from the start  
Maybe we were tryin too hard  
Its crazy coz its breakin our hearts  
Things can fall apart but I know  
That I dont want you to go no  
Maybe we were tryin to hard  
Its crazy coz its breakin our hearts  
Things can fall apart but I know  
That I dont want you to go  
Oh no dont want you to go
