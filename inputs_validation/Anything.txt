Please just tell me what the hell is wrong  
Do you wanna eat

Just settle down settle down settle down

That love and happiness were the same  
Now Im older and I dont play  
And I found out the hardest way

He got crazy and I did too  
Wondring what I did to you

Give you pills

Hundred dollar bills  
  
And Ill even let you watch the shows you wanna see  
Ill do anything anything anything  
Anything anything anything anything anything
