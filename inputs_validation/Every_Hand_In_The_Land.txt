Words and Music Arlo Guthrie  
Every hand in the land  
Shakes along with me  
It dont seem that I can dream  
Like I used to dream  
Maybe that somebody is shaking me  
If I fell I could tell  
It may be that somebody is making me  
Dream that youre forever  
Gone away from me  
Every toe that I know  
Step away with me  
I cant seem to get where  
I want to be  
Maybe its my own foot  
That keeps tripping me  
Trip trap  flip flap  
It must come to wherever from it comes  
Through to me  
I cant walk to where  
My own dreams talk to me  
Every face in this place  
Take your eyes away  
Blink if you think that  
Theres another way  
Maybe its my own eyes  
That dont see the way  
The time is blind  
It may come to pass  
That I will lose my mind  
I cant live without the love I left behind  
I cant live without the love I left behind
