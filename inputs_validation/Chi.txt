Pain  
Buried so fly away  
Enter my life of nothing  
Sick of the same old thing so I dig a hole buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing so I dig a hole buried pain  
Hanging so high always  
Burying my life so slowly  
  
Sick of the same old thing so I dig a hole buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing so I dig a hole buried pain  
It opens my mind to feelings  
I cant face boredom without something  
  
Sick of the same old thing so I dig a hole buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing so I dig a hole buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing so I dig a hole buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing so I dig a hole buried pain  
  
Me entering my head  
Feeling like Im God  
With the world around me  
Cant you feel this pain  
Reaming through my heart  
Screaming through my veins  
Nothing I can kill  
Screaming a Lie Lie Lie  
Cant you feel this My Eyes Out  
Cant you take my heart away  
Take my heart Goodbye  
Sick of the same old thing so I dig a hole buried pain  
Pain Pain Pain Pain Pain
