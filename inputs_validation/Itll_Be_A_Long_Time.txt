All this time has whittled away  
Like so many days in one  
Back and forth the leaders sway  
Backing it up with guns  
  
Superpowers flex their wings  
Hold the world on puppet strings  
Egos will feed  
While citizens bleed  
  
Thats always the way it goes  
When will the world listen to reason  
Ive got a feeling itll be a long time  
When will the truth come in to season  
  
Ive got a feeling itll be a long time  
All they want is what they can defend  
Before their time is up  
Make the same mistakes again  
  
Heard it all before  
Superpowers flex their wings  
Hold the world on puppet strings  
Egos will feed  
  
While citizens bleed  
Thats always the way it goes  
Well if they tried  
Maybe theyd see  
  
Itd do a little good to let the world be free  
Handshake and a smile  
Gets you on through  
Then turn it all around with a suicide move  
  
But you know its not fooling anyone but me  
You gotta make yourself see what you want to see  
  
Chorus
