When I waken and Im achin time for sleepin yeah  
When Im sayin time to go and Ive been hurtin yeah  
When Im layin Im still tryin concentrating on dyin yeah  
Youre right as rain but youre all to blame  
Agreed my crimes the same  
My sins Ill claim give you back shed pain  
Go find a place for own shame  
So you can deal with this thing unreal  
No one made you feel any hurt yeah  
Bodys movin only provin no one needs to move  
Still believin yet mistaken all Gods children yeah  
And I must say I was stupid selfishly she consumed yeah  
And you must change patterns all we trained  
Or ner regain peace you seek

Yeah I believe in inner peace yeah  
Throw out blow up hold in  
Show fine no signs grow blind
