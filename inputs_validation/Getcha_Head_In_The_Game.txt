Coach said to fake right and Break left  
Watch out for the pick  
And keep your eye on defense  
You gotta run the give and go  
And take the ball to the hole  
But dont be afraid  
To shoot the outside J  
  
Just keep yah head in the game  
Just keep yah head in the game  
And Dont be afraid to shoot the outside J  
Just keep yah head in the game

We gotta get our get our get our get our head in the game x4

Cause when we get it the crowd will go wild
