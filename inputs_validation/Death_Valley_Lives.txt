Its the ways of her father  
If shes gonna change she hasnt done it yet  
And the desert is calling to me  
Run before the final trap is set  
All roads lead to the city  
Where the dudes and the dykes all look the same  
Lady lays out the pattern  
With the parts of her body that seem tame  
Death valley lives and tracy isnt sure what really gives  
Act like a child and Ill respond with my wellrehearsed farewell  
Quoting the verse that you bought but werent quite prepared to sell  
Saying I think I love you  
Maybe I care  
Its not fair  
Death valley lives and tracy isnt sure what really gives  
And its a sore spot when the rooms burning hot  
And the desert air just cannot bring you down  
Still the beds warm but a cold arm  
Keeps me floating inches off the ground  
Death valley lives and tracy isnt sure what really gives  
Go paint your toes wipe you nose and then come to say goodbye  
And all along tell yourself I am wrong if I try  
Crying sorry its over  
Im not to blame  
What a game  
Death valley lives now Im not even sure what really gives  
Ho ha
