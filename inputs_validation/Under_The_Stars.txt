Well find a love to hold our hand through the cold  
Well find an angel lying out in the snow  
Well see a light to lead us all the way home and  
Wherever we go we will know

All the lost and lonely  
All the lovers holding on  
All of us no matter what weve done  
We are not alone although were far apart  
We are one under the stars

Here we are under the stars

Heaven is not so far  
Heaven is not so far
