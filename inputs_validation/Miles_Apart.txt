If I could I would do all of this again  
Travel back in time with you to where this all began  
We could hide inside ourselves and leave the world behind  
Make believe theres something left to find  
  
Chorus  
Well be miles apart  
Ill keep you deep inside youre always in my heart  
A new life to start  
I may be leaving but youre always in my heart  
  
Now weve all grown up gone on and moved away  
Nothing I can do about it nothing I can say  
To bring us back to where we were when life was not this hard  
Looking back it all just seemed so far so far away  
  
Chorus  
  
Id give it up for just one more day with you  
Give it up for just one more day  
Id give it up for just one more day with you  
Id give it up for just one more day with you  
  
Id give it up for just one more day with you  
Give it up give it all away  
Id give it up for just one more day with you  
  
Chorus  
  
I need you now were miles apart  
Ill keep you deep inside youre always in my heart  
I need you now were miles apart  
I may be leaving but youre always in my heart
