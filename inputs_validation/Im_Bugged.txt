Im bugged you all look like insects  
In your brand new sunspecs  
Im bugged Im bugged  
I drop a little note through my sympathetics door  
I think Im going ga ga I just cant take anymore  
At first I see em swarming from a dark and midnight nest  
And when I see em fiddling well I think youve guessed the rest  
  
Im bugged you all look like insects  
In your brand new sunspecs  
Im bugged Im bugged  
I wake up in a cold sweat and I run into the street  
And just like in my nightmare they are jiggling at my feet  
I take a dead mans lighter and I burn them to the floor  
But where there was a dozen there are now a hundred more  
Im bugged
