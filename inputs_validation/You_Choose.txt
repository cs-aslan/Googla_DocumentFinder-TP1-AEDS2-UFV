Hes gone  
Youve lost  
Stay behind  
And count the cost  
You try  
You lose  
You dont fall in love by chance  
You choose  
  
Its a decision  
Made over time  
Should you take a risk  
And start to climb  
The steepest hill  
Only to find  
Halfway there  
Youve been left behind  
  
Choosing to love  
Is risking a lot  
And trying to change  
And to give all youve got  
But dont pretend  
It comes out of the blue  
You take a chance  
And see it through  
And if its refused  
What can you do  
Continue hopefully  
Start anew  
  
Lick your wounds  
Buy your booze  
You wont get drunk by accident  
Youll choose  
Dont blame him  
For refusing your bid  
He didnt decide to love  
You did  
  
Learn the lesson  
Take the blows  
You didnt fall in love by chance  
You chose  
Play the sad songs  
Sing the blues  
You dont fall in love by chance  
You choose
