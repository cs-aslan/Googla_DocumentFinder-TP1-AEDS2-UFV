Steve Perry  
  
You shouldve been gone  
Knowing how I made you feel  
And I shouldve been gone  
After all your words of steel  
Oh I mustve been a dreamer  
And I mustve been someone else  
And we shouldve been over  
  
Oh Sherry our love  
Holds on holds on  
Oh Sherry our love  
Holds on holds on  
  
But I want to let go  
Youll go on hurtin me  
Youd be better off alone  
If Im not who you thought Id be  
  
But you know that theres a fever  
Oh that youll never find nowhere else  
Cant you feel it burnin on and on  
  
Chorus  
  
But I shouldve been gone  
Long ago far away  
And you shouldve been gone  
Now I know just why you stay  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh Sherry our love  
Holds on holds on
