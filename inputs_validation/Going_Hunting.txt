Well me an my buddies we got us some beer  
And a great big bottle of rye  
And boxes of ammo and guns to go with em  
And good old Charlies glass eye  
Well we looked all around so we sees all of nature  
So calm and so serene  
But not for long cause were gonna use guns  
To make furry animals scream  
  
Cause were goin huntin  
Were gonna kill somethin  
I dont care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon maybe a gopher  
Maybe the neighbours kids  
Were goin huntin  
Were gonna kill somethin  
I dont care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon maybe a gopher  
Maybe the neighbours kids  
  
Well off we go our guns are loaded  
And sos are we  
We weaves through the bushes and falls on our faces  
And piss on the nice trees  
And then we spot something moving an a rustle  
We pump it full of lead  
And smile real wide as we hear it scream  
And thud as it falls down dead  
  
Cause were goin huntin  
Were gonna kill somethin  
I dont care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon maybe a gopher  
Maybe the neighbours kids  
Were goin huntin  
Were gonna kill somethin  
I dont care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon maybe a gopher  
Maybe the neighbours kids  
  
Well off we go to see what we killed  
And watch the damn thing bleed  
The first thing we see is a bright orange cap  
And we shot down Ol Charlie  
But he dont to mind he smiled all the time  
He died real happy  
But next time he should tell us  
When hes goin off to take a pee  
  
Cause were goin huntin  
Were gonna kill somethin  
I dont care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon maybe a gopher  
Maybe the neighbours kids  
Were goin huntin  
Were gonna kill somethin  
I dont care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon maybe a gopher  
Maybe the neighbours kids  
  
Well the sun goes down and we head back to town  
And we hop in our pickup truck  
Strap Charlie to the hood start up the engine  
Drive it home with any luck  
Well what do you know we run into a pole  
But were all still in one piece  
And we get a free ride back into town  
Courtesy of the police  
  
Cause were goin huntin  
Were gonna kill somethin  
I dont care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon maybe a gopher  
Maybe the neighbours kids  
Were goin huntin  
Were gonna kill somethin  
I dont care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon maybe a gopher  
Maybe the neighbours kids
