Things are getting just too cozy for me  
And I see people as they see me  
Gonna break away and gain control  
You free your mind  
You free your soul  
I was the type who knocked at old men  
historys easy  
Who together at tables sit and drink beer  
somewhere is really  
Then I saw that I was really the same  
So this links breaking away from the chain  
  
Away from the numbers  
Away from the numbers  
Is where Im gonna be  
Away from the numbers  
Away from the numbers  
Is where I am free  
  
I was sick and tired of my little niche  
Well gonna break away and find where life is  
  
And all those fools I thought were my friends  
coaching is easy  
They now stare at me and dont see a thing  
realitys so hard  
Till their life is over and they start to moan  
How they never had the chance to make good  
  
Away from the numbers  
Away from the numbers  
Is where Im gonna be  
Away from the numbers  
away from the numbers  
Away from the numbers  
Is where I am free  
Is where I am free  
Is where Im gonna be  
Is reality  
  
Realitys so hard realitys so hard
