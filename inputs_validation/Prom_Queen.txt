Wont you be my prom queen  
Everybody has a real good time  
Wont you be my prom queen must take for my senior prom  
Wont you be my prom queen  
Everybody has a real good time  
Another morning I must get up and go to school  
Im taking too long gettin dressed tryin to look my best  
Because today is not your ordinary every morning  
My high school prom is coming and I heave my daddys warnings  
Im going to find myself a girl to take to the prom  
I shouldnt have too much trouble because Im  
Im very nice my mother says Im very handsome  
When I wear my good vest and mother knows best  
I got to school I straggle through the hallways  
I stop and gaze at all the girls just like always  
But this time I must now approach them or  
Or my daddy might get mad and break my wrist again ow  
And so I chose her her hair it matches with her face  
She is so lovely my heart pulse begin to race  
I make my way between her friends and to her presence  
Hello Christine would you be my prom queen  
Id rather die Id rather die Id rather die repeat over  
would you be my prom queen no aaah prom queen  
There was a time when I could except a no  
That was before Christine is gonna have to go  
My parents will be proud of me when I bring her home  
So now I sit and watch her practice in the gym dome  
Christine is famous she has so many different friends  
Will they miss her when shes dead or will they just pretend  
Nobody talks to me I only talk to I  
And I been telling myself all day shes gotta die  
Good morning everybody This is Principal Rogers and I would just  
like to congradulate our Senior class and wish them at tonights  
Prom dance  
Wont you be my prom queen I can be your prom baby  
Wont you be my prom queen  
Everybody has a real good time  
It was really fuckin easy Im a human hater  
I took a towel from the locker room to suffocate her  
I had to throw away her gym bag and all her folders  
And when it got dark I caried her home on my shoulders  
My daddy was asleep when I snuck her in the back  
I thought about my situation and its kind of whack  
It sounds cheap but were having prom in my cellar  
But shes dead I guess Ill never have to tell her  
I took the bottles of Tamiace four dollars worth  
I took the seventeen dollars that was in her purse  
I bought balloons and streaming and stuff to munch  
I had a dollar left I bought a Faygo Punch  
I hung the streamers and balloons on my basement wall  
I banged my head a couple times Im just too fuckin tall  
I would have took her to the school like a normal man  
But I had to kill her first theyd never understand  
I put a record on and then I picked her up to dance  
I bet she cannot feel the woody growing in my pants  
I know my daddy would be proud of all that Ive done  
Instead of burning me hed probably come and hug his son  
I think about it as I dance slowly to the beat  
The more I think about it tears are rolling down my cheek  
I hope I showed Christine a night like no other  
After all thats how my daddy did my mother  
Our Seniors deserve a night to celebrate with friends celebrate  
all their great work Prom night is your very own special night  
and everybody always remember their high school prom  
Wont you be my prom queen I can be your prom baby  
Wont you be my prom queen  
Everybody has a real good time
