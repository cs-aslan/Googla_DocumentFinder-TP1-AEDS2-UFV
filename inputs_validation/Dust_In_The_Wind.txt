I close my eyes  
Only for a moment and the moments gone  
All my dreams  
Pass before my eyes a curiosity  
Dust in the wind  
All they are is dust in the wind  
Same old song  
Just a drop of water in an endless sea  
All we do  
Crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see  
Dust in the wind  
  
All we are is dust in the wind  
dont hang on  
Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky  
It slips away  
And all your money wont another minute buy  
Dust in the wind  
All we are is dust in the wind  
all we are is dust in the wind  
Dust in the wind  
Everything is dust in the wind  
everything is dust in the wind
