Ive been told in the name of something  
Ive got to know what it means to play the game  
  
Too many faces around theyre talking  
They play their parts oh so well but whos to blame  
  
Back on the streets thats where we are  
Building a fortress of power yeah Were coming  
  
You know better than me the rules are  
Getting better or fat in the mania  
  
Its good to know who is who in our game  
The speed is faster its harder to see where we are  
  
Back on the streets  
  
Please Mister Knowhow just bring me the news  
Im waiting so long for you telling me all you can tell  
  
Theres one thing about you youre dying to prove  
The master plan is yours and living with knowledge is hell  
  
Back on the streets
