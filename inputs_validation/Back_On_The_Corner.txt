Im back on th corner  
Im right back on th corner  
Ive been in this condition so many times before  
  
Back by my lonesome  
Im right back by my lonesome  
Just watching th people going from door to door  
  
Ive got to change my ways  
And try to quit this place  
Cause one of these rainy days  
Im gonna need a friendly face  
  
Im back on th corner  
Im right back on th corner  
Ive been in this condition so many times before  
  
Ive got to change my ways  
And try to quit this place  
Cause one of these rainy days  
Im gonna be a mental case
