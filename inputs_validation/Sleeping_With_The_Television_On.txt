Ive been watching you waltz all night Diane  
Nobodys found a way behind your defenses  
They never notice the zap gun in your hand  
Until youre pointing it and stunning their senses  
  
All night long all night long  
Youll shoot em down because youre waiting for somebody good to come on  
All night long all night long  
But youre sleeping with the television on  
  
You say youre looking for someone solid here  
You cant be bothered with those just for the night boys  
Tonight unless you take some kind of chances dear  
Tomorrow morning youll wake up with a white noise  
  
All night long all night long  
Youre only standing there cause somebody once did somebody wrong  
All night long all night long  
But youll be sleeping with the television on  
  
Youre eyes are saying talk to me talk to me  
But your attitude is dont waste my time  
Your eyes are saying talk to me talk to me  
But you wont hear a word cause it just might be the same old line  
  
This isnt really easy for me to say Diane  
I know you dont need anybodys protection  
I really wish I was less of a thinking man  
And more a fool whos not afraid of rejection  
  
All night long all night long  
Ill just be standing here cause I know I dont have the guts to come on  
All night long all night long  
And Ill be sleeping with the television on  
  
Youre eyes are saying talk to me talk to me  
But my attitude is boy dont waste my time  
Your eyes are saying talk to me talk to me  
But I wont say a word cause it just might be somebody elses same old line  
  
All night long all night long  
Were only standing here cause somebody might do somebody wrong  
All night long all night long  
And well be sleeping with the television on  
Sleeping with the television on  
Sleeping with the television on
