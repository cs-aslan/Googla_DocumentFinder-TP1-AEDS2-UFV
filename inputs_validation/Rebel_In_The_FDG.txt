I live my life like a shot in the wind  
If tomorrow dont come I know  
I stole my share of fun for me  
Cause Im too fast too rad  
Im going wasted when I go  
The cost of freedoms never free  
Its the deep six its my fix  
Its my best friend cause its my way or the highway  
Ill tell you its the living end  
  
Im a rebel in the FDG  
And I say only God in heaven knows  
Im a bad child come and love me  
And I say oh yeah  
  
If youre fast you might last  
Slow you gotta go  
A wild one in the decadent zoo  
Ooh I lick up all my seven deadly sins  
Cause Im too hot too cool  
Oh Ive been playing in the fire of fools  
I might burn but Ill burn in the wind  
Its the deep six its my fix  
Its the big jam cause its my way or the highway  
Ill tell you what I am  
  
Oh I I feel the heat and I I touch the flesh and bone  
And I feel the kiss of fire  
Too fast to live too fast to die  
Mom and daddy say Im dancing in the fire  
  
Sometimes I feel like an animal in a cage  
I pace back and forth and look around  
For something to sink my teeth into  
But nobody knows whats going on inside me
