If youd never said anything  
If youd never said anything  
If you never If you never  
If you never If youd never said anything  
  
If you never if you never  
Ohhhh  
If you never if you never  
Ohhhh  
If you never if you never  
Ohhhh  
If you never if you never  
  
Here it is in my hands  
In my veins and overlands  
It spreads like fire seeking air  
To pull me in my own funfair  
Wont you come wont you come  
Wont you come just dont say a word  
Wont you come wont you come  
Wont you come just dont say a word  
  
If you never if you never  
Just hold sway away  
If you never if you never  
Just hold sway away  
  
Im more alive Ive ever been  
So now I give you all my sins  
Ive chosen you Ive chosen you  
But dont say a word  
  
And if I save us and I fall down  
I will leave your words behind now  
If you never held me under if you never hear my thunder  
  
If you never if you never  
Oh  
If you never if you never  
Oh  
If you never if you never  
Just dont say a word
