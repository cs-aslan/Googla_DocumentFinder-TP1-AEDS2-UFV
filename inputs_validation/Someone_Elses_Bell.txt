We talk about each other  
On our wrap around couch  
And live out all the romance  
In our little town house  
I never fit the shower  
And she never sews the threads  
And so we find our feelings  
In other peoples beds  
And if the grass seems greener  
But it turns out to be blue  
The garden of Eden isnt quite the place for you  
Dont be surprised if Im gone under the spell  
Of some other witches wand  
Ringing someone elses bell  
  
Meeting on the motorway  
Your lover boy blue  
Steaming up the windows  
With your last breath of youth  
Dont you think I see it  
Your handbags full of notes  
Im feeling like the punch line  
In someones private joke  
  
Our eyes dont seem to contact  
Never much to say  
Except perhaps excuse me  
Or pass me the ashtray  
I see him waiting for you  
As you go off to work  
Im left to draw conclusions  
While I button up my shirt
