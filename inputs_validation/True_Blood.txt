Red was the color of her eyes  
And she put me in a meditation state  
Her skin was white so white  
Looked like it had no expiration date  
Black is the color of the night  
And its time for feeding and her body waits  
Theres just something bout the demon that she brings out of me  
When we raise hell I cant stay away  
  
Aw give it to me now  
So evil in your dress  
It circulates you start to feel it  
Devil in the flesh  
Once you start to invoke her spirit  
Got you on the floor  
She comes alive when your appearing  
Hungry for some more  
  
I think shes got that true blood  
Every time youre round I can smell it in you  
Shes got that true blood  
I come around and raise the hell out of you  
Its that demon its so mean thats got me screaming  
Make me wanna build a coffin for two  
Shes got that true blood  
But baby I just do it for the thrill out of you  
It makes me say  
  
Now I feel my fever on the rise  
In my bones and my body starts to quake  
Straight up from my toes to my mind  
She controls me but I dont want to escape  
All the other ones that have tried  
Find out that they have made their final mistake  
But when she got a bite of my type  
She told me that she found her perfect blood mate  
  
So evil in your dress  
It circulates you start to feel it  
Devil in the flesh  
Once you start to invoke her spirit  
Got you on the floor  
She comes alive when your appearing  
Hungry for some more  
  
I think shes got that true blood  
Every time youre round I can smell it in you  
Shes got that true blood  
I come around and raise the hell out of you  
Its that demon its so mean thats got me screaming  
Make me wanna build a coffin for two  
Shes got that true blood  
But baby I just do it for the thrill out of you  
It makes me say  
  
Your pheromones invaded my instinct  
I start to seem like an animal  
Roast me in your perfection Im mad I dont wanna think  
Cause the others wanna burn with me but they dont hold a candle  
It feels like  
The others wanna burn with me but they dont hold a candle  
Ooh sometimes it feels like  
  
I think shes got that true blood  
Every time youre round I can smell it in you  
Shes got that true blood  
I come around and raise the hell out of you  
Its that demon its so mean thats got me screaming  
Make me wanna build a coffin for two  
Shes got that true blood  
But baby I just do it for the thrill out of you  
It makes me say  
Give it to me that goes to boogie that goes to high  
Give it to me  
  
Yeah  
Now that you got me  
Tell me what your gonna do with me  
I taste your blood  
I found out you was a perfect fit  
Mmm come on mama  
Show me what your working with  
Mmm come on mama  
Go on show me what your working with  
Show me what your working with  
  
Now that you got me

Cause I can taste your blood  
I found out you was a perfect fit  
Mmm come on mama
