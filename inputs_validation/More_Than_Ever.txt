If there are any words  
That we havent said  
Let us say them  
I know all too well  
How peoples lies  
Betray them  
  
More than ever  
Ill wait for you there  
More than ever  
I will need you to care  
And Ill never need  
More than a prayer  
To be near you  
To be near you  
  
Time is a baby child  
Found in the rain born of fever  
Shell bring you pretty songs  
Laced through with lies  
But dont you believe her  
  
More than ever  
Ill wait for you there  
More than ever  
I will need you to care  
And Ill never need  
More than a prayer  
To be near you  
To be near you  
To be near you
