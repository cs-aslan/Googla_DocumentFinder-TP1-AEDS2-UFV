Wow its your boy  
Lets go  
This is a tribute right here  
And its about to go down  
  
Do you remember twentyfirst night of September  
Before you go cold like December  
And all you saw a cloudy day  
  
And I remember that day when you surrender  
You start turning cause you remember  
The season it wont last away  
  
Ba de ya tell me you remember  
Ba de ya and your heart felt like September  
You still had the joy and God was just a prayer away  
  
Ba doo doop ba doop ba doo doop ba doop  
I can see clearly now  
Ba doo doop ba doop ba doo doop ba doop  
The sun is much brighter now  
Ba doo doop ba doop ba doo doop ba doop  
The season it wont last away  
  
Sing like forever  
You said when will my life get better  
Im tired of stormy weather  
But the sun always shines in day  
  
So just remember  
The next time you feel like December  
Remember the night in September  
When God wiped all your tears away  
  
Ba de ya tell me you remember  
Ba de ya and your heart felt like September  
You still had the joy and God was just a prayer away  
  
Ba de ya tell me you remember  
Ba de ya and your heart felt like September  
You still had the joy and God was just a prayer away  
  
Everybody has a September in their life  
You know that first time you heart Gods voice  
Oh you felt His Love  
  
So no matter what season youre in right now  
After winter comes spring  
So if you love my Jesus help me sing  
  
Ba de ya tell me you remember  
Ba de ya and your heart felt like September  
You still had the joy and God was just a prayer away  
  
Ba de ya tell me you remember  
Ba de ya and your heart felt like September  
You still had the joy and God was just a prayer away
