Chorus  
Last night it was Kush and Ciroc I was super geeked  
Cash flowing money flowing yeah thats a super week

Superfreak superfreak yeah you know I want a

What it do What it is What you working with  
Every time you see me on the grind stay on that working shit  
All I ever wanted a bad bitch and a Chanel bag  
All the street niggas want her cause they know she got Chanel swag  
Straight like that yea I fuck with her the long way  
Been bragging to my partners I been talking bout her all day  
Pull up in that Supercoupe you know them diamonds glistening  
Too much money in the room guess I hit her in the kitchen then  
Get her to myself man I aint hit that girl yet  
Now that I got her to myself man you know Im tryna get that girl wet  
Keep it one thousand with you I really think Im diggin her  
Cant hear nothing but the money so she might just think Im big enough  
  
Chorus  
  
Rick James super freak  
She got that wetwet now thats a super leak  
Tell your baby daddy that hes super weak  
Fucked your girl last night it only took a week  
Two Chains charm cost a hundred stacks  
Tenthousand with my shirt off thats a hundred carats  
OK Im done with that you can run with that Imma switch it up  
This bitch Im with is thick as fuck Im rich as fuck  
Laying in the bed and I still got my semi tucked  
Going online like when they gonna make that Bentley truck  
My bankroll make em pay attention  
The white girl like it when I whip it whip it  
  
Chorus  
  
She with me if Im wrong or Im right yea she my type  
Baby girl go and get the bread she know what I like  
Meet her at my lowkey apartment never at the house  
Every time we got pulled over never ran her mouth  
Fuck with real niggas get money baby off the chain  
Long as baby stay getting money how can I complain  
Favorite girl guess she got the skills just to pay the bills  
Last nigga she was fuckin with was worth a couple mil  
Even when she going for the low says shes not a ho  
Yeah you know that thing is superwet call it sloppy Joe  
Said she like it when I whip it fast then I whip it slow  
Even though she got a lot of names I just call her blow
