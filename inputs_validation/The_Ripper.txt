Time kills  
Go ask Jesus  
Im done  
Makes no difference  
Stare straight  
Stare at the sun  
Im done  
Makes no difference  
  
Time takes us all  
So why am I not just living for today  
Time takes us  
Time takes us all  
Will I die right now  
Im only seconds away  
Time takes us  
  
Move on  
Gone forever  
Im done  
Makes no difference  
Poison  
Time kills slowly  
Youre done  
Makes no difference  
  
Time takes us all  
So why am I not just living for today  
Time takes us  
Time takes us all  
Will I die right now  
It could be seconds away  
Time takes us  
  
Time will now be  
Time will now be  
Time will now be time will now be the chopping block  
Leave my head  
Time will now be the chopping block  
So leave my head  
Leave my head  
Leave my head  
  
Time kills  
Makes no difference  
Im done  
Makes no difference makes no difference  
  
Time takes us all  
So why am I not just living for today  
Time takes us  
Time takes us all  
Will I die right now  
It could be seconds away  
Time takes us  
  
Time takes us all
