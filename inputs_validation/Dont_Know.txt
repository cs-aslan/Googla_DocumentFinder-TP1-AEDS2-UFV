Just hold me a little softly its cold  
Hold me again  
cause thats when our love is ageless and time time is my friend  
  
So hold me closer closer closer baby thats what I need  
And you could lay your head on my dress  
And you could listen to my breathing its whispering  
  
I dont know exactly where it started I dont know  
I dont know exactly where it started I dont know  
I just want to love you  
  
Remember I once told you where not two of a kind  
Except I was chasing after something  
Love was the last thing on my mind  
  
And then you started you started started something inside of me yeah  
So come on lay your head on my dress  
And you could listen to my breathing its whispering  
I dont know exactly where it started I dont know  
I dont know exactly where it started I dont know  
I just want to love you
