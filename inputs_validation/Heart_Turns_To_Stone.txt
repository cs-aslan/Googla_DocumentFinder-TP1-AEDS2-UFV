The days and nights you sit around wondering where can she be  
Hoping that she might appear out of nowhere  
But you fail to see  
All the hurt inside the wounded pride  
Ooh what she went through for you  
You cheated and lied as her love slowly died  
And her heart just broke in two  
When she was with you all along  
Behind you right or wrong  
She tried to hold on hold on  
But you went too far and shes gone  
And now its over and her heart turns to stone  
No time for pity when her heart turns to stone  
She cries a little as her heart turns to stone  
Shes that kind of woman  
Shell do fine on her own  
What you thought was a game  
A game you were winning  
Wouldnt go your way  
Now youve lost what you had  
And your back to the beginning  
Its the price you have to pay  
When she was with you all along  
Behind you right or wrong  
She tried to hold on hold on  
But you went too far and shes gone  
And now its over and her heart turns to stone  
No time for pity when her heart turns to stone  
She cries a little as her heart turns to stone  
Shes that kind of woman  
Shell get by on her own  
She hides the pain  
But her heart turns to stone  
No time for pity  
When her heart turns to stone  
She cries sometimes  
As her heart turns to stone  
Shes that kind of woman  
Shell get by on her own  
Yeah its over  
And her heart turns to stone  
Dont look for pity now  
When her heart turns to stone  
Listen to her cry  
Listen to her cry  
Shes a woman now  
Ooh its a sad thing to see  
To see a heart turn to stone  
The heart of a woman  
A heart turned to stone
