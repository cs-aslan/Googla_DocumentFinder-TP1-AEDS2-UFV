Ive been scared to make a move  
So much left for me to prove  
I guess its time for me to show what Ive got  
Things will never be the same  
I may snuff the burning flame  
Or I may prove to be much more than I thought  
  
This is the dawning of a brave new world  
I dont know where Im going but I know Ill figure it out yeah  
This is the dawning of a brave new world  
No more hesitating its too late to turn back now yeah  
  
You can come along with me  
Or if thats not your destiny  
You can choose to go your way if you want  
I will send my best to you  
There are things I have to do  
I cant wait no more Ive got to move on  
  
This is the dawning of a brave new world  
I dont know where Im going but I know Ill figure it out yeah  
This is the dawning of a brave new world  
No more hesitating its too late to turn back now yeah  
  
It does not take this action  
To see a chain reaction  
Everyone blossoming in the sun  
  
Ooh Wed hate to leave our shelter  
But theres so much waiting out there  
If only wed open our eyes and see  
Woah woah woah woah  
  
This is the dawning of a brave new world  
I dont know where Im going but I know Ill figure it out yeah  
This is the dawning of a brave new world  
No more hesitating its too late to turn our backs now yeah
