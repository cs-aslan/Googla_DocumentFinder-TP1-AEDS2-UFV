Sister Im heading out of alabama  
So you better think fast  
The wind is gonna pick me up now  
And the rain wont slack  
Im heading down to georgia  
So dont lose track  
Of where youve been and where youre going now  
Who youve seen and what they lack  
And why you come undone  
Every time you go there  
You come undone  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
I know your hearts in danger  
And so is your life  
I said you learn to trust a stranger  
And stop and rest for the night  
Set your sight up in the headlight  
Well the moon wont be enough  
sister  
And light the embers of another  
And the night wont wont seem so rough  
Sister  
  
Ah  
There was a bloody beast of burden  
i wish I was a mother  
On a dark texas road  
with a baby at my breast  
A woman in a family way  
i am just a farmer  
And a car that lost control  
with a milkcow and a mess  
Im studying the distance  
i wish I was a mother  
Between the blanket and the gun  
with a baby at my breast  
I got ten hours to natchez  
i am just a farmer  
And another ten home  
with a milkcow and a mess  
Well Im goin home  
Yes  
  
I know your hearts in danger  
sister  
And so is your life  
sister  
I say learn to trust a stranger  
learn to trust  
And stop and rest for the night  
Set your sight up in the headlight  
Yeah the moon wont be enough  
And light the embers of another  
And the night wont seem so rough  
Sister  
Go ahead  
I said come on  
Ah oh yeah  
Ah oh yeah  
Ah oh yeah  
Ah oh yeah  
  
I said its trust that brought me here  
And trust will bring me home
