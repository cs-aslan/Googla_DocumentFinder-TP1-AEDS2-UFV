Its a Hell Up in Harlem fuckit another day  
Another dollar wake up to the barking from the Rottweilers  
Pull the collars make em sit for the Godfather  
Then I holler to Justin my son run the water  
For the shower trust fund scholarship sure to give him power  
Baby momma call she pick him up in about an hour  
Now free to go free to blow with the calicos  
And the navajos its just the way this player knows  
Anything goes finally caught up with my nigga Sam Sam  
Picked me up in the tan Lex Land  
Wanted breakfast down at Pan Pans whats your favorite dish  
He ordered cheese eggs and grits I had the swordfish  
What is this Three niggaz dressed in black  
Roleys on they wrist feathers in they hat  
One tapped me on my back then pointed at my stack  
Put my finger on the trigger  
Then I asked him Whatchu want nigga  
Chorus Puff Daddy  
Whatchu gonna do when its your turn to go  
Whatchu gonna do when you cant take no mo  
You gonna cry like a bitch or take it nice and slow  
Whatchu gonna do when its your turn to go  
repeat 2X  
Verse Two Puff Daddy  
I pray to God that Im dreamin I know my family  
Wouldnt take it when the doctor said He aint make it  
Mom Dukes cryin baby mom full of grief  
How she gonna tell her son his daddy is deceased  
Now she got beef with them bitches up the street  
All because I used to creep with her girlfriend Sharese  
She knows I keep the hoes from nation to nation  
On every radio station Goodfellas in rotation uhh  
Thats why niggaz wanna twist my shit flip my wig  
Attempt to murder me like Tommy Gills  
Before they draw niggaz threw me to the floor  
Drill holes in my pocket Sam launch the rocket  
They wanna rip my arms out the socket fuckin heathens  
Love to see a nigga stop breathin  
I heard a voice sing out Aint you Sean Puffy Combs  
Heres your eulogy meet you at the Crossroads  
Gnight Bone  
Chorus  
Verse Three Puff Daddy  
Nothing but clouds and white suits fill my vision  
Watching my life go down like Christian  
Listen hear them bullets rang shotguns and Mac millis  
Spraying like a hurricane in this war called the terror game  
And deuce deuces cant stand the pain  
Little guns aint got no business in this blizzard  
They just kibitz heres five shots to visit blaka  
Blowin bullet holes sizes of door knockers  
Three headed for my chest straight the other two  
Came a little late and just barely missed my face  
Im tryin to find a steady place between two cars  
One of us gon either wind up dead or behind bars  
Shit Im just tryin to live so I can raise my kid  
And own the world bone all the girlie girls  
Thats when I finally figured out  
Thats that nigga David Arthur Sharese baby father  
And I didnt even bother to ask no further questions  
No more confessions only suggestions  
I think Sam set me up cause them bullets squeezed up  
From the rear and Sam was the only nigga there  
Then they all peeled out in the rental aluminum  
Sam in the passenger seat so Im assumin them  
Niggaz didnt even get to peep  
Lil Kim and them in the backseat with the heat  
Clips they feelin em to the top shit aint sweet  
Once the light turns red nuff said thats dead  
They fled and they waved hot lead  
If I aint duck Id be on my deathbed  
Sucker move for that they dont get no props  
Lil Kim and them mad they aint bust no shots  
We in the block no Land posters just old posters  
Of gangsta niggaz I see ghosts of gangsta figures  
Im tryin to hold my own when they snatched me out the car  
Took me in the saloon and said Puffy there you are  
Them same cats we chased two blocks had new spots  
Washin dishes I guess for goin out like bitches  
I smacked em gave a little speech to mirth  
Happiness cause me and all my peeps got hurt  
That night I said a little prayer me and Justin  
Thats when I heard the bustin yeah  
Chorus
