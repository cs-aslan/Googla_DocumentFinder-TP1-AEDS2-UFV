Catholic school girls rule  
  
In the class shes taking notes  
Just how deep deep is my throat  
Mother Mary dont you know  
Shes got eyes like Marylin Monroe  
Catholic school girls rule  
  
From the cross shes raised her head  
This is what the sister said  
Give no love until youre wed  
Live no life until youre dead  
The good books says we must suppress  
The good books says we must confess  
But who cares what the good books says  
Cause now shes taking off her dress  
Catholic school girls rule  
  
Lead us into temptation  
We are pure divine creation  
Talkin about my generation  
Injected with the seed of emaculation Catholic
