It wasnt God who made honky tonk angels  
j d miller  
As I sit here tonight the jukebox playing  
The tune about the wild side of life  
As I listen to the words you are saying  
It brings memries when I was a trustful wife  
  
Chorus  
It wasnt God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song  
Too many times married men think theyre still single  
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong  
  
Its a shame that all the blame is on us women  
Its not true that only you men feel the same  
From the start most every heart thats ever broken  
Was because there always was a man to blame  
  
chorus
