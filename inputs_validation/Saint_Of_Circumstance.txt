This must be heaven tonight I cross the line  
You must be the angel I though I might never find  
Was it you I heard singing oh while I was chasin dreams  
Driven by the wind like the dust that blows around  
And the rain fallin down but I never know  
Got to be heaven cause heres where the rainbow ends  
If this aint the real thing then its close enough to pretend  
When that wind blows when the nights about to fall  
You can hear the silence call its a certain sort of sound  
Like the rain fallin down  
Holes in whats left of my reason holes in the knees of my blues  
Odds against me been increasin but Ill pull through  
I never could read no road map I dont know what the weather might do  
But when that rich wind whines and I see the dark star shine  
I got a feeling theres no time to lose no time to lose  
Never know now just dont never know no  
Well its been heaven but even the rainbows will end  
Now my sails are fillin and the wind is willin  
And Im as good as gone again  
Im still walkin so Im sure that I can dance  
Just a Saint of Circumstance just a tiger in a trance  
And the rain fallin down well you never know just dont know  
Listen sure dont know what I going for but Im gonna go for it for sure
