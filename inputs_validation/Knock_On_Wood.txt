I dont want to lose you this good thing  
That I got cause if I do  
I will surely  
Surely lose a lot  
Cause your love is better  
Than any love I know  
  
Its like thunder and lightning  
The way you love me is frightening  
You better knock knock on wood baby  
  
Im not superstitious about ya  
But I cant take no chance  
I got me spinnin baby  
You know Im in a trance  
Cause your love is better  
Than any love I know  
  
Its like thunder and lightning  
The way you love me is frightening  
You better knock knock on wood baby  
  
Its no secret about it  
That woman is my loving cup  
cause she sees to it  
That I get enough  
Just one touch from here  
You know it means so much
