What she got she got to give it to somebody  
What she got she got to give it to someone  
Its not a case of growin up or lots of money  
Its just the fundamental twist of the sun  
  
What she got she got to let somebody find it Really  
What she got is not for her to keep alone Oh  
Nobodys got a clue if there is such a reason Yeah  
Why she wanna play it oon her own  
  
Shes got nothing on but the radio  
Shes a passion play  
And like the break of day  
She takes my breath away  
  
What she got she got to give to some contender  
What she got is just like gold dust on a shelf  
And no ones got a clue whats on her brave agenda  
Why she wanna keep it keep it to herself  
  
Shes got nothing on but the radio  
Its a passion play  
And like the break of day  
She takes my breath away  
  
Who did the painting on my wall  
Who left a poem down the hall  
Oh I dont understand at all hehehey  
  
Shes got nothing on but the radio  
Shes a passion play  
And like the break of day  
She takes my breath away  
  
Shes got nothing on but the radio  
Its a passion play  
And like the break of day  
She takes my breath away  
  
She takes my breath away  
She takes my breath away
