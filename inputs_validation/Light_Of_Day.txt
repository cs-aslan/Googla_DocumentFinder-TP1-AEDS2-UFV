Well Ive been out of the woods for six days and nights now  
Well Im a little hot wired but Im feeling alright  
I got some money in my pocket and a long lean ride  
I got to make it down to Galveston by Saturday night now  
  
Well Im a little down under but Im feeling OK  
Got a little lost along the way  
  
Im just around the corner to the light of day  
Well Im just around the corner to the light of day  
  
Been driving five hundred miles got five hundred to go yeah  
I got rock and roll music on the radio  
I got a brother on a rig just off the gulf coast  
He says the girls down there well theyre really the most man  
  
Well Im a little down under but Im feeling OK  
I got a little lost along the way  
  
Just around the corner to the light of day  
Just around the corner to the light of day  
Im just around the corner to the light of day  
Im just around the corner to the light of day  
  
Well I got thrown out of work on the Kokomo  
Dont ask me what Im doing I dont know  
I hope he wasnt joking when he wrote me that letter  
Things cant get any worse they got to get better  
  
Well Im a little down under but Im feeling OK  
I got a little lost along the way  
  
Im just around the corner to the light of day  
Just around the corner to the light of day  
Just around the corner to the light of day  
Just around the corner to the light of day
