You were just a young girl the  
Well I know your story well  
Your parents died and left you  
Just a name and little else  
  
You split from Colorado  
You left without a word  
I guess I should have hated you  
But I loved you even more

So youre the one they called

Quite a change come over you  
But then youre a woman now  
See just how you earned your name  
Your beauty conquered all  
  
Denver dream Ive missed you  
Its been a long long time  
Since the day weve been apart  
Youve been on my mind  
  
Say youre not sure whom I am  
Then cast your thoughts do Denver  
cause Im the girl you left so lost  
Yes Im your little sister
