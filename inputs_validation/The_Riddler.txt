Riddler Riddler ask me why  
The birds fly free on a mackerel sky  
Ask me whither goes the wind  
Whence the endless ticktick stream begins  
  
Make me guess if the earth is flat or round  
Set a guessing if fantasies are unbound  
If tales arent just for children to see  
That its peace if sleep walks with me  
  
As you wish  
For kingdom come  
The one to know all the answers  
You think you dwell in wisdoms sea  
Still sweet ignorance is the key  
To a poets paradise  
Challenge the Riddler and you will see  
  
Riddler Riddler ask me why  
All mothers beneath the Earth and sky  
Hold their childrens hands for a while  
Their hearts forever  yours and mine  
  
Make me wonder whats the meaning of life  
Whats the use to be born and then die  
Make me guess whos the one  
Behind the mask of Father and Son  
  
As you wish  
For kingdom come  
The one to know all the answers  
You think you dwell in wisdoms sea  
Still sweet ignorance is the key  
To a poets paradise  
Challenge the Riddler and you will see  
  
For nature hates virginity  
I wish to be touched  
Not by the hands of wheres and whys  
But by the Oceans minds  
  
As you wish  
For kingdom come  
The one to know all the answers  
You think you dwell in wisdoms sea  
Still sweet ignorance is the key  
To a poets paradise  
Challenge the Riddler and you will see
