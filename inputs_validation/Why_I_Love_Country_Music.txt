Jane is fine always fine  
Were unhappy most of the time  
We dont talk we dont fight  
Im just tired shes way past caring  
But she says she is fine  
She tells lies most of the time  
What she needs I dont have  
Thats not in the hand that Im holding  
So we drink spanish wine  
She plays country records until the morning  
This is mine all of mine  
She is not she is not mine  
And I feel fine only when Im sleeping  
Only with the T V On  
She and I and empty wine and whisky bottles  
And she write beneath crumpled sheets  
She is everything I need  
But she would rather be any place but here  
Jane is fine always fine  
Were unhappy most of the time  
We dont talk we dont fight Im just tired  
Shes way past caring  
So we drink spanish wine we tell lies  
Were killing and we feel fine  
Well whats the crime
