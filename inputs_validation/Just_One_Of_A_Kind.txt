Within the prison of my soul  
Locked within my troubled mind  
Is a love I cant forget  
Cause shes just one of a kind  
  
Just a plain old fashioned girl  
The kind a man dont have to tame  
When he starts to settle down  
Hes proud to let her wear his name  
  
Within my hand I hold the key  
Do I dare to set her free  
Got a feelin in my mind  
That shes just one of a kind  
  
Pulled away from my hometown  
Thought Id leave her love behind  
But Mary rode with me  
On the highways of my mind  
  
Seen a million pretty girls  
Pretty girls arent hard to find  
But shes a rare breed Im convinced  
Marys just one of a kind  
  
Within my hand I hold the key  
Do I dare to set her free  
Got a feelin in my mind  
That shes just one of a kind  
  
Within the prison of my soul  
Locked within my troubled mind  
Is a love I cant forget  
Cause shes just one of a kind
