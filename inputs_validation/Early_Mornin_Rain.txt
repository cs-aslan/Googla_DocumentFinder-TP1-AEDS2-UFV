In the early mornin rain  
With a dollar in my hand  
And an aching in my heart  
And my pockets full of sand  
Im a long ways from home  
And I missed my loved one so  
In the early mornin rain  
With no place to go  
  
Out on runway number nine  
Big seven o seven set to go  
Well Im out here on the grass  
Where the pavement never grows  
Where the liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
There she goes my friend  
Shes rolling out at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wing on high  
Shes away and westward bound  
For above the clouds she flies  
Where the mornin rain dont fall  
And the sun always shines  
Shell be flying over my home  
In about three hours time  
  
This ol airports got me down  
Its no earthly good to me  
Cause Im stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be  
Cant jump a jet plane  
Like you can a freight train  
So I best be on my way  
In the early mornin rain  
So I best be on my way  
In the early mornin rain  
So I best be on my way  
In the early mornin rain
