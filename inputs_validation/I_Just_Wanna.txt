I got a body built for sin and an appetite for passion  
Yeah I can see the road to ruin and Im lookin for some action  
I got my finger on the trigger and a match to the fuse  
Ill make someone an offer thats too big to refuse  
Tired of tryin to be what Ill never be baby  
You could never see that  
I dont want a romance I dont want to dance I just want to forget you  
Time to take my chances find somebody new  
I just want to for I just want to for I just want to forget you  
Im gonna set the night on fire shootin like a Roman Candle  
Ooh yeah Im burnin with desire and Im much too hot to handle  
Im like a runaway crazy train Im out of control  
If you try to put the brakes on Im still gonna roll  
Tired of tryin to do what you want me to baby  
Im just tired of you yeah  
I dont want a romance I dont want to dance I just want to forget you  
Time to take my chances find somebody new  
I just want to for I just want to for I just want to for  
I just want to forget you  
Wake up baby dont you sleep I cant take this one more week  
If I cant go out to play I cant make it one more day  
I want to play with dynamite time is right for heavy breathing  
Gettin stone cold crazy till the dawn without a reason  
I want to take me a vacation down a long stretch of track  
Ill find a new sensation and I aint comin back  
Tired of tryin to be what Ill never be baby  
You could never see that  
I dont want a romance I dont want to dance  
I dont want a romance or a second chance  
I dont want a romance I dont want to dance  
I just want to for I just want to forget  
I just want to forget you yeah
