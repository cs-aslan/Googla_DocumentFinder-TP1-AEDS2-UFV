Theyre tryin to take away my pride  
By stripping me of everything I own  
Theyre tryin to hurt me inside  
And make me into a white mans drone  
  
But this ones not for sale  
And I was born to fight  
I aint been knocked down yet  
I was born to fight  
Im the surest bet  
  
There aint no man no woman  
No beast alive that can beat me  
Cause Im born to fight  
  
Theyre tryin to dig into my soul  
And take away the spirit of my God  
Theyre tryin to take control  
And monitor my every thought  
  
I wont let down my guard  
And I was born to fight  
I aint been knocked down yet  
I was born to fight  
Im the surest bet  
  
There aint no man no woman  
No beast alive that can beat me  
Cause Im born to fight
