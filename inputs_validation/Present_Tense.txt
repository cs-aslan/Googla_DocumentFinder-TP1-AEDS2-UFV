This dance  
This dance  
Its like a weapon  
Like a weapon  
Of self defense  
Self defense  
Against the present  
Against the present  
Present tense  
  
I wont get heavy  
Dont get heavy  
Keep it light and  
Keep it moving  
I am doing  
No harm  
As my world  
Comes crashing down  
Im dancing  
Freaking out  
Deaf dumb and blind  
  
In you Im lost  
In you Im lost  
  
I wont turn around when the penny drops  
I wont stop now  
I wont slack off  
Or all this love  
Will be in vain  
  
Stop from falling  
Down a mine  
Its no ones business but mine  
That all this love  
Could be in vain  
  
In you Im lost  
In you Im lost  
In you Im lost  
In you Im lost
