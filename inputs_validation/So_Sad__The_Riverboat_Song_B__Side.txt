So sad so sad  
So sad so sad  
I didnt want to love you  
And you do want nothing at all  
So sad so sad  
So sad so sad  
  
Theres a cold break in my dream  
Keeps turning round everything youve said  
Its so naked in my brain  
Makes it hard to be by myself  
  
Repeat opening verse  
  
And I didnt want to love you  
And Im feeling the pain  
Stop watching the best things we loved in our life  
Was the wind and the sails  
And I needed to try for you  
Thats lost on the night  
And its found in the beautiful store in your eyes  
And its making you cry  
So sad its so sad  
  
So sad so sad  
So sad so sad  
I didnt want to love you  
And you do nothing at all  
Its so sad so sad  
So sad so sad x2
