Got no time to be on the run  
Got no holes in my shoes  
Youre the reasong all my friends have gone  
But I wont run from you  
  
So many promises and you broke them all  
Oh Ill forgive but I cant forget  
You know youre a fake but I just cant take no more  
Cause Im tired of it  
  
Im so tired so tired  
Sick and tired of it all  
Im so tired sick and tired  
Im so tired sick and tired of it all yeah  
  
You turn the truth then you turn your back  
Youre a victim of yourself  
The hate remains the hurting still exists  
Im so tired of it all  
  
Im so tired sick and tired  
So damn tired sick and tired of it all oh yeah  
Im so tired Im sick and tired of it all
