Were automatic tonight  
Theres no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
Were not alone  
Were automatic tonight  
Theres no looking back  
We came to put out the lights  
Were not alone tonight  
  
We wont stop  
Gonna crush the day  
Take any cheap shot  
Thrown our way  
Get high on top  
Of the world at bay  
And were never coming down never coming down never  
  
So well bleed on through and suffer the bruises  
Take all the blame but no excuses  
First one to blink is the first that loses  
So were never looking down never looking down never  
  
Were automatic tonight  
Theres no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
Were not alone  
Were automatic tonight  
Theres no looking back  
We came to put out the lights  
Were not alone tonight  
  
Were Automatic  
Its a heart break  
But it wont be long  
Like an earthquake  
We kick it strong  
Make your world shake  
Cross the line thats drawn  
And were never looking back never looking back never  
  
So well lick our wounds rise from the ashes  
Kick down the door and break the latches  
Gasoline dreams so we strike with matches  
So were never giving up never giving up never  
  
Were automatic tonight  
Theres no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
Were not alone  
Were automatic tonight  
Theres no looking back  
We came to put out the lights  
Were not alone tonight  
  
Were automatic like an addict passin out on the lawn  
When were chargin into battle like Genghis Khan  
And youre god damn right well prove you wrong  
This block this city is where we belong  
  
Were automatic tonight  
Theres no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
Were not alone  
Were automatic tonight  
Theres no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
Were not alone  
Were automatic tonight  
Theres no looking back  
We came to put out the lights  
Were not alone tonight  
  
Were automatic tonight  
  
Were automatic tonight
