Standin on top of my hill  
How do yall know what it feels like  
How can you tell me to make my bed  
When I sleep on the ground  
How can you say that you like my noise  
When I havent made a sound  
I like peace time better than war  
Spendin my money in the candy store  
I like makin angels on the shore  
How do yall know  
  
Floatin on my cloud  
How do yall know what it feels like  
Yellin your sermon from the bottom of a glass  
Cause you know how its done  
Tellin me the troubles of the promised land  
When Im in it just for fun  
I like to eat my pie before my meal  
Make a snake with an orange peel  
Say my prayers before I kneel  
How do yall know  
  
When I was walkin past your house  
I didnt see nobody home  
Yall musta been out buyin gold  
When I was polishin chrome  
Ridin in my spaceship  
How do yall know what it feels like  
What makes you think you can navigate  
When you dont know where Im flyin  
Tellin me the facts about what I say  
When you dont even know if Im lyin  
  
I like to wear white in the wintertime  
Pay my penance before the crime  
Have my reason without the rhyme  
But how do yall know
