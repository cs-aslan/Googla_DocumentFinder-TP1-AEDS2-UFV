When you left me I didnt cry but my heart was heavy  
As heavy as lead  
I sit there thinking with no thoughts in my head  
I could not be comforted by the living or the dead  
  
Chorus  
So I keep on dreaming to communicate  
And I keep on dreaming if thats what it take  
Keep on dreaming its never too late  
Keep on dreaming cause thats what it take  
  
I see you in my visions and it seems youre right here  
I wish I didnt have to wake up but here comes the light of day  
Its been too long now since you went away  
Wont you come back so we can play  
  
Chorus  
  
I knew it wasnt over it was only the start  
Cause I see the light that shines in the dark  
The questions have answers my love isnt lost  
Fate put us together so nothing can tear us apart  
  
Chorus
