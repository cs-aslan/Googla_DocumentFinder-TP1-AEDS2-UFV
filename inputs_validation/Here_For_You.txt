I remember all the good times  
Sometimes Id wonder would it last  
I used to dream about the future  
But now the future is the past  
I dont wanna live in yesterday  
Cross my heart until I die  
Dont wanna know just what tomorrow may bring  
Because today has just begun  
No matter whatever else Ive done  
Im here for you  
Im here for you  
  
So now I sit here and I wonder  
Whatever happened to my friends  
Too many bought a one way ticket  
But Ill be with you till the end  
  
I dont wanna live in yesterday  
Cross my heart until I die  
Dont wanna know just what tomorrow may bring  
Because today has just begun  
No matter whatever else Ive done  
Im here for you  
  
Youre my religion youre my reason to live  
You are the heaven in my hell  
Weve been together for a long long time  
And I just cant live without you  
No matter what you do  
Im here for you  
  
I dont wanna live in yesterday  
Cross my heart until I die  
Dont wanna know just what tomorrow may bring  
Because today has just begun  
No matter whatever else Ive done  
Im here for you  
Im here for you  
Im here for you  
Im here for you
