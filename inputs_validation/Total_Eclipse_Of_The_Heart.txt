Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit  
Lonely and youre never coming round  
Turnaround every now and then I getta little bit  
Tired of listening to the sound of my tears  
Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit  
Nervous that the best of all the years have gone by  
Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit  
Terrified and then I see the look in your eyes  
Turnaround bright eyes every now and then I fall apart  
Turnaround bright eyes every now and then I fall apart  
  
And I need you now tonight  
And I need you more than ever  
And if youll only hold me tight  
Well be holding on forever  
And well only be making it right  
Cause well never be wrong together  
We can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time all of the time  
I dont know what to do and Im always in the dark  
Were living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight  
Forevers gonna start tonight  
Forevers gonna start tonight  
  
Once upon a time I was falling in love  
But now Im only falling apart  
Theres nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now theres only love in the dark  
Nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
  
Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit  
Restless and I dream of something wild  
Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit  
Helpless and Im lying like a child in your arms  
Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit  
Angry and I know Ive got to get out and cry  
Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit  
Terrified but then I see the look in you eyes  
Turnaround bright eyes every now and then I fall apart  
Turnaround bright eyes every now and then I fall apart  
  
And I need you now tonight  
And I need you more than ever  
And if youll only hold me tight  
Well be holding on forever  
And well only be making it right  
Cause well never be wrong together  
We can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time all of the time  
I dont know what to do and Im always in the dark  
Were living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight  
Forevers gonna start tonight  
Forevers gonna start tonight  
  
Once upon a time I was falling in love  
But now Im only falling apart  
Theres nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
  
A total eclipse of the heart  
A total eclipse of the heart  
A total eclipse of the heart  
A total eclipse of the heart
