Itd be just another river town  
Streets would have a different sound  
Thered be no honky tonks with whiskey rounds  
No dreamers chasin dreams down  
  
No tourists takin in the sights  
No stetsons under broadway lights  
No pickers playin for pocket change  
No rhinestone boots on an old church stage  
  
Hey blue eyes cryin in the rain  
Hey fire burnin round the ring  
Hey crazy you know its true  
That nashville wouldnt be nashville without you  
  
No ghost of the man in black  
No long white cadillac  
No woman standin by her man  
In the place where it all began  
  
Hey good lookin hey momma tried  
Hey gambler hey country boy can survive  
Hey jolene you know its true  
That nashville wouldnt be nashville without you  
  
Hey georgia hey smokey mountain rain  
Hey galveston he stopped loving her today  
Hey fancy you know its true  
That nashville wouldnt have  
Blue eyes cryin in the rain  
Hey fire burnin round the ring  
Hey crazy you know its true  
That nashville wouldnt be nashville without you  
  
Itd be just another river town  
Streets would have a different sound
