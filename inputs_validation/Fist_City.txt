A youve been makin your brags around town  
That youve been a lovin my man  
But the man I love when he picks up trash  
He puts it in a garbage can  
And thats what a you look like to me  
And what I sees a pity  
Close your face and stay outta my way  
If ya dont wanna go to fist city  
  
If ya dont wanna go to fist city  
Ya better detour around my town  
Cause Ill grab you by the hair a the head  
And Ill lift a you off a the ground  
  
Im not a sayin my babys a saint cause he aint  
N that he wont cat around with a kitty  
Im here to tell ya gal to lay offa my man  
If ya dont wanna go to fist city  
  
Come on and tell me what you told my friends  
If you think youre brave enough  
And Ill show you what a real woman is  
Since you think youre hot stuff  
Youll bite off more than you can chew  
If you get to cute or witty  
You better move your feet  
If you dont wanna eat  
A meal thats called fist city  
  
If you dont wanna go to fist city  
You better detour around my town  
Cause Ill grab you by the hair a the head  
And Ill lift you offa the ground  
  
Im not a sayin my babys a saint cause he aint  
N that he wont cat around with a kitty  
Im here to tell ya gal to lay offa my man  
If ya dont wanna go to fist city  
Im here to tell ya gal to lay offa my man  
If ya dont wanna go to fist city
