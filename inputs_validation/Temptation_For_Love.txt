What have I done  
What did I say  
Am I the one  
You can not face  
When I need love  
I look to you  
But when I search I can not trace  
A beat of your heart a shadow or shape  
Could it be me that learns to mistake temptation  
Temptation for love  
  
Why dont we try  
To talk it through  
And we may find  
Some common ground  
I realize  
That once again  
I search for what can not be found  
A beat of your heart a shadow or shape  
Could it be me that learns to mistake temptation  
Temptation for love  
  
Is there a bond that we havent found  
Now that youre gone I lie awake  
Now Ive mistaken  
  
Words fail me now  
I fear the worst  
I let you down  
And can not face  
What I have done  
To you this time  
I called on you but couldnt trace  
A beat of your heart a shadow or shape  
Could it be me that learns to mistake temptation  
Temptation for love
