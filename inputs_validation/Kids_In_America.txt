Friday night and everyones moving  
I can feel the heat but its soothing  
Heading down I search for the beat in this dirty town  
  
Down town the young ones are going  
Down town the young ones are growing  
  
Were the kids in America  
Were the kids in America  
Everybody live for the musicgoround  
  
Bright ligths the music get faster  
Look boy dont check on your watch not another glance  
Im not leaving now honey not a chance  
  
Were the kids in America  
Were the kids in America  
Everybody live for the musicgoround  
  
Were the kids  
Were the kids  
Were the kids in America  
  
Were the kids in America  
Were the kids in America  
Everybody live for the musicgoround
