Love can have its mysteries  
Some strange enchanted notion  
You cant explain just how it begins  
A feel a smile a potion  
But something goes off in your head  
You cant believe the words you just said  
Its not so hard to see the light  
Lovers at first sight  
When the right one comes along  
There is no hesitation  
You wonder how you lost all control  
Its just a revelation  
And thats the way I felt with you  
One glance was all it took and I knew  
You and I were just so right  
Lovers at first sight  
Je taime beaucoups mon cherie  
I love that you love me  
Jai envie detre pres de toi  
I want you too  
Cause when we are together  
There is no place in this world that Id rather be  
Girl  
Duratil pour toujours  
Yes its forever  
Estce que tu me promets  
I promise my cherie  
Cause you know nothing will change  
The way were gonna live together  
In our litle fantasy  
Chorus  
Thats the way I felt with you  
One glance was all it took and I knew  
You and I were just so right  
Lovers at first sight  
Fade  
Depuis que jetais un enfant  
Je taimais  
Mais tu ne savais pas que jexistais  
Et maintenant que nous sommes ensemble  
Tu dis que seeest lamour do premier coup
