We said goodbye to a dear old friend  
And we packed our bags and left feeling sad  
Its the only way  
We said hello as we turned the key  
A new roof over our heads  
Gave a smile  
Its the only way  
Only way  
  
Turn your head  
And dont look back  
Set your sails for a new horizon  
Dont turn around dont look down  
Oh theres life across the tracks  
And you know its really not surprising  
It gets better when you get there oh  
  
Well it really dont matter much where you are  
cause home is in your heart  
Its a feeling that you wake with one day  
Some people key p running all their life  
And still find they havent gone too far  
They dont see its the feeling inside  the feeling inside oh  
  
Turn your head and dont look back  
Just set your sails for a new horizon  
Dont turn around dont look down  
Oh theres life across the tracks  
And you know its really not surprising  
It gets better when you get there  
  
We said hello as we turned the key  
A new roof over our heads  
Gave a smile  its the only way
