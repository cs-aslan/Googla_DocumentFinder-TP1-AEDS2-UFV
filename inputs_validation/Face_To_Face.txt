Oh you dont have blue eyes  
I expected blue eyes  
Thats how I pictured you would be  
  
And you dont have long hair  
I thought that youd have long hair  
So this is all a shock to me  
  
I didnt know if you would meet me or believe me  
When I said that I was fooled  
I really thought that I would hate you  
I know I meant to  
Thered only be one of us left when were through  
  
Now that were face to face  
And I put myself in your place  
I see the truth I see whos really to blame  
  
And I wont play his game or try to get even  
Hell know hes lost watching us leaving  
I blamed you but I see my mistakes  
Now that were face to face  
  
I believe in true love something to be sure of  
Isnt that what we deserve  
There is no blame here we both end up the same here  
A little wiser than we were  
  
There was a time this would have killed me  
And it may still be hard to look you in the eye  
And now that all the spells are broken  
The truths been spoken  
My heart has the strength to tell him goodbye  
  
And now that were face to face  
And I put myself in your place  
I see the truth I see whos really to blame  
  
And I wont play his game or try to get even  
Hell know hes lost watching us leaving  
I blamed you but I see my mistakes  
Now that were face to face  
  
I wont play his game or try to get even  
Hell know hes lost watching us leaving  
I blamed you but I see my mistakes  
Now that were face to face  
Now that were face to face
