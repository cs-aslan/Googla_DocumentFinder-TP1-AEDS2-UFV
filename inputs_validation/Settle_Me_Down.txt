A mans blood runs hot  
As high as the temple will go  
Though we can deny our nature baby  
It makes us less in control  
  
Theres a beautiful lady who breaks in the sand  
With secrets that she only knows  
Oh she gives and she takes with each wave that she makes  
And its to her that I must go  
  
Cause she settle me down  
Settle me down  
Oh wont you settle me down  
The coolest fever in my blood  
Oh wont you settle me down  
Cmon  
  
Oh its not my style  
To be afraid  
Of what evil men gon do  
And I wont live in fear  
I know why Im here  
Yeah Im sheltered and watched after too  
  
Cause these people put on the fine business suits  
And they step on your face til theyre going  
Oh the money the cursin when its time for the hearse  
Only bankers and lawyers are showin  
  
Come and settle me down  
Settle me down  
Oh wont you settle me down  
  
The coolest fever in my blood  
Oh wont you settle me down  
  
Bye bye bye bye  
  
Hey boys  
Listen right here  
This aint ever gonna get on country radio  
Im tellin ya  
You gotta change your style  
  
Cmon  
  
Settle me down  
Settle me down  
Oh wont you settle me down  
The coolest fever in my blood  
Oh wont you settle me down  
  
Settle me down  
Settle me down  
Oh wont you settle me down  
The coolest fever in my blood  
  
Settle me down  
Settle me down  
Oh wont you settle me down  
The coolest fever in my blood  
Oh wont you settle me down
