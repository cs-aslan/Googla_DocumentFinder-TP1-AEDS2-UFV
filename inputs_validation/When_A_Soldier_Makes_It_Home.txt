Halfway around the world tonight  
In a strange and foreign land  
A soldier packs his memories  
As he leaves Afghanistan  
And back home they dont know too much  
Theres just no way to tell  
I guess you had to be there  
For to know that war was hell  
And there wont be any victory parades  
For those thats coming back  
Theyll fly them in at midnight  
And unload the body sacks  
And the living will be walking down  
A long and lonely road  
Because nobody seems to care these days  
When a soldier makes it home  
Theyll say it wasnt easy  
Just another job well done  
As the government in Kabul falls  
To the sounds of rebel guns  
And the faces of the comrades  
Being blown out of the sky  
Leaves you bitter with the feeling  
That they didnt have to die  
And there wont be any victory parades  
For those thats coming back  
Theyll fly them in at midnight  
And unload the body sacks  
And the living will be walking down  
A long and lonely road  
Because nobody seems to care these days  
When a soldier makes it home  
Halfway around the world tonight  
In a strange and foreign land  
A soldier unpacks memories  
That he saved from Vietnam  
Back home they didnt know too much  
There was just no way to tell  
I guess you had to be there  
For to know that war was hell  
And there wasnt any big parades  
For those that made it back  
They flew them in at midnight  
And unloaded all the sacks  
And the living were left walking down  
A long and lonely road  
Because nobody seemed to care back then  
When a soldier made it home  
The night is coming quickly  
And the stars are on their way  
As I stare into the evening  
Looking for the words to say  
That I saw the lonely soldier  
Just a boy thats far from home  
And I saw that I was just like him  
While upon this earth I roam  
And there may not be any big parades  
If I ever make it back  
As I come home under cover  
Through a world that cant keep track  
Of the heroes who have fallen  
Let alone the ones who wont  
Which is why nobody seems to care  
When a soldier makes it home
