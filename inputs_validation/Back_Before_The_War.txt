Stacks of paper my name in bold print  
Yours right besides it on this document  
Too many lawyers too many angry words  
So much we didnt say so much we never heard  
Do you remember  
When I was all that you were living for  
Back before the war  
  
Chorus  
Back before the broken vows  
The shattered trust this empty house  
When nothing really mattered but us  
Back before we climbed too high  
My dreams were yours your dreams were mine  
back before we fell so out of touch  
Back before the war  
  
Childrens laughter trailing down the hall  
Tiny footsteps God how I miss it all  
Its not as simple as whos right and whos to blame  
How could we fly so high to be shot down in flames  
Do you remember  
When you were all that I was living for  
Back before the war  
  
Chorus  
  
Stacks of paper I guess this is where we sign  
Strange how your signature so closely matches mine  
I never dreamed our love would ever come to this  
Avoiding each others eyes still craving your tenderness  
Do you remember  
When love was all that we were living for  
Back before the war  
Back before the war
