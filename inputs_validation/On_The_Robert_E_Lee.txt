Hey  
Look at the way shes wavin her sail  
Its a wondrous sight to see  
People hurry on down from every town  
Have a look at the Robert E Lee  
Proud and strong and made to be free  
Cant go wrong on the Robert E Lee  
  
Got the sun in my eyes  
And the wind in my face  
And its good just to be alive  
Gonna set out tonight for New Orleans  
I wont sleep till I arrive  
  
And if Im lucky  
Ill find a young lady under the stars  
And well dance the night away  
  
Somebody wake me and say its a dream  
Leadin me far from my home  
And havent you noticed  
Despite what it seems  
You cant deny its you and I alone  
  
Maybe spend my life just workin the land  
Maybe livin from day to day  
But Im free tonight in New Orleans  
If I like it I just might stay  
  
Proud and strong and made to be free  
Cant go wrong on the Robert E Lee  
  
Got the sun in my eyes  
And the wind in my face  
And its good just to be alive  
Gonna set out tonight for New Orleans  
I wont sleep till I arrive
