I got some socalled friends  
Theyll smile right to my face  
But when my back is turned  
Theyd like to stick to me  
  
Yes they would  
Oh no no oh no no  
Theres only one thing I need to know  
Whose side are you on  
  
I fly into JFK  
My heart goes boom boom boom  
I know that customs man  
Hes going to take me  
  
To that little room  
Oh no no Oh no no  
Theres only one thing I need to know  
Whose side are you on  
Whose side are you on  
  
I got the paranoia blues  
From knockin around in New York City  
Where they roll you for a nickel  
And they stick you for the extra dime  
  
Anyway you choose  
Youre bound to lose in New York City  
Oh I just got out in the nick of time  
Well I just got out in the nick of time  
  
Once I was down in Chinatown  
I was eating some Lins Chow Fon  
I happened to turn around  
And when I looked I see  
  
My Chow Fons gone  
Oh no no Oh no no  
Theres only one thing I need to know  
Whose side are you on whose side are you on  
Theres only one thing I need to know  
Whose side whose side whose side
