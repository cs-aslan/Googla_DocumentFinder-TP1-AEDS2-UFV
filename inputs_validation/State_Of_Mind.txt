I was goin round the world  
I was lookin for somewhere  
I was searchin for someone  
Who was gonna take me there  
  
Didnt want to do it cause I knew what Id find  
Yourre Really only livin in a state of mind yeah  
  
I was thinkin of the past  
I was tryin to rack my brain  
I was looking at the future looking at the future  
I was tryin to play the game  
  
Didnt want to do it cause I knew what Id find  
Youre really only livin in a state of mind yeah  
  
Sometimes you get lost  
Sometimes you get found  
In a state of mind  
Sometimes youre too high  
Sometimes youre too down  
Its just a state of mind  
  
Didnt want to do it cause I knew what Id find  
Youre really only livin in a state of mind yeah  
  
Sometimes you get lost  
Sometimes you get found  
In a state of mind  
Sometimes youre too high  
Sometimes youre too down  
Its just a state of mind  
  
You think you know it all  
Then you think that you know nothing  
Cant dance cant crawl crawl  
Maybe you better forget it  
  
Didnt want to do it cause I knew what Id find  
Youre really only livin in a state of mind yeah  
  
Didnt want to it cause I knew what Id find  
Youre really only livin in a state of mind yeah  
  
Didnt want to it cause I knew what Id find  
Youre really only livin in a state of mind yeah  
  
State of mind  
Its a state of mind  
State of mind  
State of mind  
State of mind  
State of mind
