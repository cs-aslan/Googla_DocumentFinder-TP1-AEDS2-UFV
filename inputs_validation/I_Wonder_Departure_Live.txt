This park and these houses  
Old streets I have walked  
Everything dear will it be here  
One day when I am returning  
  
My friends will get married  
Have children and homes  
It sounds so nice wellplanned and wise  
Never expecting surprises  
  
I wonder its frightening  
Leaving now is that the right thing  
I wonder it scares me  
But who the the hell am I if I dont leave it  
  
Im not a coward  
Oh no Ill be strong  
One chance in a lifetime  
Yes I will take it it cant go wrong  
  
My friends and my family  
This dull little town  
Buses Ive missed boys that Ive kissed  
Everything old and familiar  
  
I wonder its frightening  
Leaving now is that the right thing  
I wonder it scares me  
But who the the hell am I if I dont leave and try  
  
Im not a coward  
Oh no Ill be strong  
One chance in a lifetime  
Yes I will take it oh yes  
Yes I will take it it cant go wrong
