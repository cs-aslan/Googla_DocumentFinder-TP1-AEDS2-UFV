She owns a shotgun and a fourtyfour  
And a fivepound chihuahua named El Salvador  
She likes to lie under the stars at night  
And watch the sky as the plains pass by  
  
You know that skirts so short your eyes could bleed  
Yes she acts like shes a royal queen of modesty  
Shell keep you guessing cause her eyes deceive  
When you think you got it made  
Shes got the aces up her sleeve  
  
Shes so lovely  
And she lets you believe what you want to believe  
When she loves me  
All you know she can do no wrong  
  
You know she wants to buy a limousine  
So she can always look important everytime shes seen  
Shes got a smile that you cant believe  
And the junk in her trunk Itll bring you to your knees  
  
Shes so lovely  
And she lets you believe what you want to believe  
When she loves me  
All you know she can do no wrong  
  
Oh no she can do no wrong  
Say you know she can do no wrong  
When she loves me  
  
When she goes out with the girls at night  
She wont be back until the dawn of the morning light  
She quit her job at the sales and loan  
Now shes working for the nation  
Got a job in immigration  
  
Shes so lovely  
And she lets you believe what you want to believe  
When she loves me  
All you know she can do no wrong  
  
Oh no she can do no wrong  
Say you know she can do no wrong  
When she loves me
