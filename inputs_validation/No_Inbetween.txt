So pardon me boys  
Im gonna be late  
I dont have the choice  
Ive got to get into shape  
  
Its eight on the nose  
And I gotta go  
So pass me my coat  
Ive got to get to the show  
  
Aint got no feelin  
Aint got no pain  
Aint got no reason  
To try again  
  
Dont need no finger  
To point at me  
Cant let it linger  
I must get free  
  
So send me away  
Cause I need a break  
What more can I say  
Theres just so much I can take  
  
But dont be so sad  
Im feelin alright  
It wont be so bad  
If I can get through tonight  
  
It seemed so simple  
Lets go out and have some fun  
Someone to play to  
We didnt know what wed begun  
  
Then as things grew  
We really thought we had it made  
But soon we all knew  
That wed be ending up like slaves  
  
The simple fact is  
There really aint no in between  
Youre either up there  
Or scurryin round and lookin lean  
  
And when youre up there  
They just cant wait to tear you down  
Just like a treadmill  
You find yourself goin round  
  
So pardon me boys  
Im gonna be late  
I dont have the choice  
Ive got to get into shape  
  
So just one more time  
Yeah that is for sure  
And then Ill be fine  
Ah but Ive said it before
