The gaslamp flickers in the night  
And jinglejangles in the wind  
The poolhall cowboys play and play  
cause poolhall hot shots dont go home  
And a lonely breeze sends shivers  
From a distant shore  
Since I dont see you anymore  
  
The morning curtains gently sway  
A gap throws light across the room  
You curse that noisy radio  
Even when you turn it down  
It tells us bad news of a distant war  
And I dont see you anymore  
Since I didnt see you  
Since I didnt see you  
Since I dont see you anymore  
  
No me da un bledo si senor  
Since I dont see you anymore  
Ive always got time for one more  
Since I dont see you anymore  
And a lonely breeze sends shivers  
From a distant shore  
And the tears fall faster now love  
Much more than before  
Since I dont see you anymore
