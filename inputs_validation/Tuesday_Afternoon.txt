Tuesday afternoon  
Im just beginning to see  
Now Im on my way  
It doesnt matter to me  
Chasing the clouds away  
  
Something calls to me  
The trees are drawing me near  
Ive got to find out why  
Those gentle voices I hear  
Explain it all with a sigh  
  
Im looking at myself reflections of my mind  
Its just the kind of day to leave myself behind  
So gently swaying through the fairyland of love  
If youll just come with me youll see the beauty of  
Tuesday afternoon  
Tuesday afternoon  
  
Tuesday afternoon  
Im just beginning to see  
Now Im on my way  
It doesnt matter to me  
Chasing the clouds away  
  
Something calls to me  
The trees are drawing me near  
Ive got to find out why  
Those gentle voices I hear  
Explain it all with a sigh
