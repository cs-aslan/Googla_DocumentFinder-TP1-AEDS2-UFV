Honey you do me wrong  
But Im still crazy about you  
Stay away too long  
When you know I cant do without you  
Every chance you get you seem to  
Hurt me more and more and more  
But each hurt makes my love  
Stronger than before  
I know flowers grow from rain  
But how can love  
Grow from this pain  
I want to know  
Aint that peculiar  
Peculiarity  
Aint that peculiar baby  
Aint it just like you and me  
Aw you tell me lies  
And you should be honest to me  
Me Im so much in love with you baby  
That I dont want to see  
That the things you do and say  
Are designed to make me blue  
Its a crying shame  
My love for you  
Makes all your lies seem true  
If the truth makes love last longer  
Why do lies make my love stronger  
I want to know right now  
Aint that peculiar  
Peculiarity  
Aint that peculiar baby  
Aint it just like you and me  
Yeah  
Uh huh  
Ah ah yeah  
All right  
Yeah  
Aint that peculiar  
Peculiarity  
Aint that peculiar baby  
Aint it just like you and me  
Aint that peculiar  
Peculiarity right now  
Yeah  
I want to know right now  
Why it means that much to you and me  
My poor hearts going to break  
Im making a big mistake  
Making my poor heart break  
Making me give her a double take  
Making my poor heart break  
Making me give her a double take  
I could change your world  
I could  
You could and I could  
I will  
Change your world  
you can I can change our world  
you can I can change our world  
you can I can change our world  
you can I can change our world  
you can I can change our world  
you can I can change our world
