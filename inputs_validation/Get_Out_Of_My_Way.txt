Crash bang wallop Im a lover again  
Ive got my eyes on the road and Im feeling no pain  
Ive found a real fine woman  
Im heading to see her  
Bye bye melancholy listen to me  
We had a long long ride  
But it isnt to be  
Ive found a real fine woman  
Im heading to see her  
Get out of my way get out of my life  
I dont need anybody to tell me how to be right  
Dont try to stop me Ive got the answer  
I wont need anybody except my woman tonight  
I cant help it if Im starting to smile  
Ive got a full gas tank and its only a mile  
Til Ill be with my little woman  
Im ready to see her  
So I say  
Bye bye melancholy listen to me  
We had a long long ride  
But it isnt to be  
Ive found a real fine woman  
Im heading to see her  
Get out of my way get out of my life  
I dont need anybody to tell me how to be right  
Dont try to stop me Ive got the answer  
I wont need anybody except my woman tonight
