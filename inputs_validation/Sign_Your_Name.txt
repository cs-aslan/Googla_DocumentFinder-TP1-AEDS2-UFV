Sign your name  
Across my heart  
I want you to be my baby  
Sign your name  
Across my heart  
I want you to be my lady  
  
Time Im sure will bring  
Disappointments in so many things  
It seems to be the way  
When your gambling cards on love you play  
Id rather be in Hell with you baby  
Than in cool Heaven  
It seems to be the way  
  
Sign your name  
Across my heart  
I want you to be my baby  
Sign your name  
Across my heart  
I want you to be my lady  
  
Birds never look into the sun  
Before the day is gone  
But oh the light shines brighter  
On a peaceful day  
Stranger blue leave us alone  
We dont want to deal with you  
Well shed our stains showering  
In the room that makes the rain  
  
All alone with you  
Makes the butterflies in me arise  
Slowly we make love  
And the Earth rotates  
To our dictates  
Slowly we make love  
  
Sign your name  
Across my heart  
I want you to be my baby  
Sign your name  
Across my heart  
I want you to be my lady
