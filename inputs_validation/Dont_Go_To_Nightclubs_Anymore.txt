Dont get around much anymore  
The smoke has driven me out the door  
All night I used to walk the floor  
Dont go to nightclubs anymore  
  
Dont see my old friend Mose  
I dont run into Mr Clive  
I cut out all that off the wall jive  
I dont go to nightclubs no more  
  
Im not a legend in my own mind  
Dont need juice to unwind  
And dont have no need to pretend  
Aint got no huckleberry friend  
  
Alcohol was too big a price  
Listen I just said no dice  
When it comes to the men and the mice  
Dont go to nightclubs anymore  
  
Im not a legend in my own mind  
Dont need booze to unwind  
Dont have no reason to pretend  
Aint got no huckleberry friend  
  
Alcohol was too big a price  
That why I said hey no dice  
When it comes to men or mice  
Dont go to nightclubs no more  
  
Dont go to nightclubs no more  
Dont go to nightclubs no more  
Dont go to nightclubs no more Im such a bore  
Dont go to nightclubs no more
