I looked over at my pillow but your face wasnt there  
And I dont smell the perfume you used to wear  
And I dont see your blouse or jeans or your pretty white cotton gown  
And Ive looked all over Hell but Heaven cant be found  
  
I looked on the bedside table but your jewelry was all gone  
And I just wish youd call every time I look at the phone  
I looked in our dressing mirror and I saw myself break down  
Oh I looked all over Hell but Heaven cant be found  
  
I called and looked in everyplace you used to hang around  
Ive searched in every bar and club and honkey tonk in town  
And I dont know if I can go on without breaking down  
Ive looked all over Hell but Heaven cant be found  
  
And I dont know if I can go on without breaking down  
Oh Ive looked all over Hell but my Heaven cant be found
