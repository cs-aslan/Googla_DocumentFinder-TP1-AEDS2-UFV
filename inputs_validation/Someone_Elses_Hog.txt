Well I got a little girl and shes got a daddy  
Whos got a lotta money and it makes me happy  
To follow them around like a little whipped puppy dog  
Well shes my honey but hes my sugar dad  
This country boy aint doin too bad  
Livin high on someone elses hog  
  
Well Im livin high on someone elses hog  
I sit around all day like a twentyfour karat  
Bump on a golden log  
Well I traded that rusty ol GMC  
Gotta long black Cadillac limousine  
Im a livin high on someone elses hog  
  
Well this redneck boy from a bluecollar town  
Has really moved up since he got tied down  
I got a brand new life and I owe it to my daddyinlaw  
Well he gave me a socalled executive position  
Now I get up early every day and go fishin  
Im a livin high on someone elses hog  
  
Well Im livin high on someone elses hog  
I sit around all day like a twentyfour karat  
Bump on a golden log  
Well I traded that rusty ol GMC  
Gotta long black Cadillac limousine  
Im a livin high on someone elses hog  
  
Well Im livin high on someone elses hog  
I sit around all day like a twentyfour karat  
Bump on a golden log  
Well I traded that rusty ol GMC  
Gotta long black Cadillac limousine  
Im a livin high on someone elses hog  
  
Well I traded that rusty ol GMC  
Gotta long black Cadillac limousine
