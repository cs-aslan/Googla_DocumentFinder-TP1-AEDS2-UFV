Im too terrified to walk out of my own front door  
Theyre demonstrating outside I think theyre gonna start the third world war  
Ive been to my local head shrinker  
To help classify my disease  
He said its one of the cases of acute schizophrenia he sees  
  
Well the milkmans a spy and the grocer keeps on following me  
And the woman next doors an undercover for the KGB  
And the man from the Social Security  
Keeps on invading my privacy  
Oh there aint no cure for acute schizophrenia disease  
  
Ive got acute schizophrenia paranoia too  
Schizophrenia schizophrenia  
Ive got it youve got it we cant lose  
Acute schizophrenia blues  
  
Im lost on the river the river of no return  
I cant make decisions I dont know which way Im gonna turn  
Even my old dad lost some of the best friends he ever had  
Apparently his was a case of acute schizophrenia too  
  
I got acute schizophrenia paranoia too  
Schizophrenia schizophrenia  
Ive got it youve got it we cant lose  
Acute schizophrenia blues  
  
Theyre watching my house and theyre tapping my telephone  
I cant trust nobody but Im much too scared to be on my own  
And the income tax collectors got his beady eye on me  
Oh there aint no cure for acute schizophrenia disease  
  
No there aint no cure for  
Schizophrenia disease
