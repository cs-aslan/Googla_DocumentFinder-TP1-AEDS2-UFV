In a run down bed and breakfast  
A room with a view across the river  
I tried to loos the claustrophobia  
Opened up and find Utopia  
Theres no more denying  
As my mind go flying  
Ten light years away to save my soul  
Ten light years away to change it all  
Whatever it may take I gotta try again  
Girl its time to start over  
Ten light years away  
Id been watching the reflection  
Of a bamboo in the shade when I saw her  
A very hot day in Havana  
In a midnight blue lagoon  
So I tried to get exciting  
I knew she was hiding  
Ten light years away so take me home  
Ten light years away where i come from  
Help me find today Its been way too long  
Girl its time to start over  
Ten light years away  
Theres no more denying  
As my mind go flying  
Ten light years away to save my soul  
Ten light years away to change it all  
Whatever it may take I gotta try again  
Girl its time to start over  
Ten light years away so take me home  
Ten light years away to change it all  
Help me find today Its been way too long  
Girl its time to start over  
Ten light years away
