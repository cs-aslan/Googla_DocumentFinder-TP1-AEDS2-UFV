So she said whats the problem baby  
Whats the problem I dont know  
Well maybe Im in love love  
Think about it every time  
I think about it  
Cant stop thinking bout it  
  
How much longer will it take to cure this  
Just to cure it cause I cant ignore it if its love love  
Makes me want to turn around and face me but I dont know nothing bout love  
  
Come on come on  
Turn a little faster  
Come on come on  
The world will follow after  
Come on come on  
Cause everybodys after love  
  
So I said Im a snowball running  
Running down into the spring thats coming all this love  
Melting under blue skies  
Belting out sunlight  
Shimmering love  
  
Well baby I surrender  
To the strawberry ice cream  
Never ever end of all this love  
Well I didnt mean to do it  
But theres no escaping your love  
  
These lines of lightning  
Mean were never alone  
Never alone no no  
  
Come on come on  
Move a little closer  
Come on come on  
I want to hear you whisper  
Come on come on  
Settle down inside my love  
  
Come on come on  
Jump a little higher  
Come on come on  
If you feel a little lighter  
Come on come on  
We were once upon a time in love  
  
Were accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love  
  
Accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love  
  
Accidentally  
  
Im in love Im in love  
Im in love Im in love  
Im in love Im in love  
Accidentally  
Im in love Im in love  
Im in love Im in love  
Im in love Im in love  
Accidentally  
  
Come on come on  
Spin a little tighter  
Come on come on  
And the worlds a little brighter  
Come on come on  
Just get yourself inside her  
  
Love Im in love
