Hit it  
  
Everything Ive ever dreamed of  
Has begun to fade to black  
Oh I dont know where I ever lost love  
Or where to go now to get it back  
  
Im a desperate lonely child and I dont have enough  
Ive come to know the rules and laws and scriptures of love  
  
If it aint real fake it  
If it aint yours take it  
If it dont exist you make it  
If it aint broke break it  
  
If it aint real fake it  
If it aint yours take it  
If its gone to sleep you wake it  
If it aint broke break it  
  
Gimme some words I can live by  
Gimme commandments to know  
Gimme some fables and proverbs  
You gotta gimme some signs where to go  
  
There are designated angels who just might save your soul no  
They give me words to live by and thats all that I know  
  
If it aint real fake it  
If it aint yours take it  
If it dont exist you make it  
If it aint broke break it  
  
If it aint real fake it  
If it aint yours take it  
If its all gone bad forsake it  
If it aint broke break it  
  
There are designated angels who just might save your soul  
They give me words to live by and thats all that I know  
  
If it aint real fake it  
If it aint yours take it  
If it dont exist you make it  
If it aint broke break it  
  
If it aint real fake it  
If it aint yours take it  
If its gone to sleep you wake it  
If it aint broke break it  
  
If it aint real fake it  
If it aint yours take it  
If it dont exist you make it  
If it aint broke break it  
  
If it aint real fake it  
If it aint yours take it  
If its all gone bad forsake it  
And if it aint broke break it
