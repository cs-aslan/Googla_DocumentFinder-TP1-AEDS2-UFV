When you say the things you say you gotta mean it  
And when you do the things you do its gotta come from the heart  
  
Somethings gone I cant explain  
The heat is missing from the plain  
Cant deny it theres a link missing from the chain  
Theres something wrong with you and me  
When more than one adds up to three  
Dont know the reason but the fact is plain to see  
Its the touch that you lose and the words you dont say  
Its our love you abuse dont you throw it away  
  
When you do what you do that you do to me  
Dont you know that it aint enough  
When you do what you do it dont mean a thing  
when you do what you do without love without love  
  
Im gonna paint a picture of you  
The only colour I need is blue  
Youre out of love baby you know its true  
Tell me why and Ill try to understand  
  
Cause I can cry when you do what you do to me  
Dont you know that it aint enough  
When you do what you do it dont mean a thing  
When you do what you do without love  
  
Its the touch that you lose and the words you dont say  
Its the love you refuse dont you throw it away  
  
When you do what you do that you do to me  
Dont you know that it aint enough  
When you do what you do it dont mean a thing  
Then you know its a crime that you kill me up  
When you do what you do without love without love  
Dont know what youre doing what youre doing without love
