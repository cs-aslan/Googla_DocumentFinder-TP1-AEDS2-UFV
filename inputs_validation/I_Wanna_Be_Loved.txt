Why must I be so lonely  
When so many people pass me by  
Ive been waiting for oh so long now  
And yet Im unable to answer why  
I cant be made to give up now  
Can you find room for me  
In your heart somehow  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved  
  
I guess Im a victim of loneliness  
But why should this be my destiny  
A foolish man for a lot of my life  
Shouldnt there be someone  
Someone for me  
I hope and I pray some happy day  
That Ill be around to hear you say  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved
