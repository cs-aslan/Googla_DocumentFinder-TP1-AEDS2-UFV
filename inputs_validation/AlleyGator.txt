Crawlin cross the floor at the Holiday Inn motel  
I saw that girl that my swamp bone knew so well  
She crawled out of Texas flipped off to Baton Rouge  
She got that Gulf Coast sun tan that give a poor boy the blues  
Alleygator with those hypnotic big green eyes  
Alleygator shell make you fraid em  
Shell chew you up it aint no lie yeah yeah yeah  
Crawlin through the weeds with a Louisiana meantoothed grin  
You can tell her that you love her then you better tell her once again  
She might scratch your back and rub you with her rack  
You better watch out or stand back  
Alleygator with those hypnotic big green eyes  
Alleygator shell make you fraid em  
Shell chew you up it aint no lie listen here  
Alleygator with those hypnotic big green eyes  
Alleygator shell make you fraid em  
Shell chew you up it aint no lie listen here  
Alleygator with those hypnotic big green eyes  
Alleygator alleygator alleygator alleygator  
Alleygator alleygator alleygator alleygator  
Crocodile a crocodile alleygator alleygator alleygator
