If you cant stand to lose  
Dont stand in the way  
Hey dont you think its time to say  
Tell her the truth now dont be afraid  
Tell her shes the only one  
You cant stand to lose  
Its alright if youre feelin like  
Theres something that you need to say  
Cause the only words that she hasnt heard  
Are the very ones that stand in your way  
So just let your heart tell her whats on your mind  
Even though youre afraid of what she might find  
If you cant stand to lose  
Dont stand in the way  
Hey dont you think its time to say  
Tell her the truth now dont be afraid  
Tell her shes the only one  
You cant stand to lose  
Hey dont you think its time to say  
Tell her the truth now dont be afraid  
Tell her shes the only one  
That you cant stand to lose
