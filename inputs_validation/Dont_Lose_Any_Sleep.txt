You tell me to be strong tell me to be strong  
Goodbye aint no reason to cry it aint no big deal  
You say Ill get along sure Ill get along  
Youre so nonchalant that its unreal  
  
Well I thought this love would be all I needed  
I thought this love was something to believe in  
Now you you say sorry babe it didnt work out that way  
Dont let it ruin youre day babe  
  
Chorus  
Dont lose any sleep now babe  
Its just my heart youre breakin its just my heart youre breakin  
Dont lose any sleep now babe  
Just dont worry bout me dont you worry bout me  
Ill be all right oh yeah  
  
Dont act so concerned no dont be concerned  
Dont know how much more of your kindness I can bear  
Guess I had to learn just had to learn  
That after all this you just dont care  
  
Well dont let that worry your mind now  
Ill be okay baby Ill be fine now  
Its just that Im watching my world walking away  
Dont let it ruin youre day babe  
  
Dont lose any sleep now babe  
Its just my heart youre breakin its just my world youre takin Yeah

Dont lose any sleep now babe  
Just dont worry bout me dont you worry bout me  
Ill be all right oh yeah  
  
I thought this love was all that I needed  
I thought this love was something to believe in  
Now you just say sorry babe it didnt work out that way  
Dont let it ruin your day babe  
Dont lose any sleep now babe oh
