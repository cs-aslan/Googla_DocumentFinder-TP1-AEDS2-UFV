Dont get excited  
Dont say a word  
Nobody noticed  
Nothing was heard  
It was committed discreetly  
It was handled so neatly  
And it shouldnt surprise you at all  
You know  
Break all the records  
Burn the cassettes  
Id be lying if I told you  
That I had no regrets  
There were so many mistakes  
And what a difference it makes  
But still it shouldnt surprise you at all  
You know  
I said it shouldnt surprise you at all  
You know  
Dont look now but you have changed  
Your best friends wouldnt tell you  
Now its apparent  
Now its a fact  
So marshal your forces  
For another attack  
You were so young and naive  
I know its hard to believe  
But now it shouldnt surprise you at all  
You know  
No it shouldnt surprise you at all  
You know  
What has it cost you  
What have you won  
The sins of the fathers  
Are the sins of the sons  
It was always within you  
It will always continue  
But it shouldnt surprise you at all  
You know  
I said it shouldnt surprise you at all  
You know
