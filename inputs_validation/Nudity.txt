I like it  
Nu nu di di ty  
Let me let me see  
Nu di ty  
  
Hang your coat up hang your coat up  
Lock the doors up lock the doors up  
Let the steam rise in the spotlight alright  
Are you ready to let it go tonight tonight  
Do your own thing with your own thing  
Whoo shake a hip  
Its getting cool swing  
Ooh ooh guess who is watching now  
Look looking looking wow  
  
Chorus  
Flash it in fashion with me  
Skin to skin body to body  
Dare to never never let me see  
Nudity  
  
Nu nu di di ty  
Nudity  
  
Time to strip down  
Time to strip down  
Just pop that zipper for me  
And work that thing out  
Just expose it  
Cause you know its alright alright  
Are you ready to let it go tonight tonight  
Let it go here we go  
Just let it slip inside  
Thats right here we go  
One button at a time  
Who cares who sees tonight  
Look looking looking wow  
  
Chorus  
  
Nudity  
Nudity  
Never never let me see  
Nudity  
Never never see  
  
Chorus  
  
Nu nu di di ty  
Nudity  
Nu nu di di ty  
Nudity
