She cuts you once she cuts you twice  
But still you believe  
The wound is so fresh you can taste the blood  
BUt you dont have strength to leave  
Youve been bought youve been sold  
Youve been locked outside the door  
But you stand there pleadin  
With your insides bleedin  
Cause you deep down want some more  
Then she says she wants forgiveness  
Its such a clever masquerade  
Shes so good with her stiletto  
You dont even see the blade  
  
She cuts you hard she cuts you deep  
Shes got so much skill  
Shes so fascinating that youre still there waiting  
When she comes back for the kill  
Youve been slashed in the face  
Youve been left there to bleed  
You want to run away  
But you know youre gonna stay  
Cause she gives you what you need  
Then she says she wants affection  
While she searches for the vein  
Shes so good with her stiletto  
You dont really mind the pain  
  
She cuts you out she cuts you down  
She carves up your life  
But you wont do nothng  
As she keeps on cutting  
Cause you know you love the knife  
Youve been bought youve been sold  
Youve been locked outside the door  
But you stand there pleadin  
With your insides bleedin  
Cause you deep down want some more  
Then she says she needs affection  
While she searches for the vein  
Shes so good with her stiletto  
You dont really mind the pain
