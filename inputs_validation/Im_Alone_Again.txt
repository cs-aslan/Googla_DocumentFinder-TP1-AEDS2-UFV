All the things I said I wanted turned out to be heavan haunted  
Every time I dream Im sharin  
All the things that I tried pairing too  
  
If the thought could ever barter  
Time enough to make a pedal  
Now I might help any other  
Now thats it Ill simply ponder you  
Its hard to recognize thats all  
True it wasnt that at all  
  
Im alone again  
Never thought Id see the one I told you  
Head is along  
Over now  
  
All the things I said I wanted  
Turned out to be heavan haunted  
Every time the dream Im sharin  
All the things that I tried pairing too  
If the thought could ever barter  
Time enough to make a pedal  
Now I might help any other  
Now thats it Ill simply ponder you  
Its hard to recognize thats all  
True it wasnt that at all
