Birds sing theres not a cloud in the sky August 8th is a beautiful day  
I see a bunch of hippies crying yeah August 8th is a beautiful day  
Like waking up from a real bad dream suddenly everything is OK  
The storm has passed the sun is shining yeah August 8th is a beautiful day  
Whats going on whats going on is something bumming your scene  
Theres something wrong theres something wrong Im not trying to be mean  
The air is sweet the summer flowers blooming nowhere in sight is there
anything grey  
Feelings of joy are filling the street yeah beautiful day  
Like waking up from a fucked up dream suddenly everythings looking good  
Theres been no permanent damage done  
Yeah August 8th came right when it should  
  
Poor Jeff  
Poor little  
Timmy Turtle  
Staying home on  
Such a beautiful  
Day
