I cant forget you  
Ive got these memories of you  
I cant forget you  
Ill always be loving you  
  
Once we were happy  
We were so carefree and gay  
Then something happened  
And you went away  
  
I cant forget you  
Please tell me what must I do  
My memories haunt me  
Because Ill always love you  
  
Where are you darlin  
Are you with someone new  
I cant forget you  
Ill always be loving you  
  
I cant forget you  
Ive got these memories of you  
I cant forget you  
Ill always be loving you  
  
I cant forget you  
Please tell me what must I do  
My memories haunt me  
Because Ill always love you  
  
Where are you darlin  
Are you with someone new  
I cant forget you  
Ill always be loving you
