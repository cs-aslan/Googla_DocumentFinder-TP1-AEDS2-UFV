I love dancing  
Crazy romancing  
Fellas advancing constantly  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Old folks not for me  
One husband  
One wife  
Whaddya got  
Two people sentenced for life  
  
I love singing  
Good healthy clinging  
Quietly bringing on a spree  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Cold folks  
One married he  
One married she  
Whaddya got  
Two people watchin tv  
  
Im not ready  
To quit bein free  
And Im not willing  
To stop being me  
Ive gotta sing my song  
Why should I belong  
To some guy who says  
That Im wrong  
  
Doo doo dooo  
De doo de doo  
Dedoo dedoo  
Doo doo doo  
Dooo  
  
Cookin dinner  
Lookin no thinner  
Gray elbows and  
A sudsy sea  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Cold folks  
And its not for me  
One husband  
One wife  
Whaddya got  
Two people sentenced for life  
  
Im exploding  
With youth and with zest  
Who needs corroding  
In some vultures nest  
Ive gotta fly my wings  
Go places do things  
My freedom bells really  
Gonna ring  
  
Doo doo doooetc  
  
Ive been through years  
Too many blue years  
Now I want New Years every eve  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Marriage is for cold folks  
One husband  
One wife  
Whaddya got  
Two people sentenced for life  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Marriage is for cold folks  
Not for me  
Cant you see  
Marriage aint for me
