Dont call me  
Leave me alone  
Not gonna answer my phone  
Cuz I dont  
No I wont see you  
  
Im out to have a good time  
To get you off of my mind  
Cuz I dont  
And I wont need you woot Woot  
  
Send out a 911  
Were gonna have some fun  
Hey boy you know  
You better run  
  
Cuz its a girls night  
Its alright without you  
Im gonna stay out  
And play out without you  
You better hold tight  
This girls night is without you  
Lets go  
G N O  
Lets go  
Its a girls night  
  
Ill dance with somebody new  
Wont have to think about you  
And who knows  
What let go will lead to  
  
Youll hear from everyone  
Youll get the 411  
Hey boy  
You knew this day would come  
  
Chorus  
Cuz its a girls night  
Its alright without you  
Im gonna stay out  
And play out without you  
You better hold tight  
This girls night is without you  
Lets go  
G N O  
Lets go  
Its a girls night  
  
Hey boy  
Dont you wish you could have been a good boy  
Try to find another girl like me boy  
Feel me when I tell ya  
I am fine  
And its time for me to draw the line  
  
Chorus  
Cuz its a girls night  
Its alright without you  
Im gonna stay out  
And play out without you  
You better hold tight  
This girls night is without you  
Lets go  
G N O  
Lets go  
Its a girls night
