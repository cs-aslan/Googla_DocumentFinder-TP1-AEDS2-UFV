You cant escape what makes you tragic you know  
Vicious cause you want to be leaving time possessed to please you  
What might have been was never the way you envisioned things  
So difficult to stop pretending  
Whats this to you anyway  
  
Turn down the voluptuous  
Keeping close to me again  
Hold back your virtues  
Youre fearless in motion  
  
You found your way so why keep asking me  
Nothing common suits you you live again in solitary  
Look away for now beautiful alone  
Now who decides to settle down  
Maybe nobody really cares  
Whats this to you anyway  
  
Turn down the voluptuous  
Keeping close to me again  
Hold back your virtues  
Youre fearless in motion  
  
Something dirtys got you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
Somethings painfuls with you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
  
Youre better off saying nothing  
Wish for a happy ending  
Youre better off saying nothing  
Repent so alls forgiven  
  
Something dirtys got you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
Somethings painfuls with you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
  
Something dirtys got you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
Somethings painfuls with you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
  
Something dirtys got you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
Somethings painfuls with you dear  
Makes me want to be with you
