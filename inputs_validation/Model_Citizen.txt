Be an Arab Be a Jew  
Be a boxing kangaroo  
Beat yourself all black and blue  
I dont care  
  
Be a bleeder Be a Cancer  
A hemophiliac romancer  
Be a crippled disco dancer  
Oooh What a pair  
  
Chorus  
Hes a model citizen  
I think Ive got them fooled them again  
Hes an ultrasweety guy  
And a master of disguise  
Hes a model citizen  
Just keep believing that my friends  
Im a model citizen  
  
Bridge  
Im a model citizen  
Im a model citizen  
Im a model citizen  
Im an all American  
  
Im a hostage in a city of creeps  
Theyve got mercenary guards  
That watch me sleep  
Theyd like to kill me slow  
Bury me deep  
  
In the heart of Texas  
Im a martyr Im a sadist  
I might be the Savior here to save us  
Im a friend of Sammy Davis casually  
  
Chorus  
Hes a model citizen  
I think Ive got them fooled again  
Hes an ultrasweety guy  
I wont let down my disguise  
Hes a model citizen  
Just keep believing that my friends  
Im a model citizen  
  
Bridgex2  
Im a model citizen  
Im a model citizen  
Im a model citizen  
Im an all American
