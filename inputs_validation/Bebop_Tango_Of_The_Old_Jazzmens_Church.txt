Fz Some of you may know that the tango which is not a very popular dance
anymore was at one time reputed to be a dance of unbridled passion back in
the old days when it wasnt so easy to get your rocks off when it was hard to
make contact with a member of the  Opposite camp and you had to resort to
things like dancing close together and going hey  Those were the days
Well those days are probably gone forever I dont know unless Nixon is
going to bring them back a little bit later but we have this very special
highly evolved permutated tango Its actually a perverted tango By the time
 Yes its so perverted This is the BeBop Tango a special entertainment
event that includes choreography a little bit later so watch out folks
