Delilah Delilah oh my oh my oh my  youre irresistible  ooh ooh ooh  
You make me smile when Im just about to cry  
You bring me hope you make me laugh  and I like it  
You get away with murder so innocent  
But when you throw a moody youre all claws and you bite  
Thats alright  
Delilah Delilah oh my oh my oh my  youre unpredictable  ooh ooh ooh ooh  
You make me so very happy  
When you cuddle up and go to sleep beside me  
And then you make me slightly mad  
When you pee all over my Chippendale suite  
Ooh ooh Delilah  
Ooh ooh Delilah  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You take over my house and home  
You even try to answer my telephone  
Delilah youre the apple of my eyes  
Meow meow meow  
Delilah  I love you Delilah oh  
Ooh you make me so very happy  you give me kisses  
And I go out of my mind  ooh ooh  
Meow meow meow meow  
Youre irresistible  I love you Delilah  
Delilah  I love you ha ha  
You make me very happy  oooh oh yeah  
I love your kisses  
I love your kisses  
I love your kisses  
I love your kisses  
I love your your your kisses  
I love your kisses
