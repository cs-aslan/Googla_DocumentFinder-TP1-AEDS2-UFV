I take a step outside  
And I breath the air  
And I slam the door  
And Im on my way  
I wont lay no blame  
I wont call you names  
Cause Ive made my break  
And I wont look back  
Ive turned my back  
On those endless games  
  
Im all through with ties  
Im all tired of tears  
Im a happy man  
Dont it look that way  
Shakin dust from my shoes  
Theres a road ahead  
And theres no way back home no way back home  
Oh but I have to say  
  
Leavin home aint easy  
Oh I never thought it would be easy  
Leavin on your own  
Oh is the main thing calling me back  
Leavin home aint easy  
On the one youre leavin home  
  
Stay my love my love please stay  
Dont stray my love  
Whats wrong my love  
Whats right my love  
Oh leavin home aint easy  
I thought how could I think of leavin  
Leavin on your own  
Still tryin to persuade me that  
Leavin home aint necessarily the only way  
Leavin home aint easy  
But may be the only way
