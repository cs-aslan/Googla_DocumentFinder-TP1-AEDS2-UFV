Dont let go  
Dont lose your mystique  
Wait a little longer  
Tomorrow brings another feast  
  
Dont let go  
Dont lose your reputation  
Thank God youre still alive ha  
Youre still in one piece  
  
Hang on in there dont lose your appetite  
Hang on in there forget the danger signs  
Pray for that magical moment just stay there and it will appear  
Dont fight for lost emotions  
Wait for the sunrise  
And everything will seem so clear  
Look straight ahead look straight ahead  
  
Hang on in there hang on in there  
Hang on in there hang on in there  
Your wish will be granted  
All your problems will disappear  
  
Dont be a fool  
You havent reached your peak  
Youve got a fast car racing up inside you  
Your life is incomplete  
  
Hang on in there hang on in there  
Pray for that magical moment and it will appear  
Wait for the moment  
Wait for the sunrise  oh  
Just wait and see and it will seem so clear  
Ba dap bap ee bap bap ba ba bap bap de de de da  
Hey  
And lets go lets go  ok now do the change now  
Hang on  
Yeah  
Hang on in there hang on in there
