I cant wake in the mornin  
I cant sleep at night  
I got a pain in my memory  
That just wont sit right  
You might say Im losing my mind  
What a shame shame shame  
But I dont want and I dont need  
To play the cryin game  
  
Music lights this flame in me  
I wont let it go and it wont let me be  
Im just a happy slave and oh I cant leave it  
Cause Im still and I always will be a believer  
  
Still burnin Yeah  
Still yearnin And the wheels  
Still turnin Let me tell you why  
Were jivin And the beats  
Still drivin And we are all  
Divin Rocknroll never die  
  
I cant breathe in the city  
Got dust in my lungs  
I get mad in the country  
Everythin seem to go wrong  
You might think Im playin around  
But my heart is true  
I got reason to believe  
That sweet soul magic  
Gonna tear my heart in two  
  
Music makes the world go round  
Ive been flyin on the wings of the sound  
It feels so good from way up here  
Im still a believer  
Headin for the stars  
  
Still burnin  
Still yearnin  
Still turnin Better than every guy  
Were jivin  
Still drivin  
Sky divin Rocknroll never die  
  
Dont say that you love me I cant go down that road  
But dont think for a moment that my heart went cold  
I keep thinkin about what I lost  
And what I might have found  
I went to sleep and when I woke  
Everything had turned around  
  
Still burnin Yeah  
Still yearnin  
Still turnin A new day dawnin  
Were jivin  
Still drivin  
Sky divin Early in the morning  
  
Still burnin Yeah  
Still yearnin And the wheels  
Still turnin Better than every guy  
Were jivin And the beats  
Still drivin And were all  
Sky divin Rocknroll never die
