I go out to work on Monday morning  
Tuesday I go off to honeymoon  
Ill be back again before its time for sunnydown  
Ill be lazing on a Sunday afternoon  
Bicycling on every Wednesday evening  
Thursday I go waltzing to the zoo  
I come from London Town Im just an ordinary guy  
Fridays I go painting in the Louvre  
Im bound to be proposing on a Saturday night  
There he goes again  
Ill be lazing on a Sunday  
Lazing on a Sunday  
Lazing on a Sunday afternoon
