Hes a fairy feller  
Ah ah the fairy folk have gathered  
Round the new moons shine  
To see the feller crack a nut  
At nights noon time  
To swing his axe he swears  
As he climbs he dares  
To deliver the master stroke  
  
Plow man wagoner will and types  
Politician with senatorial pipe  
Hes a dilly dally oh  
Pedagogue squinting wears a frown  
And a satyr peers under ladys gown  
Hes a dirty fellow  
What a dirty laddieoh  
  
Tatterdemalion and the junketer  
Theres a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter  
Hes my hero ah  
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy  
Of his lady friend  
The nymph in yellow can we see the master stroke  
What a queer fellow  
  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah  
Soldier sailor tinker tailor plow boy  
Waiting to hear the sound  
And the arch magician presides  
He is the leader  
  
Oberon and Titania watched by a harridan  
Mab is the queen and theres a good apothecary man  
Come to say hello  
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy  
Of his lady friend  
The nymph in yellow  
What a queer fellow  
The ostler stares with hands on his knees  
Come on mister feller  
Crack it open of you please
