Sammy was low  
Just watching the show  
Over and over again  
Knew it was time  
Hed made up his mind  
To leave his dead life behind  
His boss said to him  
Boy youd better begin  
To get those crazy notions right out of your head  
Sammy who do you think that you are  
You shouldve been sweeping up the Emerald bar  
  
Spread your wings and fly away  
Fly away far away  
Spread your little wings and fly away  
Fly away far away  
Pull yourself together  
Cause you know you should do better  
Thats because youre a free man  
  
He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room  
Keeping his thoughts to himself hed be leaving soon  
Wishing he was miles and miles away  
Nothing in this world nothing would make him stay  
  
Since he was small  
Had no luck at all  
Nothing came easy to him  
Now it was time  
Hed made up his mind  
This could be my last chance  
  
His boss said to him now listen boy  
Youre always dreaming  
Youve got no real ambition you wont get very far  
Sammy boy dont you know who you are  
Why cant you be happy at the Emerald bar  
  
So honey  
Spread your wings and fly away  
Fly away far away  
Spread your little wings and fly away  
Fly away far away  
Pull yourself together  
Cause you know you should do better  
Thats because youre a free man  
Come on honey
