Here I stand here I stand  
Look around around around around around  
But you wont see me but you wont see me  
  
Now Im here Now Im here now Im there Now Im there  
Im just ajust a new man  
Yes you made me live again wow  
  
A baby I was when you took my hand  
And the light of the night burned bright  
The people all stared didnt understand  
But you new my name on sight  
  
Ooh whatever came of you and me  
Americas new bride to be  ooh dont worry baby Im safe and sound  
  
Down in the dungeon just peaches n me  
  
Dont I love her so  
Yes you made me live again yeah  
  
Yeah ooh a thin moon me in a smokescreen sky  
Where the beams of your lovelight chase  
Dont move dont speak dont feel no pain  
With the rain running down my face  
  
Your matches still light up the sky  
And many a tear lives on in my eye  
  
Down in the city just Hoople n me  
Dont I love him so  
Ooh dont I love him so  
Wooh  
  
Whatever comes of you and me  
I love to leave my memory with you

Think Ill stay around around around around around around  
Down in the city justa you n me down in the city justa you n me  
Dont I love you so  
Go go go little Queenie
