I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things  
We can do the tango just for two  
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings  
Be your Valentino just for you  
  
Ooh love  ooh loverboy  
Whatre you doin tonight hey boy  
Set my alarm turn on my charm  
Thats because Im a good oldfashioned lover boy  
  
Ooh let me feel your heartbeat grow faster faster  
Ooh ooh can you feel my love heat  
Come on and sit on my hotseat of love  
And tell me how do you feel right afterall  
Id like for you and I to go romancing  
Say the word  your wish is my command  
  
Ooh love  ooh loverboy  
Whatre you doin tonight hey boy  
Write my letter  
Feel much better  
And use my fancy patter on the telephone  
  
When Im not with you  
I think of you always  
I miss those long hot summer nights  
I miss you  
When Im not with you  
Think of me always  
Love you  love you  
  
Hey boy where do you get it from  
Hey boy where did you go   
I learned my passion in the good old  
Fashioned school of loverboys  
  
Dining at the Ritz well meet at nine precisely  
One two three four five six seven eight nine o clock  
I will pay the bill you taste the wine  
Driving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely  
Just take me back to yours that will be fine come on and get it  
  
Ooh love There he goes again just like a good oldfashioned lover boy  
Ooh loverboy  
Whatre you doin tonight hey boy  
Everythings all right  
Just hold on tight  
Thats because Im a good oldfashioned fashioned lover boy
