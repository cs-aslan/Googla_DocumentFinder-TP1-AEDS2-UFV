Is this the real life  
Is this just fantasy  
Caught in a landslide  
No escape from reality  
Open your eyes  
Look up to the skies and see  
Im just a poor boy I need no sympathy  
Because Im easy come easy go  
A little high little low  
Anyway the wind blows doesnt really matter to me to me  
  
Mama just killed a man  
Put a gun against his head  
Pulled my trigger now hes dead  
Mama life had just begun  
But now Ive gone and thrown it all away  
Mama ooo  
Didnt mean to make you cry  
If Im not back again this time tomorrow  
Carry on carry on but nothing really matters  
  
Too late my time has come  
Sends shivers down my spine  
Bodys aching all the time  
Goodbye everybody Ive got to go  
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth  
Mama ooo anyway the wind blows  
I dont want to die  
I sometimes wish Id never been born at all  
  
I see a little silhouetto of a man  
Scaramouch scaramouch will you do the fandango  
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me  
Gallileo Gallileo  
Gallileo Gallileo  
Gallileo Figaro  magnifico  
  
But Im just a poor boy and nobody loves me  
Hes just a poor boy from a poor family  
Spare him his life from this monstrosity  
Easy come easy go will you let me go  
Bismillah No we will not let you go  let him go  
Bismillah We will not let you go  let him go  
Bismillah We will not let you go let me go  
Will not let you go let me go never  
Never let you go let me go  
Never let me go ooo  
No no no no no no no  
Oh mama mia mama mia mama mia let me go  
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me  
For me  
For me  
  
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye  
So you think you can love me and leave me to die  
Oh baby cant do this to me baby  
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here  
  
Ooh yeah ooh yeah  
Nothing really matters  
Anyone can see  
Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me  
  
Anyway the wind blows
