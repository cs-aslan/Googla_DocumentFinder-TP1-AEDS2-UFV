Shed a tear cause Im missing you  
Im still alright to smile  
Girl I think about you every day now  
Was a time when I wasnt sure  
But you set my mind at ease  
There is no doubt youre in my heart now  
Said woman take it slow  
Itll work itself out fine  
All we need is just a little patience  
Said sugar make it slow  
And well come together fine  
All we need is just a little patience  
inhale Patience  
Ooh oh yeah  
Sit here on the stairs  
Cause Id rather be alone  
If I cant have you right now Ill wait dear  
Sometimes I get so tense  
But I cant speed up the time  
But you know love theres one more thing to consider  
Said woman take it slow  
Things will be just fine  
You and Ill just use a little patience  
Said sugar take the time  
Cause the lights are shining bright  
You and Ive got what it takes to make it  
We wont fake it Oh never break it  
Cause I cant take it  
 Little patience mm yeah ooh yeah  
Need a little patience yeah  
Just a little patience yeah  
Some more pati ence yeah  
Ive been walking these streets at night  
Just trying to get it right Need some patience yeah  
Its hard to see with so many around  
You know I dont like being stuck in a crowd Could use some patience yeah  
And the streets dont change but maybe the name  
I aint got time for the game  
Cause I need you Patience yeah  
Yeah yeah well I need you  
Oh I need you Take some patience  
Whoa I need you Just a little patience is all we need  
Ooh this ti me
