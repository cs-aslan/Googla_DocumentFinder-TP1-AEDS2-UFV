A word in your ear from father to son  
Hear the word that I say  
I fought with you fought on your side  
Long before you were born  
  
Joyful the sound the word goes around  
From father to son to son  
And the voice is so clear time after time it keeps on  
Calling you calling you on  
Dont destroy what you see your country to be  
Just keep building on the ground thats been won  
  
Kings will be crowned and the word goes around  
From father to son to son  
  
Wont you hear us sing

Our family song

Father father father father ooh yeah father father father father

Now we hand it on  
But Ive heard it all before  
  
Take this letter that I give you  
Take it sonny hold it high  
You wont understand a word thats in it  
But youll write it out again before you die yeah yeah  
  
A word in your ear from father to son  
Funny you dont hear a single word I say  
But my letter to you will stay by your side  
Through the years till the loneliness is gone  
Sing if you will  but the air you breathe I live to give you

From father to son to son  
  
Joyful the sound the word goes around  
From father to son to son  
  
Kings will be crowned the word goes around  
From father to son to son  
  
Joyful the sound the word goes around
