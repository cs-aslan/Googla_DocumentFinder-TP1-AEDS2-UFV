Once I loved a butterfly  
Dont wonder how dont ask me why  
But I believed what Id been told  
All things that glitter cant be gold ooh yeah  
All things that glitter cant be gold  
Those jealous minds conspired to say  
Just let that creature fly away  
How can it be she has it all  
Her pride is headed for a fall ooh yeah  
All things that glitter cant be gold  
Oh Lord what races we run  
Seeking our place in the sun  
Reaching and hoping  
Well find the right one  
Now every day a new joy waits  
My butterfly grew golden wings  
It seems we find as we grow old  
Some things that glitter may be gold ooh yeah  
Some things that glitter may be gold  
So let us mind whats there to see  
Before our hearts become too cold  
In spite of all that weve been told  
Some things that glitter may be gold ooh yeah  
Some things that glitter may be gold ooh yeah  
Some things that glitter may be gold
