Love of my life  youve hurt me  
Youve broken my heart and now you leave me  
Love of my life cant you see  
Bring it back bring it back  
Dont take it away from me because you dont know  
What it means to me  
  
Love of my life dont leave me  
Youve taken my love all of my love and now desert me

Please bring it back bring it back bring it back back  
Dont take it away from me take it away from me

And everythings all by the way  ooh yeah

How I still love you  i still love you
