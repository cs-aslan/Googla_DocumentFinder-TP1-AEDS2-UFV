She keeps her Moet et Chandon  
In her pretty cabinet  
Let them eat cake she says  
Just like Marie Antoinette  
A builtin remedy  
For Kruschev and Kennedy  
At anytime an invitation  
You cant decline  
  
Caviar and cigarettes  
Well versed in etiquette  
Extraordinarily nice  
  
Shes a Killer Queen  
Gunpowder guillotine  
Dynamite with a laser beam  
Guaranteed to blow your mind  
Anytime  
Ooh recommended at the price  
Insatiable an appetite  
Wanna try  
  
To avoid complications  
She never kept the same address  
In conversation  
She spoke just like a baroness  
Met a man from China  
Went down to Geisha Minah  
Killer killer shes a killer Queen  
Then again incidentally  
If youre that way inclined  
  
Perfume came naturally from Paris naturally  
For cars she couldnt care less  
Fastidious and precise  
  
Shes a Killer Queen  
Gunpowder guillotine  
Dynamite with a laser beam  
Guaranteed to blow your mind  
Anytime  
  
Drop of a hat shes as willing as  
Playful as a pussy cat  
Then momentarily out of action  
Temporarily out of gas  
To absolutely drive you wild wild  
Shes all out to get you  
  
Shes a Killer Queen  
Gunpowder gelatin  
Dynamite with a laser beam  
Guaranteed to blow your mind  
Anytime  
  
Ooh recommended at the price  
Insatiable an appetite  
Wanna try  
You wanna try
