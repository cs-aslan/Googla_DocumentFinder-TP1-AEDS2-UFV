Another partys over  
And Im left cold sober  
My baby left me for somebody new  
I dont wanna talk about it  
Want to forget about it  
Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew  
So come and get me  
Let me  
Get in that sinking feeling  
That says my heart is on an all time low  so  
Dont expect me  
To behave perfectly  
And wear that sunny smile  
My guess is Im in for a cloudy and overcast  
Dont try and stop me  
Cause Im heading for that stormy weather soon  
Im causing a mild sensation  
With this new occupation  
Im permanently glued  
To this extraordinary mood so now move over  
And let me take over  
With my melancholy blues  
  
Im causing a mild sensation  
With this new occupation  
Im in the news  
Im just getting used to my new exposure  
Come into my enclosure  
And meet my melancholy blues
