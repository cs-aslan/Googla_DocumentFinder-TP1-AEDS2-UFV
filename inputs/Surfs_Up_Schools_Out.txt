Surfs up schools out  
I got a criminal urge to twist and shout  
  
Ive been searching my whole life through  
For some perfect dream imagined in my youth  
  
Follow that dream  
Surfs up schools out  
Surfs up schools out  
  
For a perfect life find a perfect girl  
You gotta follow that dream to a perfect world  
Ive been a searcher an adventurer too  
This ride still runs I wanna ride with you  
  
This ride still runs wanna ride with you  
  
Follow that dream  
Surfs up schools out  
Surfs up schools out  
  
In the town and the country  
We all lay and dreamed our dreams  
Then we found the world is tough  
And all is not quite what it seems  
Gotta take it by the horns  
Gotta seize your precious day  
Gotta follow your dream  
  
Follow that dream  
Follow that dream  
Follow that dream  
Surfs up schools out  
Follow that dream  
Surfs up schools out  
Surfs up  
Follow that dream  
Surfs up schools out  
Surfs up schools out  
Follow that dream  
  
Follow that dream
