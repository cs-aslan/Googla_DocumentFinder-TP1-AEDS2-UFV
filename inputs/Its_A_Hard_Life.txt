I dont want my freedom  
Theres no reason for living with a broken heart  
  
This is a tricky situation  
Ive only got myself to blame  
Its just a simple fact of life  
It can happen to any one  
  
You win  you lose  
Its a chance you have to take with love  
Oh yeah  I fell in love  
But now you say its over and Im falling apart  
  
Yeah yeah  
Its a hard life  
To be true lovers together  
To love and live forever in each others hearts  
Its a long hard fight  
To learn to care for each other  
To trust in one another right from the start  
When youre in love  
  
I try and mend the broken pieces  
Ooh I try to fight back the tears  
Ooh they say its just a state of mind  
But it happens to everyone  
  
How it hurts yeah  deep inside oh yeah  
When your love has cut you down to size  
This life is tough  on your own  
Now Im waiting for something to fall from the skies  
Im waiting for love  
  
Yes its a hard life  
Two lovers together  
To love and live forever in each others hearts  
Its a long hard fight  
To learn to care for each other  
To trust in one another  right from the start  
When youre in love  
  
Yes its a hard life  
In a world thats filled with sorrow  
There are people searching for love in every way  
Its a long hard fight  
But Ill always live for tomorrow  
Ill look back at myself and say I did it for love ooh  
Yes I did it for love  for love  oh I did it for love
