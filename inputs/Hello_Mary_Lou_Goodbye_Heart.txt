I say hello Mary Lou goodbye heart  
Sweet Mary Lou Im so in love with you  
I knew Mary Lou wed never part  
So hello Mary Lou goodbye heart  
You passed me by one sunny day  
Flashed those big brown eyes my way  
Ooh I wanted you forever more  
Hey Im not one that gets around  
Swear my feet stuck to the ground  
And though I never did see you no more  
Yeah neah  
I said hello Mary Lou goodbye heart  
Sweet Mary Lou Im so in love with you  
Hey I knew Mary Lou wed never part  
So hello Mary Lou goodbye heart  
So hello Mary Lou goodbye heart  
One more time  
Yes hello Mary Lou goodbye heart  
Hey wait a minute  
One minute  
Ah I need my fucking water  
I dont care lets go  
Right give us the right key for fucks sake
