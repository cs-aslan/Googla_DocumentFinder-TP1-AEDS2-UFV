In the bright shop window sits the polar bear  
Makes the childrens eyes light up to see him there  
Amongst the tinsel he gives everyone a smile  
To see him as youd see a star  
Love him from where you are  
Hes not for not for not for sale  
  
Past an open window walks the pretty girl  
Does she see me at her feet its hard to tell  
But if I ask her she might turn her smile away  
To see her as Id see a star  
Love her from where you are  
Shes not for not for not for sale  
  
I guess Ill learn to look  
Without a grasping hand  
Minor contentment wears a smile  
I love her from where I lie  
Hes not for not for not for sale  
Not for sale
