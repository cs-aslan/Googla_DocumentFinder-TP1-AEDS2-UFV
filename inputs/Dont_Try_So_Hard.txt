If youre searching out for something  
Dont try so hard  
I youre feeling kind of nothing  
Dont try so hard  
When your problems seem like mountains  
Feel the need to find some answers  
You can leave it for another day  
Dont try so hard  
  
But if you fall and take a tumble  
It wont be far  
If you fail you mustnt grumble  
Thank your lucky stars  
Just savor every mouthful  
And treasure every moment  
When the storms are raging round you  
Stay right where you are  
Oooh dont try so hard  
Oooh dont take it all to heart  
Its only fools they make these rules  
Dont try so hard  
  
One day youll be a Sergeant Major  
Oh youll be so proud  
Screaming out your bloody orders  
Hey but not too loud  
Polish all your shiny buttons  
Dressed as lamb instead of mutton  
But you never had to try  
To stand out from the crowd  
  
Oh what a beautiful world  
Is this the life for me  
Oh what a beautiful world  
Its the simple life for me  
Oooh  
  
Oh dont try so hard  
Oh dont take it all to heart  
Its only fools they make these rules  
Dont try so hard  
Dont try so hard  
Dont try so hard
