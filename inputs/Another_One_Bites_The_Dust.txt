Lets go Steve walks warily down the street  
With the brim pulled way down low  
Aint no sound but the sound of his feet  
Machine guns ready to go  
  
Are you ready  
Are you ready for this  
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat  
Out of the doorway the bullets rip  
To the sound of the beat  
  
Chorus  
Another one bites the dust  
Another one bites the dust  
And another one gone and another one gone  
Another one bites the dust  
Hey Im gonna get you too  
Another one bites the dust  
  
How do you think Im going to get along  
Without you when youre gone  
You took me for everything that I had  
And kicked me out on my own  
  
Are you happy are you satisfied  
How long can you stand the heat  
Out of the doorway the bullets rip  
To the sound of the beat  
  
Chorus  
  
Another one bites the dust  
Another one bites the dust  
Another one bites the dust  
Another one bites the dust  
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man  
And bring him to the ground  
You can beat him  
You can cheat him  
You can treat him bad and leave him  
When hes down  
But Im ready yes Im ready for you  
Im standing on my own two feet  
Out of the doorway the bullets rip  
Repeating the sound of the beat  
  
Chorus
