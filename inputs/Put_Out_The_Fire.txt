They called him a hero  
In the land of the free  
But he wouldnt shake my hand boy  
He disappointed me  
So I got my hand gun  
And I blew him away  
That critter was a bad guy  
And I had to make him pay  
  
You might fear for my reason  
I dont care what they say  
Look out baby its the season  
For the mad masquerade  
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire  
Oh you need a bullet like a hole in the head  
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire  
Dont believe what your granddaddy said  
  
She was my lover  
It was a shame that she died  
But the constitutions right on my side  
Cause I caught my lover in the neighbours bed  
I got retribution  
Filled em all full of lead  
  
Ive been told its the fashion  
To let me on the streets again  
Its nothing but a crime of passion  
And Im not to blame  
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire  
You need a weapon like a hole in the head  
Put out the fire put out the fire baby put out the fire  
And let your sons and daughters sleep sound in their beds  
  
You know a gun never killed nobody  
You can ask anyone  
People get shot by people  
People with guns  
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire  
You need a gun like a hole in the head  
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire  
Just tell me that old fashioned gun law is dead  
  
Shoot shoot
