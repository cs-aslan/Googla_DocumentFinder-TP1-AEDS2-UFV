Im the invisible man  
Im the invisible man  
Incredible how you can  
See right through me  
  
Freddie Mercury  
When you hear a sound  
That you just cant place  
Feel somethin move  
That you just cant trace  
When something sits  
On the end of your bed  
Dont turn around  
When you hear me tread  
  
Im the invisible man  
Im the invisible man  
Incredible how you can  
See right through me  
Im the invisible man  
Im the invisible man  
Its criminal how I can  
See right through you  
  
John Deacon  
And Im in your room  
And Im in your bed  
And Im in your life  
And Im in your head  
Like CIA  
Or the FBI  
Youll never get close  
Never take me alive  
  
Im the invisible man  
Im the invisible man  
Incredible how you can  
See right through me  
Im the invisible man  
Im the invisible man  
Its criminal how I can  
See right through you  
Hah hah hah hello  
Hah hah hah ok  
Hah hah hah hellohellohellohello  
Never had a real good friend  not a boy or girl  
Noone knows what Ive been through  let my flag unfurl  
So I make my mark from the edge of the world  
From the edge of the world  
From the edge of the world  
  
Brian May  Brian May  
  
Now Im on your track  
And Im in your mind  
And Im on your back  
But dont look behind  
Im your meanest thought  
Im your darkest fear  
But Ill never get caught  
You cant shake me shake me dear  
  
Im the invisible man  
Im the invisible man  
Incredible how you can  
See right through me  
Watch me now  
Im the invisible man  
Im the invisible man  
Its criminal how I can  
See right through you  
Look at me look at me  
RRRRRoger Taylor  
Shake me shake me shake me dear
