Theres no living in my life anymore  
The seas have gone dry  
And the rains stopped falling  
Please dont you cry any more  
Cant you see  
Listen to the breeze  
Whisper to me please  
Dont send me to the path of nevermore  
  
Even the valleys below  
Where the rays of the sun  
Were so warm and tender  
Now havent anything to grow  
Cant you see  
Why did you have to leave me nevermore  
Why did you deceive me nevermore  
You sent me to the path of nevermore  
When you say you didnt love me anymore  
Ah ah nevermore nevermore
