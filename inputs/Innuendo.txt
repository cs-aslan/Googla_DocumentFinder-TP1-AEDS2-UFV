One two three four  
  
Ooh ooh  
  
While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand  
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land  
While theres a wind and the stars and the rainbow  
Till the mountains crumble into the plain  
  
Oh yes well keep on trying  
Tread that fine line  
Oh well keep on trying  
Yeah  
Just passing our time  
  
Ooh ooh  
  
While we live according to race colour or creed  
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed  
Our lives dictated by tradition superstition false religion  
Through the eons and on and on  
  
Oh yes well keep on trying yeah  
Well tread that fine line  
Oh oh well keep on trying  
Till the end of time  
Till the end of time  
  
Through the sorrow all through our splendor  
Dont take offence at my innuendo  
  
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh  
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh  
  
You can be anything you want to be  
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be  
Be free with your tempo be free be free  
Surrender your ego  be free be free to yourself  
  
Ooh ooh yeah  
  
If theres a God or any kind of justice under the sky  
If theres a point if theres a reason to live or die  
Ha if theres an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask  
Show yourself  destroy our fears  release your mask  
Oh yes well keep on trying  
Hey tread that fine line  
Yeah yeah  
Well keep on smiling yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
And whatever will be  will be  
Well just keep on trying  
Well just keep on trying  
Till the end of time  
Till the end of time  
Till the end of time
