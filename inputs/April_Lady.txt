She won our hearts the arts she loved  
Is painting pictures for free  
When she was done she hung them up  
For all the children to see  
  
Chorus  
Goodbye April lady  
Its been good to have you around  
Goodbye April lady  
Youve done a lot for the folks in this town  
  
The children learned to read  
She strung their beads  
Its sorry she was the one  
As you can see isnt she good  
She dont leave nothing undone  
  
Chorus  
  
She taught them all to love  
She was their cream  
And we dont want her to go  
But we know too well  
She fell in love  
And theres no stopping her so  
  
Chorus  
  
Goodbye April lady
