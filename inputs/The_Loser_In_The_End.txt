Mamas got a problem  
She dont know what to say  
Her little baby boy  
Has just left home today  
Shes got to be the loser in the end  
Shes got to be the loser in the end  
Misuse her and youll lose her as a friend  
Shes Ma on whom you can always depend ooh  
  
She washed and fed and clothed and cared  
For nearly twenty years  
And all she gets is Goodbye Ma  
And the night times for her tears  
Shes got to be the loser in the end  
Shes got to be the loser in the end  
Misuse her and youll lose her as a friend  
Shes Ma on whom you can always depend ooh  
  
So listen mothers everywhere  
To just one mothers son  
Youll get forgotten on the way  
If you dont let them have their fun  
Forget regrets and just remember  
Its not so long since you were young  
  
Youre bound to be the loser in the end  
Youre bound to be the loser in the end  
Theyll chose their new shoes  
Thats not far to bend  
Youre Ma on whom they can always depend ooh ooh
